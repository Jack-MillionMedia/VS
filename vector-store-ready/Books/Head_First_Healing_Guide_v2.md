## R David Young

<!-- chunk -->

### I used to be an anxiety ridden self-deprecating mess. I have you to thank

<!-- chunk -->

### for consolidating all this information in an easily accessible format. You

<!-- chunk -->

### have my eternal thanks. Nootropics gave me the opportunity to reclaim my

<!-- chunk -->

### life. You made this process exponentially easier. I am now perusing a

<!-- chunk -->

### double major in neuroscience and philosophy. You sparked my interest in

<!-- chunk -->

## the study of the brain. You helped me find purpose again. ~ A. Hazelwood

<!-- chunk -->

### Thankyou sir for not only sharing your wisdom but for also being

<!-- chunk -->

### transparent including solutions and personal hacks to your own mental

### You truly are an amazing mentor and it shows in just how much you are

<!-- chunk -->

### improving in yourself. I have taken your advice over these last few years

<!-- chunk -->

### and have seen a dramatic improvement in my health as well and none of it

<!-- chunk -->

### so much kind sir :). I truly owe my life in a way to you and all that you

### David’s book Head First is an amazing manual and gift. I could not do this

<!-- chunk -->

### energy - you now have a grounded human being and experienced guide to -

<!-- chunk -->

## get you started, move you along or trim tab your trajectory!” ~ P. Masters

<!-- chunk -->

### Head First is full of useful information about brain supplements. I like the

### way it is written with a lot of structure and easy to understand, even for

<!-- chunk -->

### non-native English speakers. There is not only explanation about the

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits, but also for the risks and side effects and the writer David Tomen

<!-- chunk -->

<!-- chunk -->

### right supplements for oneself. Thank you so much for writing this book. A

<!-- chunk -->

### Thank you for the information you present. I find it not only useful but

<!-- chunk -->

## highly accurate. ~ A. Schinitsky

<!-- chunk -->

### I’m not a comments person, but you deserve a Big Thank You from me. I

<!-- chunk -->

### started taking supplements after listening to your vids. So glad I did. I get

<!-- chunk -->

### so many complements on my appearance and energy now because I feel

<!-- chunk -->

### great... still working in my own business at 70. I love learning about what

<!-- chunk -->

## makes me work better. Please don’t stop. ~ M. Miller

<!-- chunk -->

### I am truly grateful for the information you share and provide. What you

### give to us carries a tremendous amount of value. David Tomen, you are a

<!-- chunk -->

### huge inspiration to me, and I genuinely appreciate your existence. I’m

<!-- chunk -->

## grateful beyond what I can manage to express through words. ~ S. Gjerde

<!-- chunk -->

### After 20 years of depression and social anxiety, you changed my life,

<!-- chunk -->

## David. My name is David too, and I thank you. ~ D. Dave

<!-- chunk -->

### I love that you understand the nutritive aspects as primary, including the

<!-- chunk -->

### importance of the correct fats. And then you go into the nootropics that

<!-- chunk -->

## might assist you as supplements. Bravo, sir. ~ S. Keefe

<!-- chunk -->

### VERY thorough... an excellent list and very comprehensive explanations...

<!-- chunk -->

## thank you... time to do my homework. Great job David! ~ T. Walz

<!-- chunk -->

## Thank you for great content! I always learn so much! ~ anyaleto

<!-- chunk -->

### I have been so impressed with your videos. I just came upon them by

<!-- chunk -->

<!-- chunk -->

## been so informative. ~ Ellen

<!-- chunk -->

### Just watching your videos help relieve my anxiety... You’re like the Bob

<!-- chunk -->

## Ross of nootropics. Thanks for all you do! My go to guy for nootropics. ~

<!-- chunk -->

## A. Donaldson

<!-- chunk -->

### God bless you, David Tomen. I’ve gone from a 10 to a 5. I’m not in bed all

<!-- chunk -->

### day. I followed your depression recommendations. Thank you. It still feels

<!-- chunk -->

## impossible to get up in the morning, but I get up. It’s unbelievable. ~ LB

<!-- chunk -->

### Excellent video on the mechanisms involved in anxiety disorders and

<!-- chunk -->

### which supplements help which type! Top notch and easy for me as a

<!-- chunk -->

## novice supplement user to understand. Thanks. ~ J. Hunt

<!-- chunk -->

### Well, David…. Holy glockamorras! All I can say is “there is something

<!-- chunk -->

### different” as to the way both my wife and I feel. I am an “old hack” at all

<!-- chunk -->

### this stuff and perfectly healthy because of it! And my wife as well! I am

<!-- chunk -->

### 64 and she’s 42. But this is OUTSTANDING! Thank you so very, very

<!-- chunk -->

### much from both of us. We will see you on the “other side”, to thank you in

<!-- chunk -->

## person. In Spirit. ~ C & E O’Riada

<!-- chunk -->

### So much good information! This is a good example of how using whole

<!-- chunk -->

### foods or full spectrum extracts often work best as compared to single

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds. I’ve got some organic artichoke extract inbound and I can

<!-- chunk -->

### hardly wait to try it! The recommended stack here seems like something

<!-- chunk -->

### students could really benefit from, so I’ll be sharing this information (and

<!-- chunk -->

### products soon) with my local university population. Thanks for all your

<!-- chunk -->

## diligent and quality work David! I really appreciate the journal sources. ~

<!-- chunk -->

## Adam

<!-- chunk -->

### THANKS, DAVID, SO VERY MUCH!! I have so many of these issues. I

<!-- chunk -->

### was in a horrible accident. Back in 2000, I had to relearn everything all

<!-- chunk -->

### over again. The surgeries I have gone through has been a living nightmare.

<!-- chunk -->

### I would have killed for this supplement back then when I was struggling

<!-- chunk -->

## so. Thanks again!! ~ C. Magee

<!-- chunk -->

### David, thanks for your commitment and thorough information. I’ve been

<!-- chunk -->

### my own lab rat for about 2 years now and the rat is doing much better.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your site has been indispensable. ~ Kevin

<!-- chunk -->

### Thank you so much for your valuable work. I am a victim of childhood

<!-- chunk -->

### domestic violence and I diagnosed myself with PTSD after reading

<!-- chunk -->

### psychological literature on trauma. I find that the talking cure does not

<!-- chunk -->

### cure childhood memories of abuse but only prolongs feelings of

<!-- chunk -->

### helplessness and bitterness. The minute I started looking into nootropics,

<!-- chunk -->

### the traumatic memories and preoccupation with the past began to subside.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even when I do feel bitter, the feelings subside and I’m able to redirect my

<!-- chunk -->

### energies to the here and now. Neuroscience truly is the answer to trauma

<!-- chunk -->

### because you can’t fix a physical problem by simply talking about it. It’s

<!-- chunk -->

### like trying to talk your way out of a broken leg. I find your work on

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics to be so thorough and enjoy your tailormade research and

<!-- chunk -->

### attention to nuance. You are helping create positive change in the world.

<!-- chunk -->

## Thank you. ~ Christina

<!-- chunk -->

### David, thank you for your continuing efforts in service to your fellow man.

<!-- chunk -->

### You are truly demonstrating that you are living the lessons received

<!-- chunk -->

### through meditation! At times we need to realize we need to focus on the

<!-- chunk -->

### solution rather than the problem. Directing our mind and internal

<!-- chunk -->

### resources to the creation of what we desire. Your work demonstrates this

<!-- chunk -->

### principle. Our minds CANNOT; Not think of something: such as NOW

<!-- chunk -->

### seeing the color RED. Our thoughts create our reality. Meditation could be

<!-- chunk -->

## considered a reset mechanism. ~ B. Tegeler

<!-- chunk -->

### Great article on Mitochondria support is terrific! I am 70, still working &

<!-- chunk -->

### want to focus my nootropics on longevity & the Mitochondria. Again a

<!-- chunk -->

## great article from one of the “reliable” voices in the nootropic arena. ~ A.

<!-- chunk -->

## Robinson

<!-- chunk -->

### This Spring you helped me get started with Nootropics through a

<!-- chunk -->

### consultation. Wanted to say thank you and tell you and your followers how

<!-- chunk -->

### well I have progressed. I started with basics like Alpha GPC, Lions Main,

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tyrosine, Pine Bark, Phenylpiracetam, Tart Cherry, Lemon Bark, and L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan. I have since added Rhodiola Rosea, Vinpocetine and Polygala

<!-- chunk -->

### Tenuifolia. After fighting depression for so many years and being lethargic

<!-- chunk -->

### and sleepy, I am a new person because I’m happy, productive, and not

<!-- chunk -->

### taking long naps as I used to. I started off taking Adrafinil but don’t need

<!-- chunk -->

### that any longer. Had tried anti-depressants, all SSRIs, with no luck and

<!-- chunk -->

### now I understand why they didn’t work after reading your material and

<!-- chunk -->

### listening to your podcasts and doing some of my own research. Thanks

<!-- chunk -->

## again and good luck to everyone else out there. ~ C. Crawley

<!-- chunk -->

### Dear David, thank you for all the incredibly valuable information!! My

<!-- chunk -->

### mother died just before her 69th birthday – 11 years suffering with

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s. The recent info on choline has been priceless for my husband

<!-- chunk -->

### (71) and myself (66)! Within the 1st day of taking one 250 mg capsule

<!-- chunk -->

### Citicoline our lives have changed for the BETTER! We both noticed

<!-- chunk -->

### instant better eyesight with clearer distant viewing, along with the

<!-- chunk -->

### ‘overwhelm’ being replaced with ease in being able to focus, concentrate

<!-- chunk -->

### and Get Things Done (procrastination is out the window!). You are An

<!-- chunk -->

## Angel From Heaven – Thanks from the bottom of our hearts! ~ K & B

<!-- chunk -->

## Tarte

<!-- chunk -->

### Hi David! Thank you, I try to recommend your blog to as many people as I

<!-- chunk -->

### can, over 20 people so far :). I changed my life because of YOU. Thank

<!-- chunk -->

## you for all your wisdom, Sir. ~ Sandra

<!-- chunk -->

### Just want to thank you for your amazing work! I thought I could analyze!

<!-- chunk -->

## You’re the best on the Internet! Thank you. ~ R. Long

<!-- chunk -->

### I had no idea that important nootropics from turmeric aren’t always

<!-- chunk -->

### absorbed by your body. I will make sure to keep this in mind when I shop

<!-- chunk -->

### for more supplements online later today. I love turmeric, but I want to

<!-- chunk -->

### make sure my body is using it correctly. Thanks so much for your lovely

<!-- chunk -->

## advice and incredible insights. ~ D. McDougal

<!-- chunk -->

### Congratulations for having the BEST site of all time on the internet!

<!-- chunk -->

### Amaaaazing! Thank you, thank you, thank you for so selflessly sharing

<!-- chunk -->

### this with the very many people confused and suffering with strange new

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms and lack of energy etc. I have now found the Holy Grail of info

<!-- chunk -->

### especially about stacking which was my big worry taking so many pills

<!-- chunk -->

### with each meal and also how to do intermittent fasting or OMAD and still

<!-- chunk -->

### take all my supplements. I look forward to finding all the answers on your

<!-- chunk -->

## site!!! Forever grateful. ~ Amelia

<!-- chunk -->

## Amazingly helpful thank you. Life saver actually. ~ Sam

# INTRODUCTION

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’ve spent any time on my website NootropicsExpert.com, or have

<!-- chunk -->

### experimented with nootropics before, you have a good idea how certain

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic supplements can benefit your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### But if you’re just getting started with nootropics, the choices can seem

<!-- chunk -->

### overwhelming. Where do you start?

<!-- chunk -->

### Allow me a minute or two to share my story. How I discovered nootropics.

<!-- chunk -->

### And how I ended up with the nootropic stack I’m using now.

<!-- chunk -->

### I met a beautiful blonde girl on North Miami Beach about 18 years ago.

<!-- chunk -->

### Six months later we got married. And we are still married today. Marrying

<!-- chunk -->

### Larah is the best decision I have ever made.

<!-- chunk -->

### But during our first year together she could see the problems I was having

<!-- chunk -->

### with focus and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### I had been struggling with focus all of my adult life. Every executive job I

<!-- chunk -->

### had resulted in a yearly performance review. “David, you are a fantastic

<!-- chunk -->

### manger, a great executive, good salesmen, and people love working with

<!-- chunk -->

### you. But you have got to learn how to focus.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Every single year. So, I went out and bought the books on how to focus.

<!-- chunk -->

### And how to be a good executive. But I couldn’t get it. I thought it was a

<!-- chunk -->

### moral failing.

<!-- chunk -->

### So, after about a year together, Larah saw what was happening. She told

<!-- chunk -->

### me to see a psychiatrist she knew in Palm Beach, Florida.

<!-- chunk -->

### Turns out this doc was a rock star. In the first 10 minutes he diagnosed me

<!-- chunk -->

### with Adult ADD and PTSD.

<!-- chunk -->

### For Adult ADD I was prescribed Ritalin. And from the very first day using

<!-- chunk -->

### Ritalin it was like someone turned the lights on in my brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### For the first time in my life I could focus. But it didn’t last. After a couple

<!-- chunk -->

### of great years, Ritalin no longer worked as well as it once did.

<!-- chunk -->

### And I panicked. I finally find something that works, and it stops working?

<!-- chunk -->

### I don’t think so.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now, keep in mind there were no books or websites I could go for help. I

<!-- chunk -->

### had to figure this out on my own. So, I started reading clinical studies on

<!-- chunk -->

### how Ritalin works.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ritalin is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. And if it no longer worked as

<!-- chunk -->

### well maybe that means I don’t have enough dopamine in my brain? How

<!-- chunk -->

### do I fix that?

<!-- chunk -->

### I also discovered that brain cell signaling was a problem in those dealing

<!-- chunk -->

### with ADD and ADHD. And that was dependent on adequate levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine in my brain. How do I increase acetylcholine?

<!-- chunk -->

### Turns out that L-Tyrosine boosts dopamine. And Alpha GPC along with

<!-- chunk -->

### ALCAR increases acetylcholine. So, I went around the corner to a GNC

<!-- chunk -->

### store near us. And bought L-Tyrosine, Alpha GPC and ALCAR.

<!-- chunk -->

### I took these supplements home and started using them 3-times per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ritalin started working again. And I have not increased my Ritalin dose

<!-- chunk -->

### since. Nor do I experience a stimulant crash later in the afternoon as long

<!-- chunk -->

### as I take the same supplements again around 4 PM.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fast forward about 8 years and I started getting really sick. So sick that I

<!-- chunk -->

### could not work. My business was failing, marriage was on the rocks, we

<!-- chunk -->

### were out of money, and I felt like I wanted to die.

<!-- chunk -->

### It got so bad that one day I ended up in the ER. What my wife feared was a

<!-- chunk -->

### heart attack turned out to be hypothyroidism. A non-functioning thyroid

<!-- chunk -->

### came with chronic fatigue syndrome, severe brain fog, memory loss,

<!-- chunk -->

### fibromyalgia, chronic pain, and adrenal fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

### We endured endless visits to specialists and renowned hospitals including

<!-- chunk -->

### the Cleveland Clinic. Along with episodes of not remembering dates and

<!-- chunk -->

### appointments, a failing business, a crumbling marriage, doctors,

<!-- chunk -->

### endocrinologists, neuroscience specialists and therapists.

<!-- chunk -->

### Two unrelated neurologists tested me for dementia, and early-onset

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease. One of the tests was the “Mini-Mental State Exam”.

<!-- chunk -->

### The doctor asked a series of questions designed to test a range of everyday

<!-- chunk -->

### mental skills.

<!-- chunk -->

### The maximum MMSE score is 30 points. A score of 20 to 24 suggests

<!-- chunk -->

### mild dementia, 13 to 20 suggests moderate dementia, and less than

<!-- chunk -->

### indicates severe dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### I got 30 points on every test which meant I didn’t have dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mini-cog

<!-- chunk -->

### During the mini-cog, a person is asked to complete two tasks:

<!-- chunk -->

### 1.Remember, and a few minutes later, repeat the names of three

<!-- chunk -->

### common objects.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.Draw a face of a clock showing all 12 numbers in the right places

<!-- chunk -->

### and a time specified by the examiner.

<!-- chunk -->

### The results of this brief test can help a physician determine if further

<!-- chunk -->

### evaluation is needed.1

<!-- chunk -->

### I’m a writer, and not an artist. But was able to draw a near perfect clock.

<!-- chunk -->

### So it was becoming increasingly clear that this was not dementia, or

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s. But clearly my brain was not working nearly as well as it

<!-- chunk -->

### should.

<!-- chunk -->

### The medical bills kept stacking up, and the doctors had all but given up.

<!-- chunk -->

### There was nothing wrong with me according to mainstream medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### But my life was falling apart, and I had to decide. Either figure this thing

<!-- chunk -->

### out. Or give up and die.

<!-- chunk -->

## I decided there must be a better way.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nootropics Saved My Life

<!-- chunk -->

### I’m a Virgo. And this means I’m very methodical in my approach to life.

<!-- chunk -->

### There had to be another answer to my cognitive problems. And thus began

<!-- chunk -->

### more years of research and experimenting.

<!-- chunk -->

### I had to find out if there was an alternative way to beat severe brain fog,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory loss and depression. Ritalin helped me focus. But was not helping

<!-- chunk -->

### in the memory and thinking department.

<!-- chunk -->

### Years of searching PubMed for clinical studies related to the issues I was

<!-- chunk -->

### dealing with, reading stacks of books, and combing through the forums.

<!-- chunk -->

### And little by little, I was able to get my brain working again. With

<!-- chunk -->

### determination and time, it is now working better than ever before.

<!-- chunk -->

### With the right combination of supplements and lifestyle changes, I’ve

<!-- chunk -->

### been able to turn my life around. My business is more profitable than ever,

<!-- chunk -->

### my relationship is better than the day we got married, and my brain is

<!-- chunk -->

### firing on all cylinders.

<!-- chunk -->

### And I continue to tweak and refine every area of my brain and cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

## Who This Book is For

<!-- chunk -->

### So if you’re dealing with ADHD. Or are not happy with your life because

<!-- chunk -->

### of brain fog, anxiety, depression, chronic fatigue, difficulty sleeping, OCD,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory loss or age-related problems … this book could be your way

<!-- chunk -->

### back.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nootropics and neuroscience are maturing. Researchers and ordinary

<!-- chunk -->

### neurohackers like us are beginning to understand a lot about the brain. And

<!-- chunk -->

### we’ve found that several things follow from taking care of your head first.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your quality of life is tied to how well your brain functions. If you give

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain what it needs, and slow down brain aging, boost your memory

<!-- chunk -->

### and alertness so you can think faster on your feet, and your brain begins to

<!-- chunk -->

### function the way it was designed or better – everything changes.

<!-- chunk -->

### My life, and the lives of millions of neurohackers worldwide is certainly

<!-- chunk -->

### testament to that!

<!-- chunk -->

### Think about this for a moment. You go to the dentist once a year to see

<!-- chunk -->

### how your teeth are doing. But you don’t think about going to your

<!-- chunk -->

### neurologist once a year to see how your brain is doing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clearly your brain is more important than your teeth. You can get false

<!-- chunk -->

### teeth. But replacement brains are simply not yet available.

<!-- chunk -->

### One big lesson I have learned is your brain is not going to get better on its

<!-- chunk -->

### own. Researchers at Simon Fraser University in Canada studied 3,305

<!-- chunk -->

### volunteers aged 16 to 44 years. They concluded that our brains start going

<!-- chunk -->

### south at age 24.2

<!-- chunk -->

### This means that even if you’re living an optimal lifestyle, eating right,

<!-- chunk -->

### exercising, getting enough sleep, and breathing clean air – your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### health on average starts to decline in your early 20’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### So this book is not just for neurohackers looking to tweak their brain for

<!-- chunk -->

### optimal performance. This book is for you if you want to do better in any

<!-- chunk -->

### area of your life. Including work, athletics, relationships, and spiritual life.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even your body’s overall physical health depends largely on how well your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain works.

<!-- chunk -->

### Take care of your head first and your life gets better.

<!-- chunk -->

## What is Your Brain Hacking Goal?

<!-- chunk -->

### This is an important question because when it comes to brain health and

<!-- chunk -->

### optimization, your options can be so overwhelming that you’ll put this

<!-- chunk -->

### book down. And never get started.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nootropic supplements can boost alertness, concentration, focus, memory

<!-- chunk -->

### and recall. And can reduce anxiety and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some nootropics have even been proven effective in combating serious

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological diseases like ADHD, ADD, Alzheimer’s, Anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Traumatic Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### Injury (TBI), PTSD, and Major Depressive Disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### So my advice is to first choose one area of your life that you’d like to

<!-- chunk -->

### improve. Maybe you’d like better memory. Or you’d like a healthier, more

<!-- chunk -->

### effective alternative to treating depression than with prescription SSRI’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Maybe anxiety is destroying your quality of life.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nearly every area of your life can be improved with the right nootropic


<!-- chunk -->

## How to Use this Book

<!-- chunk -->

### This book is divided into sections that are easy to find and navigate. The

<!-- chunk -->

### first part of the book (Top 7 Brain Hacking Principles) explains how to get

<!-- chunk -->

### started with nootropic supplements. What to expect and how to choose the

<!-- chunk -->

### right supplement. General principles that will help keep you safe. And how

<!-- chunk -->

### to evaluate your progress as you try different supplements.

<!-- chunk -->

## The next chapter talks about “How Your Brain Works”. I’ve done my

<!-- chunk -->

### best to keep the neuroscience as simple to understand as possible. While

<!-- chunk -->

### giving you the fundamentals of what’s going on in your brain. And how

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic supplements affect each area for desired results.

<!-- chunk -->

### The next section is the longest and provides you with a list of

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic supplements. Each supplement has an overview of what it is and

<!-- chunk -->

### what it helps in your brain, what goes wrong and why you may need it,

<!-- chunk -->

### how the nootropic feels when you take it, plenty of clinical research to

<!-- chunk -->

### back up what I’m saying, recommended dosage and side effects. Including

<!-- chunk -->

### drug interactions and where you need to be cautious if you’re using any

<!-- chunk -->

### prescription medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most of the nootropic supplements I talk about in this book are available

<!-- chunk -->

### at your local vitamin shop or health food store. The racetams are now

<!-- chunk -->

### much more difficult to get but can be purchased online from a couple of

<!-- chunk -->

### reputable supplement suppliers.

<!-- chunk -->

### One thing you’ll notice is I don’t talk much about “Smart Drugs” that are

<!-- chunk -->

### commonly referred to in the press as nootropics. However, you may see

<!-- chunk -->

### me reference ADHD stimulants like Adderall or Ritalin. And possibly

<!-- chunk -->

### mention other prescriptions drugs like Modafinil.

<!-- chunk -->

### “Smart Drugs” are NOT nootropics. Anything that requires a prescription

<!-- chunk -->

### to purchase is considered a Smart Drug.

<!-- chunk -->

### Natural nootropic supplements can be purchased online or at your local

<!-- chunk -->

### health food store or vitamin shop. You do not need a prescription to buy

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic supplements. And that distinct difference is reflected in this

<!-- chunk -->

### book.

<!-- chunk -->

### I want you to have the best experience possible while optimizing and

<!-- chunk -->

### repairing your brain. And not have to beg your doctor for a prescription.

<!-- chunk -->

### The section after the list of individual nootropic supplements in this book

<!-- chunk -->

### provides recommendations for specific brain-hacking goals.

<!-- chunk -->

### I talk about nootropics that have been shown to help specific brain

<!-- chunk -->

### functions. This will help you choose between the various supplements

<!-- chunk -->

### you’ve just read about. Brain functions including decision-making and

<!-- chunk -->

### thinking, anxiety and depression, energy and motivation, memory, and

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidants and repair.

<!-- chunk -->

### The closing chapter provides instructions on “How to Build Your

<!-- chunk -->

### Nootropic Stack”. Think of that chapter as a recipe that when assembled,

<!-- chunk -->

### will help you achieve whatever you’re trying to fix or optimize.

<!-- chunk -->

### The very end of the book includes a glossary and index. The glossary can

<!-- chunk -->

### be handy to look up words you’re unfamiliar with. And the index of course

<!-- chunk -->

### is a ready reference to the entire book.

<!-- chunk -->

### This book is not meant to be read cover-to-cover like a novel. It’s more

<!-- chunk -->

### like a reference and repair manual for your brain. And the supplements

<!-- chunk -->

### that can help it.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest you keep this book handy as you first build your nootropic stack.

<!-- chunk -->

### And refer to it when you hear about something new that you think you’d

<!-- chunk -->

### like to try. Bookmark it, highlight it, write in the margins, circle things –

<!-- chunk -->

### do whatever you need to do to make this book work for you.

<!-- chunk -->

### The next section is my Top 7 Brain Hacking Principles. To get you started

<!-- chunk -->

### in hacking your own brain. And keeping you safe while you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### experimenting. Good luck. And remember. Fix your Head First. And most

<!-- chunk -->

### of the other important things in your life will fall into place.


# TOP 7 BRAIN HACKING

# PRINCIPLES

<!-- chunk -->

### Walk into any Vitamin Shoppe, drug store or shop online and you’ll have

<!-- chunk -->

### thousands of different supplements to choose from. Go to the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### optimization section, and your selection is reduced to a few hundred

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic supplements.

<!-- chunk -->

### With this smorgasbord of racetams, vitamins, herbs, amino acids, and

<!-- chunk -->

### peptides within easy reach, you may be tempted to buy a variety of them

<!-- chunk -->

### for your nootropic stack.

<!-- chunk -->

### But I recommend taking a more cautious approach to hacking your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ideally, you should be talking to your health-care provider to make sure

<!-- chunk -->

### these supplements will not interact with any of your prescription

<!-- chunk -->

### medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, let’s get real, and consider the state of medicine in many

<!-- chunk -->

### countries including the United States. Your doctor likely has no idea what

<!-- chunk -->

### you’re even talking about. Especially when it comes to natural nootropic


<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, hundreds of doctors, nurses, chiropractors, naturopaths and other

<!-- chunk -->

### medical professionals have subscribed to the Nootropics Expert newsletter

<!-- chunk -->

### and bought the 1st Edition of Head First.

<!-- chunk -->

### But fear not because we’ve got you covered. In the Chapter “Nootropics

<!-- chunk -->

### List”, each nootropic has a section detailing side effects including

<!-- chunk -->

### interactions with many prescription medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### But don’t rely exclusively on the medication interactions included in this

<!-- chunk -->

### book. Each nootropic could have many more interactions than I have been

<!-- chunk -->

### able to include in this book.

<!-- chunk -->

### Please do your own research online for each prescription medication you

<!-- chunk -->

### are taking. And review the contraindications, side effects & drug

<!-- chunk -->

### interactions, warnings and precautions lists for each medication. See how

<!-- chunk -->

### they work in your body and brain. And if there could be any kind of

<!-- chunk -->

### problem combining it with any of the nootropics in your stack.

# There is No “Magic Pill”

<!-- chunk -->

### Bradley Cooper’s character in the blockbuster film Limitless took just one

<!-- chunk -->

### pill called NZT-48. And suddenly had perfect recall, could access the

<!-- chunk -->

### tiniest of snippets of past information, and turned them into advanced

<!-- chunk -->

### powers of deduction. His whole brain came alive. Making him seemingly

<!-- chunk -->

### super-human.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are looking for your version of NZT-48 in nootropics, or any

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement or prescription drug, it doesn’t exist. It can’t exist. And here’s

<!-- chunk -->

### why.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain is arguably the most complex thing in the entire universe. The

<!-- chunk -->

### number of biochemical and bioelectrical processes going on in your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### right now, are mind-blowingly complicated.

<!-- chunk -->

### We have been conditioned by Western medicine in our modern society to

<!-- chunk -->

### choose one pill to fix a health problem. Every disease or health problem

<!-- chunk -->

### has a separate pill. And if the pill you’re prescribed causes a side effect,

<!-- chunk -->

### you’ll get a prescription for the side effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### Of course, the antidepressant may not work. Or makes you sleepy. So you

<!-- chunk -->

### get another pill to keep you awake. And it goes on and on and on…

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s put a stop to this nonsense right now. And look at how they’ve done

<!-- chunk -->

### it for several thousand years in the Far East and Native Americans.

<!-- chunk -->

### Healers in China and India know that your body and brain need a variety

<!-- chunk -->

### of nutrients in small doses instead of one high dose nutrient or drug.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ancient Chinese medicine, and Ayurveda from India, have known this for

<!-- chunk -->

### millennia. Their formulations include small amounts of several natural

<!-- chunk -->

### ingredients.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ancient doctors learned long ago that many medical conditions respond

<!-- chunk -->

### better to a combination of several active nutrients, instead of just one.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taking a high dose of one nootropic supplement can upset the delicate

<!-- chunk -->

### balance of the complex biochemical interactions in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Western medicine is always looking for that one “magic pill” that alone

<!-- chunk -->

### will cure all ills. One pill to cure Alzheimer’s. Another pill to cure

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia. Yet another pill to cure depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### But your body and brain is far too complicated, with far too many

<!-- chunk -->

### processes going on every instant. One pill is not the answer to everything

<!-- chunk -->

### that can go wrong in your brain. Or that causes disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### With nootropics and brain optimization we must intelligently combine a

<!-- chunk -->

### variety of solutions.

# Dosage and Synergy

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the most critical things to understand in using nootropics is that

<!-- chunk -->

### your stack must work synergistically. Because each supplement has a

<!-- chunk -->

### different mechanism of action in your brain and body. And each

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement in your stack should support the other nootropics in your

<!-- chunk -->

### stack.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, acetylcholine’s function in your brain is needed for encoding

<!-- chunk -->

### new memories, reasoning, concentration, cognition and growth of new

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons (neurogenesis).

<!-- chunk -->

### Once acetylcholine does its job, the enzyme acetylcholinesterase comes in

<!-- chunk -->

### and breaks down acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can increase acetylcholine in your brain by adding Alpha GPC, CDP-

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline with Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR) to your stack.

<!-- chunk -->

### But if you use more than one acetylcholine (ACh) precursor or

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement, you can boost ACh too much. Excess ACh can cause

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, irritability, muscle pain and a host of other problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Also keep in mind that a nootropic like Huperzine-A inhibits

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholinesterase. Which increases ACh levels in your brain. So if you

<!-- chunk -->

### are using Hup-A in your stack, you may want to cut back on your dose of

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC, CDP-Choline or other choline supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many nootropic supplements either increase ACh or inhibit

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholinesterase. If you take more than one choline supplement, you’ll

<!-- chunk -->

### hit a ceiling and not get a synergistic effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### The same holds true for other neurotransmitters. And many other

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements explored in the Nootropics List section of this book.

# Start Low and Slow

<!-- chunk -->

### Every nootropic has an ideal dosage for you. If you take more than your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain needs, you could have a negative reaction. And depending on the

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement, your reaction could include feeling anxious, brain fog,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, slow thinking, irritability, restlessness, or feeling overly

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulated.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is particularly dangerous when boosting dopamine or serotonin too

<!-- chunk -->

### much. I’ll cover these neurotransmitters in more detail in the next section

<!-- chunk -->

### “Stay Safe”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some nootropics, like most of the B-Vitamins are used by your body and

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. And the excess is excreted in your urine within a few hours. But

<!-- chunk -->

### other nootropics have a cumulative effect. And build up over time.

<!-- chunk -->

### A classic example of this effect is drinking too many cups of coffee. One

<!-- chunk -->

### or two cups give you an energy boost. But 3, 4, or 5 cups can have a

<!-- chunk -->

### cumulative effect and leave you irritable or feeling anxious.

<!-- chunk -->

### Combining a stimulant like caffeine with certain nootropics which also

<!-- chunk -->

### have a stimulant effect will produce similar symptoms of anxiety or

<!-- chunk -->

### irritability. And each of our bodies is unique. So you can’t predict how

<!-- chunk -->

### your body and brain will react to a supplement unless you try it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Start with a low dose of any new nootropic you’re adding to your stack.

<!-- chunk -->

### And gradually increase it over the next few days to see how your body

<!-- chunk -->

### reacts.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes you’ll see recommendations of higher doses for certain

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics. Especially on supplement packaging. These dosages are often

<!-- chunk -->

### based on clinical studies. Researchers were using a high dose to elicit a

<!-- chunk -->

### specific response within the time parameters of the trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you intend on taking the same nootropic over an extended period, it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### very possible that you will need a fraction of the dose used in the trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### You’ll notice this as you read forum threads. People experience a wide

<!-- chunk -->

### range of responses to different amounts for each nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our body and brain are unique. And influenced by genetics, the food we

<!-- chunk -->

### eat, what we drink, environmental toxins and a host of other things that

<!-- chunk -->

### affect us.

<!-- chunk -->

### Starting low and slow with any nootropic will minimize side effects. With

<!-- chunk -->

### experience, you’ll soon learn how much of each nootropic produces the

<!-- chunk -->

### best effect for you.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should also be skeptical of dosages listed on product labels. This

<!-- chunk -->

### advice goes for nootropics and even your prescription medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplement companies and doctors don’t know your body as well as you

<!-- chunk -->

### do. Some people are very sensitive to nutrients and medicines where even

<!-- chunk -->

### a very small dose can produce nasty side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s OK to break pills in half or quarters, or open capsules and only use a

<!-- chunk -->

### small amount until you see how your body reacts. A small dose may be all

<!-- chunk -->

### you need.

<!-- chunk -->

### You’ll often see in nootropics forums the letters YMMV. It stands for

<!-- chunk -->

### “Your Mileage May Vary”. Which means your reaction to a nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### could be very different to the person standing next to you.

<!-- chunk -->

### I’ll say it one more time. Then leave it alone. For now. Start low and slow.

# Avoid Tolerance

<!-- chunk -->

### With nootropics and many prescription drugs, developing tolerance means

<!-- chunk -->

### that over time your body doesn’t respond to that substance as well as when

<!-- chunk -->

### you first started using it. This doesn’t always mean it suddenly stops

<!-- chunk -->

### working. It just seems to become less effective over time.

<!-- chunk -->

### Not all nootropics are susceptible to tolerance. It’s typically an issue with

<!-- chunk -->

### some of the racetams like Phenylpiracetam. And Phenibut users can

<!-- chunk -->

### quickly build up a tolerance when using this nootropic. I talk more about

<!-- chunk -->

### tolerance for specific individual supplements later in this book.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many prescription meds also come with tolerance problems. Particularly

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulants like Adderall and Ritalin. Even many SSRIs used for

<!-- chunk -->

### depression and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tolerance is caused in several ways in your brain and body depending on

<!-- chunk -->

### the substance. For example, many have tolerance issues with Adderall.

<!-- chunk -->

### And I’m going to use Adderall to illustrate how this works in your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### because there is some parallel here to understanding the cause of tolerance

<!-- chunk -->

### with some nootropics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Adderall in your brain alters dopamine concentrations and receptor

<!-- chunk -->

### densities, as well as calcium ion influx at NMDA receptor sites.

<!-- chunk -->

### Constantly triggering an excess influx of calcium ions through NMDA

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors alters synaptic plasticity, neuronal connectivity, and could even

<!-- chunk -->

### cause neuron damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Over time, changes in NMDA receptor function from excess calcium ions

<!-- chunk -->

### could be part of the cause of tolerance. Now this gets a little complicated

<!-- chunk -->

### so stick with me here.

<!-- chunk -->

### Adderall works by boosting certain proteins (TAAR1) and inhibiting

<!-- chunk -->

### monoamine transporter molecules (VMAT2) in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### TAAR1 agonism decreases firing of dopamine receptors. And increases

<!-- chunk -->

### protein kinase signaling to the dopamine transporter (DAT). This

<!-- chunk -->

### modification of proteins stop DAT from functioning. Or affect transport of

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine to the synapse.

<!-- chunk -->

### And VMAT2 inhibition triggers a release of dopamine from presynaptic

<!-- chunk -->

### vesicles into intracellular fluid. This all results in dopamine depletion in

<!-- chunk -->

### parts of your brain. Leading to tolerance due to low levels of dopamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### To make matters even worse, there’s some evidence that Adderall

<!-- chunk -->

### facilitates the expression of CREB (cAMP response element binding

<!-- chunk -->

### protein) in dopamine terminals. This induces the transcription of various

<!-- chunk -->

### genes which may also cause tolerance in some neurohackers.

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom-line is concentrations of dopamine, norepinephrine and

<!-- chunk -->

### possibly even serotonin are affected by Adderall. But it depletes dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### the most. Leading to tolerance. And why Adderall over time doesn’t work

<!-- chunk -->

### as well as it once did.

<!-- chunk -->

### Enough of the neuroscience already. My point is that these types of

<!-- chunk -->

### shenanigans in your brain that can be caused by prescription meds and

<!-- chunk -->

### certain nootropics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Using some of these drugs can deplete certain neurotransmitters, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### density of neuroreceptors. Nootropics and drugs can alter gene expression

<!-- chunk -->

### in brain cells. They can affect hormone levels and cause oxidative stress in

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells. Receptors are downregulated and you experience synaptic

<!-- chunk -->

### reorganization. And some neurotransmitter transporters decrease.

<!-- chunk -->

### The result is tolerance. So, we need a strategy to counteract this affect. But

<!-- chunk -->

### there’s not one blanket approach to avoiding tolerance because each

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic or drug works differently in your brain. And even differently for

<!-- chunk -->

### different people.

<!-- chunk -->

### Often, the simplest strategy is cycling the substance you are using. Once

<!-- chunk -->

### you feel you’re not getting the affect you once did, it’s time to stop using

<!-- chunk -->

### that nootropic for a while. Allow your brain to recover before you start

<!-- chunk -->

### using it again.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another strategy is compensating for what’s causing that tolerance in the

<!-- chunk -->

### first place.

<!-- chunk -->

### For Adderall, you could add NDMA antagonists like magnesium, zinc or

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A to your stack. You could upregulate dopamine by using L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine which boosts dopamine levels, or Inositol which increases

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine D


<!-- chunk -->

### receptor density. Or choline which also increases dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### receptor densities. And even Sulbutiamine which increases the number of

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine binding sites.

<!-- chunk -->

### Personally, I find that using 1000 mg of DHA in the morning, with 500 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tyrosine, 750 mg Aniracetam, and 400 mg Sulbutiamine along with

<!-- chunk -->

### mg CDP-Choline and 500 mg ALCAR every time I take my dose of Ritalin

<!-- chunk -->

### (twice per day), prevents tolerance.

<!-- chunk -->

### And an extra dose of these nootropics around 4 pm also prevents the

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulant crash that normally comes with using a stimulant like Ritalin.

<!-- chunk -->

### My final advice on tolerance is research each nootropic you are using.

<!-- chunk -->

### Find out exactly how it works in your brain. And if there is a potential for

<!-- chunk -->

### tolerance, find out what you can do to avoid it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Comments on the Nootropics Expert website and YouTube channel can be

<!-- chunk -->

### useful too. But you’ll find that every person in a thread has a different

<!-- chunk -->

### opinion on how to avoid tolerance for a nootropic or prescription med.

<!-- chunk -->

### You must decide for yourself by listening to your body and how it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### reacting. That, combined with your knowledge of a nootropic will provide

<!-- chunk -->

### you with a plan of action to deal with tolerance.

# Choosing the Right Nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### This entire book is about choosing the right nootropic supplements to help

<!-- chunk -->

### address your specific cognitive issues. So, here I’ll talk about a couple of

<!-- chunk -->

### examples that could help you build your nootropic stack.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the previous section, we explored how using certain nootropics or

<!-- chunk -->

### prescription drugs can affect various parts of your brain. Stimulants like

<!-- chunk -->

### Adderall and Ritalin and their kin can deplete dopamine in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Among other issues which we also covered.

<!-- chunk -->

### To replenish dopamine stores in your brain requires finding out what

<!-- chunk -->

### natural substances can help your brain produce more dopamine. And once

<!-- chunk -->

### you’ve made a list of dopamine-producing options, choose one and try it.

<!-- chunk -->

### One strong word of caution. You may have a list of several natural

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds that help your brain produce dopamine. Don’t try using all of

<!-- chunk -->

### them at the same time. Because if you boost dopamine too much, you’ll

<!-- chunk -->

### experience some nasty side effects. Including irritability, aggression,

<!-- chunk -->

### intense sexual feelings and worst case is psychosis.

<!-- chunk -->

### The same goes for boosting any other neurotransmitter or cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### function in your brain. Carefully choose a nootropic, get the dose right,

<!-- chunk -->

### take it and see how you react. If it doesn’t produce the effect you want,

<!-- chunk -->

### then try something else.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can also have an unpleasant experience by taking a nootropic at the

<!-- chunk -->

### wrong time of day. For example, if you use a supplement that acts as a

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulant while indoors and strapped to your desk, you could feel restless

<!-- chunk -->

### and irritable.

<!-- chunk -->

### On the other hand, using the same nootropic with stimulant effects during

<!-- chunk -->

### the weekend could give you the energy to enjoy that mountain hike more.

<!-- chunk -->

### Or a more enjoyable bike ride, or time with your kids.

<!-- chunk -->

### So, it’s not only important to choose the right nootropic, or nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### stack, but also that you match the right circumstance, day, and time or

<!-- chunk -->

### setting.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many of the nootropics discussed in this book act as stimulants. Including

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine, DHEA, Citicoline, Ginseng, Gingko Biloba, Coenzyme Q10,

<!-- chunk -->

### SAMe, DMAE and even high doses of B-Vitamins. When combined, their

<!-- chunk -->

### effects can be cumulative and lead to overstimulation or insomnia.

<!-- chunk -->

### It took me several years to settle on exactly what I needed in my personal

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic stack. And my wife gave me a hard time about the money I was

<!-- chunk -->

### spending on supplements every month.

<!-- chunk -->

### But I no longer get complaints about money spent on supplements.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because the result has been a complete turnaround in my health including

<!-- chunk -->

### the bedroom. My income is higher than it ever was. And it keeps on

<!-- chunk -->

### getting better.

<!-- chunk -->

### Experimenting is your key to success in biohacking and brain

<!-- chunk -->

### optimization. Stick with it and the miracles start to happen.

# Stay Safe

<!-- chunk -->

### Earlier in this chapter I touched on the hazards of messing with

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters in your brain. Let’s take a closer look at things to watch

<!-- chunk -->

### out for when using nootropics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some supplements can accumulate in brain cells, organs, and tissues over

<!-- chunk -->

### time. Meaning the more you take, the more they build up in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### With those types of nootropics, you need less, not more the longer you use

<!-- chunk -->

### it.

<!-- chunk -->

### I personally find I must re-evaluate my stack from time to time. And

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce dosages if I find I’m becoming over-stimulated or experiencing

<!-- chunk -->

### other side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Every nootropic supplement I’ve included in this book have positive

<!-- chunk -->

### effects on the brain and mental health. But high doses of some can have

<!-- chunk -->

### nasty effects which I cover in more detail in each relevant supplement

<!-- chunk -->

### review later in this book.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s look at a couple of examples here. We’ll start with dopamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dopamine is associated with feelings of pleasure and reward. This

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter plays a vital role in motivation and reward behavior.

<!-- chunk -->

### Drugs, food, and sex are all capable of boosting dopamine levels in your


<!-- chunk -->

### Increased levels of dopamine can enhance your concentration, improve

<!-- chunk -->

### your mood, and even make you more sociable. But combining L-Tyrosine

<!-- chunk -->

### with Mucuna Pruriens (L-DOPA), and L-Theanine, which all affect

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine levels, and you could have issues.

<!-- chunk -->

### Too much dopamine can result in agitation, anxiety, over-amped cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### function, hyperactivity, hypersexuality, insomnia, and even psychosis. And

<!-- chunk -->

### excess dopamine suppresses serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin plays a role in appetite control, mood, learning and memory, and

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep. Low serotonin is widely believed to be the underlying cause of

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. But too much serotonin can also cause big problems. And this

<!-- chunk -->

### can happen much more easily than you’d expect.

<!-- chunk -->

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Paxil, Prozac, Zoloft,

<!-- chunk -->

### Celexa, and Lexapro are used by millions to relieve depression by either

<!-- chunk -->

### boosting serotonin levels, or somehow affecting how serotonin works in

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### But combining one of these SSRIs with nootropics like tryptophan, 5-HTP,

<!-- chunk -->

### or St. John’s wort which also boost serotonin, can lead to excess serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### levels in your brain. Leading to Serotonin Syndrome which is a real danger,

<!-- chunk -->

### and one I’ve personally experienced.

<!-- chunk -->

### Excess serotonin can cause agitation, restlessness, diarrhea, nausea,

<!-- chunk -->

### vomiting, and rapid changes in blood pressure. When serotonin levels are

<!-- chunk -->

### excessively elevated, your headed for Serotonin Syndrome. And it’s much

<!-- chunk -->

### easier than you’d expect to enter this danger zone. Simply combining 5-

<!-- chunk -->

### HTP with an SSRI and you’re asking for trouble.

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin Syndrome symptoms include high fever, irregular heartbeat,

<!-- chunk -->

### seizures, loss of consciousness and even death. And I’m not kidding. My

<!-- chunk -->

### doctor’s fiancé died from Serotonin Syndrome.

<!-- chunk -->

### Staying safe when using nootropics means knowing exactly how they work

<!-- chunk -->

### in your brain and body. Learning how two or more nootropics interact. And

<!-- chunk -->

### reviewing the contraindications and warnings for every prescription

<!-- chunk -->

### medication you’re on.

# Evaluating your Nootropic Stack

<!-- chunk -->

### Earlier I mentioned that my personal nootropic stack changes from time to

<!-- chunk -->

### time. I find something I want to try, compare it to my current stack, then

<!-- chunk -->

### decide if I need to eliminate something before adding it.

<!-- chunk -->

### As you gain more experience with neurohacking and nootropics, you’ll

<!-- chunk -->

### likely do the same thing. Testing and evaluating are part of the nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### experience. And key to success with optimizing your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nootropics can have dramatic benefits touching every part of your life.

<!-- chunk -->

### But just because something is within easy reach on a vitamin store shelf

<!-- chunk -->

### doesn’t mean it’s safe to use.

<!-- chunk -->

### You could be that one person in a thousand who has a bad experience.

<!-- chunk -->

### Does that mean that nootropic should be banned and taken off the market?

<!-- chunk -->

### I don’t believe that’s the answer. Each of us must take personal

<!-- chunk -->

### responsibility for our body and brain. And decide what to use to enhance

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition. Or not to use.

# Your Brain is Part of a System

<!-- chunk -->

### When you take the nootropics presented in this book for optimizing your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain, they not only have an effect on your brain, but on many other organs

<!-- chunk -->

### and tissues.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most nootropics I’ve included in this book have positive effects on both

<!-- chunk -->

### physical and cognitive health. But high dosages of some could cause side

<!-- chunk -->

### effects. In some cases, very severe side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### You’ll find more on precautions and side effects in my review for each

<!-- chunk -->

### individual nootropic. Whenever you’re considering adding something new

<!-- chunk -->

### to your stack, carefully read the review for that nootropic. And keep in

<!-- chunk -->

### mind how it may affect your entire body. Not just your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### One more thing… ever wondered why you get butterflies in your stomach?

<!-- chunk -->

### Or why an impending decision can cause an attack of intestinal cramps?

<!-- chunk -->

### They happen because your body has two brains. You’re already familiar

<!-- chunk -->

### with the one in your head. But there’s another vitally important one found

<!-- chunk -->

### in your gut.

<!-- chunk -->

### Like Siamese twins, your two brains are connected. When one gets upset,

<!-- chunk -->

### the other does too. Your gut has a powerful influence on all things brain

<!-- chunk -->

### related.

<!-- chunk -->

### I’ll not go into detail here because this book is about ‘nootropics’. Just

<!-- chunk -->

### realize that all the nootropics you take start in your digestive system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unless you take it sublingually. And can have effects starting in your gut.

<!-- chunk -->

### And all the way up until it crosses your blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can learn more about your microbiome and how it affects cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### and mental health by doing an online search. Or going to

<!-- chunk -->

### NootropicsExpert.com and searching for my article called “Psychobiotics:

<!-- chunk -->

### The Gut-Brain Connection”.

<!-- chunk -->

### We’ll investigate in detail each of 102 nootropics in detail in the next

<!-- chunk -->

### chapter. I’ve tried most of the supplements discussed in this book. They all

<!-- chunk -->

### work, and I have my favorites that I use every day.

<!-- chunk -->

### My dearest wish is that you find your ultimate nootropic stack. Start

<!-- chunk -->

### optimizing your brain and being feeling better today.

<!-- chunk -->

### But first, I have found through thousands of hours of research that it helps

<!-- chunk -->

### to understand how your brain works.

<!-- chunk -->

### Understanding the neuroscience even a little helps you understand why

<!-- chunk -->

### you are choosing a specific nootropic. It takes the mystery out of building

<!-- chunk -->

### your own nootropic stack. And reduces the feelings of overwhelm.

<!-- chunk -->

### Next up is how your brain works. You’ll be amazed once you learn what’s

<!-- chunk -->

### going on in that skull of yours.


# HOW YOUR BRAIN WORKS

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain is the most complex organ in your body. And many speculate

<!-- chunk -->

### the most complex thing in the entire universe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Weighing only about 3 pounds (1.36 kg), your brain is the command center

<!-- chunk -->

### for intelligence, interprets what you feel, hear, smell, taste, controls body

<!-- chunk -->

### movement and functions, directs your behavior and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### People have been fascinated by the brain since Aristotle in ancient Greece.

<!-- chunk -->

### But until recently the brain was considered too complicated to understand.

<!-- chunk -->

### Times have changed and scientists have learned more about the brain in

<!-- chunk -->

### the last 10 years than in the last several thousand years. The rate of

<!-- chunk -->

### research in neurobiology and behavioral science has accelerated. As has

<!-- chunk -->

### new research techniques.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a result, we know more about how nootropic supplements work. And

<!-- chunk -->

### can fine-tune our stacks to get the results we want.

<!-- chunk -->

### This chapter will help you understand how your brain works. We’ll touch

<!-- chunk -->

### on how to keep it healthy and optimized. And what happens when the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### is diseased or dysfunctional.

# Brain Architecture

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain is like a highly skilled team of professionals. Everyone

<!-- chunk -->

### working together, but each with their own unique job function. This macro

<!-- chunk -->

### view divides your brain into three basic teams: forebrain, midbrain, and

<!-- chunk -->

### hindbrain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The upper section of your spinal cord, the brain stem and a ball of tissue

<!-- chunk -->

## called the cerebellum (Latin for ‘little brain’) make up the hindbrain.

<!-- chunk -->

### This team controls your body’s vital functions like heart beat and

<!-- chunk -->

### breathing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your cerebellum also coordinates movement and plays a role in learned

<!-- chunk -->

### movements. Like reaching for a glass when you want a drink. When you

<!-- chunk -->

### play your guitar, or kick a football, you are activating your cerebellum.

<!-- chunk -->

## The very top of your brain stem is called the midbrain. This team controls

<!-- chunk -->

### your reflex actions. And plays a role in controlling eye movement and

<!-- chunk -->

### other voluntary movements.

<!-- chunk -->

## The forebrain is the most highly developed and largest part of your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## This team consists mainly of the cerebrum. And the structures buried

<!-- chunk -->

### beneath the cerebrum including the hippocampus, basal ganglia and

<!-- chunk -->

### olfactory bulb (sense of smell).

<!-- chunk -->

## The cerebrum is the uppermost part of your brain and what you normally

<!-- chunk -->

### associate with the idea of what a brain looks like in pictures.

<!-- chunk -->

### The cerebrum controls your emotions, hearing, vision, personality, all

<!-- chunk -->

### voluntary actions, and more. This is where intellect and cognition take

<!-- chunk -->

### place, where your memories are stored, imagination and thinking occur,

<!-- chunk -->

### and allows you to plan.

<!-- chunk -->

## The cerebrum is split in two halves or hemispheres. The two cerebral

<!-- chunk -->

### hemispheres are connected and communicate with each other via a thick

<!-- chunk -->

### cable of nerve fibers called the corpus callosum.

<!-- chunk -->

### The two hemispheres look alike but each has a unique function. Each

<!-- chunk -->

### interacts with the opposite side of your body. When the left side of your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain is damaged, the right side or your body is affected. For example, a

<!-- chunk -->

### stroke in the left hemisphere of your brain can leave your right arm and

<!-- chunk -->

### leg paralyzed.

# Cognitive Architecture

<!-- chunk -->

### Each cerebral hemisphere is divided into ‘lobes’, each specializing in a

<!-- chunk -->

## different function. Let’s start with the two frontal lobes.

<!-- chunk -->

### The two frontal lobes are located directly behind your forehead. Imagining

<!-- chunk -->

### the future, planning a schedule or reasoned arguments are controlled by

<!-- chunk -->

### these two frontal lobes.

<!-- chunk -->

### The frontal lobes act as short-term storage for memory much like RAM in

<!-- chunk -->

### your computer. It allows you to keep one idea in mind while other ideas

<!-- chunk -->

### are considered.

<!-- chunk -->

### At the back of each frontal lobe is a motor area which helps control

<!-- chunk -->

### voluntary movement. Like lifting your arm or taking a step. Next door to

<!-- chunk -->

### the motor area is Broca’s area which allows thought to be transformed into

<!-- chunk -->

### words.

<!-- chunk -->

## The parietal lobes are right behind the frontal lobes. And are used for

<!-- chunk -->

### example when you savor a delicious meal. This is where smell, taste and

<!-- chunk -->

### texture are processed.

<!-- chunk -->

### The forward section of your parietal lobes (right behind the motor area)

<!-- chunk -->

## are sensory areas. This is where you receive information from the rest of

<!-- chunk -->

### your body about movement, taste, temperature, and touch. Arithmetic and

<!-- chunk -->

### reading are also governed by each parietal lobe.

<!-- chunk -->

## Occipital lobes are near the back of your cerebrum. As you look at the

<!-- chunk -->

### words on this page, images from your eyes are processed in the occipital

<!-- chunk -->

### lobes. And linked to information with images stored in your memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Damage to your occipital lobes can cause blindness.

<!-- chunk -->

## Underneath the parietal and frontal lobes are your temporal lobes. When

<!-- chunk -->

### you listen to music, your brain responds through activity in the temporal

<!-- chunk -->

### lobes.

<!-- chunk -->

### An area at the top of each frontal lobe is involved in receiving information

<!-- chunk -->

### from your ears. The underside of each temporal lobe plays a role in

<!-- chunk -->

### forming and retrieving memories. Including those associated with music.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other parts of each temporal lobe help integrate memories and sensations

<!-- chunk -->

### of taste, sound, sight, and touch.

# Cerebral Cortex

<!-- chunk -->

### A 2 – 3 mm layer of tissue covering your cerebrum and cerebellum is

<!-- chunk -->

## called the cortex (Latin for ‘bark’). Also referred to as the cerebral cortex,

<!-- chunk -->

## this “gray matter” is where information processing takes place in your


<!-- chunk -->

### The cerebral cortex is ‘gray’ because neurons in this area lack the

<!-- chunk -->

### protective layer that makes most other parts of your brain appear white

<!-- chunk -->

## (“white matter”).

<!-- chunk -->

### The folds you notice in pictures of the brain are there to add surface area

<!-- chunk -->

### to the cortex. Increasing this surface area increases the amount of gray

<!-- chunk -->

### matter and the volume of information you can process.

# The Gatekeepers

<!-- chunk -->

## Deep within your brain is the “inner brain”. Here lie the gatekeepers

<!-- chunk -->

### between your spinal cord and cerebral hemispheres. These team members

<!-- chunk -->

### help determine your emotional state, modify your perceptions and

<!-- chunk -->

### responses depending on that state, and even allow you to initiate

<!-- chunk -->

### movements without thinking about them.

<!-- chunk -->

### Like the lobes in your cerebrum, these team members come in pairs which

<!-- chunk -->

### are duplicated in each half of your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## The pearl-sized hypothalamus directs several crucial actions. It wakes you

<!-- chunk -->

### up in the morning. And gets the adrenaline flowing when you’re taking an

<!-- chunk -->

### exam or doing a job interview.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your hypothalamus is an important emotional center. Controlling

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters that make you feel angry, exhilarated, or unhappy.

<!-- chunk -->

## The thalamus is near your hypothalamus and a major clearinghouse for

<!-- chunk -->

### information traveling to and from your spinal cord and cerebrum.

<!-- chunk -->

### A curved set of nerve cells leads from your hypothalamus and thalamus to

<!-- chunk -->

## your hippocampus. This surprisingly tiny hub acts as a memory indexer.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s like mission control when it comes to memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your hippocampus sends memories out to the appropriate part of your

<!-- chunk -->

### cerebrum for long-term storage and retrieves them when needed.

<!-- chunk -->

## Note that the hippocampus, while crucial to long-term memory, doesn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### store memories.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Alzheimer’s Disease, the hippocampus is one of the first areas of the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain to suffer damage. Disorientation and memory loss is some of the

<!-- chunk -->

### first symptoms in Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your basal ganglia are clusters of nerve cells surrounding the thalamus.

<!-- chunk -->

### And interconnected with your cerebral cortex, thalamus and brainstem.

<!-- chunk -->

## This area is involved in working memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your basal ganglia play a role in decision making, initiating, and

<!-- chunk -->

### integrating movements, learning and skill acquisition, procedural learning,

<!-- chunk -->

### reward processing, routine behaviors (habits), eye movement, cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### and emotion.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your basal ganglia transfers information that controls the release of

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine. Parkinson’s Disease, which results in rigidity, stiff and

<!-- chunk -->

### shuffling walk, and tremors, is a disease of the nerve cells leading to the

<!-- chunk -->

### basal ganglia.3

# Neurons & Synapses

<!-- chunk -->

### Your Central Nervous System and brain are composed of many distinct

<!-- chunk -->

### types of cells. But the primary functional cell when choosing nootropics

<!-- chunk -->

## for optimizing your brain is a cell called the neuron.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most recent research estimates your brain has an average of 86.1

<!-- chunk -->

## billion neurons, and 84.6 billion other types of cell including glial cells.4

<!-- chunk -->

### Glial cells surround and nutritionally support neurons. And more recent

<!-- chunk -->

### research shows may even play a role in brain cell signaling and

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroplasticity.

<!-- chunk -->

### A neuron is a highly specialized cell for processing and transmission of

<!-- chunk -->

### cellular signals. Your mood, movements, memories and sensations are the

<!-- chunk -->

### result of neurotransmitters and electrical signals sent and received by


<!-- chunk -->

## Neurons consist of three parts: the soma (cell body), dendrites and an

<!-- chunk -->

## axon.

<!-- chunk -->

### The soma contains the nucleus which is the control center of the cell. The

<!-- chunk -->

### nucleus is comprised of DNA, mRNA, genes, chromosomes, and proteins.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dendrites are feathery branches extending out from the soma. And act as a

<!-- chunk -->

## type of ‘antenna’ to receive signals sent by neighboring neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

## Each neuron (nerve cell) has a single axon which can vary in length

<!-- chunk -->

## extending out from the cell. Axons act as the cell’s sending unit that

<!-- chunk -->

### allows it to communicate with a neighboring neuron.

<!-- chunk -->

### Each axon can have extensive branches allowing it to communicate with

<!-- chunk -->

### many target cells. The longest axon in your body is the sciatic nerve that

<!-- chunk -->

### extends from the base of your spine down to your toes.

<!-- chunk -->

## The axon terminal contains synapses which are special structures where

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters are released or collected to communicate with target


# Cell Membranes

<!-- chunk -->

## Each neuron is encased in a cell membrane which separates the inside of

<!-- chunk -->

### the cell from the outside. This cell membrane acts like a barrier, allowing

<!-- chunk -->

### only the good stuff like water, oxygen, and nutrients to enter the cell. And

<!-- chunk -->

### restricts access to undesirable substances like toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

### The cell membrane consists mostly of lipids (fats) which include

<!-- chunk -->

### phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS), DHA, and other lipids.

<!-- chunk -->

### This cell membrane is constantly changing, and is influenced by your diet,

<!-- chunk -->

### stress and your immune system.

<!-- chunk -->

### DHA, PC and PS are used as nootropics because manipulation of the

<!-- chunk -->

### composition of the lipids in cell membranes can influence the function of


<!-- chunk -->

### The cell membrane has two layers. The inner layer facing the inside of the

<!-- chunk -->

### cell. And an outer layer facing the outside. The two most common groups

<!-- chunk -->

## of compounds making up these layers include phospholipids and sterols.

<!-- chunk -->

### Amino acids, fatty acids and phosphorous make up most of the lipids

<!-- chunk -->

### comprising phospholipids.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylcholine (PC) makes up about 30% of the lipid content in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) makes up about 27% of the lipid

<!-- chunk -->

### content in your brain. And another 10% of your brain lipid content is

<!-- chunk -->

### phosphatidylserine (PS).5

<!-- chunk -->

### Sterols include cholesterol which comprise about 20% of the lipid content

<!-- chunk -->

### of your brain. Cholesterol is a precursor from which steroid hormones like

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA, progesterone, estrogen and testosterone are formed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Changing or altering the composition of brain cell membranes can have a

<!-- chunk -->

### profound impact on many aspects of brain function. In many instances,

<!-- chunk -->

### using Omega-3s containing DHA, or supplementing with PC or PS can

<!-- chunk -->

### influence cognition, memory and brain health. Often as important as

<!-- chunk -->

### changing neurotransmitter levels with the use of nootropic supplements.

# Brain Cell Signaling

<!-- chunk -->

## Calcium, chloride, potassium and sodium ions in each brain cell has a

<!-- chunk -->

### different charge. And maintain a voltage gradient across the membrane of

<!-- chunk -->

### that cell.

<!-- chunk -->

### When the voltage changes significantly, an electrochemical pulse called an

<!-- chunk -->

### action potential is generated. This electrical activity can be measured and

<!-- chunk -->

## displayed as a wave form called Brain Waves.

<!-- chunk -->

### This electrical pulse travels along the cell’s axon. And is transferred

<!-- chunk -->

### across a synapse to a neighboring neuron. The neighboring neuron receives

<!-- chunk -->

### the signal through one of its dendrites. This transfer is known as a synaptic

<!-- chunk -->

### connection.

<!-- chunk -->

### A neuron can form tens of thousands of connections with other neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some estimates report well over 100 trillion synapses.6 Related neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### can form neural networks. And the more signals sent between two neurons,

<!-- chunk -->

### the stronger the connection.

<!-- chunk -->

### With each new experience and each fact that you remember, your brain

<!-- chunk -->

## slightly re-wires itself on a physical level. This neuroplasticity is called

<!-- chunk -->

## long-term potentiation and is required for the development or encoding of

<!-- chunk -->

### long-term memories.

<!-- chunk -->

### Signaling between neurons is not only electrical, but also electro-

<!-- chunk -->

## chemical. An axon terminal contains thousands of sacs called vesicles.

<!-- chunk -->

### Each vesicle can contain thousands of neurotransmitter molecules.

<!-- chunk -->

### These neurotransmitters are like chemical messengers which amplify,

<!-- chunk -->

### relay, and modulate signals between neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### When stimulated by an electrical pulse, a neurotransmitter is released.

<!-- chunk -->

### And crosses the synaptic cleft to the neighboring neuron. It then binds to a

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroreceptor in the dendrite of the receiving (post-synaptic) neuron.

# Neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### Every emotion or thought you experience is associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### electrochemical nerve impulses. And the release of tiny amounts of

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters between neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Electrochemical nerve impulses and the release of neurotransmitters in

<!-- chunk -->

### certain parts of your brain are happening as you read this sentence. Your

<!-- chunk -->

### eyes sense the shape of letters. And the information is relayed to your

<!-- chunk -->

### cerebral cortex.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain interprets these letters and words and convert them into

<!-- chunk -->

### thoughts. The thought is in turn stored as memory. Your genetic makeup,

<!-- chunk -->

### prior learning experience and memory dictate the nature of these thoughts.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another person reading this same sentence will experience it differently

<!-- chunk -->

### than you because no two people will have the exact same thoughts. Each

<!-- chunk -->

### brain is unique.

<!-- chunk -->

### Everything that you hear, see, smell, taste and touch is processed in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain with electrochemical messengers. These messengers are

<!-- chunk -->

## neurotransmitters.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dozens of amino acids, amines, hormones, minerals, peptides and purines

<!-- chunk -->

### act as neurotransmitters. Influencing alertness, cognition, memory, and

<!-- chunk -->

### mood. But investigating all of these neurotransmitters is not necessary for

<!-- chunk -->

### our purposes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Instead, a brief explanation of some of the important neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### will help you understand how the nootropic supplements discussed in this

<!-- chunk -->

### book affect your cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend you use this chapter as a reference. When you find a

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic supplement later in this book that you find helpful, refer back to

<!-- chunk -->

### this section to learn more about its chemistry and function in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## The two most common neurotransmitters in your brain are glutamate and

<!-- chunk -->

## GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid). Other crucial neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

## include acetylcholine, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine,

<!-- chunk -->

## melatonin and serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s start with a review of the two most abundant neurotransmitters in

<!-- chunk -->

## your brain; glutamate and Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA).

# Glutamate

<!-- chunk -->

## Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glutamate is stored in synaptic vesicles. And when an electrical impulse is

<!-- chunk -->

### sent down the axon by the neuron, glutamate is released from the

<!-- chunk -->

### presynaptic neuron.

<!-- chunk -->

### At the receiving, or post-synaptic neuron, glutamate binds to glutamate

<!-- chunk -->

## receptors like NMDA or AMPA receptors which are then activated.

<!-- chunk -->

### Constant or frequent activation of glutamate receptors strengthen these

<!-- chunk -->

## interconnected synaptic networks. And contributes to the neuroplasticity

<!-- chunk -->

## and long-term potentiation associated with cognitive functions like

<!-- chunk -->

### learning and memory.7

<!-- chunk -->

### Too much glutamate, or overly sensitive glutamate receptors can cause

<!-- chunk -->

### cell damage or cell death. And lead to restlessness, irritability, insomnia

<!-- chunk -->

### and even seizures. Scientists have discovered that NMDA receptors in

<!-- chunk -->

### people with Huntington’s Disease are overactivated by glutamate.

<!-- chunk -->

### You get glutamate from foods like meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy

<!-- chunk -->

### products. Glutamate does not easily cross your blood-brain barrier. So,

<!-- chunk -->

### must be transported across by the high-affinity transport system.

<!-- chunk -->

## Glutamate is a precursor for the synthesis of the inhibitory

<!-- chunk -->

## neurotransmitter Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA).

# GABA

<!-- chunk -->

## GABA (γ-Aminobutyric acid) is the most abundant inhibitory

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter in your brain. Neurons that produce GABA are known as

<!-- chunk -->

### GABAergic neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA does not easily cross the blood-brain barrier. But instead, is

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesized in your brain from the neurotransmitter glutamate using the

<!-- chunk -->

### enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and pyridoxal-5-phosphate

<!-- chunk -->

### (Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### or P-5-P) as a cofactor.

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA’s primary role in your brain is to keep glutamate in check. Too

<!-- chunk -->

### much glutamate can cause a seizure. And too much GABA can put in you

<!-- chunk -->

### in coma. An optimized brain has a healthy balance of both GABA and


<!-- chunk -->

### GABA helps reduce anxiety, insomnia, nervousness, restlessness and

<!-- chunk -->

### stress. When you take GABA as a supplement it can even increase human

<!-- chunk -->

### growth hormone.8

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA receptors are stimulated by barbiturates and benzodiazepines which

<!-- chunk -->

### result in relaxation. And a reduction of irritability and stress. Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders like epilepsy, sleep disorders and Parkinson’s disease are

<!-- chunk -->

### affected by GABA.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha, Lemon Balm, Passionflower, Valerian root, Ginseng, Kava,

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Theanine, green, black and oolong tea help increase the effect of GABA

<!-- chunk -->

## on its receptors. The nootropic GABA is either synthetically formed and

<!-- chunk -->

## naturally-grown (PharmaGABA) GABA which helps increase GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### levels in your brain.

# Acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetylcholine (ACh) was the very first neurotransmitter to be identified.

<!-- chunk -->

### Discovered in 1915 by British physiologist Sir Henry Hallett Dale who

<!-- chunk -->

### later shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology Medicine with Otto Loewi in

<!-- chunk -->

### 1936.

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetylcholine is made from choline and a two-carbon molecule called

<!-- chunk -->

### acetyl. It is synthesized in cholinergic neurons in your brain and body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetylcholine binds and activates two classes of receptors: muscarinic and

<!-- chunk -->

### nicotinic.

<!-- chunk -->

### You have two types of nicotinic receptors in your body: muscle-type and

<!-- chunk -->

### neuronal-type. The muscle-type receptors are on muscle cells and are used

<!-- chunk -->

### to activate skeletal muscles and signal a body movement.

<!-- chunk -->

### The neuronal-type receptors have acetylcholine acting as a

<!-- chunk -->

### neuromodulator. Affecting attention, learning and memory. Once it is

<!-- chunk -->

### produced, acetylcholine is stored in cholinergic neurons and released into

<!-- chunk -->

### the synaptic cleft when stimulated by an electrical signal.

<!-- chunk -->

### When acetylcholine is released in the synaptic cleft, the enzyme

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholinesterase breaks acetylcholine back down into choline and

<!-- chunk -->

### acetyl.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s patients have a shortage of acetylcholine. And one of the

<!-- chunk -->

### ways doctors increase levels of ACh is to inhibit the acetylcholinesterase

<!-- chunk -->

### enzyme with prescription drugs. Leaving more acetylcholine available for

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Too much acetylcholine can result in continuous stimulation of muscles,

<!-- chunk -->

### glands, and your central nervous system. Which can even result in fatal

<!-- chunk -->

### convulsions. For example, nerve agents like Sarin gas act as

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and are used in chemical warfare.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Black Widow Spider has a similar effect to Sarin in that it inhibits

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholinesterase. The venom causes a massive release of

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine, norepinephrine and GABA. Causing cramps, fast pulse,

<!-- chunk -->

### pain, and sweating.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nootropic supplements like Alpha GPC and CDP-Choline can boost levels

<!-- chunk -->

### of acetylcholine. Which is particularly important when using racetams

<!-- chunk -->

### like Piracetam that modulates AMPA and NMDA receptors. Piracetam also

<!-- chunk -->

### improves the flow of acetylcholine, and the sensitivity of ACh receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A is used a nootropic because it acts as an acetylcholinesterase

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibitor which boosts the use of acetylcholine in your brain. Improving

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, cognition and lucid dreaming.

# Dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### Dopamine is an amine synthesized from its precursor L-DOPA in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. It belongs to the catecholamine family of neurotransmitters which

<!-- chunk -->

### include epinephrine and norepinephrine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dopamine must be synthesized in dopaminergic neurons in your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### from L-DOPA because it can’t cross the blood-brain barrier on its own.

<!-- chunk -->

### The primary pathway for dopamine synthesis is L-Phenylalanine → L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine → L-DOPA → Dopamine. You get the first two amino acids in

<!-- chunk -->

### this pathway from protein-rich foods like eggs, chicken, liver, beer, milk,

<!-- chunk -->

### and soybeans.

<!-- chunk -->

### Boosting dopamine levels in your brain leads to better mood, alertness,

<!-- chunk -->

### sex drive and even heightened verbal fluency and creativity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dopamine also controls muscle movement by modulating motor centers in

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain (e.g. basal ganglia) and may also regulate movement by

<!-- chunk -->

### directly controlling motoneuron function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dopamine in your brain binds to dopamine receptors of which there are 5-

<!-- chunk -->

### types numbered D


<!-- chunk -->

### – D


<!-- chunk -->

### . After dopamine is synthesized in the neuron, it is

<!-- chunk -->

### transported to and stored in vesicles until it is ejected in the synaptic cleft.

<!-- chunk -->

### Upon arrival at the post-synaptic neuron, dopamine binds to and activates

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine receptors located on dendrites of that neuron. Or presynaptic

<!-- chunk -->

### auto-receptors which are located on the axon of the presynaptic neuron.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once dopamine activates the receptor, it is released back into the synaptic

<!-- chunk -->

## cleft where it’s broken down by the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO).

<!-- chunk -->

### Bookmark that last sentence in your brain because many prescription

<!-- chunk -->

### drugs take advantage of that MAO action. Certain drugs block the activity

<!-- chunk -->

## of MAO and are known as MAO inhibitors (MAOIs).

<!-- chunk -->

### There are two types of MAO inhibitors – type-A and type-B. Both can act

<!-- chunk -->

### as antidepressants, and type-B inhibitors are also used to treat Parkinson’s


<!-- chunk -->

### A decline in dopamine in your brain can lead to learning and memory

<!-- chunk -->

### problems, low sex drive, anxiety, or depression. And worst-case is

<!-- chunk -->

### movement problems like in Parkinson’s Disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Later in this book we’ll explore the nootropics that influence or can boost

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine levels in your brain.

# Epinephrine & Norepinephrine

<!-- chunk -->

### The amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine are converted into dopamine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dopamine can then be converted into norepinephrine, and then

<!-- chunk -->

## epinephrine.

<!-- chunk -->

### When you take tyrosine as a supplement or get it from food, you can

<!-- chunk -->

### elevate dopamine and norepinephrine levels. Which leads to a boost in

<!-- chunk -->

### alertness and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Too much of these neurotransmitters can elevate blood pressure, heart rate,

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, irritability and insomnia. Some prescription antidepressants

<!-- chunk -->

### improve mood and boost arousal by increasing levels of epinephrine and

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Several enzymes are required to convert phenylalanine all the way through

<!-- chunk -->

### the dopamine pathway to epinephrine. And these enzymes require

<!-- chunk -->

### cofactors like the B-Vitamins and other nutrients.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, L-DOPA is converted to dopamine with Vitamin B

6,


<!-- chunk -->

### as cofactors. Dopamine is converted to norepinephrine with Vitamin C

<!-- chunk -->

### as a cofactor. And norepinephrine requires SAM-e to convert to

<!-- chunk -->

### epinephrine.

# Serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin (5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter. Serotonin is

<!-- chunk -->

## synthesized from 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) with Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### as a

<!-- chunk -->

### cofactor. And 5-HTP comes from the synthesis of Tryptophan which you

<!-- chunk -->

### get from meat, fish, and other protein foods.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once serotonin is synthesized in your brain, your pineal gland can use it to

<!-- chunk -->

## produce melatonin which is used to govern your circadian rhythm and

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep cycles.

<!-- chunk -->

### We have a ton of research to draw on for serotonin because it affects such

<!-- chunk -->

### a vast range of psychological and biological functions. A team at the

<!-- chunk -->

### Cleveland Clinic first discovered serotonin in 1948.

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin regulates or is otherwise involved in anxiety, arousal,

<!-- chunk -->

### aggression, mood and cognition. Recall that we referred to dopamine and

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine earlier in this chapter, and their effects on arousal and

<!-- chunk -->

### mood. Serotonin produces similar effects in your brain but works

<!-- chunk -->

### differently than the other catecholamines.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, serotonin receptors modulate the release of several

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters including glutamate, GABA, dopamine, norepinephrine,

<!-- chunk -->

### epinephrine and acetylcholine. Which would account for some of

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin’s similar effects like that of dopamine and norepinephrine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Where they differ is too much serotonin can cause relaxation, sedation,

<!-- chunk -->

### and decreased sex drive. And can also cause aggression and anger.

<!-- chunk -->

### The antidepressant fluoxetine (Prozac®) is a selective serotonin reuptake

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibitor (SSRI) and acts to raise serotonin levels in the brain. Maybe even

<!-- chunk -->

### influencing other neurotransmitters in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) prevent the breakdown of

<!-- chunk -->

### monoamine neurotransmitters (including serotonin) and increase

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrations of neurotransmitters in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The nootropic 5-HTP is an immediate precursor to serotonin, and in some

<!-- chunk -->

### cases, can be used instead of SSRI’s. L-Tryptophan and St. John’s wort can

<!-- chunk -->

### also boost serotonin levels in the brain. And are often used as an

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant.

<!-- chunk -->

### When the serotonergic system gets out-of-whack, it can lead to anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, improper social behavior and sexual problems. Other problems

<!-- chunk -->

### with serotonin in the brain include insomnia, obesity, eating disorders and

<!-- chunk -->

### even chronic pain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Low serotonin levels can be caused by not getting enough of its precursor

<!-- chunk -->

### tryptophan from food. And for tryptophan to be transported across the

<!-- chunk -->

### blood-brain barrier, it needs a carrier protein.

<!-- chunk -->

### The problem is that carrier protein is also used by other amino acids that

<!-- chunk -->

### need to cross into your brain. Including amino acids like phenylalanine

<!-- chunk -->

### and tyrosine which convert in your brain to dopamine and norepinephrine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Imagine this carrier as a very small boat that can only carry one person

<!-- chunk -->

### across the lake at a time. There is always competition for amino acids to

<!-- chunk -->

### jump on that little boat to get to your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### So, brain levels of tryptophan are not only determined by levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### tryptophan in your bloodstream. But also, by the concentration of

<!-- chunk -->

### competing amino acids trying to get across and into your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## You can supplement with L-Tryptophan to boost serotonin levels. Or its

<!-- chunk -->

## direct precursor 5-HTP. You can also use the nootropic Cat’s Claw which

<!-- chunk -->

### can also boost tryptophan levels which in turn can increase serotonin.

# Improve Your Memory with Nootropics

<!-- chunk -->

### Looking for an edge to advance your career? How about more confidence

<!-- chunk -->

### and an easier time preparing for and writing that next exam. Preparing that

<!-- chunk -->

### next presentation. Or improving your mood and motivation to help your

<!-- chunk -->

### relationships.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nootropic supplements can help improve:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Alertness

<!-- chunk -->

### •Arousal, libido, and sexual enjoyment

<!-- chunk -->

### •Awareness, vision, hearing and sensory perception

<!-- chunk -->

### •Concentration and focus

<!-- chunk -->

### •Creativity and thinking outside-the-box

<!-- chunk -->

### •Complex problem-solving abilities

<!-- chunk -->

### •Learning and memory

<!-- chunk -->

### •Mood, energy and vitality

<!-- chunk -->

### •Speed of cognition and reaction time

<!-- chunk -->

### •Verbal fluency

<!-- chunk -->

### Research over the last couple of decades has shown that our brain has the

<!-- chunk -->

### remarkable ability to re-wire itself throughout life. Meaning we can not

<!-- chunk -->

### only retain our memories and stabilize our mood. But we now have the

<!-- chunk -->

### knowledge and ability to improve memory and boost mood while taming

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### These may sound like lofty promises. But I’m living proof along with

<!-- chunk -->

### thousands of others that improved cognition, better memory and mood,

<!-- chunk -->

### and an overall better quality of life is possible with nootropic


<!-- chunk -->

### Here I’ll touch on some of what’s happening in your brain. And how

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics can help optimize brain function.

# Types of Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists have identified several distinct types of memory. Including

<!-- chunk -->

### short- and long-term memory and working memory. Let’s look at each

<!-- chunk -->

### type with a brief explanation of what they are and how they work in

<!-- chunk -->

### everyday life.

<!-- chunk -->

## Short-Term Memory is also known as primary or active memory. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### characterized as being very brief (i.e., seconds), and is limited to what you

<!-- chunk -->

### can remember and retain for 20 to 30 seconds.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain can only retain new information to a certain extant (chunk

<!-- chunk -->

### capacity) and only temporarily (temporal capacity). Short-term memory

<!-- chunk -->

### includes things like thinking on your feet, making quick decisions, verbal

<!-- chunk -->

### fluidity, humor, and reaction time.

<!-- chunk -->

### Short-term memory can be improved with certain nootropics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetylcholine precursors like Alpha GPC and CDP-Choline, Kava,

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea, Phosphatidylserine (PS), and Nicotine have been shown

<!-- chunk -->

### to help alertness, focus, short-term memory and mental clarity.

<!-- chunk -->

## Long-Term Memory describes the type of memory associated with an

<!-- chunk -->

### event or information acquired by your mind long ago. It could be

<!-- chunk -->

### anywhere from a couple of days to a lifetime.

<!-- chunk -->

### These memories are often pieced together by the brain with inaccurate or

<!-- chunk -->

### imagined information. This memory storage can come from your

<!-- chunk -->

### perception of an event or thing, conditioning, or any other accurate or

<!-- chunk -->

### faulty input.

<!-- chunk -->

## Long-term memory relies on long-term potentiation (LTP) and the

<!-- chunk -->

### strengthening of connections between neurons and synapses. LTP relies

<!-- chunk -->

## upon brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). A naturally occurring

<!-- chunk -->

### protein in your brain that is responsible for the growth, maintenance, and

<!-- chunk -->

### survival of neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### When BDNF is released in your brain, new connections form as BDNF

<!-- chunk -->

### attracts dendrites from neurons and connects them to neighboring

<!-- chunk -->

### synapses. As your brain cells fire together, they wire together. These tiny

<!-- chunk -->

### networks in your brain are how long-term memories consolidate and form.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nootropics to boost BDNF include Ashwagandha, Bacopa Monnieri, DHA,

<!-- chunk -->

### Gotu Kola, L-Theanine, Magnesium, N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC), Noopept,

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea, Pterostilbene, Resveratrol and Turmeric.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nootropics to boost long-term memory include Oat Straw, Nicotine,

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam, L-Glutamine, Forskolin, Tryptophan, Vinpocetine,

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol, Pterostilbene, Phosphatidylserine (PS), Phosphatidylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### (PC), Pramiracetam, Phenylpiracetam, Piracetam, Picamilon, Oxiracetam,

<!-- chunk -->

### N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC), Noopept, L-Theanine, L-Dopa, Magnesium,

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginseng, Huperzine-A, Lion’s Mane Mushroom, Coluracetam, and

<!-- chunk -->

### Artichoke Extract.

<!-- chunk -->

## Working Memory is distinct from short- and long-term memory. These

<!-- chunk -->

### are memories that are not only remembered, but simultaneously

<!-- chunk -->

### processed. You not only remember information that is important to you.

<!-- chunk -->

### You also remember the purpose of the information, and why you decided

<!-- chunk -->

### to remember it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Working memory uses different parts of your brain compared to short- and

<!-- chunk -->

### long-term memory. Researchers have identified activation in the prefrontal

<!-- chunk -->

### cortex, and other parts of the brain. Calling this model of brain

<!-- chunk -->

### computation FROST (short for FROntal-Striatal-Thalamic).9

<!-- chunk -->

## Nootropics to boost working memory performance include Gotu Kola,

<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam, Creatine, Ginseng, Kava, Nicotine, L-Tyrosine, N-Acetyl L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine (NALT), NADH, N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC), Piracetam,

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine, Phosphatidylcholine (PC), Phosphatidylserine (PS),

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene, Turmeric, and Tryptophan.

<!-- chunk -->

### Each form of memory calls on specific pathways in your brain. Select

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroreceptors including AMPA receptors and NDMA receptors are

<!-- chunk -->

### involved in memory. Gene expression in the cellular nucleus. Brain-

<!-- chunk -->

### Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), long-term potentiation, human

<!-- chunk -->

### nerve growth factor, neurogenesis, and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is we have control over how our memory works. And many

<!-- chunk -->

### natural nootropics to help boost and maintain the efficiency of these neural

<!-- chunk -->

### networks.

<!-- chunk -->

### Memory and mood are complex subjects and each worthy of a book on

<!-- chunk -->

### their own. But instead of turning this into a book about neuroscience, let’s

<!-- chunk -->

### stay with how you can use nootropics to optimize cognition and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### The next chapter goes into much more detail on how each nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### featured in this book works, what it is, where it comes from, available

<!-- chunk -->

### forms, and dosage recommendations.

<!-- chunk -->

### For each nootropic, I also reference several clinical studies that support

<!-- chunk -->

### what neurohackers say about their experience with that nootropic.


# LIST OF NOOTROPICS

# Acetyl-L-Carnitine

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetyl-L-Carnitine may reverse age-related cognitive decline, and improve

<!-- chunk -->

### memory

<!-- chunk -->

## Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR, ALC or LAC) is a synthesized version of L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Carnitine. Which is a derivative of the amino acids lysine and methionine.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnitine is an amino acid that’s synthesized in your body. You also get

<!-- chunk -->

### it from red meat and dairy.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnitine is considered a “conditionally essential” nutrient because

<!-- chunk -->

### when your body uses it faster than it can produce it, you need

<!-- chunk -->

### supplemental L-Carnitine either from food or a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnitine is used throughout your body. Here we’re talking about the

<!-- chunk -->

## Acetyl-L-Carnitine form of L-Carnitine because of its effects on brain

<!-- chunk -->

### health and chemistry.

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Carnitine vs. Acetyl-L-Carnitine: What’s the Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnitine and Acetyl-L-Carnitine are often referred to as Carnitine. But

<!-- chunk -->

### each are structurally different, and each has its advantages.

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Carnitine: Can help increase energy production within mitochondria in

<!-- chunk -->

### your cells but is not capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplemental L-Carnitine is difficult for your body to absorb; only 18% of

<!-- chunk -->

### it reaches your bloodstream.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnitine is favored by athletes and dieters who want Carnitine’s fat-

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolizing benefits. But are not seeking any brain benefits.

<!-- chunk -->

## Acetyl-L-Carnitine: Is easier to absorb and use by your body than L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Carnitine. One study showed using 2 grams daily for 50 days boosted

<!-- chunk -->

### blood ALCAR levels by 43%.10

<!-- chunk -->

## ALCAR does everything that L-Carnitine does but can also cross the

<!-- chunk -->

### blood-brain barrier. In another study, researchers found that ALCAR

<!-- chunk -->

### protects brain cells from oxidative stress, while L-Carnitine does not.11

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Acetyl-L-Carnitine Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetyl-L-Carnitine boosts brain health and function in several ways. But


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.ALCAR boosts acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter tied to memory

<!-- chunk -->

### and overall brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetyl-L-Carnitine is a precursor to acetylcholine in the presence of

<!-- chunk -->

### Coenzyme-A. ALCAR donates a “methyl group” to make

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine.12

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s-diseased brains show a 25% to 40% reduction in carnitine

<!-- chunk -->

### acetyltransferase, a brain enzyme that works with L-Carnitine & Acetyl-

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnitine.

<!-- chunk -->

### This brain enzyme decline led researchers to link low ALCAR with low

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine, and Alzheimer’s onset. They went on to suggest ALCAR as

<!-- chunk -->

### a viable therapy for brain regeneration.13

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.ALCAR promotes brain energy by helping increase fuel production

<!-- chunk -->

### in your brain cell’s mitochondria.14

<!-- chunk -->

### ALCAR works as a shuttle transport for fatty acids through cell

<!-- chunk -->

## membranes. And into mitochondria.15

<!-- chunk -->

### •ALCAR shuttles fatty acids into mitochondria which contributes to

<!-- chunk -->

### adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, and which is your most

<!-- chunk -->

### fundamental source of energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### •ALCAR also shuttles fatty acids out of mitochondria, and helps

<!-- chunk -->

### flush out toxic byproducts.

<!-- chunk -->

### ALCAR supplies fatty acids for mitochondrial energy production in nearly

<!-- chunk -->

### every cell of your body. Your brain consumes at least 20% of your body’s

<!-- chunk -->

### energy. And generates a lot of toxic byproducts. So ALCAR is particularly

<!-- chunk -->

### important for a healthy brain.


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, our brain chemistry and energy metabolism changes.16

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Nerve growth factor in the brain declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Acetyl-L-Carnitine levels decline


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Mitochondria lose efficiency


<!-- chunk -->

## ALCAR benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Research from the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University

<!-- chunk -->

### shows that Acetyl-L-Carnitine will:17

<!-- chunk -->

### •Restore efficient mitochondrial energy production

<!-- chunk -->

### •Replenish age-related changes to mitochondrial structure

<!-- chunk -->

### •Replenish ALCAR and acetylcholine levels in the brain and body

<!-- chunk -->

### ALCAR has the ability to boost acetylcholine and rejuvenate brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### (including mitochondria). This has been proven to benefit those with age-

<!-- chunk -->

### related brain diseases like Alzheimer’s and major depression.18

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Acetyl-L-Carnitine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### You may not feel ALCAR… unless you’re elderly or have Erectile

<!-- chunk -->

### Dysfunction. Within those specific groups, Acetyl-L-Carnitine helps with

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, mood, mental performance and the ability to get and maintain an

<!-- chunk -->

### erection.

<!-- chunk -->

### ALCAR’s brain support and its ability to help create ATP in mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### in your brain cells should boost cognition in all age and gender groups.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, ALCAR user reviews report a boost in energy and quick

<!-- chunk -->

### thinking.


<!-- chunk -->

## In one study, researchers showed that ALCAR may have positive effects

<!-- chunk -->

### for depression and dementia.19

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study out of Italy; researchers showed that Acetyl-L-Carnitine

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulated the growth of new neurites. More of these minute projections

<!-- chunk -->

## from nerve cell bodies meant increased signaling between cells

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).20

<!-- chunk -->

## ALCAR helps with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)

<!-- chunk -->

### A gold-standard double-blind, randomized controlled trial on 1,204 people

<!-- chunk -->

### showed a significant effect on attention, mental performance, memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### higher mental functions.21

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study ALCAR seemed to ward off further brain deterioration. And

<!-- chunk -->

### could be considered as therapy for brain degeneration.

<!-- chunk -->

## Acetyl-L-Carnitine slows rate of cognitive decline

<!-- chunk -->

### 130 Alzheimer’s patients were given ALCAR or a placebo daily for a year.

<!-- chunk -->

### They were tested across 14 points of cognitive performance.

<!-- chunk -->

### This research showed a slower decline in cognitive performance with the

<!-- chunk -->

### ALCAR group compared to the placebo group.22

<!-- chunk -->

## ALCAR effective for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetyl-L-Carnitine has been shown to improve fatigue in patients with

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic fatigue syndrome.

<!-- chunk -->

### In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study; 36 people were treated for

<!-- chunk -->

### 3 months with either amantadine (used to treat Chronic Fatigue), or

<!-- chunk -->

### gram of ALCAR twice daily.

<!-- chunk -->

### The results of the study showed that ALCAR was better tolerated and more

<!-- chunk -->

### effective than the pharmaceutical for fatigue.23

<!-- chunk -->

## Acetyl-L-Carnitine protects from oxidative damage of Ecstasy

# (MDMA)

<!-- chunk -->

### Research has shown ALCAR to be effective in protecting your

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria from oxidative stress. And the use of MDMA can cause

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidative damage in mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, male rats were given Acetyl-L-Carnitine before a dose of

<!-- chunk -->

### Ecstasy (MDMA). ALCAR pretreatment “exerts effective neuroprotection

<!-- chunk -->

### against MDMA-induced neurotoxicity at the mitochondrial level”, said the

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers.24

<!-- chunk -->

### Keep that in mind before your next party.

<!-- chunk -->

## ALCAR for Erectile Dysfunction

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, 120 patients were split into 3 groups. Group 1 was given

<!-- chunk -->

### mg of testosterone per day. The 2nd group was given 2 grams of Propionyl-

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnitine plus 2 grams of Acetyl-L-Carnitine per day. And the 3rd group

<!-- chunk -->

### a placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

## Did you know that there’s an International Index of Erectile Function?

<!-- chunk -->

### Turns out the Propionyl-L-Carnitine/Acetyl-L-Carnitine stack was better

<!-- chunk -->

### than testosterone for erectile dysfunction. Without the side effects of an

<!-- chunk -->

### enlarged prostate, better organisms, more sexual desire, and improved

<!-- chunk -->

### mood.25


<!-- chunk -->

### •Acetyl-L-Carnitine suggested dosage for cognitive benefit is 1 –

<!-- chunk -->

### grams per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### •For improved mood and elimination of chronic fatigue, 1 – 3 grams

<!-- chunk -->

### of ALCAR per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### •For age-related memory concerns, 1 – 2 grams of ALCAR per day.


<!-- chunk -->

### Acetyl-L-Carnitine is produced naturally in your body. So is considered

<!-- chunk -->

### well-tolerated and safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects are rare but can include nausea, vomiting, increased agitation,

<!-- chunk -->

### weight loss, and restlessness.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can also experience an increase in seizure frequency if you have any

<!-- chunk -->

### kind of seizure disorder.


<!-- chunk -->

## •Acetyl-L-Carnitine: L-Carnitine with an extra acetyl group. This

<!-- chunk -->

### version is more bioavailable and easily crosses the blood-brain

<!-- chunk -->

### barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

## •L-Carnitine: This is the standard form of carnitine found in food.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Lipo-Carn®: A proprietary blend of Alpha-Lipoic Acid and Acetyl-

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnitine. Studies show this combination is a powerful anti-aging

<!-- chunk -->

### duo.

<!-- chunk -->

### Together, these two help combat diabetes, boost energy production,

<!-- chunk -->

### maintain proper cognitive function, protects the body from radiation

<!-- chunk -->

### and chemical toxins, and helps immunity.26

<!-- chunk -->

## •Propionyl-L-Carnitine: L-Carnitine combined with propionic acid.

<!-- chunk -->

### This form is noted for its antioxidant activity and is used for heart

<!-- chunk -->

### health applications. Also useful for erectile dysfunction.


<!-- chunk -->

## Acetyl-L-Carnitine 500 – 1,500 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Acetyl-L-Carnitine as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does synthesize some ALCAR on its own. And from the food

<!-- chunk -->

### you eat. But most Acetyl-L-Carnitine comes from red meat. And unless

<!-- chunk -->

### you eat a lot of high-quality grass-fed beef or mutton…

<!-- chunk -->

### ALCAR is especially helpful for those suffering from age-related

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive decline. Studies show it helps stop or reverse brain degeneration

<!-- chunk -->

### with Alzheimer’s Disease, and depressive disorders. Particularly in the

<!-- chunk -->

### initial stages of the disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest starting with a dose of 500 mg daily. ALCAR is a great

<!-- chunk -->

### compliment to a stack including Piracetam. Add a choline source (Alpha

<!-- chunk -->

### GPC or CDP-Choline) typically at a ratio of 1:4. 1 gram of CDP-Choline

<!-- chunk -->

### to 4 grams of Piracetam. Take just enough choline to eliminate a racetam-

<!-- chunk -->

### induced headache. Then add 500 mg of ALCAR.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some have found ALCAR stacked with Coenzyme Q-10 has a profound

<!-- chunk -->

### effect on everything from mood to bipolar disorder. Especially combined

<!-- chunk -->

### with Alpha-Lipoic Acid.

<!-- chunk -->

### Age-related cognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s may want to up the dose

<!-- chunk -->

### to 1,500 mg per day.


# Alpha GPC

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC has been shown to reverse age-related cognitive decline,

<!-- chunk -->

### improve memory and learning, and boost athletic workouts

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha GPC (L-Alpha Glycerylphosphorylcholine, choline alfoscerate) is a

<!-- chunk -->

### choline source derived from soy or sunflower lecithin.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is also naturally present in small amounts in your body. You can also get

<!-- chunk -->

### it from eating organ meats, dairy and wheat germ.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline is considered an essential nutrient because when your body uses it

<!-- chunk -->

### faster than it can produce it, you need supplemental choline either from

<!-- chunk -->

### food or a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### You need choline for synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. And

<!-- chunk -->

### is part of phosphatidylcholine (PC), used in building cell membranes.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, choline is so vital to cognition and nerve function that, without it,

<!-- chunk -->

### we couldn’t move, think, sleep or remember anything.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC is used throughout your body. It even helps the production of

<!-- chunk -->

### human growth hormone. Athletes use it for peak performance, and to help

<!-- chunk -->

### build lean muscle mass. It provides more energy for a workout and quicker

<!-- chunk -->

### recovery.27

<!-- chunk -->

### Here we’re talking about how Alpha GPC affects your brain health and

<!-- chunk -->

### chemistry.

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha GPC vs. CDP-Choline vs. Choline Bitartrate: What’s the

<!-- chunk -->

## Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline is a water-soluble nutrient, and its composition is similar to B-

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamins. Alpha GPC, CDP-Choline, Choline Citrate and Choline

<!-- chunk -->

### Bitartrate are all sources of choline.

<!-- chunk -->

## CDP-Choline (cytidine 5′-diphosphocholine): Is only about 18% choline

<!-- chunk -->

### by weight. Your body naturally synthesizes choline into CDP-Choline

<!-- chunk -->

## (Citicoline). It’s then converted to phosphatidylcholine (PC) which assists

<!-- chunk -->

## cell membranes and helps create acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Choline Bitartrate: An economical form of choline, and about 40%

<!-- chunk -->

### choline by weight. 1 gram of Choline Bitartrate offers 400 mg of actual

<!-- chunk -->

### choline. It does not easily cross the blood-brain barrier. So, you won’t

<!-- chunk -->

### experience the same level of nootropic benefit as with Alpha GPC or CDP-

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline.

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha GPC: About 40% choline by weight and easily crosses the blood-

<!-- chunk -->

### brain barrier. Alpha GPC naturally occurs in your brain as a byproduct of

<!-- chunk -->

## phosphatidylcholine (PC). When your brain needs more choline, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### choline floating around in your brain is running low, it breaks down PC

<!-- chunk -->

### from cell membranes. And turns it into Alpha GPC.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body and brain love it when you use Alpha GPC. Because it doesn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### have to cannibalize its own cells to get more choline.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Alpha GPC Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Alpha GPC boosts acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter tied to memory

<!-- chunk -->

### and overall brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC is a precursor to acetylcholine. Improving the efficiency

<!-- chunk -->

### of communication between neurons in your brain. This increase in

<!-- chunk -->

### neural signaling boosts memory, learning, cognitive processing and

<!-- chunk -->

### mental clarity.

<!-- chunk -->

## In one study, 32 healthy volunteers received either Alpha GPC or a

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo as a pretreatment. Ten days later they were injected with

<!-- chunk -->

### scopolamine to induce amnesia. The researchers found Alpha GPC was

<!-- chunk -->

### able to prevent the impairment of attention and memory normally caused

<!-- chunk -->

### by scopolamine.28

<!-- chunk -->

### These researchers showed that memory function in young healthy people

<!-- chunk -->

### could improved. Simply by taking Alpha GPC as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.Alpha GPC directly impacts development of cell membranes in the

<!-- chunk -->

### cerebral cortex. This outer layer of neural tissues or “gray matter” is

<!-- chunk -->

### the information processing center of your brain. It controls

<!-- chunk -->

### intelligence, motor function, organization, personality, planning and

<!-- chunk -->

### touch.29

<!-- chunk -->

### Published in Clinical Therapeutics, researchers conducted a double-blind,

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo-controlled trial with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s patients.

<!-- chunk -->

### mg capsules were administered 3- times per day for 180 days. The

<!-- chunk -->

### conclusion of this trial showed consistent improvement in dementia

<!-- chunk -->

### patients given Alpha GPC.30


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Acetylcholine levels decline31

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Nerve growth factor in the brain declines


<!-- chunk -->

### But even if you’re not concerned with the effects of aging, Alpha GPC can

<!-- chunk -->

### help.

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha GPC benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Research from hundreds of studies have shown that Alpha GPC will:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improve memory and learning ability32

<!-- chunk -->

### •Restore the bioavailability of acetylcholine33

<!-- chunk -->

### •Restore and boost nerve growth factor receptors in the brain34

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increase growth hormone in all age groups35

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boost cognitive performance and memory in Alzheimer’s patients36

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC is water-soluble and quickly enters your brain after you take it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once in your brain, it boosts signal transmission, and protects neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC improves your brain function and learning processes by

<!-- chunk -->

### directly increasing synthesis and secretion of acetylcholine. As your body

<!-- chunk -->

### calls for it.

<!-- chunk -->

### This form of choline is not a precursor to phosphatidylcholine (PC), but is

<!-- chunk -->

## a metabolite of PC. This means once PC is metabolized and stripped of its

<!-- chunk -->

### fatty acids – all that remains is Alpha GPC.

<!-- chunk -->

### Instead of scavenging your brain’s own membranes for Alpha GPC, you

<!-- chunk -->

### give it exactly the type of choline its looking for.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Alpha GPC feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have trouble getting started in the morning, try coffee and 400 mg of

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC. Instead of your usual high sugar, high carbohydrate breakfast.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC can be a great way to boost your energy. Take it 45 minutes

<!-- chunk -->

### before you work out.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC helps with memory, mood, mental performance and energy. Its

<!-- chunk -->

### brain support and ability to fuel the acetylcholine in your brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### should boost cognition in all age and gender groups.


<!-- chunk -->

### In one study, researchers showed that Alpha GPC had positive effects for

<!-- chunk -->

## increasing human growth hormone.37

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha GPC increases the release of dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

## Another trial demonstrated an increase in the release of dopamine.38 This

<!-- chunk -->

### is particularly significant in showing Alpha GPC can help those suffering

<!-- chunk -->

### from dopamine deficiencies. And alleviating the symptoms of diseases

<!-- chunk -->

### like depressive disorders, and Parkinson’s Disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha GPC facilitates learning and memory

<!-- chunk -->

### An ongoing trial demonstrates Alpha GPC improving memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### attention. This research shows Alpha GPC increasing the effectiveness of

<!-- chunk -->

### pairing it with donepezil (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor). Far better than

<!-- chunk -->

### using donepezil on its own.

<!-- chunk -->

### And in rats, Alpha GPC boosted learning and memory. It increased brain

<!-- chunk -->

### energy mechanisms and decreased age-related structural changes in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain.39,

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha GPC relieves cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### Thirteen published clinical trials, involving a total of 4,054 Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### patients consistently showed Alpha GPC:41

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boosted memory and attention

<!-- chunk -->

### •Promoted recovery in stroke patients

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reversed the symptoms of acute cerebrovascular disease

<!-- chunk -->

### •Is far more effective than using choline or lecithin in treating

<!-- chunk -->

### disease


<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC is about 40% choline by weight. So 1,000 mg of Alpha GPC

<!-- chunk -->

### provides approximately 400 mg of choline.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Alpha GPC suggested dosage for cognitive benefit is 400 – 1,200 mg


<!-- chunk -->

### •Athletic training suggested dosage of Alpha GPC is 400 mg first

<!-- chunk -->

### thing in the morning, and another 400 mg dose 15 – 30 minutes

<!-- chunk -->

### before working out.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Clinical treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease, dementia and other

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive disorders dosage of up to 1,200 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### For higher dosages, split the daily Alpha GPC total into 2 or 3 doses per

<!-- chunk -->

### day. For example, 1,200 mg would be taken 400 mg at a time.


<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC is produced naturally in your body. So is considered well-

<!-- chunk -->

### tolerated and safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects are rare but can include fatigue, headaches, nervousness,

<!-- chunk -->

### nausea, diarrhea and gastrointestinal issues. This is often an indication you

<!-- chunk -->

### have too much choline in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because Alpha GPC causes an energy boost in many neurohackers, avoid

<!-- chunk -->

### dosing in the evening. Or you may find difficulty getting to sleep.


<!-- chunk -->

### Because Alpha GPC tends to liquefy at 99-100%, many suppliers offer

<!-- chunk -->

### 50% Alpha GPC powder combined with 50% of a filler like silicon

<!-- chunk -->

### dioxide. Adjust your dosage accordingly.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC is made from soy or sunflower lecithin. So if you’re trying to

<!-- chunk -->

### avoid soy in your diet look for Alpha-GPC “no soy” or labeled as derived

<!-- chunk -->

### from sunflower lecithin.


<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha GPC 400 – 1,200 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Alpha GPC as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does make some Alpha GPC on its own. And from the food you

<!-- chunk -->

### eat. But studies have shown we don’t get an adequate supply of choline

<!-- chunk -->

### from food sources in our modern diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC is especially helpful for those suffering from age-related

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive decline. Studies show it helps stop or reverse brain degeneration

<!-- chunk -->

### with Alzheimer’s Disease, and other cognitive disorders. Particularly in

<!-- chunk -->

### the early to mid-stages of the disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest starting with a dose of 400 mg daily. And Alpha GPC is a great

<!-- chunk -->

### compliment to a stack including any nootropic from the racetam-family.

<!-- chunk -->

### Anything that causes an increase in uptake of acetylcholine in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### You need to provide your brain with the choline it is demanding. Or it

<!-- chunk -->

### starts cannibalizing your own brain cells for more choline. Signs that your

<!-- chunk -->

### lacking adequate choline are headaches.

<!-- chunk -->

### Use Alpha GPC at a ratio of 1:4. For example, 400 mg of Alpha GPC to

<!-- chunk -->

### 1,600 mg of a racetam like Piracetam.

<!-- chunk -->

### Age-related cognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s may want to up the dose

<!-- chunk -->

### to 1,200 mg per day.


# Alpha-Lipoic Acid

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha-Lipoic Acid has been shown to boost acetylcholine, improve

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition and memory, and is a powerful antioxidant

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) is a sulfur-containing fatty acid naturally found

<!-- chunk -->

## in your body. Lipoic acid is unique among other antioxidants because it is

<!-- chunk -->

### both water- and fat-soluble.

<!-- chunk -->

## You get small amounts of lipoic acid in your diet from spinach and collard

<!-- chunk -->

### greens, broccoli, beef and organ meats.

<!-- chunk -->

### But lipoic acid declines in your body as you age. So you need to

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement with Alpha-Lipoic Acid to achieve the levels your body needs

<!-- chunk -->

### to run optimally.

<!-- chunk -->

### And because Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) is both water- and fat-soluble, it

<!-- chunk -->

### works in all parts of the human cell. The more lipoic acid you have in your

<!-- chunk -->

### system; the more antioxidant benefits you experience.

<!-- chunk -->

### You need alpha-lipoic acid’s antioxidant power. Because it regenerates

<!-- chunk -->

### other antioxidants that were depleted by the ongoing fight with free

<!-- chunk -->

## radicals in your cells. It allows you to use the antioxidants Vitamin C & E,

<!-- chunk -->

## glutathione and CoQ10 already in your body over and over again.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, alpha-lipoic acid is so efficient at what it does, it boosts the energy

<!-- chunk -->

## in your cells while reducing inflammation, and getting rid of heavy

<!-- chunk -->

## metals.

<!-- chunk -->

### In your brain, alpha-lipoic acid boosts the production of the

<!-- chunk -->

## neurotransmitter acetylcholine. And even increases glucose uptake in

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells. Providing you with a boost of mental energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha-Lipoic Acid is used throughout your body. It helps increase insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitivity which reduces the threat of diabetes. And ALA reduces the

<!-- chunk -->

### chances of metabolic syndrome which is associated with cardiovascular

<!-- chunk -->

### disease, diabetes and weight gain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha-Lipoic Acid vs. S-Lipoic Acid vs. R-Lipoic Acid

<!-- chunk -->

## Lipoic Acid is also known as Alpha-Lipoic Acid, ALA and Thioctic acid.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Alpha-Lipoic Acid you get as a supplement is usually a 50/50 mixture

<!-- chunk -->

## of R-(natural) and S-(unnatural) enantiomers. They are mirror images of

<!-- chunk -->

### each other and called a ‘racemic’ mixture.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most commercially available forms of Alpha-Lipoic Acid include the ‘S-

<!-- chunk -->

### form’, or unnatural form of lipoic acid. Chemically synthesized in 1952,

<!-- chunk -->

### and not found in nature.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is thought that the two enantiomers differ biologically. But much of the

<!-- chunk -->

### research done over the last 30 years has been with the racemic version of

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha-Lipoic Acid because the R-form was not commercially available.

<!-- chunk -->

## S-Lipoic Acid (the enantiomer not found in nature) may not produce the

<!-- chunk -->

### most essential properties of Lipoic Acid. Including interactions with

<!-- chunk -->

### proteins, enzymes and genes.

<!-- chunk -->

## R-Lipoic Acid is the form of lipoic acid occurring naturally in the human

<!-- chunk -->

### body, animals, and plants. This is the only form that functions as a co-

<!-- chunk -->

### factor for mitochondrial enzymes involved in energy production.

<!-- chunk -->

### Be aware that most commercially available forms of Alpha-Lipoic Acid

<!-- chunk -->

### include both S- and R-forms of lipoic acid.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha-Lipoic Acid is produced as a mixture because R-Lipoic Acid, when

<!-- chunk -->

### separated from the S-form, is very unstable. And deteriorates very quickly.

<!-- chunk -->

### Making it unusable as a dietary supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Very few companies go through the complicated, expensive process

<!-- chunk -->

## required to remove the synthetic S-ALA from R-ALA. So unless the bottle

<!-- chunk -->

### specifically states 100% R-ALA, you’re getting a 50/50 blend.

<!-- chunk -->

## Know that R-ALA may be up to 12 times more effective than S-ALA.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Alpha-Lipoic Acid Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha-Lipoic Acid boosts brain health and function in several ways. But


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Alpha-Lipoic Acid boosts acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter tied to

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and overall brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### ALA increases acetylcholine production by activation of choline

<!-- chunk -->

### acetyltransferase and increases glucose uptake. This process supplies

<!-- chunk -->

### more Acetyl-CoA for the production of acetylcholine.42

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.Alpha-Lipoic Acid is a promising weapon in the fight against

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxidative stress plays a key role in cognitive disorders because neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### are highly vulnerable to free radical damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### A recent study showed that lipoic acid may help slow down the

<!-- chunk -->

### progression of Alzheimer’s Disease. An area where no known cure has

<!-- chunk -->

### been produced by the big pharmaceutical companies.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, 43 patients with dementia were given 600 mg of Alpha-

<!-- chunk -->

### Lipoic Acid daily for 4 years. Researchers concluded from this study,

<!-- chunk -->

### “alpha-lipoic acid might be a successful ‘neuroprotective’ therapy option

<!-- chunk -->

### for Alzheimer’s disease.”43


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, our brain chemistry and metabolism changes.


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Oxidative (free radical) damage in neural cells

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Heavy metal accumulation in cells


<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases of aging, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s

<!-- chunk -->

### and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### But even if you’re not concerned with the effects of aging, Alpha-Lipoic

<!-- chunk -->

### Acid can help.

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha-Lipoic Acid benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Research from hundreds of studies have shown that Alpha-Lipoic Acid

<!-- chunk -->

### will:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increase the production of acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improve memory and learning ability

<!-- chunk -->

### •Restore the health of neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boost cognitive performance and memory in Alzheimer’s patients.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha-Lipoic Acid is both water- and fat-soluble and quickly crosses the

<!-- chunk -->

### blood-brain barrier after you take it.

<!-- chunk -->

### ALA improves your brain function and learning processes by directly

<!-- chunk -->

### increasing the production of acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha-Lipoic Acid also helps regenerate depleted antioxidants in your

<!-- chunk -->

### system including Vitamins C and E, glutathione and Coenzyme Q10.

<!-- chunk -->

### By reducing inflammation and heavy metals in your brain, you boost

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive processes and fluid thinking.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Alpha-Lipoic Acid feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### You may not feel ALA... unless you’re diabetic or have Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Within these specific groups, Alpha-Lipoic Acid helps with nerve pain,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, recall and mental performance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha-Lipoic Acid’s provides brain support because it has the ability to

<!-- chunk -->

### boost acetylcholine. So should boost cognition in all age and gender

<!-- chunk -->

### groups.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your entire body, even your DNA is under endless assault. This assault is

<!-- chunk -->

### caused by everything from poor diet to pollution. And your brain cells are

<!-- chunk -->

## getting hit by free radicals thousands of times per day. This oxidation is

<!-- chunk -->

### damaging your cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Antioxidants fight back against free radicals. When you supplement with

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha-Lipoic Acid, not only are you using arguably the most effective free

<!-- chunk -->

### radical scavenger on the planet. You’re regenerating antioxidants like

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin C & E, glutathione and CoQ10.44

<!-- chunk -->

### And they join the fight against free radicals alongside Alpha-Lipoic Acid.


<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha-Lipoic Acid plays an essential role in mitochondria. The heart of

<!-- chunk -->

### energy-generation in the human cell. Scientists at Emory University

<!-- chunk -->

### School of Medicine found ALA can stimulate telomerase, the enzyme that

<!-- chunk -->

### lengthens telomeres.

<!-- chunk -->

### The effects of many chronic diseases can be traced back to telomere

<!-- chunk -->

### shortening. (Telomeres are the ‘caps’ on the end of each chromosome in

<!-- chunk -->

### your DNA).

<!-- chunk -->

### Any treatment that can restore healthy telomeres has great potential in the

<!-- chunk -->

### fight against chronic disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study scientists showed Alpha-Lipoic Acid boosted the production

<!-- chunk -->

### of PGC1-alpha. The telomerase that lengthens telomeres. And they did it

<!-- chunk -->

### in just one day of treatment.45

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha-Lipoic Acid reduces wrinkles

<!-- chunk -->

### A topical solution of 5% Alpha-Lipoic Acid was applied to the faces of

<!-- chunk -->

### volunteers. This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed a reduction

<!-- chunk -->

### in facial lines, almost complete eradication of fine lines, and an overall

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement of skin color and texture in most volunteers.46

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha-Lipoic Acid critical for cellular energy

<!-- chunk -->

### Cellular energy is behind every single action that happens in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Including your brain. Cellular energy is required for muscle movement,

<!-- chunk -->

### producing new cells, wound healing and thinking.

<!-- chunk -->

### The mitochondria in each of your cells is the source of this energy. This

<!-- chunk -->

## ongoing energy production process is call the Krebs Cycle. Alpha-Lipoic

<!-- chunk -->

### Acid is a cofactor to two key enzymatic reactions within the Krebs Cycle.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the simplest terms, without ALA, cellular energy is not possible. And

<!-- chunk -->

### without cellular energy, well… life is not possible.47

<!-- chunk -->

## Memory loss reversed with ALA and ALCAR

<!-- chunk -->

### Accumulated oxidative damage to brain cell mitochondria eventually

<!-- chunk -->

### leads to neuronal and cognitive dysfunction.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study on rats showed supplementing with ALCAR and Alpha-Lipoic

<!-- chunk -->

### Acid improved memory. By lowering oxidative damage and improving

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function.48


<!-- chunk -->

### Taking Alpha-Lipoic Acid with a meal decreases its bioavailability. So I

<!-- chunk -->

### recommend taking ALA on an empty stomach (1 hour before eating).

<!-- chunk -->

### Most Alpha-Lipoic Acid supplements contain a 50/50 mixture of R-LA and

<!-- chunk -->

### S-LA. Supplements claiming to contain only R-LA are often more

<!-- chunk -->

### expensive. And information regarding their purity is not often available.

<!-- chunk -->

### Peak plasma (blood) concentrations of R-LA were found to be 40-50%

<!-- chunk -->

### higher than S-LA. This suggests that R-LA is better absorbed than S-LA.49

<!-- chunk -->

### •Alpha-Lipoic Acid dosage for cognitive benefit is 2- 600 mg per


<!-- chunk -->

### •ALA dosage for diabetic neuropathy is 800 mg per day divided into

<!-- chunk -->

### two doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Alpha-Lipoic Acid dosing for antioxidant benefit is 50 – 100 mg per


<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects from using Alpha-Lipoic Acid as a supplement are generally

<!-- chunk -->

### rare. But can include diarrhea, fatigue, insomnia and skin rash.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha-Lipoic Acid can lower blood sugar levels. So if you have diabetes

<!-- chunk -->

### or low blood sugar, you should take Alpha-Lipoic Acid under the

<!-- chunk -->

### supervision of your doctor.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha-Lipoic Acid supplementation can lower levels of thyroid hormone.

<!-- chunk -->

### So get your thyroid labs done when using ALA. And adjust your dosage of

<!-- chunk -->

### both ALA and thyroid meds accordingly.

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha-Lipoic Acid can lower levels of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

## (Thiamine). This can

<!-- chunk -->

### be dangerous for alcoholics, or in cases of malnutrition. It would be wise

<!-- chunk -->

### to add Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

## or Sulbutiamine if you’re taking ALA.

<!-- chunk -->

## The chemical structure of Biotin is similar to that Alpha-Lipoic Acid. And

<!-- chunk -->

### there is some evidence that ALA can compete with Biotin for transport

<!-- chunk -->

### across cell membranes. This may require higher doses of Biotin when

<!-- chunk -->

### you’re using ALA.


<!-- chunk -->

### Most Alpha-Lipoic Acid available as a supplement is a 50/50 combination

<!-- chunk -->

## of R-LA and S-LA. S-LA is the synthetic version of ALA and not found in

<!-- chunk -->

### nature.

<!-- chunk -->

### R-LA and S-LA are combined because R-LA is highly unstable on its own.

<!-- chunk -->

### And degenerates quickly.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have shown that 30-40% of an oral dose of Alpha-Lipoic Acid is

<!-- chunk -->

### absorbed. Oral ALA supplements are better absorbed on an empty

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach. Taking ALA with food reduces total plasma (blood)

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrations by about 30%.

<!-- chunk -->

### The sodium salt version of R-LA may be better absorbed than free lipoic

<!-- chunk -->

### acid, likely because of its higher solubility.50

<!-- chunk -->

### There is little evidence whether R-LA supplements are more effective than

<!-- chunk -->

### regular Alpha-Lipoic Acid supplements in humans.


<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha-Lipoic Acid 50 – 600 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Alpha-Lipoic Acid as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does make some Alpha-Lipoic Acid on its own. And from the

<!-- chunk -->

### food you eat. But the science is clear that supplemental ALA is a potent

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant. And acetylcholine booster.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha-Lipoic Acid can lengthen telomeres which is great for your neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### And neurogenesis (new neuron creation).

<!-- chunk -->

### ALA also helps regenerate antioxidants already in your system that have

<!-- chunk -->

### been depleted while doing their job. And it helps get rid of free radicals in

<!-- chunk -->

### your cells. So you get a double benefit when using Alpha-Lipoic Acid as

<!-- chunk -->

### an antioxidant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha-Lipoic Acid also helps in the creation of acetylcholine. Which

<!-- chunk -->

### boosts all cognitive functions including memory, recall, focus and

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration.

<!-- chunk -->

### ALA is especially helpful for those suffering with diabetes. Studies show

<!-- chunk -->

### it helps relieve diabetic neuropathy or nerve pain. But care must be taken

<!-- chunk -->

### because ALA can lower blood sugar levels. So work with your doctor

<!-- chunk -->

### when using Alpha-Lipoic Acid.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest starting with a dose of 400 mg daily. And work your way up to

<!-- chunk -->

### 600 mg per day. Taken in two doses during the day. Alpha-Lipoic Acid is

<!-- chunk -->

### often stacked with B-vitamins.


# Aniracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam has been shown to relieve depression, boost learning &

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, improve verbal fluidity, increase music listening pleasure, and

<!-- chunk -->

### make you more social

<!-- chunk -->

## Aniracetam (1-p-anisoyl-2-pyrrolidinone) is a fat-soluble ampakine

<!-- chunk -->

## nootropic in the racetam-class of compounds. AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-

<!-- chunk -->

### 5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic) refers to one of three glutamate receptors

<!-- chunk -->

### in your brain.51

<!-- chunk -->

## The racetam-class of nootropics have a pyrrolidone nucleus at their core.

<!-- chunk -->

## And Aniracetam is a Cholinergic compound, meaning it affects

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine levels in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam is up to 10-times more potent than the original racetam,

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam. It was patented by Swiss-based pharmaceutical company F.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hoffmann-La Roche AG in the 1978.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam is sold as a prescription drug (Ampamet, Draganon,

<!-- chunk -->

### Memodrin, Referan, Sarpul) in Europe. It is sold as an over-the-counter,

<!-- chunk -->

### unrestricted compound in the United States. But not as a dietary


<!-- chunk -->

### A favorite racetam among the nootropics community. Neurohackers use

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam to boost memory and learning. And to relieve anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, stress, and improve sociability.52

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the original synthetic nootropic compounds, it is known as a

<!-- chunk -->

## cognitive enhancer. And is known for its anxiolytic, or anti-anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

## effects. As an ampakine nootropic, Aniracetam helps increase attention

<!-- chunk -->

## span, alertness and boosts memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ampakines tend to have a stimulant effect. But do not produce the same

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulant side effects as Ritalin or coffee from prolonged use.

<!-- chunk -->

## Aniracetam vs. Piracetam: What’s the Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

### Swiss-based pharmaceutical company F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG

<!-- chunk -->

## developed Aniracetam in the late 1970’s as a derivative of Piracetam.

<!-- chunk -->

## Aniracetam is fat-soluble while Piracetam is water-soluble. Fat-soluble

<!-- chunk -->

### molecules cross the blood-brain barrier more easily than water-soluble

<!-- chunk -->

### molecules.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam works faster in the brain after taking compared to Piracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### because of its superior bioavailability. But its effects don’t last as long as

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam.

<!-- chunk -->

### The potency of Aniracetam seems almost counter-intuitive. Because most

<!-- chunk -->

### of an Aniracetam dose is lost in the liver during digestion. Only 0.2% of

<!-- chunk -->

### the original dose is available to the brain.53 Piracetam is nearly 100%

<!-- chunk -->

### bioavailable.54

<!-- chunk -->

### Both Aniracetam and Piracetam are cognitive enhancers. And both have

<!-- chunk -->

## neuroprotective qualities. Both racetams are able to improve learning and

<!-- chunk -->

## memory. And both are able to repair brain damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam has additional benefits not shared with Piracetam. Aniracetam

<!-- chunk -->

## can reduce anxiety, depression and fear. And increase sociability.55 This

<!-- chunk -->

### may indicate its effects on dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Aniracetam Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

### 1.Aniracetam modulates AMPA receptors in the brain. The main

<!-- chunk -->

## metabolite of Aniracetam (70-80%) is N-anisoyl-GABA and is

<!-- chunk -->

### responsible for many of its effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2-Pyrrolidinone and p-anisilic acid are additional metabolites of the drug

<!-- chunk -->

### (20-30%), both of which are also active.56

<!-- chunk -->

### The main function of these metabolites is on the glutamate system in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. It desensitizes the glutamate receptors. This causes the

<!-- chunk -->

## neurotransmitter glutamate to become more available in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### More glutamate means better cognition and memory. And neural

<!-- chunk -->

### protection and repair due to brain injury.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Aniracetam also seems to affect dopamine and serotonin receptors

<!-- chunk -->

### in the brain. Leading to improved mood and sociability.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study published in the European Journal of Pharmacology

<!-- chunk -->

### demonstrated the anti-anxiety effects of Aniracetam. Researchers tracked

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain pathways in mice showing Aniracetam’s mechanism of action.57

<!-- chunk -->

### Illustrating the effect on dopamine and serotonin.


<!-- chunk -->

### Glutamate is an excitatory relative of GABA. While GABA has a calming

<!-- chunk -->

### effect, glutamate stimulates. Glutamate is the most common

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

### But glutamate is actually toxic to neurons. And too much of it in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain can kill brain cells. Lou Gehrig’s Disease for example, is caused by

<!-- chunk -->

### excess glutamate.

<!-- chunk -->

### But glutamate is a pivotal neurotransmitter in the brain. It links the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### circuits involved in memory, learning and perception.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Too much glutamate can kill neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Too little glutamate can cause problems with memory, learning and

<!-- chunk -->

### perception


<!-- chunk -->

### So Aniracetam can help for age-related cognitive decline, as well as a

<!-- chunk -->

### student looking to do better in school. By boosting acetylcholine and

<!-- chunk -->

### controlling glutamate in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Aniracetam benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam modulates AMPA receptors which are involved in how

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamate is used in your brain. More of the neurotransmitter glutamate is

<!-- chunk -->

### available. Which means better neural signaling across synapses. Your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain is working optimally despite stress, fatigue and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is anecdotal evidence that Aniracetam boosts communication

<!-- chunk -->

### between left and right brain hemispheres. You become more creative. And

<!-- chunk -->

### are prone to making innovative and resourceful decisions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam combined with choline boosts the production of the crucial

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Improving memory, recall and focus.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam is fat-soluble and quickly enters your brain after you take it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once in your brain, it boosts signal transmission, and protects neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam boosts acetylcholine so you should add a good choline source.

<!-- chunk -->

### Try Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline with Aniracetam. And give your brain the

<!-- chunk -->

### choline it needs.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Aniracetam feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Nootropics users report:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Aniracetam as a study aid. On its own, Aniracetam seems to

<!-- chunk -->

### increase attention span for many neurohackers. And when combined

<!-- chunk -->

### with caffeine, many report being able to work effortlessly for hours

<!-- chunk -->

### on end.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Increased auditory perception. If you love music, Aniracetam can

<!-- chunk -->

### take you deeper into your listening experience. Minute details like

<!-- chunk -->

### background guitars, and other auditory effects come alive. Every

<!-- chunk -->

### instrument becomes part of the sound stage.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Increased visual acuity. The visual effects of Aniracetam feel like

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain is processing a broader spectrum of what’s in your visual

<!-- chunk -->

### range. Nature and your surroundings look more vibrant and

<!-- chunk -->

### beautiful.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Sociability. Many users report being able to articulate thoughts, and

<!-- chunk -->

### improved speaking ability. Language and your vocabulary seem to

<!-- chunk -->

### flow effortlessly. Thoughts and ideas come with less effort.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should be able to experience the effects of Aniracetam soon after you

<!-- chunk -->

### take it. It’s fat-soluble so it’s digested and enters your cells quickly. And

<!-- chunk -->

### unlike other stimulants, there is no “crash” once Aniracetam leaves your

<!-- chunk -->

### system.


<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers worked with 276 patients with cognitive disorders. They were

<!-- chunk -->

### given Aniracetam and tested at 3, 6 and 12 months.

<!-- chunk -->

### Improved emotional states and better motor functionality was observed

<!-- chunk -->

### within 3 months. A boost in cognitive performance was observed within

<!-- chunk -->

### months.

<!-- chunk -->

### Findings concluded Aniracetam “is a promising option for patients with

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive deficit” disorders. Improvements held throughout the 12-month

<!-- chunk -->

### study. And there was a favorable effect on emotional stability in patients

<!-- chunk -->

### with dementia.58

<!-- chunk -->

## Aniracetam as an antidepressant

<!-- chunk -->

### A study published in Psychopharmacology in 2001 showed Aniracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### helped stimulate the release of dopamine. The study reported Aniracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### as effective against depression caused by age-related brain dysfunction.59

<!-- chunk -->

## Aniracetam improves learning & memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers put rats and mice through six scenarios. From drug-induced

<!-- chunk -->

### memory loss to electric shock avoidance, while administering Aniracetam.

<!-- chunk -->

### The results of all tests conclusively showed Aniracetam improving

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive function. It didn’t matter what they put these animals through.

<!-- chunk -->

### Learning and memory improved with the use of Aniracetam.60

<!-- chunk -->

## Aniracetam repairs Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

<!-- chunk -->

### We’re exposed to toxins everywhere we go. And in everything we do

<!-- chunk -->

### during our day. This toxin exposure wreaks havoc in our body, including

<!-- chunk -->

### our brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, scientists showed one way to repair damage to synaptic

<!-- chunk -->

### transmission in the brain. They exposed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats to

<!-- chunk -->

### ethanol and a saccharin-like sweetener. Pups born to these female rats

<!-- chunk -->

### would normally be extremely cognitively impaired. Just like babies born

<!-- chunk -->

### to alcoholic mothers.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, the pups born with fetal alcohol syndrome were treated with

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam 18 and 27 days after birth. Aniracetam completely restored

<!-- chunk -->

### synaptic transmission in their brains. And reversed any cognitive deficits

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with fetal alcohol syndrome.61


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended Aniracetam dosage is 1,500 mg per day. Taken in two

<!-- chunk -->

### mg doses. One Aniracetam dose in the morning, and one in the early

<!-- chunk -->

### afternoon.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam is sold in tablet, capsule and powder form. Tablets and


<!-- chunk -->

### Since Aniracetam is a fat-soluble nootropic, you should take it with a meal

<!-- chunk -->

### containing healthy fats. Or with a tablespoon of extra virgin, expeller cold-

<!-- chunk -->

### pressed coconut or olive oil. Or other similar healthy fat to ensure quick

<!-- chunk -->

### absorption.


<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam non-toxic. So is considered well-tolerated and safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects are rare but can include anxiety, fatigue, headaches,

<!-- chunk -->

### nervousness and nausea. Side effects are often a result of unusually high

<!-- chunk -->

### doses of the nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Headaches from using Aniracetam typically happen when you forget to


<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam is sold in tablet, capsule and powder form. Tablets and


<!-- chunk -->

### In Europe and some other countries around the world, Aniracetam is a

<!-- chunk -->

### prescription drug. And sold under the brand names Ampamet, Draganon,

<!-- chunk -->

### Memodrin, Referan, and Sarpul.


<!-- chunk -->

## Aniracetam 1,500 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Aniracetam as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does not make Aniracetam on its own. So to get its benefits you


<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam is especially helpful for those suffering from depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show it helps stop and reverse the symptoms associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. This nootropic helps boost the activity of dopamine and

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Personally, I’ve found Aniracetam to be more effective (and safer) than

<!-- chunk -->

### any prescription anti-depressant I’ve ever tried.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam is also particularly useful to students and executives who want

<!-- chunk -->

### to boost cognition, learning and memory. My experience using Aniracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### shows it helps boost study scores, work flow, learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam also helps improve verbal fluidity and sociability. Words seem

<!-- chunk -->

### to come easily, and vocabulary you didn’t know you had access to come

<!-- chunk -->

### into play.

<!-- chunk -->

### Music sounds richer and fuller, and your listening experience enters a new

<!-- chunk -->

### level of music appreciation.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should use Aniracetam with a good choline supplement like Alpha

<!-- chunk -->

### GPC or CDP-Choline. It helps boost neural acetylcholine, so demands the


<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely boost daily intake of Aniracetam to 3,000 mg. if needed.


# Artichoke Extract (Luteolin)

<!-- chunk -->

### Artichoke Extract (Luteolin) has been shown to boost memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### learning, improve motivation and mood, and stimulate the growth of new

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Artichoke Extract (Luteolin) contains a naturally occurring compound

<!-- chunk -->

## called luteolin. Luteolin is a natural and powerful phosphodiesterase

<!-- chunk -->

## (PDE4) inhibitor. Excess PDE4 in your brain is bad news because it

<!-- chunk -->

## degrades cAMP.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a derivative of adenosine

<!-- chunk -->

## triphosphate (ATP). ATP is synthesized within mitochondria in each of

<!-- chunk -->

### your cells. cAMP is part of that cellular energy source.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a secondary messenger in neurons, cAMP helps produce proteins for

<!-- chunk -->

### increased neuron growth. Neuron dendrites connect to other neurons

<!-- chunk -->

## through a process called Long-Term Potentiation (LTP).

<!-- chunk -->

## LTP creates an increase in the production of cAMP. Which triggers a

<!-- chunk -->

### biochemical cascade of reactions. Which is the basis of learning and


<!-- chunk -->

### When cAMP is degraded, it interferes with efficient brain signaling. And

<!-- chunk -->

### interferes with Long-Term Potentiation. Making it harder to develop

<!-- chunk -->

### memories, and to learn.

<!-- chunk -->

### Artichoke Extract (luteolin) reduces PDE4. When PDE4 is reduced, you

<!-- chunk -->

### not only maintain healthy cAMP cellular energy. Brain signaling is

<!-- chunk -->

### actually amplified.62

<!-- chunk -->

## When luteolin is combined with another natural herb called Forskolin,

<!-- chunk -->

### you get double duty. Luteolin reduces PDE4 which maintains cellular

<!-- chunk -->

### signal strength. And Forskolin boosts cAMP. Increasing brain signal

<!-- chunk -->

### strength.

<!-- chunk -->

## Artichoke Extract (Luteolin) vs. Pure Luteolin: What’s the Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

### Luteolin is not bioavailable on its own if taken as a supplement.63 It

<!-- chunk -->

### requires the presence of other naturally occurring bioflavonoids to be

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolized by your body. And to reach the cells in active form.

<!-- chunk -->

### Artichoke Extract contains the compounds apigenin-7-rutinoside and

<!-- chunk -->

### narirutin, which unlocks Luteolin’s potential to work in your cells.64

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Artichoke Extract (Luteolin) Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Artichoke Extract (Luteolin) boosts brain health and functions in several

<!-- chunk -->

### ways. But two in particular stand out.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Artichoke Extract (luteolin) inhibits PDE4 which boosts cAMP

<!-- chunk -->

## activity in brain cells. cAMP helps stimulate the production of

<!-- chunk -->

### CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein).

<!-- chunk -->

### An increase in CREB enhances Long-Term Potentiation (LTP). LTP is the

<!-- chunk -->

### connection between brain synapses. Strengthening in response to

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulation by neurons on either side. A major component in both learning

<!-- chunk -->

### and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Memories are stored at a cellular level. And retrieved at a cellular level.

<!-- chunk -->

## This well-travelled pathway is strengthened by boosting cAMP with

<!-- chunk -->

## Artichoke Extract (Luteolin).

<!-- chunk -->

### This improvement in memory was demonstrated by researchers at the

<!-- chunk -->

### University of Genoa in Italy. Rats and mice were used in this study. In this

<!-- chunk -->

### case, the PDE4 inhibitor they used was a chemical derivative of rolipram.

<!-- chunk -->

### (Rolipram cannot be used in human patients because it causes vomiting).

<!-- chunk -->

### Results of the study showed this derivative enhanced memory function

<!-- chunk -->

### even at low doses. Acting on the same neural pathways as Artichoke

<!-- chunk -->

### Extract in humans.65

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Artichoke Extract (Luteolin) reduces brain inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers studied the effect of Luteolin on immune system cells in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain called microglia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Microglia produce cytokines in response to infections and toxins. Over-

<!-- chunk -->

### production of cytokines result in inflammation and the destruction of


<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, brain cells in mice were pretreated with Luteolin before

<!-- chunk -->

### being exposed to a substance that induced inflammation in brain cells. The

<!-- chunk -->

### same type of inflammation humans experience from daily exposure to

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study showed that Luteolin offered protection against brain

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation. And its consequences. Including problems with cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team concluded that Luteolin “may be useful for mitigating

<!-- chunk -->

### neural inflammation”.66


<!-- chunk -->

### Environmental factors, ADHD, illness, stress and aging changes our brain

<!-- chunk -->

### chemistry.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Mood and motivation declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Memory and recall declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Long-term memory fades

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes are contributing factors to poor quality of life. And as

<!-- chunk -->

### they progress, to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, dementia

<!-- chunk -->

### and Parkinson’s.

<!-- chunk -->

## Artichoke Extract (Luteolin) benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Research from hundreds of studies, and feedback from neurohackers have

<!-- chunk -->

### shown that Artichoke Extract can:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improve memory by inhibiting PDE4 in the brain (which boosts

<!-- chunk -->

### cAMP activity)

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boost dopamine levels in the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### •Tame inflammation in the brain

<!-- chunk -->

## Artichoke Extract (Luteolin) is water-soluble and quickly enters your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain after you take it. Once in your brain, it inhibits PDE4 which boosts

<!-- chunk -->

### cAMP activity. cAMP is involved in the Long-Term Potentiation process

<!-- chunk -->

### of preserving memories.

<!-- chunk -->

## Artichoke Extract combined with Forskolin is even more effective.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because not only are you helping cAMP activity in the brain, you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### boosting cAMP with Forskolin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inhibiting PDE4 and boosting cAMP also makes the effect of normal

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine production more effective. Boosting processes in this stream of

<!-- chunk -->

### chemical reactions in the brain increases learning and memory.67 Without

<!-- chunk -->

### the side effects of stimulating dopamine production through the use of

<!-- chunk -->

### drugs like Adderall or Ritalin.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Artichoke Extract (Luteolin) feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers report that Artichoke Extract with Forskolin improves

<!-- chunk -->

### mood. It motivates you to want to learn, and to get things done. Some say

<!-- chunk -->

### it works as good as Modafinil.

<!-- chunk -->

### The general consensus is:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improved mood and motivation

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increased ability to study

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increased ability to retain information

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improved long-term memory


<!-- chunk -->

### Microglia cells are immune cells in your brain and spinal cord. They

<!-- chunk -->

### produce signaling molecules called cytokines. These cytokines are cell

<!-- chunk -->

### signaling molecules that aid communication between cells in immune

<!-- chunk -->

### responses.

<!-- chunk -->

### When microglial cells are not regulated, they produce excessive levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### cytokines. And inflammatory cytokines kill neurons. Leading to cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### aging and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. And are

<!-- chunk -->

### responsible for producing symptoms like sleepiness, loss of appetite,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory deficits and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign worked

<!-- chunk -->

### with a group of young, and older mice. The mice were fed a control diet,

<!-- chunk -->

### or a luteolin-supplemented diet for 4 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team found that luteolin helped regulate microglial cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### And stopped them from producing excess cytokines. This reduced

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation in the brains of aged mice. And restored memory to levels

<!-- chunk -->

### observed in younger mice.68

<!-- chunk -->

## Artichoke Extract improves mood

<!-- chunk -->

### Users report that Artichoke Extract boosts mood. Researchers at Kurume

<!-- chunk -->

### University School of Medicine in Japan demonstrated in the lab how this

<!-- chunk -->

### boost in mood occurs.

<!-- chunk -->

### When dopamine D1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex of the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### malfunction, psychotic symptoms and other nasty symptoms show up.

<!-- chunk -->

### Including schizophrenia.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study group found that dopamine D1 receptors signal through the

<!-- chunk -->

### cAMP cascade. Which is modulated by PDE4 enzymes.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, researchers inhibited PDE4 production in the lab. Showing

<!-- chunk -->

### that an increase in dopamine resulted in influencing cognitive function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Proving the antipsychotic action of suppressing PDE4.69

<!-- chunk -->

## Artichoke Extract improves memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at the West Virginia University Health Sciences Center in the

<!-- chunk -->

### USA worked with tame and wild-type mice. Suppressing PDE4 in the mice

<!-- chunk -->

### enhanced memory. And increased the growth of new neurons in the

<!-- chunk -->

### hippocampus of the brains in these mice.70


<!-- chunk -->

### For PDE4 suppression: 900 mg Artichoke Extract per day

<!-- chunk -->

### For boosting cAMP: 4 mg Forskolin (Coleus forskohlii) extract per day

<!-- chunk -->

### Note: Check the label of the Forskolin supplement for the amount of

<!-- chunk -->

### actual Forskolin in each capsule. For example, 385 mg of Forskohlii may

<!-- chunk -->

### only be guaranteed to contain 3.85 – 4 mg of actual Forskolin. Which is

<!-- chunk -->

## what you need. Also note that more Forskolin is not better as it causes a

<!-- chunk -->

### strong fatigue effect at higher doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### For counteracting Forskolin’s effect on Acetylcholinesterase: add 800 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR) – (200 mg of ALCAR for every 1 mg of

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin) per day

<!-- chunk -->

### Many users of this stack report it helpful to supplement with 500 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine, a B-Vitamin Complex and caffeine (coffee or preferably

<!-- chunk -->

### green tea).

<!-- chunk -->

### Note: the above combination of nootropics is known among neurohackers

<!-- chunk -->

### as the CILTEP stack. CILTEP stands for Chemically Induced Long-Term

<!-- chunk -->

### Potentation.


<!-- chunk -->

### Acetylcholinesterase is upregulated by cAMP which makes you sleepy.

<!-- chunk -->

### This means that available Acetylcholine in your brain drops. You can

<!-- chunk -->

### counteract this with Acetyl-l-Carnitine (ALCAR), which calms the

<!-- chunk -->

### upregulation of Acetylcholinesterase.

<!-- chunk -->

### Artichoke extracts have been documented to lower blood cholesterol in

<!-- chunk -->

### human and animal studies. This means it may potentiate the effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### cholesterol-lowering and statin drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Artichoke Extract affects the liver by stimulating the flow of bile. So if

<!-- chunk -->

### you have liver disease be careful about using this herb.

<!-- chunk -->

### Artichoke Extract can also cause gallbladder contractions. So if you have

<!-- chunk -->

### gallbladder disease or gallstones, check with doctor before taking this

<!-- chunk -->

### herb.


<!-- chunk -->

## Two very different forms of artichoke are available. The Globe Artichoke

<!-- chunk -->

## (Cynara cardunculus) which has been cultivated and used since ancient

<!-- chunk -->

## times. And the Jerusalem Artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) which is

<!-- chunk -->

### from the Northeastern USA.

<!-- chunk -->

## All references to Artichoke Extract in this article is for the Globe

<!-- chunk -->

## Artichoke.

<!-- chunk -->

### Users report that Artichoke Extract (Standardized to 5% Cynarins) of most

<!-- chunk -->

### premium brains are helpful in reducing PDE4.


<!-- chunk -->

## Artichoke Extract (Luteolin) 900 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Artichoke Extract as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Artichoke Extract (Luteolin) on its own. So you

<!-- chunk -->

### must take it as a standardized supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Luteolin on its own as a supplement does not appear to be effective.

<!-- chunk -->

### Luteolin is not bioavailable so your body can’t use it. Luteolin as part of

<!-- chunk -->

## the Artichoke plant is used by your body. Because it contains other

<!-- chunk -->

### flavonoids that help your body absorb it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Artichoke Extract is especially helpful when combined with Forskolin. It

<!-- chunk -->

### helps boost memory, increases motivation and the desire to learn. And

<!-- chunk -->

### helps improve mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest dosing Artichoke Extract at 900 mg per day taken in the

<!-- chunk -->

### morning. With 4 mg of Forskolin. Stack this with 800 mg of ALCAR to

<!-- chunk -->

### keep your acetylcholine levels up.

<!-- chunk -->

### I’ve also found that combining this Artichoke Extract stack with caffeine

<!-- chunk -->

### is helpful. The L-Theanine in green tea works with the caffeine boost we

<!-- chunk -->

### need. Without the side effects of coffee.

<!-- chunk -->

### I’ve also found that more in not better with this stack. And taking it early

<!-- chunk -->

### in the day is good for a productive day. The effects last all day.

<!-- chunk -->

### And finally, we are making the effects of normal dopamine function more

<!-- chunk -->

### effective with this stack. It triggers the desirable downstream processes

<!-- chunk -->

### that increase learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### The chemical dynamics of the dopamine system are preserved. And we

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t get the negative side effects of using a stimulant like Adderall or

<!-- chunk -->

### Ritalin.

<!-- chunk -->

### This Artichoke Extract (Luteolin) stack increases mental endurance for

<!-- chunk -->

### encoding long-term memories.


# Ashwagandha

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha has been shown to repair and reverse damage to the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### caused by chronic anxiety and stress

<!-- chunk -->

## Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is one of the most powerful herbs in

<!-- chunk -->

## Ayurvedic healing. This ancient herbal remedy has remarkable anti-

<!-- chunk -->

## depressant qualities. And has been shown to be as good as many

<!-- chunk -->

## prescription pharmaceuticals in treating depression and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

## In Sanskrit, Ashwagandha means “smell of horse”. Meaning this herb

<!-- chunk -->

## imparts the strength and vigor of a stallion.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha is often referred to as “Indian ginseng” because of its

<!-- chunk -->

### rejuvenating properties. But botanically, Ashwagandha and ginseng are

<!-- chunk -->

### unrelated.

<!-- chunk -->

### Native to India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Ashwagandha is now being grown

<!-- chunk -->

### in other regions including the United States.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha is in the same family as the tomato. It’s a small woody

<!-- chunk -->

### shrub with oval leaves, and five-petal yellow flowers. The fruit is red and

<!-- chunk -->

### the size of a raisin. The plant is also known as the “Winter Cherry”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha is known as an adaptogen. Which means it helps your body

<!-- chunk -->

### adapt to stress, both mental and physical.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Indian Materia Medica lists Ashwagandha for:

<!-- chunk -->

### •general debility

<!-- chunk -->

### •impotence

<!-- chunk -->

### •general aphrodisiac purposes

<!-- chunk -->

## •brain fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

### •low sperm count

<!-- chunk -->

## •nervous exhaustion

<!-- chunk -->

### •where general vigor must be restored.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha extract has been shown to be an effective antioxidant in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. Clearing the cellular waste implicated in Alzheimer’s Disease.71

<!-- chunk -->

### Is also boosts memory and cognition. By reducing stress and increasing

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine. And regeneration of nerve networks in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Ashwagandha Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

### 1.Ashwagandha enhances GABA receptors and serotonin in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### It appears to work on neuron receptors, enabling GABA to connect

<!-- chunk -->

### easier. This inhibits the signals present under a stress response in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. Anxiety goes down.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study was conducted at The Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine

<!-- chunk -->

### with 75 volunteers with moderate to severe anxiety. Ashwagandha

<!-- chunk -->

### produced a significant decrease in anxiety levels over the control group.72

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.Ashwagandha improves cognitive and psychomotor performance in a

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences in Hyderabad, India

<!-- chunk -->

### worked with 20 healthy male volunteers. In this double-blind, placebo-

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled trial participants were given 250 mg capsules of standardized

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha extract daily for 14 days.

<!-- chunk -->

### Significant improvements in reaction times were reported at the end of the

<!-- chunk -->

### trial. The study suggests that Ashwagandha extract improves cognitive and

<!-- chunk -->

### psychomotor (physical reaction) performance even when you’re in the best

<!-- chunk -->

### of health.73


<!-- chunk -->

## Chronic stress and cortisol can damage your brain. Neuroscientists at the

<!-- chunk -->

## University of California, Berkeley, found that chronic stress triggers long-

<!-- chunk -->

## term changes in brain structure and function.74

<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic stress changes neural networks. Cortisol creates a domino effect

<!-- chunk -->

### that hard-wires pathways between the hippocampus and amygdala. (The

<!-- chunk -->

### amygdala (lizard brain) is the area responsible for your fight-or-flight

<!-- chunk -->

### response).

<!-- chunk -->

### This hard-wiring caused by stress is not the way the brain was designed.

<!-- chunk -->

### But chronic, ongoing stress tricks the brain into rebuilding circuits and

<!-- chunk -->

### hunkering down for the long haul.

<!-- chunk -->

### This re-wiring appears to be permanent. Unless you intervene with

<!-- chunk -->

### something like Ashwagandha.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic stress seems to ‘flip a switch’ in stem cells in the brain. And turns

<!-- chunk -->

### them into a type of cell that prevents connections to the prefrontal cortex.

<!-- chunk -->

### Preventing improved learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## And laying down the scaffolding linked to anxiety, depression and PTSD

<!-- chunk -->

### (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).

<!-- chunk -->

## ↓ Chronic stress unnaturally coats neurons in myelin

<!-- chunk -->

## ↓ Chronic stress reduces the number of neurons

<!-- chunk -->

## ↓ Gray matter decreases and white matter increases.

<!-- chunk -->

### Under conditions of chronic stress and excess cortisol, your brain’s

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons are coated (or sheathed) in myelin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Under healthy conditions this “sheathing” is a protective measure. But this

<!-- chunk -->

### excessive sheathing is likely an evolutionary measure made to reinforce

<!-- chunk -->

## the connection between the hippocampus and amygdala. Improving the

<!-- chunk -->

### fight-or-flight response during extended periods of threat or attack.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the modern world, chronic stress hijacks your fight-or-flight response

<!-- chunk -->

### system. It backfires in daily life in when you are not typically in physical

<!-- chunk -->

### danger.

<!-- chunk -->

## Ashwagandha benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha undoes damage to the brain caused by chronic stress. And

<!-- chunk -->

### helps keep it healthy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha improves cognitive function. Glycowithanolides, one of the

<!-- chunk -->

### many compounds found in this herb, reduce cortisol. And overall energy

<!-- chunk -->

### levels are enhanced through optimizing mitochondrial function.

<!-- chunk -->

## It also has GABA-mimicking effects in the brain. Comparable to the

<!-- chunk -->

### effects of prescription benzodiazepines like lorazepam (Ativan).

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha can also help prevent and repair damage caused by

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease. Through its

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant and inflammation-reducing mechanisms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha even provides protection and regeneration of neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### during opiate and heroin withdrawal. And eases withdrawal symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Ayurvedic medicine, Rasayana herbs are used to promote a youthful

<!-- chunk -->

### state of physical and mental health. The ancients considered Medhya

<!-- chunk -->

## Rasayana herbs to be working with higher brain function. These are

<!-- chunk -->

### mind-rejuvenating herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Of the 8 or 9 most cherished herbal remedies, Ashwagandha is the highest

<!-- chunk -->

### or most prominent of Ayurvedic Rasayana herbs. Acting as an adaptogen,

<!-- chunk -->

### rejuvenating the nervous system, and boosting the body’s resilience to


<!-- chunk -->

## How does Ashwagandha feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha users report:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Ashwagandha as a stress-reliever. If you are experiencing severe

### disguise itself in many ways. Including feeling abnormally fatigued.

<!-- chunk -->

### You find that you are not sleeping well. Or don’t feel rested and

<!-- chunk -->

### refreshed when waking up in the morning. Even after taking a

<!-- chunk -->

### sleeping pill.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many report a rapid change in energy and motivation as soon as

<!-- chunk -->

### they take Ashwagandha. Others won’t feel the effects for a couple of

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks before relief sets in. You’ll know Ashwagandha is working

<!-- chunk -->

### when you wake up in the morning feeling refreshed. And eagerly

### looking forward to starting your day.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Ashwagandha as an anti-anxiety aid. As an anti-anxiety aid users

<!-- chunk -->

### say they feel their self-confidence has been restored. Your speech

<!-- chunk -->

### will feel more fluid and easier, especially in public settings. No

### mg early afternoon.


<!-- chunk -->

## Note: Ashwagandha stimulates your thyroid. So if you are hypothyroid,

<!-- chunk -->

### use Ashwagandha with caution. And check with your endocrinologist to be

<!-- chunk -->

### safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha is non-toxic at moderate doses. If you are pregnant do not

<!-- chunk -->

### use Ashwagandha as it could cause a miscarriage. This herb is an

<!-- chunk -->

### adaptogen with powerful hormonal effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha can enhance the effects of sedatives, anti-depressant and

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-anxiety medications including St. John’s Wort.

<!-- chunk -->

### It can also interact and possibly amplify the effects of immune

<!-- chunk -->

### suppressants, blood pressure medication, and drugs used to control blood

<!-- chunk -->

### glucose levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha can boost the effects of alcohol. And do not use

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha if you have bleeding issues, or before surgery.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other possible side effects include diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain,

<!-- chunk -->

### drowsiness and slowed pulse.


<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha is available as a powder, capsules, tincture and tea. The root

<!-- chunk -->

### and berry of the plant are used. The ground root of the herb is used as the

<!-- chunk -->

### base of an Ashwagandha supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Active ingredients of Ashwagandha include alkaloids, saponins, and

<!-- chunk -->

### withanolides. Look for the percentage of active ingredients listed on the

<!-- chunk -->

### bottle or package. Typically, you’ll see something like “standardized to

<!-- chunk -->

### X% of withanolides”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid supplements that list “other ingredients” on the label. And look for

<!-- chunk -->

## Certified Organic to ensure the root used to make your Ashwagandha

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement is free of heavy metals, pesticides and herbicides.


<!-- chunk -->

## Ashwagandha Extract 250 – 500 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Ashwagandha as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Ashwagandha on its own. So to get its benefits


<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha is especially helpful for those suffering from anxiety and

<!-- chunk -->

### stress. Studies show it helps stop and reverse the devastating effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### stress on your brain, and body. This nootropic helps repair the damage to

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons and synapses caused by chronic stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha is a powerful adaptogen. Which means it helps increase the

<!-- chunk -->

### effect of certain hormones when activity is low. And will block excess

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulation when activity is too high.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha as an adaptogen helps balance cortisol in the body caused by

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic stress. Chronically elevated cortisol levels suppress immunity,

<!-- chunk -->

### create fat deposits on the belly, face and neck, reduces libido, causes bone

<!-- chunk -->

### loss, causes insulin resistance, and brain fog.

<!-- chunk -->

### Balancing cortisol levels with Ashwagandha improves your sleep quality,

<!-- chunk -->

### immunity, stress response, organ function, reduces fatigue, and brain fog.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha is also helpful for those suffering from anxiety and panic

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. A study published in Phytomedicine showed the calming effect

<!-- chunk -->

### of this herb was equal to the drug Ativan (lorazepam). Without the side


<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely take up to 750 mg of Ashwagandha extract daily if needed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most get all the benefit they need with 500 mg. Dosed 250 mg in the

# Bacopa Monnieri

<!-- chunk -->

### Bacopa Monnieri has been shown to boost memory and cognition, improve

<!-- chunk -->

### mood, and reduce stress

<!-- chunk -->

## Bacopa Monnieri (Brahmi) is an aquatic herb originally found in the

<!-- chunk -->

### wetlands and marshy areas of Southeast Asia and India.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bacopa, also known as water hyssop, is often referred to as “Brahmi”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Named after the supreme god Brahma.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ancient Ayurvedic texts talked about Bacopa. It was recommended to

<!-- chunk -->

### devotees to help memorize long passages of text.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the West, Bacopa Monnieri is often used to reduce anxiety, depression

<!-- chunk -->

### and stress. But it’s gaining popularity in the nootropic community as a

<!-- chunk -->

### powerful memory and cognition booster.

<!-- chunk -->

### The active compound Bacoside A in Bacopa easily crosses the blood-brain

<!-- chunk -->

### barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Bacopa Monnieri Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## Bacopa Monnieri boosts brain health and function in several ways. But


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Bacopa Monnieri boosts memory. Bacopa’s two active

<!-- chunk -->

### components are bacosides A and B. They improve the signaling of

<!-- chunk -->

### electrical impulses between neurons in your brain. Bacosides also

<!-- chunk -->

### help rebuild damaged neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bacopa Monnieri helps you learn and remember things more easily. In one

<!-- chunk -->

### study, researchers gave 54 volunteers in Portland, Oregon 300 mg of B.

<!-- chunk -->

### Monnieri per day for 12 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### After the 12-week study, the people taking Bacopa had:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Better word recall

<!-- chunk -->

### •Better attention

<!-- chunk -->

### •Better memory scores

<!-- chunk -->

### •A great ability to focus while learning

<!-- chunk -->

### •Less anxiety and lower heart rates78

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Bacopa Monnieri reduces stress. Bacopa has traditionally been

<!-- chunk -->

### used in Ayurveda as a tonic for the nervous system. It helps to

<!-- chunk -->

## reduce anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research at Banaras Hindu University in India showed Bacopa as effective

<!-- chunk -->

### for anxiety as the benzodiazepine drug lorazepam. One of the side effects

<!-- chunk -->

### of lorazepam is memory loss. Bacopa Monnieri on the other hand, reduced

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety while boosting cognition.79


<!-- chunk -->

## Chronic stress and cortisol can damage your brain. Neuroscientists at the

<!-- chunk -->

### University of California, Berkeley, found that chronic stress triggers long-

<!-- chunk -->

### term change in brain structure and function.80

<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic stress damages neural networks. Certain proteins are over-

<!-- chunk -->

### expressed damaging neurons as a result.

<!-- chunk -->

### Toxins invade cells, hijacking their normal, healthy function. And

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidative damage by free radicals harm brain cells if they’re not removed.


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Toxins kill brain cells from the inside


<!-- chunk -->

### Under conditions of chronic stress your brain loses the capacity to

<!-- chunk -->

### transmit signals between neurons efficiently. Memory, cognition, and

<!-- chunk -->

### decision-making all suffer as a result.

<!-- chunk -->

## Bacopa Monnieri benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Bacopa Monnieri undoes damage to the brain caused by chronic stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### And helps keep it healthy. This is a little complicated, so stay with me

<!-- chunk -->

### here.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your brain is protected by heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70), cytochrome

<!-- chunk -->

## enzymes EROD and PROD, and superoxide dismutase (SOD).

<!-- chunk -->

### Hsp70 helps proteins in cells retain normal structure, so they remain

<!-- chunk -->

### functional. EROD (7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase) and PROD (7-

<!-- chunk -->

### pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase) are detox enzymes. They protect your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain by converting bad toxins into less harmful compounds. And SOD

<!-- chunk -->

### battles destructive free radicals called superoxides. And converts them

<!-- chunk -->

### into harmless organic compounds.

<!-- chunk -->

## Bacopa Monnieri Keeps Your Brain Healthy Under Stress

<!-- chunk -->

### When you are under stress, levels of Hsp70 increase in all regions of your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. But research shows that animals pretreated with Bacopa for 7 days

<!-- chunk -->

### prevented most of this increase in Hsp70. Particularly in areas of the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### responsible for memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### This means that producing less Hsp70 under stress, Bacopa makes your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain less susceptible to stress. Bacopa kept those regions of the brain in a

<!-- chunk -->

### non-stressed state. Even in the presence of stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bacopa also has a preemptive action on EROD, and PROD. Rats treated

<!-- chunk -->

### with Bacopa, but not under stress, saw an increase in these two enzymes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Suggesting that Bacopa helps stockpile these protective enzymes to help

<!-- chunk -->

### you better deal with stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### And when it comes to SOD, researchers said, “Bacopa helps in coping with

<!-- chunk -->

### the combined hypoxic, hypothermic, and immobilization stress, which

<!-- chunk -->

### could lead to an onslaught of free radicals.” So Bacopa helps SOD activity

<!-- chunk -->

### and prepares cells to weather attacks by free radicals.81

<!-- chunk -->

### Translated, this all means Bacopa helps your brain deal with stress. And

<!-- chunk -->

### helps boost memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Bacopa Monnieri feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### The effects of Bacopa are not felt immediately. But seem to build over

<!-- chunk -->

### time. Some users report a pronounced anti-anxiety effect within 2 – 4 days

<!-- chunk -->

### of supplementing with Bacopa.

<!-- chunk -->

### In one study done in Australia, results were measured at 5 and 12 weeks of

<!-- chunk -->

### taking Bacopa. The results showed improved speed of information

<!-- chunk -->

### processing, and an increase in learning and memory. Maximum reduction

<!-- chunk -->

### in anxiety was realized after 12 weeks of use.82

<!-- chunk -->

### Some neurohackers say they feel the effects of Bacopa Monnieri sooner

<!-- chunk -->

### than 4 weeks. And the effects seem to keep working even after stopping

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation. The effects are long-term.

<!-- chunk -->

### Long term users say they consistently feel calmer, can think quicker and

<!-- chunk -->

### have better memory.


<!-- chunk -->

## Bacopa Monnieri as a Nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### This double-blind placebo-controlled investigation was done at Swinburne

<!-- chunk -->

### University in Australia. 107 healthy participants were given 300 mg of

<!-- chunk -->

### Bacopa Monnieri extract for 90 days.

<!-- chunk -->

### After 90 days, the people who took B. Monnieri extract showed significant

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement in spatial memory, memory accuracy and their ability to

<!-- chunk -->

### process visual information.83

<!-- chunk -->

## Bacopa Monnieri for Stress Reduction

<!-- chunk -->

### Bacopa is likely best known for reducing stress. Recent research at

<!-- chunk -->

### Swinburne University of Technology in Australia confirmed this in the lab.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study 17 healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### volunteers were given 320 mg or 640 mg of Bacopa extract. The study

<!-- chunk -->

### reported significant mood improvement, and decreased levels of cortisol.

<!-- chunk -->

### This study demonstrated Bacopa’s adaptogenic qualities. Bacopa Monnieri

<!-- chunk -->

### counteracted the effects of stress by regulating hormones involved in the

<!-- chunk -->

### stress response.84

<!-- chunk -->

## Bacopa Monnieri for Longevity

<!-- chunk -->

### Long-term exposure to aluminum can increase your risk of Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### Disease by 60 percent.85 (So check your underarm deodorant label before

<!-- chunk -->

### you read the rest of this section)!

<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows that Bacopa Monnieri can protect you from toxins that are

<!-- chunk -->

### harmful to your brain. Including aluminum.

<!-- chunk -->

### It prevents the buildup of toxins between and inside neurons. And prevents

<!-- chunk -->

### damage to the hippocampus. The area of your brain critical for learning,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and cognitive power.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists at Jawaharlal Nehru University in India laced rats’ drinking

<!-- chunk -->

### water with aluminum chloride. The same aluminum that’s toxic to your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. Some of the rats in this study had the protective power of Bacopa

<!-- chunk -->

### Monnieri going for them.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bacopa Monnieri protected the rat’s brains from oxidative damage from

<!-- chunk -->

### the aluminum. And it worked as well as the Alzheimer’s drug selegiline.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bacopa restored the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) to levels near

<!-- chunk -->

### normal. Indicating Bacopa Monnieri’s anti-aging potential.86


<!-- chunk -->

### There is no ‘right’ dosage of Bacopa. Each person’s body is unique. In

<!-- chunk -->

### general, use the lowest dosage that works for you. And Bacopa works

<!-- chunk -->

### better if taken a few days in a row rather than just once.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dosage of Bacopa Monnieri containing 45% bacosides is

<!-- chunk -->

### 200 – 450 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dosage of Bacopa Monnieri containing 20% bacosides is

<!-- chunk -->

### 750 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Higher dosing should be divided equally with your first dose in the

<!-- chunk -->

### morning, and next dose early afternoon.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bacopa is fat-soluble so should be taken with a healthy fat source like

<!-- chunk -->

### organic, cold-pressed virgin olive or coconut oil. Fat helps your body

<!-- chunk -->

### absorb the compounds in Bacopa that bring you benefit. And helps deliver

<!-- chunk -->

### it into your brain cells.


<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects for Bacopa are rare when taken as directed. But can include

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue and upset stomach.


<!-- chunk -->

### The bioactive component of Bacopa Monnieri is Bacoside A. Which is a

<!-- chunk -->

### mixture of saponins with bacoside A3, bacopaside II, and jujubogenin

<!-- chunk -->

### isomer of bacopasaponin C.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bacopa supplements are available as a powder, capsules and tablets. Check

<!-- chunk -->

### the label for the concentration of Bacosides. A Bacopa extract with a

<!-- chunk -->

### higher Bacoside concentration requires a lower dose.


<!-- chunk -->

## Bacopa Monnieri up to 450 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Bacopa Monnieri as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Bacopa Monnieri on its own. So you must take it

<!-- chunk -->

### as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### B. Monnieri is especially helpful for those suffering from anxiety and

<!-- chunk -->

### stress. Studies show it helps stop and reverse the devastating effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### stress on your brain, and body. This nootropic helps repair damage to

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons and synapses caused by chronic stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bacopa is a powerful adaptogen. Which means it helps increase the effect

<!-- chunk -->

### of certain hormones when activity is low. And will block excess

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulation when activity is high.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bacopa Monnieri is also helpful for those suffering from anxiety and panic

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. A study published in Phytomedicine showed the calming effect

<!-- chunk -->

### of this herb was equal to the drug Ativan (lorazepam). Without the side


<!-- chunk -->

### The ancient Ayurvedic texts knew what we’re only now discovering. That

<!-- chunk -->

### Bacopa is a powerful memory enhancer. Recent studies in Australia and

<!-- chunk -->

### the USA show B. Monnieri helps improve word recall, memory scores,

<!-- chunk -->

### attention and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely take up to 450 mg of Bacopa Monnieri extract (45%

<!-- chunk -->

### Bacosides) daily if needed. Half the dose first thing in the morning. And

<!-- chunk -->

### the other half early afternoon.

### antihypertensive, as well as prevention of stroke.95

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Cat’s Claw can increase memory and learning. Cat’s Claw

<!-- chunk -->

### extracts can help learning and memory in a healthy as well as a

<!-- chunk -->

### damaged brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows certain alkaloid extracts of Cat’s Claw can help repair

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells damaged by stroke or dysfunction of the acetylcholine

## Cat’s Claw Repairs DNA and Boosts Immune System

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Sweden used the C-MED-100 (AC11®) extract of Cat’s

<!-- chunk -->

### Claw in rats and men.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rats were given doses of 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg of the Cat’s Claw

<!-- chunk -->

### extract per kg of body weight for 8 consecutive weeks. White blood cell

<!-- chunk -->

### counts in the 40 and 80 mg treatment groups were significantly elevated

<!-- chunk -->

### over controls.

<!-- chunk -->

### In male volunteers, healthy men were given 5 mg of Cat’s Claw extract per

<!-- chunk -->

### kg of body weight for 6 consecutive weeks. Again white blood cell count

<!-- chunk -->

### was significantly elevated in the male volunteers.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers also found that DNA repair got a significant boost by

<!-- chunk -->

### Cat’s Claw extract after whole body irradiation in the rats.105

<!-- chunk -->

### A 2nd study by the same research group used C-MED-100 extract with

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy men. The volunteers received either 250 mg of the extract, 350 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### of extract or a placebo daily for 8 weeks. Hydrogen peroxide was used to

<!-- chunk -->

### Cat’s Claw is well tolerated by most and considered non-toxic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cat’s Claw is available in tablets, capsules or as a water or alcohol extract

<!-- chunk -->

### tincture. Ground or freeze-dried Cat’s Claw bark can also be taken as a tea.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cat’s Claw recommended dosage is one 100 mg capsule per day for

<!-- chunk -->

### arthritis. And one 250 or 350 mg capsule per day for cognitive and

<!-- chunk -->

### immune support.

<!-- chunk -->

### Standardized Cat’s Claw vine or root bark extracts usually contain 3%

<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects are rare with Cat’s Claw. But may include diarrhea, dizziness

<!-- chunk -->

### or nausea.

<!-- chunk -->

### Those with autoimmune diseases, skin grafts, tuberculosis or receiving

<!-- chunk -->

### organ transplants should not use Cat’s Claw because of its effects on the

<!-- chunk -->

### immune system. Cat’s Claw can stimulate the immune system and will

<!-- chunk -->

### counteract any medication you’re using to suppress your immune system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cat’s Claw is known for lowering blood pressure. So if you have an issue

<!-- chunk -->

### with low blood pressure, or on high blood pressure medication you should

<!-- chunk -->

### not use Cat’s Claw.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cat’s Claw may increase the risk of bleeding so don’t take this herb if you

# Choline Bitartrate

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline Bitartrate is known to increase cognition and brain function,

<!-- chunk -->

### improve focus and motivation, and reduce fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

## Choline Bitartrate is choline combined with tartaric acid. Binding

<!-- chunk -->

## choline to tartaric acid increases bioavailability. Choline (2-hydroxy-

<!-- chunk -->

### N,N,N-trimethyl-ethanaminium) is a primary building block for the

<!-- chunk -->

### critical neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh).

<!-- chunk -->

## Choline was declared an essential nutrient by the Food and Nutrition

<!-- chunk -->

### Board of the National Institute of Medicine (USA) in 1998.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline is considered an essential nutrient because when your body uses it

<!-- chunk -->

### faster than it can produce it, you need supplemental choline either from

<!-- chunk -->

### food or a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline is found in foods such as fish, beef steak, liver, chicken liver,

<!-- chunk -->

### eggs, cod, broccoli, peanut butter, and milk.

<!-- chunk -->

## You need choline for the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### And to form phosphatidylcholine (PC), used in building cell membranes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain uses acetylcholine to maintain clear communication. In fact,

<!-- chunk -->

### it’s used to maintain communication between all the cells in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, choline is so vital to cognition and nerve function that, without it,

<!-- chunk -->

### we couldn’t move, think, sleep or remember anything.

<!-- chunk -->

### When choline is in short supply, your brain goes on a scavenger hunt. And

<!-- chunk -->

### starts to steal choline from nerve cell membranes. In your brain’s attempt

<!-- chunk -->

### to maintain normal acetylcholine signaling, it starts taking cells apart.107

<!-- chunk -->

### This works in the short term. Your brain uses this technique to keep your

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and other functions running smoothly. But in the long run it takes

<!-- chunk -->

### a toll on your brain at the cellular level.108

<!-- chunk -->

### This is the primary reason you need to add a choline supplement to your


<!-- chunk -->

## Choline Bitartrate vs. CDP-Choline vs. Alpha GPC: What’s the

<!-- chunk -->

## Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline is a water-soluble nutrient, and its composition is similar to B-

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamins. Choline Bitartrate, CDP-Choline, Choline Citrate and Alpha

<!-- chunk -->

### GPC are all sources of choline.

<!-- chunk -->

## Choline Bitartrate: An economical form of choline, and about 40%

<!-- chunk -->

### choline by weight. So 1 gram of Choline Bitartrate offers 400 mg of actual

<!-- chunk -->

### choline. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier as readily as other

<!-- chunk -->

### sources of choline. So you won’t experience the same level of nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits as with Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline.

<!-- chunk -->

## CDP-Choline (cytidine 5′-diphosphocholine): Is only about 18% choline

<!-- chunk -->

## by weight. Your body naturally synthesizes choline into CDP-Choline

<!-- chunk -->

## (Citicoline). It’s then converted to phosphatidylcholine (PC) which is one

<!-- chunk -->

### of two fatty acids that make up the outer layer of cell membranes. And PC

<!-- chunk -->

## provides the choline needed to synthesize acetylcholine (ACh).

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha GPC: About 40% choline by weight and easily crosses the blood-

<!-- chunk -->

### brain barrier. Alpha GPC naturally occurs in your brain as a byproduct of

<!-- chunk -->

## phosphatidylcholine (PC). When your brain needs more choline, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### choline floating around in your brain is running low, it breaks down PC

<!-- chunk -->

### from cell membranes. And turns it into Alpha GPC.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body and brain loves it when you use choline. Because it doesn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### have to cannibalize its own cells to get more choline.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Choline Bitartrate Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline Bitartrate boosts brain health and function in several ways. But


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Choline Bitartrate boosts acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter tied to

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and overall brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline Bitartrate is a precursor to acetylcholine. Improving the efficiency

<!-- chunk -->

### of communications between neurons in your brain. This increase in neural

<!-- chunk -->

### signaling boosts memory, learning, cognitive processing and mental

<!-- chunk -->

### clarity.

<!-- chunk -->

### A research team in the Netherlands set out to determine if choline

<!-- chunk -->

### bitartrate could affect coordination of movement and visual perception. In

<!-- chunk -->

### this study, they worked with a group of 28 people who took 2 grams of

<!-- chunk -->

### choline bitartrate or a placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### An hour and 10 minutes after they took the choline or placebo, they had

<!-- chunk -->

### participants try to hit the center of a target. Participants who took the

<!-- chunk -->

### choline were not only far more accurate at hitting the target center than the

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo group. They also did it faster.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded there was a “choline-induced bias” towards

<!-- chunk -->

### precision, speed and accuracy.

<!-- chunk -->

### They even measured pupil-size in participants. And determined, “The

<!-- chunk -->

### changes in pupil size suggest that choline uptake alters cholinergic

<!-- chunk -->

### functions in the nervous system.”109

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Choline Bitartrate Boosts Memory. Researchers and medical

<!-- chunk -->

### professionals have long known about poor memory in people with a

<!-- chunk -->

### choline deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study at Northwestern University in Chicago tested people with a

<!-- chunk -->

### choline deficiency. They gave them a series of memory tests and found

<!-- chunk -->

### their scores below average.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, they then gave one group extra choline, and the others were

<!-- chunk -->

### given a placebo. After 24 weeks, both groups repeated the memory tests.

<!-- chunk -->

### The group who received extra choline showed a dramatic improvement in

<!-- chunk -->

### memory. The placebo group performed poorly as expected with scores the

<!-- chunk -->

### same as on the original test.110


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, our brain chemistry and energy metabolism changes. This

<!-- chunk -->

### can happen at any age once we enter our adult years.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Brain fog and/or a sense of confusion

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Fatigue or lack of energy

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Unable to learn new things

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Memory loss and poor recall

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Feeling distracted or irritable

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Poor balance

<!-- chunk -->

### And these changes can happen at any age. Our bodies are influenced by the

<!-- chunk -->

### food we eat (and what we don’t eat!), what we drink, lifestyle habits, and

<!-- chunk -->

### even the air we breathe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline Bitartrate can help reverse cognitive decline. It can help you

<!-- chunk -->

### perform better in your work, and at school. By boosting acetylcholine and

<!-- chunk -->

### repairing neural cell membranes.

<!-- chunk -->

## Choline Bitartrate benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Research from hundreds of studies have shown that choline will:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Eliminate brain fog and confusion

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boost energy

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improve learning

<!-- chunk -->

### •Enhance memory and recall

<!-- chunk -->

### •Help focus and reduce irritability

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improve physical performance

<!-- chunk -->

### •Eliminate fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline Bitartrate is water-soluble. After it’s digested it will enter your

<!-- chunk -->

### bloodstream and cross the blood-brain barrier. Once in your brain it boosts

<!-- chunk -->

### neural signal transmission and helps repair neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline Bitartrate improves your brain function and memory by

<!-- chunk -->

### increasing the production of acetylcholine. And prevents neurons from

<!-- chunk -->

### getting cannibalized when your brain is searching for more choline.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Choline Bitartrate feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### After taking Choline Bitartrate you should feel a boost in your ability to

<!-- chunk -->

### think, mood should improve, and your energy level should go up.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline Bitartrate influences the level of acetylcholine in your brain. This

<!-- chunk -->

### crucial neurotransmitter affects memory, cognition, recall and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

### Low levels of choline will leave you with brain fog and an inability to

<!-- chunk -->

### think clearly. You may also experience a drop in mood and some

<!-- chunk -->

### irritability.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re using anything from the racetam-family of nootropics and you

<!-- chunk -->

### experience a headache – your brain is likely starved for choline.


<!-- chunk -->

## Choline Boosts Cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### The Framingham Heart Study is a long-term, ongoing cardiovascular study

<!-- chunk -->

### on residents in the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The study began

<!-- chunk -->

### in 1948 with 5,209 adults. And is now on its 3rd generation of participants.

<!-- chunk -->

### This study of Framingham Offspring involved 1,391 dementia-free

<!-- chunk -->

### subjects. Ages ranged from 36 – 83 years. The participants underwent a

<!-- chunk -->

### food-frequency questionnaire, and MRI brain scan. The study was in two

<!-- chunk -->

### parts, from 1991 to 1995, and 1998 to 2001.

<!-- chunk -->

### Study participants were tested for verbal memory, visual memory, verbal

<!-- chunk -->

### learning and executive function. And a MRI-scan measured brain volume.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study concluded that those residents with a higher choline intake was

<!-- chunk -->

### directly related to significantly better cognitive performance.111

<!-- chunk -->

## Choline Bitartrate Helps with Exercise and Muscle Performance

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline Bitartrate boosts mental energy, focus and concentration. All

<!-- chunk -->

### critical for physical activity and athletic performance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline’s effect on your metabolism and neurotransmitters in the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### produce quicker reaction times. And shorten the time needed for mental

<!-- chunk -->

### processing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline helps improve your energy levels, mood, and recovery time

<!-- chunk -->

### following a workout. It is also critical for muscle nerve function, and in

<!-- chunk -->

### preventing fatigue, muscle aches and pain following a workout.

<!-- chunk -->

### When your muscles move, choline is needed to activate the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). ACh sends signals to muscles, and

<!-- chunk -->

### makes them move.112


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended Choline Bitartrate dosage is 500 mg to 3,000 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can use higher doses of Choline Bitartrate because this is a water-

<!-- chunk -->

### soluble version of choline. And a limited amount of this choline source

<!-- chunk -->

### will cross the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other fat-soluble versions of choline such as Alpha GPC and CDP-Choline

<!-- chunk -->

### will more readily cross the blood-brain barrier and make its way into your

<!-- chunk -->

### cells. So lower doses are required.


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dosages even for extended periods are considered well-

<!-- chunk -->

### tolerated and safe. While Choline Bitartrate is considered non-toxic, it is

<!-- chunk -->

### possible to experience toxicity with too much choline in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you experience trouble sleeping, headache, diarrhea, low or high blood

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure, nausea, blurred vision or chest pain – you should stop using

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline Bitartrate.


<!-- chunk -->

### Choline Bitartrate is sold in capsule or powder form. Capsules are usually

<!-- chunk -->

### 500 mg each. Many of the nootropic stacks available on the market, and

<!-- chunk -->

### even some brand name vitamins contain Choline Bitartrate in their

<!-- chunk -->

### formula.


<!-- chunk -->

## Choline Bitartrate 500 – 3,000 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Choline Bitartrate as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Choline Bitartrate on its own. But some versions

<!-- chunk -->

### of choline naturally occur in your body and brain. Choline sources like

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC and CDP-Choline.

<!-- chunk -->

### You do get some choline from the food you eat. But studies show we don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### get an adequate supply of choline from food sources in our modern diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline Bitartrate is especially helpful for those suffering from age-

<!-- chunk -->

### related cognitive decline. Studies show supplemental choline helps stop or

<!-- chunk -->

### reverse brain degeneration like Alzheimer’s Disease, and other cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. Especially in the early to mid-stages of the disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### We suggest starting with a dose of 500 to 1,000 mg daily. Choline

<!-- chunk -->

### Bitartrate is a good compliment to a stack including any nootropics from

<!-- chunk -->

### the racetam-family.

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam for example affects your neuroreceptors for acetylcholine. So

<!-- chunk -->

### stacking Piracetam and Choline Bitartrate boosts acetylcholine activity

<!-- chunk -->

### even more.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re on a tight budget and you need choline, Choline Bitartrate is a

<!-- chunk -->

### great place to start. It is the most affordable version of Choline available.

<!-- chunk -->

### Particularly when purchased in bulk powder form. You just need more of it

<!-- chunk -->

### than other choline sources like Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline.

<!-- chunk -->

### Use Choline Bitartrate at a ratio of 6:1. For example, 1,000 mg of Choline

<!-- chunk -->

### Bitartrate with 6,000 mg of Piracetam. If you get a racetam-headache add

<!-- chunk -->

### more choline to your stack.


# Choline Citrate

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline Citrate is known to increase cognition and brain function, improve

<!-- chunk -->

### focus and motivation, and reduce fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

## Choline Citrate is choline combined with citrate which is an ester of citric

<!-- chunk -->

### acid. Binding choline to citrate contributes to the synthesis of

<!-- chunk -->

## acetylcholine (ACh) in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## The two precursors required for acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis are Choline

<!-- chunk -->

## (2-hydroxy-N,N,N-trimethyl-ethanaminium) and the enzyme acetyl-

<!-- chunk -->

## Coenzyme A (Acetyl-CoA).

<!-- chunk -->

### Citrate is a citric acid ester which provides a third of the acetyl groups

<!-- chunk -->

### used in the acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis process.113 You can get citric

<!-- chunk -->

### acid from citrus fruit like lemons and limes.

<!-- chunk -->

### And citrate plays another important role in the brain. Citrate is an

<!-- chunk -->

## intermediate in the Krebs cycle (also known as the TCA cycle or

<!-- chunk -->

### Tricarboxylic Acid cycle, or Citric acid cycle).

<!-- chunk -->

### Citrate synthase catalyzes the condensation of oxaloacetate with acetyl

<!-- chunk -->

## CoA to form citrate. Citrate then acts as the substrate for aconitase and is

<!-- chunk -->

### converted in aconitic acid. This cycle ends with the regeneration of

<!-- chunk -->

### oxaloacetate.

<!-- chunk -->

### This series of chemical reactions is the source of 2/3’s of the energy we

<!-- chunk -->

### get from food. Most of the energy made available by these steps is

<!-- chunk -->

## transferred to form NADH. Which then drives adenosine triphosphate

<!-- chunk -->

### (ATP) synthesis within mitochondria and provides the energy needed for

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells.114

<!-- chunk -->

### Now let’s go back to acetylcholine for a minute. Your brain uses

<!-- chunk -->

### older adults between 60 and 85 years.

<!-- chunk -->

### After fasting overnight, the subjects received 50 mg of a choline

### choline concentration in the blood. And proton magnetic resonance

<!-- chunk -->

### spectroscopy (1H-MRS) was performed to determine the relative

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration of cytosolic choline-containing compounds in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Both tests were done before, and 3 hours after choline supplementation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Levels of choline in the blood and brain of study subjects were similar

### before choline supplementation.

<!-- chunk -->

### But after choline supplementation, the younger subjects showed a 60%

<!-- chunk -->

### increase of choline in their blood and brain. The older subjects showed

### only a 16% increase in choline levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded circulating choline in the brain decreases with

### And the citric acid part of Choline Citrate is a critical part of the KREBS

<!-- chunk -->

### cycle in your brain cells. Leading to support of brain cell energy

<!-- chunk -->

### production within mitochondria. Providing you with mental energy and

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminating fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Choline Citrate feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### After taking Choline Citrate you should feel a boost in your ability to

<!-- chunk -->

### think, mood should improve, and your energy level should go up.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline Citrate influences the level of acetylcholine in your brain. This

<!-- chunk -->

### crucial neurotransmitter affects memory, cognition, recall and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

### Low levels of choline will leave you with brain fog and an inability to

<!-- chunk -->

### think clearly. You may also experience a drop in mood and some

<!-- chunk -->

### irritability.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re using anything from the racetam-family of nootropics and you

<!-- chunk -->

### experience a headache – your brain is likely starved for choline.


<!-- chunk -->

## Choline Boosts Cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### The Framingham Heart Study is a long-term, ongoing cardiovascular study

<!-- chunk -->

### on residents in the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The study began

<!-- chunk -->

### in 1948 with 5,209 adults. And is now on its 3rd generation of participants.

<!-- chunk -->

### This study of Framingham Offspring involved 1,391 dementia-free

<!-- chunk -->

### subjects. Ages ranged from 36 – 83 years. The participants underwent a

<!-- chunk -->

### food-frequency questionnaire, and MRI brain scan. The study was in two

<!-- chunk -->

### parts, from 1991 to 1995, and 1998 to 2001.

<!-- chunk -->

### Study participants were tested for verbal memory, visual memory, verbal

<!-- chunk -->

### learning and executive function. And a MRI-scan measured brain volume.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study concluded that those residents with higher choline intake

<!-- chunk -->

### demonstrated significantly better cognitive performance.119

<!-- chunk -->

## Choline Citrate Helps with Exercise and Muscle Performance

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline Citrate boosts mental energy, focus and concentration. All critical

<!-- chunk -->

### for physical activity and athletic performance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline’s effect on your metabolism and neurotransmitters in the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### produce quicker reaction times. And shorten the time needed for mental

<!-- chunk -->

### processing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline helps improve your energy levels, mood, and recovery time

<!-- chunk -->

### following a workout. It is also critical for muscle nerve function, and in

<!-- chunk -->

### preventing fatigue, muscle aches and pain following a workout.

<!-- chunk -->

### When your muscles move, choline is needed to activate the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). ACh sends signals to muscles, and

<!-- chunk -->

### makes them move.120

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers found that providing 2 grams of choline prior to exercise

<!-- chunk -->

### prevented a fall in choline levels. And raised choline levels above baseline

<!-- chunk -->

### values for up to 2 hours after exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

## The researchers found that choline citrate and choline bitartrate were

<!-- chunk -->

### equally effective. One randomized, placebo-controlled study found

<!-- chunk -->

### improvements in running times by a significant amount over a 20-mile

<!-- chunk -->

### course when compared to those using a placebo.121


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended Choline Citrate dosage is 500 mg to 3,000 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can use higher doses of Choline Citrate because this is a water-soluble

<!-- chunk -->

### version of choline. And a limited amount of this choline source will cross

<!-- chunk -->

### the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have found that age has a significant effect on choline uptake into

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain. So older neurohackers are encouraged to use larger doses of

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline Citrate compared to younger neurohackers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Note that other fat-soluble versions of choline such as Alpha GPC and

<!-- chunk -->

### CDP-Choline will more readily cross the blood-brain barrier and make its

<!-- chunk -->

### way into your cells. So lower doses are required.


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dosages even for extended periods are considered well-

<!-- chunk -->

### tolerated and safe. While Choline Citrate is considered non-toxic, it is

<!-- chunk -->

### possible to experience toxicity with too much choline in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you experience trouble sleeping, headache, diarrhea, low or high blood

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure, nausea, blurred vision or chest pain – you should stop using

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline Citrate. Or reduce your dose.


<!-- chunk -->

### Choline Citrate is sold in capsule or powder form. Capsules are usually

<!-- chunk -->

### 500 – 650 mg each. Some ready-made nootropic stacks, and even some

<!-- chunk -->

### brand name vitamins contain Choline Citrate in their formula.


<!-- chunk -->

## Choline Citrate 500 – 3,000 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Choline Citrate as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Choline Citrate on its own. But some versions of

<!-- chunk -->

### choline naturally occur in your body and brain. Choline sources like Alpha

<!-- chunk -->

### GPC and CDP-Choline.

<!-- chunk -->

### You do get some choline from the food you eat. But studies show we don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### get an adequate supply of choline from food sources in our modern diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### And as we age, our bodies have a difficult time using the choline we get

<!-- chunk -->

### from food.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline Citrate is especially helpful for those suffering from age-related

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive decline. Studies show supplemental choline helps stop or reverse

<!-- chunk -->

### brain degeneration like Alzheimer’s Disease, and other cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. Especially in the early to mid-stages of the disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest starting with a dose of 500 to 1,000 mg daily. Choline Citrate is a

<!-- chunk -->

### good compliment to a stack with any nootropics from the racetam-family.

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam for example affects your neuroreceptors for acetylcholine. So

<!-- chunk -->

### stacking Piracetam and Choline Citrate boosts acetylcholine activity even

<!-- chunk -->

### more.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re on a tight budget and you need choline, Choline Citrate is a great

<!-- chunk -->

### place to start. It is one of the most affordable versions of Choline

<!-- chunk -->

### available. Particularly when purchased in bulk powder form. You just need

<!-- chunk -->

### more of it than other choline sources like Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline.

<!-- chunk -->

### Use Choline Citrate at a ratio of 1:6. For example, 1,000 mg of Choline

<!-- chunk -->

### Citrate with 6,000 mg of Piracetam. If you get a racetam-headache add

<!-- chunk -->

### more choline to your stack.


# CDP-Choline (Citicoline)

<!-- chunk -->

### CDP-Choline is known to increase cognition and brain function, improve

<!-- chunk -->

### focus and motivation, and reduce fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

## CDP-Choline (Cytidine Diphosphate Choline or cytidine 5’-

<!-- chunk -->

## diphosphocholine) is also known as Citicoline. This naturally occurring

<!-- chunk -->

### choline source is present in every cell in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### CDP-Choline is unique as a choline source. Once it’s digested it separates

<!-- chunk -->

## into cytidine and choline. When it gets to your brain it converts back to

<!-- chunk -->

### CDP-Choline.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline is considered an essential nutrient because your body uses it faster

<!-- chunk -->

### than it can produce it. So you need to supplement choline either from food

<!-- chunk -->

### or a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### You need choline for the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### And to form phosphatidylcholine (PC), used in building cell membranes.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, choline is so vital to cognition and nerve function that, without it,

<!-- chunk -->

### we couldn’t move, think, sleep or remember anything.

<!-- chunk -->

## This choline is needed to synthesize the neurotransmitter acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

## (ACh). ACh is a primary neurotransmitter released by neurons. This

<!-- chunk -->

### electrical signaling between neurons is involved in memory, learning,

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition and recall.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cytidine is a component of Ribonucleic acid (RNA). This molecule is

<!-- chunk -->

### involved in coding, decoding, regulation and the expression of genes. But

<!-- chunk -->

### once it gets into the brain, it converts to uridine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The signaling going on between neurons tends to grab choline molecules

<!-- chunk -->

### from cell membranes when choline is in short supply. This is where

<!-- chunk -->

### uridine steps in. It repairs those same cell membranes. To maintain neuron

<!-- chunk -->

### integrity.

<!-- chunk -->

## CDP-Choline vs. Alpha GPC vs. Choline Bitartrate: What’s the

<!-- chunk -->

## Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline is a water-soluble nutrient similar in composition to B-vitamins.

<!-- chunk -->

### CDP-Choline, Alpha GPC, Choline Citrate and Choline Bitartrate are all

<!-- chunk -->

### sources of choline.

<!-- chunk -->

## CDP-Choline (cytidine 5′-diphosphocholine): Is about 18% choline by

<!-- chunk -->

### weight and easily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Your body naturally

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesizes choline into CDP-Choline (Citicoline) in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taken as a supplement, it’s then converted to cytidine and choline in your

<!-- chunk -->

## gut. Once it crosses the blood-brain barrier it’s converted back to CDP-

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline. The choline then assists cell membranes and helps create

<!-- chunk -->

## acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The added benefit of CDP-Choline is with cytidine. Cytidine can convert

<!-- chunk -->

## into uridine which is critical in the brain. Uridine is needed to synthesize

<!-- chunk -->

## the phosphatidylcholine (PC) in neuron membranes. It helps repair


<!-- chunk -->

## Choline Bitartrate: An economical form of choline, and about 40%

<!-- chunk -->

### choline by weight. So 1 gram of Choline Bitartrate offers 400 mg of actual

<!-- chunk -->

### choline. It does not easily cross the blood-brain barrier. So you won’t

<!-- chunk -->

### experience the same level of nootropic benefits as with Alpha GPC or

<!-- chunk -->

### CDP-Choline.

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha GPC: About 40% choline by weight and easily crosses the blood-

<!-- chunk -->

### brain barrier. Alpha GPC naturally occurs in your brain as a byproduct of

<!-- chunk -->

## phosphatidylcholine (PC). When your brain needs more choline, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### choline floating around in your brain is running low, it breaks down PC

<!-- chunk -->

### from cell membranes. And turns it into Alpha GPC.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body and brain loves it when you use Alpha GPC. Because it doesn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### have to cannibalize its own cells to get more choline.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does CDP-Choline Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### CDP-Choline boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.CDP-Choline is metabolized in the gut wall and liver to form

<!-- chunk -->

## choline and cytidine. Once choline and cytidine cross the blood-

<!-- chunk -->

### barrier they re-synthesize back into CDP-Choline (Citicoline).122

<!-- chunk -->

### In the brain choline aids in the synthesis of acetylcholine. And the release

<!-- chunk -->

### of dopamine.123 Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.CDP-Choline helps repair neural membranes. Choline is a precursor

<!-- chunk -->

### to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in your brain. ACh

<!-- chunk -->

### carries nerve impulses across synapses. And then is broken down by

<!-- chunk -->

### enzymes.

<!-- chunk -->

### ACh is then reassembled for reuse. But this breakdown/reassembly

<!-- chunk -->

### process isn’t foolproof. Some ACh gets lost in the process. So your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### goes looking for more choline to make ACh.

<!-- chunk -->

### If there isn’t enough choline in your blood, it gets it from the

<!-- chunk -->

### phosphatidylcholine (PC) that makes up the outside of the cell membrane

<!-- chunk -->

### of your neurons. The PC in the cell membrane releases choline to help

<!-- chunk -->

### make acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### When your neurons lose too much choline, they lose integrity. Nerve

<!-- chunk -->

### impulses break down, and cognitive abilities decline.124

<!-- chunk -->

## Scientists in the lab at MIT showed that this is where uridine steps in. The

<!-- chunk -->

### cytidine in CDP-Choline converts to uridine in your body. And it works as

<!-- chunk -->

### a bridge between choline and neuron membrane synthesis.

<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine is needed to synthesize the PC in neuron membranes. It is first

<!-- chunk -->

### converted to CDP-Choline. Which is then synthesized into new PC. This

<!-- chunk -->

### new PC can then repair damaged neuron membranes. Membranes that

<!-- chunk -->

### were raided to make acetylcholine.125


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, our brain chemistry and energy metabolism changes. This

<!-- chunk -->

### can happen at any age once we enter our adult years.


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Acetylcholine levels decline126

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes can happen at any age. And our bodies are influenced

<!-- chunk -->

### by the food we eat, what we drink, lifestyle habits, the air we breathe and

<!-- chunk -->

### more.

<!-- chunk -->

### So CDP-Choline can help for age-related cognitive decline, as well as a

<!-- chunk -->

### student looking to do better in school. By boosting acetylcholine and

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine. And rebuilding neurons in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## CDP-Choline benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Research from hundreds of studies have shown that CDP-Choline will:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boost cognition127

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increase brain energy and speed up formation of brain membranes128

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boost production of acetylcholine129

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increase blood flow to the brain130

<!-- chunk -->

### •Offset the harmful effects of stroke131

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improve memory and learning ability132

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boost cognitive performance and memory in Alzheimer’s patients133

<!-- chunk -->

### CDP-Choline is water-soluble and quickly enters your brain after you take

<!-- chunk -->

### it. In fact, studies show it has nearly 100% bioavailability in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Take it orally or intravenously and your body absorbs the same amount.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once in your brain it boosts signal transmission, and repairs neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### CDP-Choline improves your brain function and memory by directly

<!-- chunk -->

### increasing levels of acetylcholine and dopamine. And repairs neurons at

<!-- chunk -->

### the same time.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does CDP-Choline feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### The most profound indication of the power of this supplement is with

<!-- chunk -->

### those who have suffered a stroke.

<!-- chunk -->

### Stroke survivors report that after continued usage of CDP-Choline, most

<!-- chunk -->

### of the noticeable effects of the stroke are gone. Including muscle paralysis

<!-- chunk -->

### and weakness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report they are better able to concentrate and focus. And

<!-- chunk -->

### experience a significant boost in cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can feel more mentally alert. And you may even ease the fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with clinical depression by using CDP-Choline.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some use CDP-Choline as an alternative to the stimulants prescribed for

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD.


<!-- chunk -->

### In a study at the University of Utah, 75 healthy males were given 250 mg,

<!-- chunk -->

### 500 mg of CDP-Choline, or a placebo. Tests were recorded after 28 days of

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation.

<!-- chunk -->

### The adolescent males receiving 250 or 500 mg of CDP-Choline showed

<!-- chunk -->

### improved attention and psychomotor speed. And reduced impulsivity

<!-- chunk -->

### compared to adolescent males who received placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### This study indicates CDP-Choline is effective even in younger age groups.

<!-- chunk -->

### And can be particularly helpful to those dealing with ADHD.134

<!-- chunk -->

## CDP-Choline Enhances Cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### A study published in Food and Nutrition Sciences assessed the potential

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive-enhancing effects of Citicoline (CDP-Choline) in healthy, adult

<!-- chunk -->

### women.

<!-- chunk -->

### This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial worked with

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy women from 40 – 60 years old. Each volunteer was given a daily

<!-- chunk -->

### dose of 250 mg or 500 mg of Citicoline, or a placebo for 28 days.

<!-- chunk -->

### The women who took either dose of Citicoline for 28 days showed a

<!-- chunk -->

### significant improvement in cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers suggested that Citicoline may improve attentional

<!-- chunk -->

### performance in middle-aged women. And it might eliminate the attention

<!-- chunk -->

### deficits associated with central nervous system disorders (i.e. ADHD).

<!-- chunk -->

## CDP-Choline Improves Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Japan studied 16 men and women who were given either

<!-- chunk -->

### 500 mg or 2000 mg of Citicoline for 6 weeks. Magnetic resonance

<!-- chunk -->

### spectroscopy (MRS) was used to study the brains of the participants at the

<!-- chunk -->

### end of the study.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team found ATP in the neurons of those in the study

<!-- chunk -->

### increased by over 14%. And membrane phospholipids were boosted by

<!-- chunk -->

### over 32%. These finding were in specific areas of the brain associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition. And the effect was even more pronounced in the group that

<!-- chunk -->

### received the lower dose of Citicoline.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that Citicoline supplementation could help

<!-- chunk -->

### prevent cognitive decline associated with aging. Along with an increase in

<!-- chunk -->

### brain energy reserves and utilization. And an increase in the components

<!-- chunk -->

### needed to synthesize and maintain cell membranes.


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended CDP-Choline dosage is 250 - 500 mg per day. Taken no

<!-- chunk -->

### more than twice per day. Two daily doses would be one CDP-Choline dose

<!-- chunk -->

### in the morning, and one in the early afternoon.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re adding CPD-Choline to your stack with a racetam, a typical ratio

<!-- chunk -->

### would be 250 mg of Citicoline to 1 gram of Aniracetam or 4 grams of

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam.


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dosages even for extended periods are considered well-

<!-- chunk -->

### tolerated and safe. While CDP-Choline is considered non-toxic, it is

<!-- chunk -->

### possible to experience toxicity with too much choline in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you experience trouble sleeping, headache, diarrhea, low or high blood

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure, nausea, blurred vision or chest pain – you should stop using

<!-- chunk -->

### CDP-Choline.


<!-- chunk -->

### CDP-Choline is sold in capsule and powder form. Capsules are usually

<!-- chunk -->

### – 500 mg each. 500 mg of CDP-Choline in powder form is equivalent to 2-

<!-- chunk -->

### level 1/8 tsp scoops.


<!-- chunk -->

## CDP-Choline 250 - 500 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using CDP-Choline as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### CDP-Choline is brain food. And is a natural substance found in every cell

<!-- chunk -->

### in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can get choline from some of the food you eat. But adequate levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### CDP-Choline are only found in organ meats like liver. So to get its

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits you must take it as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### CDP-Choline is vital to maintaining optimal brain health. And has been

<!-- chunk -->

### shown to increase cognitive energy, boost brain function, enhance

<!-- chunk -->

### communication between neurons, and protect neural membranes from free

<!-- chunk -->

### radical damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest starting with a dose of 250 – 500 mg daily. And CDP-Choline is a

<!-- chunk -->

### great compliment to stack with any nootropic from the racetam-family.

<!-- chunk -->

### Anything that causes an increase in uptake of acetylcholine in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### You need to provide your brain with the CDP-Choline it is demanding. Or

<!-- chunk -->

### it starts cannibalizing your own brain cells to make more acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Signs that you’re lacking adequate choline are headaches.

<!-- chunk -->

### Use CDP-Choline at a ratio of 1:4. For example, 250 mg of CDP-Choline

<!-- chunk -->

### to 1,000 mg of Aniracetam.

<!-- chunk -->

### Stroke survivors may want to up the dose to 2,000 mg per day.


# Centrophenoxine

<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine helps boost cognition & memory and has significant

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-aging benefits preventing and reversing neuronal decay

<!-- chunk -->

## Centrophenoxine (Lucidril® or meclofenoxate) is one of the original

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics. Developed in France in 1959, Centrophenoxine is a

<!-- chunk -->

## combination of DMAE (dimethylethanolamine) and pCPA

<!-- chunk -->

### (parachlorphenoxyacetic acid).

<!-- chunk -->

## DMAE is an amine produced in small amounts in your brain. By

<!-- chunk -->

### preventing the use of choline by other tissues (including synthesis into

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine), DMAE increases choline levels in the bloodstream.

<!-- chunk -->

## pCPA is a synthetic version of auxins (plant growth hormones). Auxins act

<!-- chunk -->

### like natural growth factor in plants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once digested, Centrophenoxine breaks down into DMAE and pCPA in the

<!-- chunk -->

### liver. This combination was found to make DMAE more bioavailable in

<!-- chunk -->

### the body. And helps DMAE cross the blood-brain barrier more readily.

<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine can increase your brain energy levels by boosting oxygen

<!-- chunk -->

### flow. It helps flush out dangerous free radicals and cellular waste. And

<!-- chunk -->

### may help improve memory and cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

## Centrophenoxine vs. DMAE: What’s the Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

## DMAE is used to make Centrophenoxine. DMAE is found in small

<!-- chunk -->

### amounts in your brain. A good food source of DMAE is fish.

<!-- chunk -->

### But there is little evidence that DMAE as a supplement actually crosses

<!-- chunk -->

### the blood-brain barrier. And if it provides the brain enough choline

<!-- chunk -->

### needed to make acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine seems to solve the blood-brain barrier problem. Adding

<!-- chunk -->

## pCPA to DMAE helps DMAE enter your brain. And this combination also

<!-- chunk -->

### seems to be an effective way to boost acetylcholine for some neurohackers.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re considering adding DMAE to your stack, Centrophenoxine may

<!-- chunk -->

### be a better alternative.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Centrophenoxine Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two


<!-- chunk -->

### 1.Centrophenoxine helps improve memory.135 One study shows it does

<!-- chunk -->

## it by boosting acetylcholine (ACh) in your brain by increasing the

<!-- chunk -->

### enzyme acetylcholinesterase.136

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers set out to prove this in a clinical trial using lab rats. In

<!-- chunk -->

### this study they compared Centrophenoxine with DMAE. And

<!-- chunk -->

### determined that DMAE was about half as potent as Centrophenoxine

<!-- chunk -->

### in boosting choline and ACh levels.137

<!-- chunk -->

### Increased acetylcholine activity helps short-term memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration, and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.Centrophenoxine takes out the cellular trash. Lipofuscin are more

<!-- chunk -->

### commonly known as age pigments.138 They show up as “age spots”

<!-- chunk -->

### or “liver spots” on aging skin. And they hide in cells throughout

<!-- chunk -->

### your body. Including your brain, liver, kidneys, heart, adrenals and

<!-- chunk -->

### nerve cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lipofuscin are the product of oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids.

<!-- chunk -->

### They also contain other cellular heavy metal waste like mercury and

<!-- chunk -->

### aluminum.

<!-- chunk -->

### The buildup of this toxic mess is caused by a breakdown of your

<!-- chunk -->

### normal cellular waste disposal function. Centrophenoxine helps

<!-- chunk -->

### remove lipofuscin from brain cells. And from cells throughout your

<!-- chunk -->

### body.

<!-- chunk -->

### The beneficial effects of Centrophenoxine were observed in several

<!-- chunk -->

### lab studies on older animals. Administration to these animals

<!-- chunk -->

## significantly increased life-span, and it boosted learning ability

<!-- chunk -->

### compared to age-matched controls.139


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Brain cell membranes degenerate from toxic buildup

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Memory, recall, reaction time and mood diminish


<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases of aging. Including Alzheimer’s and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### But even if you’re not concerned with anti-aging, Centrophenoxine may be

<!-- chunk -->

### of some help.

<!-- chunk -->

## Centrophenoxine benefits

<!-- chunk -->

## Centrophenoxine is one of the oldest and most studied nootropics

<!-- chunk -->

### available today. It was developed in France in 1959. Primarily in the

<!-- chunk -->

### search for something to combat age-related cognitive decline.

<!-- chunk -->

## Centrophenoxine is a combination of pCPA and DMAE. Studies show that

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE can boost choline levels by inhibiting the use of choline by other

<!-- chunk -->

### tissues. But there’s very little evidence that it can cross the blood-brain

<!-- chunk -->

### barrier. pCPA seems to solve that transport problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine is water-soluble and quickly enters your brain after you

<!-- chunk -->

### take it. Once in your brain, it boosts signal transmission, and protects


<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine gets to work right away boosting available choline. And

<!-- chunk -->

### it gets busy clearing cells of free radicals and lipofuscin.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Centrophenoxine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine offers a gentle brain energy boost when you take it first

<!-- chunk -->

### thing in the morning. You’re able to remember things a little easier. Recall

<!-- chunk -->

### when you need it seems effortless.

<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine works well stacked with Aniracetam, Noopept, and

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam. It may provide some of the extra acetylcholine racetams

<!-- chunk -->

### demand when you take them.

<!-- chunk -->

### And if you dose half in the morning, and the other half early afternoon,

<!-- chunk -->

### you should feel a brain energy boost throughout your day.


<!-- chunk -->

## Centrophenoxine Relieves the Symptoms of ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### A prescription form of DMAE called Deanol was used in the 1960’s and

<!-- chunk -->

### 70’s to treat learning and behavioral problems in children. What’s now

<!-- chunk -->

## known as ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### A 3-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 74 children

<!-- chunk -->

### was conducted in 1975. They were split into groups and given 40 mg. of

<!-- chunk -->

### Ritalin or 500 mg of Deanol (DMAE). Positive results from this trial

<!-- chunk -->

### showed DMAE comparable to Ritalin in effectiveness in controlling

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD.140

<!-- chunk -->

## Centrophenoxine is Anti-Aging

<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine is not only an effective cognition booster, it helps

<!-- chunk -->

### reverse the effects of aging in your brain. Much of brain cell membrane is

<!-- chunk -->

### made of phospholipids (fat). And it oxidizes as we age. In other words,

<!-- chunk -->

### free radicals build up. And are not removed from cells efficiently the older

<!-- chunk -->

### we get.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aging brain cells also get clogged up with lipofuscin. Lipofuscin are the

<!-- chunk -->

### product of oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. They also contain other

<!-- chunk -->

### cellular heavy metal waste like mercury and aluminum. You see lipofuscin

<!-- chunk -->

### show up as ‘age spots’ on older skin. The same thing happens in your


<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have shown that Centrophenoxine helps ‘flush out’ free radicals

<!-- chunk -->

### and lipofuscin from brain cells.141 And used by younger neurohackers,

<!-- chunk -->

### helps this cellular waste from building up in the first place.142

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Hungary conducted a double-blind clinical trial with

<!-- chunk -->

### people suffering from dementia. Average age was 77 years. They gave one

<!-- chunk -->

### group 2 grams of Centrophenoxine for 8 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### They found that Centrophenoxine rehydrated ‘intracellular mass’. Proving

<!-- chunk -->

### this compound as a powerful free radical scavenger. It removed free

<!-- chunk -->

### radicals from aging brain cells. And restored them to a healthy state.143

<!-- chunk -->

### In another study in India, researchers worked with male Wistar rats aged 4,

<!-- chunk -->

### 8, 16 and 24 months. They used these ages because they correlate with

<!-- chunk -->

### human aging from young to elderly.

<!-- chunk -->

### Just like in humans, lipid oxidation and lipofuscin concentration increased

<!-- chunk -->

### with age. The experiment also showed that cellular free radical damage

<!-- chunk -->

### and lipofuscin buildup happened at the same time.

<!-- chunk -->

### This buildup of cellular waste contributes to age-related decline in

<!-- chunk -->

### neuronal electrical activity (neural signaling). Cognition, memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### learning are all affected. The research team found that Centrophenoxine

<!-- chunk -->

### had no effect on younger rat brains. But in the two older age groups they

<!-- chunk -->

### saw a significant decrease in lipid oxidation and lipofuscin concentration.

<!-- chunk -->

### Showing conclusively the anti-aging action of Centrophenoxine.144

<!-- chunk -->

## Centrophenoxine Improves Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine boosts neuronal glucose and oxygen uptake in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### And helps the production of RNA and protein. RNA is derived from DNA

<!-- chunk -->

### in the cell nucleus. And enable neurons to form proteins. Which help

<!-- chunk -->

### encode memory and repair damage to brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### In one double-blind clinical trial, researchers worked with 50 people

<!-- chunk -->

### suffering from ‘dementias of medium level’. They gave the group 2 grams

<!-- chunk -->

### of Centrophenoxine, or a placebo for 8 weeks. 48% of the group that

<!-- chunk -->

### received Centrophenoxine showed improvements in memory.145

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study was made of the effects of Centrophenoxine on the learning

<!-- chunk -->

### and memory of old mice. One group of mice were treated for 3 months and

<!-- chunk -->

### the other group received a placebo. The treated animals showed a

<!-- chunk -->

### significant improvement in memory and learning.146


<!-- chunk -->

## Centrophenoxine dosage is typically 500 mg to 1 gram daily.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re stacking it with a racetam, split your dose. So a 1-gram dose

<!-- chunk -->

### would be 500 mg first thing in the morning, and the other half early

<!-- chunk -->

### afternoon.

<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine seems to help increase choline and possibly

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine synthesis in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## But keep this in mind; Centrophenoxine and DMAE are related to choline.

<!-- chunk -->

### They are not the same as choline. Some neurohackers insist it should not

<!-- chunk -->

### replace a regular choline source like Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline. And I

<!-- chunk -->

### agree with this observation. Centrophenoxine can be stacked with a

<!-- chunk -->

### choline source.

<!-- chunk -->

### And yet some neurohackers take Centrophenoxine as a choline source to

<!-- chunk -->

### include in their racetam stack. Or use it as a nootropic on its own.

<!-- chunk -->

### Experiment and see what works best for you. YMMV.


<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine has been used as a nootropic for nearly 50 years. So it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### safety is well established. It’s non-toxic and should be well tolerated by

<!-- chunk -->

### most neurohackers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some reported side effects include stomach upset, body odor, drowsiness,

<!-- chunk -->

### confusion, increased blood pressure, moderate depression, and

<!-- chunk -->

### irritability.147

<!-- chunk -->

### If you deal with epilepsy or bipolar disorder you should avoid

<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine entirely.

<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine may boost acetylcholine in some people. So an excess of

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine could cause the above-mentioned side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cycling Centrophenoxine with 5 days using it, and a 2-day break should

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminate any acetylcholine toxicity.


<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine comes in powder form and capsules. Capsules are

<!-- chunk -->

### typically 250 – 400 mg.

<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine is water-soluble so it’s not necessary to take it with a fat

<!-- chunk -->

### or oil. You may find it absorbs better or more quickly when taken with

<!-- chunk -->

### food.


<!-- chunk -->

## Centrophenoxine 500 – 1,000 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Centrophenoxine as a nootropic supplement but with

<!-- chunk -->

### some reservation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Centrophenoxine on its own. And it’s not

<!-- chunk -->

## available from food. This nootropic is a combination of DMAE and pCPA

<!-- chunk -->

### and is only available in supplement form.

<!-- chunk -->

## In some countries Centrophenoxine is prescribed as Lucidril® for

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment of Alzheimer’s or age-related cognitive decline.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show Centrophenoxine helps stop or reverse brain degeneration by

<!-- chunk -->

### clearing out free radicals and lipofuscin from brain cells. Making

<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine one of the primary anti-aging nootropics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine may also boost acetylcholine synthesis in your brain for

<!-- chunk -->

### some people. Boosting cognition, memory, recall and learning. But this

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic is NOT a good source of choline to make acetylcholine for most

<!-- chunk -->

### neurohackers.

<!-- chunk -->

### We have much better options for precursors to acetylcholine. Including

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics like Alpha GPC and CDP-Choline.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are going to try Centrophenoxine, I suggest starting with a dose of

<!-- chunk -->

### 500 mg daily. Possibly more depending on your racetam usage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Age-related cognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s may want to up the dose

<!-- chunk -->

### to 2,000 mg per day.


# Coluracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam has been shown to boost long-term & working memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### relieve depression & anxiety, and enhance color & sound perception

<!-- chunk -->

## Coluracetam (BCI-540, or MKC-231) is a fat-soluble nootropic in the

<!-- chunk -->

### racetam-class of compounds. Coluracetam is much more potent than the

<!-- chunk -->

### original racetam, Piracetam.

<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam was patented by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma of Japan in 2005.

<!-- chunk -->

### Making it one of the newest racetam-based nootropics.

<!-- chunk -->

### The patent for coluracetam was later sold to BrainCells, Inc. in San Diego,

<!-- chunk -->

### California. BrainCells is a small, privately-held biopharmaceutical

<!-- chunk -->

### company specializing in developing compounds for the treatment of major

<!-- chunk -->

### depressive disorder (MDD), treatment resistant depression (TRD), and


<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam is similar in structure to Piracetam. And like all racetam

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics, has a pyrrolidone nucleus at its core. The latest clinical

<!-- chunk -->

### research indicates potential for treating depressive disorders, and retinal

<!-- chunk -->

### and optic nerve damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam is a very strong choline targeting supplement. It boosts your

<!-- chunk -->

## brain’s choline conversion to acetylcholine (ACh) through the high

<!-- chunk -->

## affinity choline uptake (HACU) process. Which increases alertness,

<!-- chunk -->

### attention to detail and memory.148

<!-- chunk -->

### Some research, and personal experience shows Coluracetam may affect

<!-- chunk -->

### AMPA receptors.149 Making it a potential ampakine nootropic. Which

<!-- chunk -->

### could explain the stimulant-like effects without the side effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### traditional stimulants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam also shows some anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) qualities helping

<!-- chunk -->

### improve mood and quieting anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

## Neurohackers who have tried Coluracetam say it helps increase attention

<!-- chunk -->

## span, alertness and boosts long-term memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## Coluracetam vs. Piracetam: What’s the Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam, the original racetam that started the nootropic movement, is a

<!-- chunk -->

### cyclic derivative of GABA. It affects the neurotransmitter acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### (ACh) by helping ACh receptors accept or be more sensitive to

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam also boosts acetylcholine in the brain. But through a different

<!-- chunk -->

### mechanism of action. Rather than making the ACh receptors more

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitive to ACh, it actually increases the synthesis of acetylcholine from

<!-- chunk -->

### choline. By affecting the high affinity choline uptake (HACU) process.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Coluracetam Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

### 1.Coluracetam boosts your brain’s choline uptake by targeting and

<!-- chunk -->

### working with the high affinity choline uptake (HACU) process in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain’s neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

## Acetylcholine (ACh) is made up of choline and acetate. These must be

<!-- chunk -->

### available to the neuron terminal at all times. So that ACh can be

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesized whenever it is needed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Free choline circulating in the blood crosses the blood-brain barrier. And

<!-- chunk -->

### is taken up by cholinergic neuron terminals. It gets taken into the neuron

<!-- chunk -->

### by the high affinity choline uptake (HACU) system.150

<!-- chunk -->

### The synthesis of ACh takes place in the synaptic cleft. The space between

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons as it travels into the neuron.

<!-- chunk -->

### The HACU system is temperature-, energy-, and sodium-dependent. This

<!-- chunk -->

### system is the primary means by which choline needed for the synthesis of

<!-- chunk -->

### ACh is transported into the neuron. And is the rate-limiting step in the

<!-- chunk -->

### production of this critical neurotransmitter.151

<!-- chunk -->

### When this system breaks down or doesn’t work as efficiently as it was

<!-- chunk -->

### designed, you experience problems with memory, learning, and brain fog.

<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam affects this process and helps it work more efficiently. In

<!-- chunk -->

### fact, it seems to boost the HACU process. Even in damaged neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Increased acetylcholine in neurons helps improve memory, boosts

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition and provides better decision-making capabilities.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.Coluracetam also seems to improve AMPA potentiation. AMPA

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors are affected by glutamate. Which works in the brain and

<!-- chunk -->

### central nervous system to improve alertness and cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam works with both AMPA potentiation and choline uptake

<!-- chunk -->

### enhancement. This combination seems to help improve mood disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### without affecting serotonin levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) is the current preferred mainstream

<!-- chunk -->

### medical method for dealing with mood disorders and depression. They

<!-- chunk -->

### come with a list of detrimental side effects. And don’t work for every

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed patient.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers reported that Coluracetam was beneficial in treating major

<!-- chunk -->

### clinical depression and anxiety disorder.152 Without affecting serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### levels in the brain. And without the side effects that go with disrupting

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin.


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Conversion of choline to acetylcholine breaks down


<!-- chunk -->

### So Coluracetam can help mood disorders and age-related cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### decline. But it works as well for the student looking to do better in school.

<!-- chunk -->

### By boosting acetylcholine and controlling glutamate in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Coluracetam benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Research from a very limited number of studies have shown that

<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam will:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Restore the synthesis of acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### •Restore long-term memory

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improve working memory

<!-- chunk -->

### •Relieve symptoms of severe depression

<!-- chunk -->

### •Treat symptoms of general anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increase choline uptake even in damaged neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### •Repair retinal and optical nerve damage

<!-- chunk -->

### The benefits from supplementing with Coluracetam seem to be long-

<!-- chunk -->

### lasting. Even after supplementation has stopped.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Coluracetam feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Even with very small doses of Coluracetam you should experience a

<!-- chunk -->

### decrease in anxiety and improved mood. Overall energy levels should go

<!-- chunk -->

### up.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unlike the effect commonly produced by stimulants, Coluracetam offers a

<!-- chunk -->

### more relaxed, calm and free-minded kind of thought-processing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam acts quickly to boost long-term and working memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### word-recall. And many nootropic-users report that colors are crisper, or

<!-- chunk -->

### enhanced. Sound and audio seems to wash through you.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some even report that Coluracetam enhances meditation. There is an

<!-- chunk -->

### extremely pleasant sense of being at peace with the world.


<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam was first discovered the late 1990’s. And because it’s so new,

<!-- chunk -->

### very few clinical trials have been done with humans. Most of the clinical

<!-- chunk -->

### research available to us has been done on animals.

<!-- chunk -->

### BrainCells, Inc., who acquired the patent from the company that first

<!-- chunk -->

### developed Coluracetam, have begun human trials. Here we have two

<!-- chunk -->

### examples of the clinical research done in the last 15 years on animals.

<!-- chunk -->

## Coluracetam Provides Long-lasting Cognition Improvement

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Japan worked with rats whose memory was chemically

<!-- chunk -->

### impaired. In this study, rats were dosed with Coluracetam (MKC-231) for

<!-- chunk -->

### 8 days.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team studied the effects on the high affinity choline uptake (HACU)

<!-- chunk -->

### system of the rats after 8-days of repeated Coluracetam treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

### They reported an increase of HACU activity along with a boost in

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition. And concluded that Coluracetam “could induce long-lasting

<!-- chunk -->

### pro-cognitive effects by changing the choline transporter regulation

<!-- chunk -->

### system”.153

<!-- chunk -->

## Coluracetam Improves Working Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### A study at Iwate Medical University in Japan was done on mice with

<!-- chunk -->

### working memory deficits. In this study, scientists found that Coluracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### improved working memory at all doses tested.

<!-- chunk -->

### They found it significantly reversed an acetylcholine deficit. And

<!-- chunk -->

### concluded that Coluracetam improved memory deficits by boosting high

<!-- chunk -->

### affinity choline uptake (HACU), and the release of acetylcholine.154


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended Coluracetam dosage is 20 - 80 mg per day. So 20 mg would

<!-- chunk -->

### be taken in two 10 mg doses. One Coluracetam dose in the morning, and

<!-- chunk -->

### one in the early afternoon.

<!-- chunk -->

### Higher doses of Coluracetam are based on clinical trials mostly done on

<!-- chunk -->

### animals. When first adding Coluracetam to your stack, most neurohackers

<!-- chunk -->

### start out with a much smaller dose. And see how you react to it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam is typically sold in powder form. Smaller doses are often

<!-- chunk -->

### taken sublingually for faster and better absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

### Since Coluracetam is a fat-soluble nootropic, you should take it with a

<!-- chunk -->

### meal containing healthy fats. Or with a tablespoon of extra virgin, expeller

<!-- chunk -->

### cold-pressed coconut or olive oil. Or other similar healthy fat to ensure

<!-- chunk -->

### quick absorption.


<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam non-toxic. So is considered well-tolerated and safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many first-time users of Coluracetam report fatigue which is often the

<!-- chunk -->

### result from starting with too high a dose.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember, Coluracetam works by enhancing choline uptake in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline is a precursor to the production of acetylcholine. If not enough

<!-- chunk -->

### choline is available in your system, you’ll feel the side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects are rare but can include anxiety, fatigue, headaches,

<!-- chunk -->

### nervousness and nausea. Again, side effects are often a result of unusually

<!-- chunk -->

### high doses of the nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Headaches from using Coluracetam typically happen when you forget to


<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam is usually sold in powder form. A couple of companies offer

<!-- chunk -->

### it in a liquid base making it easier to dose and take sublingually.


<!-- chunk -->

## Coluracetam 20 - 80 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Coluracetam as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does not make Coluracetam on its own. So to get its benefits


<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam is unique among racetams because it is a high affinity choline

<!-- chunk -->

### uptake (HACU) enhancer.

<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam is especially helpful for restoring long-term memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### boosting cognition and better decision-making. All benefits associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with improved choline uptake into neurons. And the improved synthesis of

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Coluracetam also has a strong, albeit brief history of treating major

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. For the healthy neurohacker you’ll get the benefit of a sense of

<!-- chunk -->

### contentment and peace.

<!-- chunk -->

### And as an added bonus, the extra choline activity affects optic nerves. So

<!-- chunk -->

### you may experience enhanced colors and sound.

<!-- chunk -->

### The positive effects of Coluracetam appear to be at least semi-permanent.

<!-- chunk -->

### The benefits continue even after it leaves your system.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should use Coluracetam with a good choline supplement like Alpha

<!-- chunk -->

### GPC or CDP-Choline. It helps boost acetylcholine synthesis, so demands

<!-- chunk -->

### the presence of more choline in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clinical trials say you can safely boost daily intake of Coluracetam to

<!-- chunk -->

### mg. for major depressive disorder if needed. But I suggest starting with

<!-- chunk -->

### mg per day. And increase your doses only after you see how it works in

<!-- chunk -->

### your system.


# Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)

<!-- chunk -->

### Coenzyme Q10 helps create ATP within mitochondria in your brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Boosting energy, cognition, memory and recall

<!-- chunk -->

## Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) (2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decaprenyl-1,4-

<!-- chunk -->

### benzoquinoneis) a natural antioxidant synthesized by your body. It’s also

<!-- chunk -->

## known as “ubiquinone” because it is ‘ubiquitous’ in the human body.

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 is used by every single cell.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body uses CoQ10 faster than it can produce it. So you need

<!-- chunk -->

### supplemental CoQ10 either from food or a supplement. You can get

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 from eating fatty fish, beef, poultry, nuts, seeds, and oils.

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 contributes to your cell’s source of energy. It helps create ATP

<!-- chunk -->

### within your mitochondria by taking fat and other substances and

<!-- chunk -->

### converting them into usable energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Brain cells have a higher concentration of mitochondria than most other

<!-- chunk -->

### cells in your body. These mitochondria are like little power plants inside

<!-- chunk -->

### each cell. They even have their own DNA.

<!-- chunk -->

### The source of life and death for neurons lies in mitochondria. Without

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy mitochondria, the natural function of each cell is damaged. And

<!-- chunk -->

### the life of that cell can come to a premature end.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows CoQ10 prevents oxidative damage in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Protecting the health of your brain cells.155

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 is a powerful antioxidant. It protects your cells from free radical

<!-- chunk -->

### damage. Free radicals are oxygen atoms missing electrons. This makes

<!-- chunk -->

### them highly reactive which wreaks havoc in your tissues and DNA.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxidative damage has been implicated in several neurodegenerative

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and Lou

<!-- chunk -->

### Gehrig (ALS) disease.156

<!-- chunk -->

### Coenzyme Q10 is used throughout your body. It helps produce energy for

<!-- chunk -->

### your cells, boosts heart health, helps maintain healthy blood pressure and

<!-- chunk -->

### immune system, and reduces the signs of aging.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here we’re talking about how CoQ10 affects your brain health and

<!-- chunk -->

### chemistry.

<!-- chunk -->

## CoQ10: Ubiquinone vs. Ubiquinol: What’s the Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

## Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a fat-soluble nutrient produced naturally in

<!-- chunk -->

### your body. The highest concentration of CoQ10 is in organs that require

<!-- chunk -->

## the most energy – including your heart, liver, muscles, kidneys, and brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 is in the mitochondria in your cells. This is where cellular energy

<!-- chunk -->

### occurs. It acts as an electron acceptor or donor in the chain of reactions

<!-- chunk -->

### that lead to cellular energy production.

<!-- chunk -->

## When oxidized CoQ10 (ubiquinone) accepts an electron from another

<!-- chunk -->

## molecule in the chain, it becomes Ubiquinol. And when Ubiquinol donates

<!-- chunk -->

### an electron, it becomes ubiquinone. This state of equilibrium is necessary

<!-- chunk -->

### and how your body benefits from CoQ10.

<!-- chunk -->

### The chemical difference between ubiquinone and Ubiquinol is the

<!-- chunk -->

### Ubiquinol compound contains two hydroxyl groups. This makes it more

<!-- chunk -->

### “hydrophilic”, or easier to dissolve in water. And makes it more

<!-- chunk -->

### bioavailable than ubiquinone.157

<!-- chunk -->

### In Ubiquinol-form, CoQ10 has the ability to scavenge free radicals in the

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria and cell membranes. Sites where free radicals inflict the

<!-- chunk -->

### most damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplement makers have been pushing the Ubiquinol form of CoQ10.

<!-- chunk -->

### They claim it’s the best form because it’s what your body produces

<!-- chunk -->

### naturally. They say it’s absorbed up to 8-times better than other forms of

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10.

<!-- chunk -->

### Real world use however, does not always back up the marketing claims.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some people say they feel fatigue when using Ubiquinol. And only energy

<!-- chunk -->

### when using ubiquinone.

<!-- chunk -->

### You’ll have to experiment and find out what works the best for you. Your

<!-- chunk -->

### body can use both. But ubiquinone is far less expensive than Ubiquinol.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does CoQ10 work in the brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## Coenzyme Q10 boosts brain health in several ways. But two in particular

<!-- chunk -->

### stand out.

<!-- chunk -->

### 1.When you supplement with enough CoQ10, you’re giving your brain

<!-- chunk -->

## cells the fuel it needs to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

<!-- chunk -->

### ATP is the fuel created within mitochondria in your neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are the source of life and death for neurons. They generate

<!-- chunk -->

### your neuron’s energy and control its death. But mitochondria tend to

<!-- chunk -->

### develop defects as we age.

<!-- chunk -->

### As these defects accumulate, mitochondria start to malfunction. This

<!-- chunk -->

### results in a reduction in cellular energy production. And cells die.

<!-- chunk -->

### The result of this dysfunction can be brain fog, cognition problems, poor

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and recall. And ultimately neurodegenerative diseases like

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, stroke and others.158

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show that CoQ10 protects against this cellular damage by raising

<!-- chunk -->

### energy levels. In a study with rats, scientists put CoQ10 in their chow for

<!-- chunk -->

### 10 days before giving them a toxin that caused brain lesions. CoQ10

<!-- chunk -->

### reduced lesions by 30%. And restored energy production in neurons to

<!-- chunk -->

### nearly normal levels.159

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.CoQ10 preserves brain function and fights mental illness and

<!-- chunk -->

### migraines. CoQ10 is essential not only in preventing brain

<!-- chunk -->

### deterioration at a structural level, but in maintaining normal

<!-- chunk -->

### function at all ages.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies are beginning to show some troubling associations between

<!-- chunk -->

## migraine headaches and mental health issues like depression and

<!-- chunk -->

## schizophrenia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists don’t know for sure what causes migraines. But think it may be

<!-- chunk -->

### related to brain energy levels. Studies show that CoQ10 supplementation

<!-- chunk -->

### in children, adolescents and adults had significant decreases in frequency

<!-- chunk -->

### and length of migraines.160

<!-- chunk -->

### Major depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have long been

<!-- chunk -->

### considered separate health issues. Lately, they are being recognized as

<!-- chunk -->

### having mitochondrial dysfunction in common. And higher oxidative stress

<!-- chunk -->

### levels.161

<!-- chunk -->

### Just one of many studies show that depression in older bipolar adults had a

<!-- chunk -->

### significant reduction in symptoms. This was after treatment with 1,200 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### of CoQ10 per day.162


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, the chemistry in our brain cells and energy metabolism


<!-- chunk -->

### But even if things haven’t degenerated to such a debilitating level, CoQ10


<!-- chunk -->

## CoQ10 benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Research from thousands of studies have shown that Coenzyme Q10 will:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boost energy levels and stamina

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reduce fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reduce the possibility of age-related diseases

<!-- chunk -->

### •Lower blood pressure

<!-- chunk -->

### •Lower blood sugar levels

<!-- chunk -->

### •Provide protection and energy to your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boost cerebral blood flow

<!-- chunk -->

## How does CoQ10 feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Optimizing your mitochondria is one the most powerful strategies you

<!-- chunk -->

### have to extend your life. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with the

<!-- chunk -->

### aging process, including many age-related diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

### So when taking CoQ10 you should feel better and more energized.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thinking should be clearer. Less fatigue and stamina improved.

<!-- chunk -->

## Some neurohackers report feeling more fatigue while taking Ubiquinol.

<!-- chunk -->

## And actually feel better taking the less optimized form ubiquinone.


<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 was first isolated from beef hearts at the University of Wisconsin

<!-- chunk -->

### in 1957. Research continued at Merck & Company, Stanford Research

<!-- chunk -->

### Institute, and the University of Texas at Austin. Many studies from around

<!-- chunk -->

### the world have been published since.163

<!-- chunk -->

## CoQ10 can Improve Learning

<!-- chunk -->

### A study at the University of Texas was conducted to find out if

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with CoQ10 or Vitamin E could help older mice learn tasks

<!-- chunk -->

### more quickly. The researchers separated groups of older mice. And gave

<!-- chunk -->

### each mouse either CoQ10, Vitamin E, or both antioxidants for 14 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The mice were run through a battery of tests assessing learning, memory

<!-- chunk -->

### and psychomotor function. The study concluded that CoQ10 combined

<!-- chunk -->

### with Vitamin E working in concert boosted performance in all tests.164

<!-- chunk -->

## CoQ10 Improves Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Neuron death caused by oxidative stress is implicated in a host of

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases. Including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and

<!-- chunk -->

### stroke.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxidative stress is an imbalance between the production of free radicals,

<!-- chunk -->

### and the ability of your body to detoxify the harm caused by free radicals.

<!-- chunk -->

### Exposure to toxins in your everyday environment can cause oxidative


<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at the University of Windsor in Canada demonstrated this

<!-- chunk -->

### effect using human cells in the lab exposed to an herbicide commonly used

<!-- chunk -->

### in North America.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain exposed to this toxin causes apoptosis (programmed cell death)

<!-- chunk -->

### and DNA fragmentation. But scientists found that cells pretreated with

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 prevented oxidative stress and neuron damage.165

<!-- chunk -->

## CoQ10 Reverses Gulf War Illness

<!-- chunk -->

### The profound protective effect of CoQ10 on brain neurons and memory

<!-- chunk -->

### was proven in studies with soldiers who fought in the Persian Gulf War.

<!-- chunk -->

### About one-third of the 700,000 troops deployed during the first Persian

<!-- chunk -->

### Gulf War, have been diagnosed with Gulf War Illness (GWI). Symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### include fatigue, muscle pain, weakness, and decreased cognitive function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gulf War Illness was caused by exposure to pesticides, sarin nerve gas,

<!-- chunk -->

### and other toxins during the war.

<!-- chunk -->

### Forty-six United States Gulf War veterans participated in this randomized,

<!-- chunk -->

### double-blind, placebo-controlled study. All had been diagnosed with GWI.

<!-- chunk -->

### The veterans were given CoQ10 in pill form, or a placebo for 3 ½ months.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers concluded that 80% of those receiving only 100 mg of CoQ10

<!-- chunk -->

### during this study saw improvements with headaches, irritability, recall and

<!-- chunk -->

### muscle pain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The degree of improvement correlated to the degree in which CoQ10 levels

<!-- chunk -->

### in the blood increased.166


<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 can help the mitochondria in your brain, and throughout your body,

<!-- chunk -->

### work more cleanly and efficiently. It reduces oxidative stress and damage

<!-- chunk -->

### to mitochondria. Helping to slow the aging process.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dosing CoQ10 depends on what you’re trying to accomplish. Generally

<!-- chunk -->

### dosing for a healthy adult is 30 – 400 mg daily.

<!-- chunk -->

### •As an antioxidant: 60 – 150 mg daily

<!-- chunk -->

### •Muscle control problems: 300 – 3,000 mg daily

<!-- chunk -->

### •Alzheimer’s Disease: 400 mg daily

<!-- chunk -->

### •Heart Attack recovery: 30 – 600 mg daily

<!-- chunk -->

### •To prevent heart disease: 200 mg daily

<!-- chunk -->

### •Chemotherapy side effects: 50 – 90 mg daily

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improve exercise performance: 50 – 300 mg daily

<!-- chunk -->

### •Male infertility and Peyronie’s disease: 30 – 300 mg daily

<!-- chunk -->

### •Diabetic nerve pain: 400 mg daily

<!-- chunk -->

### •Weight loss: 100 mg daily

<!-- chunk -->

## Note: recommended dosing is for as long as you have symptoms. Work

<!-- chunk -->

### with your doctor and get tested for CoQ10 levels in your blood. Once your

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 level are optimized you can scale back to a maintenance dose.


<!-- chunk -->

### The primary “side effect” of using CoQ10 in your nootropic stack is -

<!-- chunk -->

### you’ll feel better. You should have more energy and thinking should be

<!-- chunk -->

### clearer and faster.

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 may reduce the toxic effect of some chemotherapy drugs. And it

<!-- chunk -->

### may enhance the effectiveness of some blood pressure medications. Which

<!-- chunk -->

### can be good or bad depending on your situation.

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 can reduce the efficacy of a blood thinner like Warfarin. It can also

<!-- chunk -->

### lower blood sugar levels. So needs to be monitored if you have diabetes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Caution is advised when using CoQ10 with aspirin. Especially if you have

<!-- chunk -->

### a bleeding disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Talk to your doctor if you’re on any medication before you start using

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10.

<!-- chunk -->

### A few people who use CoQ10 report rashes, nausea, abdominal pain,

<!-- chunk -->

### dizziness, sensitivity to light, irritability, headache, heartburn or fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some neurohackers say they feel fatigue when using Ubiquinol but not

<!-- chunk -->

### with the less expensive Ubiquinone. Experiment and see what works best

<!-- chunk -->

### for you.


<!-- chunk -->

## There are two types of CoQ10 used in CoQ10 supplements: ubiquinone

<!-- chunk -->

## and Ubiquinol. Some alternative health practitioners advise staying away

<!-- chunk -->

### from ubiquinone because your body has to convert it to Ubiquinol to use

<!-- chunk -->

### it.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re under 25 and in good health, you can likely get the benefit of

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 with the less expensive ubiquinone. Over 25 and you’re better off

<!-- chunk -->

### with Ubiquinol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ubiquinol is identical to 95% of the CoQ10 your body is designed to

<!-- chunk -->

### naturally produce. Which means your body doesn’t have to convert the

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 to use it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some in vitro research shows that Ubiquinol is up to 8-times more

<!-- chunk -->

### bioavailable than other CoQ10 supplements. (“8-times” is likely a bit of

<!-- chunk -->

### an exaggerated marketing claim).

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 comes in liquid and capsule form. Logic says the liquid form is

<!-- chunk -->

### easier to absorb by your body.


<!-- chunk -->

## Coenzyme Q10 200 – 400 mg per pay

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using CoQ10 as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does make some CoQ10 on its own. And from the food you eat.

<!-- chunk -->

### But studies have shown we don’t get an adequate supply of CoQ10 from

<!-- chunk -->

### food sources in our diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 is especially helpful for those suffering from age-related cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### decline. Studies show it helps stop or reverse brain degeneration with

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s Disease, and other cognitive disorders. In any stage of the


<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest starting with a dose of 200 mg daily. And CoQ10 is a great

<!-- chunk -->

### compliment to a stack with any nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### You need to provide your brain mitochondria create the fuel your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells are demanding. Or neurons start to break down from the inside. Signs

<!-- chunk -->

### that your lacking adequate CoQ10 is brain fog, slow thinking, headaches

<!-- chunk -->

### and muscle aches.

<!-- chunk -->

### Age-related cognitive disorders that include muscle control problems may

<!-- chunk -->

### want to up the dose to 3,000 mg per day. But for a limited time until

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 blood levels are stabilized. Work with your doctor.


# Creatine

<!-- chunk -->

### Creatine has been shown to boost cognition and prevent mental fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

## Creatine is one of the most effective cognitive enhancers available. This

<!-- chunk -->

### non-essential amino acid is synthesized in your liver, kidneys and

<!-- chunk -->

## pancreas. And used in your brain to re-charge the Adenosine Triphosphate

<!-- chunk -->

## (ATP) produced within mitochondria in brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

## Creatine is stored in your body as creatine phosphate, or phosphocreatine.

<!-- chunk -->

### And is critical for producing Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) in the

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria of your brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here’s how it works…

<!-- chunk -->

### ATP is the primary energy molecule used in your cells as energy. ATP is

<!-- chunk -->

### your body’s natural fuel source. ATP is broken down to produce

<!-- chunk -->

### biochemical energy throughout your body. Including in your brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### During this biochemical process, ATP loses one of its phosphate

<!-- chunk -->

## molecules. And is changed to adenosine diphosphate (ADP). This is where

<!-- chunk -->

### creatine steps in.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember, creatine is stored in your body as creatine phosphate. It re-

<!-- chunk -->

### charges ADP by donating a phosphate molecule to ADP. Which produces

<!-- chunk -->

### more ATP that can be used to make more energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Without creatine to re-charge ATP, your brain’s cells are literally starved

<!-- chunk -->

### for energy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Creatine Monohydrate vs. Buffered Creatine vs. Creatine Ethyl Ester:

<!-- chunk -->

## What’s the Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s easy to get confused by the many forms of creatine available. And how

<!-- chunk -->

### to know which one works best in your nootropic stack. Well, let’s get past

<!-- chunk -->

### all the marketing hype, and settle this now.

<!-- chunk -->

### Creatine is one of the most well-researched supplements in the world.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thanks in large part to the sports-nutrition world.

<!-- chunk -->

## Creatine monohydrate is the form used in most of the clinical studies on

<!-- chunk -->

### creatine. It’s the gold standard of creatine. And has been proven over

<!-- chunk -->

### decades of use.

<!-- chunk -->

## Buffered creatine is marketed as being able to outperform creatine

<!-- chunk -->

### monohydrate because of its higher pH level. But research does not back up

<!-- chunk -->

### this claim.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in the Exercise and Sport Nutrition Laboratory at Texas A&M

<!-- chunk -->

### University conducted a double-blind study with 36 resistance-trained

<!-- chunk -->

### athletes.

<!-- chunk -->

### They tested creatine monohydrate (Creapure®) against buffered creatine

<!-- chunk -->

### (Kre-Alkalyn®). Following manufacturer’s directions for loading and

<!-- chunk -->

### maintenance phases. And ran the trial for 28-days.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team concluded there was no evidence that supplementing

<!-- chunk -->

### with a buffered form of creatine resulted in fewer side effects. Or that the

<!-- chunk -->

### buffered form was more efficacious and/or safer than creatine

<!-- chunk -->

### monohydrate.167

<!-- chunk -->

## Creatine Ethyl Ester is another form of creatine that is supposed to

<!-- chunk -->

### convert back to usable creatine once in your body. It’s marketed as having

<!-- chunk -->

### better absorption than creatine monohydrate. But the research shows it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### actually less effective. Because once in your body, it’s converted into an

<!-- chunk -->

### inactive form called “creatinine”.168

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom line is don’t overpay for fancy forms of creatine. No matter

<!-- chunk -->

### how good the marketing hype.

<!-- chunk -->

## Creatine monohydrate is still the least expensive and most effective form

<!-- chunk -->

### of creatine available today.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Creatine Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Creatine boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Creatine levels linked to optimal memory ability and retention.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study at the University of New Mexico investigated working memory

<!-- chunk -->

### ability. Or the brain’s ability to hold information for future use. Scientists

<!-- chunk -->

### studied children’s brains aged 7 through 12 using magnetic resonance

<!-- chunk -->

### spectroscopy. And measured various brain neurochemicals.

<!-- chunk -->

## The study found that children with the highest levels of creatine in their

<!-- chunk -->

## brain had a better working memory. And concluded, “… we speculate that

<!-- chunk -->

### higher resting creatine levels may allow for greater in-task activation

<!-- chunk -->

### [and] facilitate processing.”169

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Creatine reduces mental fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study published in Neuroscience Research examined the effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### supplemental creatine on mental fatigue. 24 healthy adults participated in

<!-- chunk -->

### this double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

<!-- chunk -->

## In this study, the adults who took 8 grams of creatine daily for 5-days

<!-- chunk -->

## showed significantly less mental fatigue while performing math than

<!-- chunk -->

### those who took no creatine.170 The research team said that creatine

<!-- chunk -->

### appeared to help increase oxygen utilization in the brain.


<!-- chunk -->

### ATP and creatine are critical to brain function. If you don’t have adequate

<!-- chunk -->

### creatine to recharge ATP, your brain can’t function at its best.

<!-- chunk -->

### And certain genetic disorders can interrupt brain creatine metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Causing significant neurological defects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lack of ATP and creatine will affect neuron repair, and the production and

<!-- chunk -->

### transmission of neurotransmitters.

<!-- chunk -->

### If a creatine deficiency is caused by a genetic defect early in life, it can

<!-- chunk -->

### result in developmental delay, mental retardation, speech disabilities and

<!-- chunk -->

### muscle weakness.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Cognition, memory, recall, reaction time and mood diminish


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Mental health, language and fine motor skills decline171

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes in brain energy metabolism are contributing factors to

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, ALS,

<!-- chunk -->

### epilepsy, and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### But even if you’re not concerned with genetic defects, or the effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### aging, Creatine can help.

<!-- chunk -->

## Creatine benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Study after study shows that creatine supplementation has a significant

<!-- chunk -->

### impact on working memory and intelligence. Both tasks that require

<!-- chunk -->

### mental speed of processing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Creatine supplementation plays a major role in brain energy capacity. And

<!-- chunk -->

### influencing brain performance.

<!-- chunk -->

### You may find it curious that researchers who study cognition and athletic

<!-- chunk -->

### performance seem to favor using vegetarians and vegans. And giving them

<!-- chunk -->

### creatine supplements.

<!-- chunk -->

### They use vegetarians as test subjects because creatine is only found in

<!-- chunk -->

### animal flesh. And vegetarians don’t eat meat.

<!-- chunk -->

### Creatine is not an essential amino acid because we can synthesize it from

<!-- chunk -->

### other amino acids. But amino acids found in plant foods are not

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesized very efficiently. This is the reason why vegetarians have lower

<!-- chunk -->

### creatine levels in their bodies than those of us who eat meat.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our cells run on energy supplied by ATP. We burn ATP energy when using

<!-- chunk -->

### our muscles. But we go through ATP faster when we use our brains.

<!-- chunk -->

### Consider that our brain only makes up about 1 – 3% of our body weight.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the billions of neurons in our brains use 20% of our body’s total ATP-

<!-- chunk -->

### derived energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### ATP energy is used in your brain for neuronal repair. And to produce,

<!-- chunk -->

### package and secrete neurotransmitters. It’s the power behind bioelectrical

<!-- chunk -->

### signals when neurons communicate with each other.

<!-- chunk -->

### During this neuronal activity, ATP loses one of its phosphate molecules.

<!-- chunk -->

### And is changed to ADP. Creatine is needed to recharge ADP by donating a

<!-- chunk -->

### phosphate molecule. So you can use that ATP energy again.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is why every neurohacker should have creatine as part of their


<!-- chunk -->

## How does Creatine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Once you start supplementing with creatine, you should experience

<!-- chunk -->

### improved cognitive function. Thinking will be clearer and faster.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mental energy will get a boost. And you won’t feel mentally wasted after

<!-- chunk -->

### an intense mental workout.

<!-- chunk -->

### Reading should be easier, and you won’t find yourself re-reading that last

<!-- chunk -->

### sentence or paragraph.

<!-- chunk -->

### Overall, you should feel a boost in both physical and cognitive abilities.

<!-- chunk -->

### And an improvement in your sense of well-being. You’ll feel better!


<!-- chunk -->

### Creatine was identified way back in 1832. And science has been

<!-- chunk -->

### researching it in every way possible since then. Thousands of studies have

<!-- chunk -->

### been done on physical and brain health. And how they’re related to

<!-- chunk -->

### creatine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Creatine Boosts Working Memory & Intelligence

<!-- chunk -->

### A research team at the University of Sydney decided to test the effect of

<!-- chunk -->

### creatine supplementation in 45 young adult vegetarians. People who stick

<!-- chunk -->

### to a vegetarian diet are typically deficient in creatine. Because red meat is

<!-- chunk -->

### a main source of this critical nutrient in our diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial they gave some of the young

<!-- chunk -->

### adults 5 grams of creatine once a day for 6 weeks. Then they tested for

<!-- chunk -->

### intelligence and working memory performance.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found that creatine supplementation had a significant

<!-- chunk -->

### positive effect on both working memory and intelligence. Both methods

<!-- chunk -->

### that they used to test the subjects required speed of processing.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team concluded brain energy capacity has a profound

<!-- chunk -->

### influence on brain performance. And that brain energy relies on

<!-- chunk -->

### creatine.172

<!-- chunk -->

## Creatine Increases I.Q & Attention Span

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists at the University of Sunderland in the U.K. conducted a double-

<!-- chunk -->

### blind, placebo-controlled study. Working with 34 healthy men and women

<!-- chunk -->

### with a mean age of 21 years. None of the participants were vegetarian.

<!-- chunk -->

### One group took 5 grams of creatine daily for 2 weeks. And the other group

<!-- chunk -->

### took a placebo. They were tested before supplementation. And then after

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks of using either creatine or the placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### The tests consisted of Memory Scanning, Number-Pair Matching,

<!-- chunk -->

### Sustained Attention and Arrow Flankers, followed by an IQ test. These

<!-- chunk -->

### tests were mentally strenuous by any standard.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that those taking creatine tested much better

<!-- chunk -->

### and showed less mental fatigue than the placebo group. Creatine increased

<!-- chunk -->

### attention span, I.Q, and working memory.173

<!-- chunk -->

## Creatine Repairs Brain Cells

<!-- chunk -->

### Drugs currently used to treat neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s

<!-- chunk -->

### and Alzheimer’s provide temporary relief of symptoms. But do not stop

<!-- chunk -->

### the underlying cause of the disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists are now working on therapies that focus on replacing injured

<!-- chunk -->

### and dead brain cells. And boosting growth factor along with other

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotrophic molecules.

<!-- chunk -->

### These new therapies include developing vaccines. And using compounds

<!-- chunk -->

### like creatine to immunize against these life-threatening diseases.174

<!-- chunk -->

## One thing scientists know for sure is impaired energy metabolism plays a

<!-- chunk -->

## prominent role in many of these neurological diseases. Recent studies

<!-- chunk -->

### show impaired energy production in the brain causes neuron cell death.

<!-- chunk -->

### Optimal levels of ATP are crucial to maintaining healthy brain cells. And

<!-- chunk -->

## creatine is a critical in maintaining cellular energy levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with creatine has been proven for neuroprotection in a

<!-- chunk -->

### wide range of neurodegenerative diseases. Including Parkinson’s, ALS,

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s, stroke and epilepsy.175


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dosage of creatine for nootropic benefit is 5 grams per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show that creatine should be consumed with carbohydrates for best

<!-- chunk -->

### absorption.176

<!-- chunk -->

### The myth that you should not take creatine with caffeine is exactly that – a

<!-- chunk -->

### myth. No reliable study has shown this to be true.


<!-- chunk -->

### Creatine is produced naturally in your body. So is considered well-

<!-- chunk -->

### tolerated and safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### But over-consumption of creatine can be hard on your kidneys and liver.

<!-- chunk -->

### These organs are creatine factories. And too much creatine can overwork

<!-- chunk -->

### them. If you are dealing with liver or kidney problems, talk to your doctor

<!-- chunk -->

### before supplementing with creatine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pure creatine is the safest. But many commercially available creatine

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements contain contaminants. Check the labels carefully. Review the

<!-- chunk -->

### manufacturer’s website and any other material they offer that attests to

<!-- chunk -->

### their quality standards.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other side effects can include mild diarrhea, gas, upset stomach or

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach cramps, muscle cramps, increased urination, headaches, reduced

<!-- chunk -->

### appetite and water weight gain. Usually when using too much creatine. Or

<!-- chunk -->

### during the “loading” phase of creatine supplementation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because creatine causes an energy boost in many neurohackers, avoid

<!-- chunk -->

### dosing in the evening. Or you may find difficulty getting to sleep.


<!-- chunk -->

### The best dietary source of creatine is found in wild game. Other sources

<!-- chunk -->

### include red meat and certain fish.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most common and least expensive form of creatine available as a

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement is in powder form. It’s also available in capsules and a liquid.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend skipping all the creatine nitrates, ethyl esters, malate, HCL’s

<!-- chunk -->

## and others – and stick with creatine monohydrate in powder form.


<!-- chunk -->

## Creatine 5 grams per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Creatine as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does make some creatine on its own. And from the food you

<!-- chunk -->

### eat. But if you’re a vegetarian, or don’t get enough quality creatine in your

<!-- chunk -->

### diet every day, you will benefit by adding creatine to your nootropic stack.

<!-- chunk -->

### Creatine is critical for fueling the activity in your neurons needed for

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition, memory, critical thinking, decision-making and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### Creatine is especially helpful if you’re dealing with fatigue. Or putting

<!-- chunk -->

### unusually high demands on your brain. Resulting in mental fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have shown creatine can help prevent a host of neurodegenerative

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest a dose of 5 grams daily. It takes a while for creatine to build up

<!-- chunk -->

### in your system. So if you’d like to get the benefits faster, load with

<!-- chunk -->

### grams a day for a week. And then pull back to a maintenance dose of

<!-- chunk -->

### grams daily.

<!-- chunk -->

### And Creatine is a great compliment to a stack including any nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### from the racetam-family. Anything that causes an increase in uptake of

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine in your brain. And an increase in mental processing.

<!-- chunk -->

### You need to provide your brain with the fuel it demands. And creatine is a

<!-- chunk -->

### proven way to do it.


# DHEA

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA has been shown to boost cognition, memory, energy levels and

<!-- chunk -->

### motivation.

<!-- chunk -->

## DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is the most abundant natural steroid

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone in your body. It’s sometimes called the “youth hormone”. And is

<!-- chunk -->

### a source of your sex hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA is naturally synthesized in your testes, adrenal glands, and brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s a precursor to DHT and testosterone in men, and estrogen in women.

<!-- chunk -->

### And can activate both androgen and estrogen receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

### Besides making DHEA, your adrenal glands also produce cortisol. Which

<!-- chunk -->

### is in direct competition with DHEA for production. When cortisol is high,

<!-- chunk -->

### especially for prolonged periods of time, your adrenal glands wear out.

<!-- chunk -->

### And DHEA production will decline.

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA can be made in the lab from wild yam and soy. But your body

<!-- chunk -->

### cannot produce DHEA from eating these foods. To boost DHEA you need

<!-- chunk -->

### to take it as a supplement.177

<!-- chunk -->

## DHEA Declines with Age

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body’s natural production of DHEA varies with age. Low levels are

<!-- chunk -->

### produced before puberty. With peak production in your 20’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Between ages 25-30 to 75 your DHEA levels will drop by 80%.178 Affecting

<!-- chunk -->

### everything from alertness, memory, recall, and mood to sex drive. Its

<!-- chunk -->

### decline is even implicated in some neurodegenerative diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

### The age-related variation in DHEA production has led scientists to believe

<!-- chunk -->

## that DHEA could be linked to the aging-process itself.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many athletes use DHEA to increase muscle mass, strength and energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### But DHEA use is banned in the U.S. by the National Collegiate Athletic

<!-- chunk -->

### Association (NCAA). It’s also considered a “banned substance” by the

<!-- chunk -->

### NBA, NFL, and United States Olympic Committee.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Canada, DHEA is considered a ‘drug’ and is only available by

<!-- chunk -->

### prescription. Which says something about the power of DHEA. It’s

<!-- chunk -->

### technically a steroid, which may be why it’s included in with Performance

<!-- chunk -->

### Enhancing Drugs (PEDs).

<!-- chunk -->

### In 2007, the U.S. Congress tried to re-classify DHEA as an “anabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### steroid drug”. Which means this natural human hormone would have only

<!-- chunk -->

### been available as a prescription drug. Fortunately, this legislation never

<!-- chunk -->

### passed and you can still buy DHEA as an OTC supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here we’re talking about how DHEA affects your brain health and

<!-- chunk -->

### chemistry.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does DHEA Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.DHEA boosts working memory. Research has shown that higher

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA levels are directly related to concentration, working memory

<!-- chunk -->

### and executive function (decision-making).

<!-- chunk -->

### A study done in Australia in 2003 and 2004 worked with 295 women aged

<!-- chunk -->

### 21 – 77 years. The researchers set out to investigate whether circulating

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of DHEAS (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) contributed to

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive function.

<!-- chunk -->

### The women in the study went through a comprehensive battery of tests for

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive function, and DHEAS levels. The researchers concluded that,

<!-- chunk -->

### “Higher endogenous DHEAS levels are independently and favorably

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with executive function, concentration, and working

<!-- chunk -->

### memory.”179

<!-- chunk -->

## Note: DHEAS is simply DHEA that is produced with the addition of a

<!-- chunk -->

### sulfate group. Naturally produced in your body, it produces the hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### estrone. DHEAS can be back-converted in the body to DHEA, and both are

<!-- chunk -->

### often simply referred to as DHEA.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.DHEA enhances mood - naturally. DHEA has been found to

<!-- chunk -->

### improve both mood and energy while alleviating depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA may be a good natural alternative to traditional antidepressants. A

<!-- chunk -->

### double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was done at the U.S.

<!-- chunk -->

### National Institutes of Health with 46 men and women. The study subjects

<!-- chunk -->

### had been diagnosed with major or minor depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### The depressed patients went through 6 weeks of DHEA therapy. 90 mg per

<!-- chunk -->

### day for 3 weeks and 450 mg per day for 3 weeks, and 6 weeks of placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### They were then tested using two different Depression Rating scales, and

<!-- chunk -->

### for sexual function.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study found that DHEA offered a significant improvement in

<!-- chunk -->

### depression symptoms. And major improvements in sexual function.

<!-- chunk -->

### In a very rare admission from the conservative National Institutes of

<!-- chunk -->

## Health, “We find DHEA to be an effective treatment for midlife-onset

<!-- chunk -->

## major and minor depression.”180

<!-- chunk -->

## How things go bad:


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Concentration, working memory and executive function decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neuron receptors degenerate

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Adrenals wear out and DHEA levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Appetite regulation, energy and alertness decline

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these age-related changes are influenced by declining DHEA levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### And are contributing factors to neurodegenerative diseases and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA levels are an inevitable consequence of aging. And can contribute

<!-- chunk -->

### to the onset of degenerative disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## DHEA benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### The latest scientific research validates what we know of DHEA’s anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### aging effects. And it’s not just for athletes. DHEA’s neuroprotective

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits are vital to memory and improving mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA supports cardiovascular health and activates genes that prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### cardiovascular health problems, diabetes and obesity. It boosts quality of

<!-- chunk -->

### life and sexual function. It even improves the appearance of younger-

<!-- chunk -->

### looking skin.

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA supplementation can enhance cognitive function and memory, and

<!-- chunk -->

### improve decision-making (executive function). It’s even been shown to

<!-- chunk -->

### decrease brain cell death and promote general cerebral health.181

<!-- chunk -->

## How does DHEA feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### You should experience a noticeable increase in motivation and drive soon

<!-- chunk -->

### after supplementing with DHEA. Especially if your levels are low.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are under constant stress, have chronic fatigue, feel weak, depressed

<!-- chunk -->

### or have a low sex drive – find a Naturopathic practitioner. And have your

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA levels checked.

<!-- chunk -->

### Too many neurohackers suffer unnecessarily from high stress and low

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA production. Don’t be one of those people.


<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA is a steroid hormone and has a strong influence on both brain

<!-- chunk -->

### structure and function. Social and physical stress has severe negative

<!-- chunk -->

### effects in your hippocampus. Affecting memory and orientation.

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA seems to have a neuroprotective role in reducing the toxic effects

<!-- chunk -->

### of glutamate and cortisol elevated by stress. Studies show low DHEA

<!-- chunk -->

### levels in people suffering from major depression. And that if cortisol and

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA are out of balance it will delay recovery from these diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA plays a role in the treatment of depression. Whether its caused by

<!-- chunk -->

### stress or aging. It affects both the cellular structure of the brain and its

<!-- chunk -->

### function.182

<!-- chunk -->

## DHEA Levels Predict How Long You’ll Live

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists in Japan set out to determine if DHEA levels could predict

<!-- chunk -->

### longevity. The study included 948 men and women aged 21 – 88 years. The

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers measured DHEAS levels at the beginning of the study. And

<!-- chunk -->

### periodically for the next 27 years.

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEAS levels were higher in the men than women as expected. DHEA

<!-- chunk -->

### levels were measured along with blood pressure, and blood sugar. Of the

<!-- chunk -->

### three health measures, DHEAS levels in men were the strongest predictor

<!-- chunk -->

### of longevity.

<!-- chunk -->

### It doesn’t matter what your age, blood pressure or blood sugar levels.183

<!-- chunk -->

### This 27-year study concluded that DHEAS levels could be a way to predict

<!-- chunk -->

### how long you’ll live.

<!-- chunk -->

## DHEA Improves Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies in rodents showed DHEA improved cognition. But there were

<!-- chunk -->

### inconsistent findings in humans tying cognition to DHEA

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation. So scientists at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in

<!-- chunk -->

### the U.K. decided to find out for themselves.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this double-blind study, 24 healthy young men were treated with 150 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### per day of DHEA for 7-days. Mood, memory and the stress hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### cortisol were measured. Including scanning their brains to identify brain

<!-- chunk -->

### regions involved in cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study results showed a reduction in evening cortisol concentrations.

<!-- chunk -->

### And improved memory and mood. Recall significantly improved. And the

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers concluded this study was the first to show that DHEA had a

<!-- chunk -->

### beneficial effect on memory in healthy young men.184

<!-- chunk -->

## DHEA Levels Associated with Mood in Pro Golfers

<!-- chunk -->

### Several studies suggest that DHEAS levels drop following different types

<!-- chunk -->

### of acute stress. Implicating DHEA’s role in coping with stress and

<!-- chunk -->

### recovering from stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Taiwan wanted to find out what happened to DHEA levels

<!-- chunk -->

### during a negative outcome in an athletic competition. In this case, they

<!-- chunk -->

### studied 14 elite golfers participating in a major national golf tournament.

<!-- chunk -->

### The golfers were divided into 2 groups. One group made the cut during the

<!-- chunk -->

### competition. And the other group did not make the cut. DHEAS levels

<!-- chunk -->

### were measured in both groups 1-day before the competition. And then on

<!-- chunk -->

### days 1, 3 and 5 after the players’ final competition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Study results showed that DHEAS levels in players that made the cut

<!-- chunk -->

### during the competition did not change. Those players that failed to make

<!-- chunk -->

### the cut experienced a drop in blood concentrations of DHEAS.

<!-- chunk -->

### This study suggests that DHEA plays a role in your coping mechanism

<!-- chunk -->

### during psychologically challenging times. Supplementing with DHEA

<!-- chunk -->

### during times of stress could help alleviate some of the symptoms normally

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with high stress levels.185


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dosage of DHEA is 25 - 50 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA is a strong steroid hormone. And low supplemental doses affect

<!-- chunk -->

### gene expression in inhibiting metabolic syndrome. DHEA

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation boosts bone strength and enhances cognition and


<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA supplementation is not recommended for anyone under 18 years

<!-- chunk -->

### old. And like many nootropics, too much DHEA is NOT a good thing. It

<!-- chunk -->

### can lead to problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many nootropics users and doctors recommend taking “hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### holidays”. In other words, use DHEA for a month then take a month off.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with DHEA beyond the normal range may be advisable for

<!-- chunk -->

### short periods of time. Such as restoring a badly depleted adrenal system.

<!-- chunk -->

### But maintaining large doses of DHEA can lead to unpleasant side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

## Note: If you have been diagnosed with a hormone-dependent cancer, you

<!-- chunk -->

### should not supplement with DHEA until your cancer has been cured.


<!-- chunk -->

### Testing for DHEA levels is very important if you’re planning on

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with this powerful compound. Because if your hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### levels are normal and you start taking DHEA, you could experience side

<!-- chunk -->

### effects like acne, hair loss, tumor formation, heart arrhythmia, and


<!-- chunk -->

### At higher than 100 mg doses, DHEA has been linked to side effects. Many

<!-- chunk -->

### experts caution against high-doses of DHEA. Or long-term usage.


<!-- chunk -->

### The most common form of DHEA is in capsule form. Supplement

<!-- chunk -->

### manufacturers offer capsules ranging from 10 – 100 mg. You can even get

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA as an ointment, lozenge, or cream.

<!-- chunk -->

### Keep in mind that a 25 mg DHEA capsule will not deliver 25 mg of DHEA

<!-- chunk -->

### to your system. It first must pass through your liver where it’s further

<!-- chunk -->

### broken down.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body is not used to getting hormones through your digestive system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once swallowed, only 10-15 percent will eventually reach the tissues you

<!-- chunk -->

### are targeting – like your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is why many Naturopathic practitioners suggest using a DHEA cream

<!-- chunk -->

### instead. But here again you have a problem. While more DHEA is

<!-- chunk -->

### bioavailable by using DHEA cream on your skin, some argue there’s even

<!-- chunk -->

### a better way to take DHEA.

<!-- chunk -->

### And that’s by applying the cream to the membranes of your vagina if you

<!-- chunk -->

### are a woman. And in your rectum if you are a man.

<!-- chunk -->

### One other option is to take DHEA sublingually. It makes logical sense that

<!-- chunk -->

### if taken under your tongue, DHEA bypasses your liver. And goes directly

<!-- chunk -->

### into your bloodstream.

<!-- chunk -->

### Personally, I use 25 mg of DHEA in capsule form in the morning, and

<!-- chunk -->

### another 25 mg at noon. And have experienced a considerable boost in

<!-- chunk -->

### energy during the day. But cycling one month on, and a one-month off to

<!-- chunk -->

### give my body a “hormonal holiday”.


<!-- chunk -->

## DHEA 25 – 50 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using DHEA as a nootropic supplement. But with a huge

<!-- chunk -->

### caveat.

<!-- chunk -->

### Get your DHEA levels checked before starting supplementation to be on

<!-- chunk -->

### the safe side.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does make some DHEA on its own. But DHEA production

<!-- chunk -->

### inevitably declines with age. And possibly even faster depending on the

<!-- chunk -->

### health of your adrenal glands.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are under constant stress, have chronic fatigue, feel weak,

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed, or have a low sex drive – find a Naturopathic practitioner. And

<!-- chunk -->

### have your DHEA levels checked.

<!-- chunk -->

### Too many neurohackers suffer unnecessarily from high stress and low

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA production. Don’t be one of those people.

<!-- chunk -->

### Maintaining optimal DHEA levels can enhance cognitive function and

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, and improve decision-making (executive function). It’s even

<!-- chunk -->

### been shown to prevent brain cell death and boost general cerebral health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Start with 25 mg of DHEA per day. And see how you feel. Increase the

<!-- chunk -->

### dose to no more than 50 mg per day. And watch for side effects. And don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### forget to cycle it. Take it for a month and take one month off.


# DMAE

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE has been shown to boost alertness, focus, memory, and mental

<!-- chunk -->

### clarity

<!-- chunk -->

## DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol, Deanol, Deaner) has two methyl groups

<!-- chunk -->

### and is structurally similar to choline. Choline is a direct precursor to

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine (ACh).

<!-- chunk -->

### ACh is a critical neurotransmitter that influences everything from memory

<!-- chunk -->

### to muscle control. And it is the relationship ACh has with DMAE that

<!-- chunk -->

### generates most of the hype around DMAE as a nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### But it turns out that DMAE is NOT a precursor to acetylcholine as

<!-- chunk -->

### reported on many nootropic and brain optimization sites. However, many

<!-- chunk -->

### neurohackers report that supplementing with DMAE has worked wonders

<!-- chunk -->

### for their brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### So here we’ll try to clear up some of the confusion and misinformation

<!-- chunk -->

### surrounding DMAE as a nootropic supplement. And if adding DMAE to

<!-- chunk -->

### your stack makes sense.

<!-- chunk -->

## DMAE is an amine naturally produced in small amounts in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### High levels of DMAE are also found in seafood like anchovies and

<!-- chunk -->

### sardines.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers have speculated that DMAE may increase acetylcholine (ACh)

<!-- chunk -->

### levels in the brain by inhibiting choline metabolism in peripheral tissues.

<!-- chunk -->

### By preventing the use of choline by other tissues (including synthesis into

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine), DMAE increases choline levels in the bloodstream.186

<!-- chunk -->

### Once DMAE crosses the blood-brain barrier, it increases choline levels in

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain. So with higher choline levels present, you would expect elevated

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of acetylcholine (ACh).

<!-- chunk -->

### But research has shown this is not always what happens when DMAE gets

<!-- chunk -->

### to your brain. In one study, DMAE was rapidly taken into the brain. But

<!-- chunk -->

### when it reached synapses – nothing happened. Choline levels rose but did

<!-- chunk -->

### not convert into acetylcholine.187

<!-- chunk -->

### What’s going on here? First, we must look at how acetylcholine (ACh) is

<!-- chunk -->

### made. ACh is synthesized in a single step reaction catalyzed by the

<!-- chunk -->

### enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT).188 The rate-limiting steps in

<!-- chunk -->

## ACh synthesis are the availability of choline and Acetyl Coenzyme A

<!-- chunk -->

## (Acetyl-CoA).

<!-- chunk -->

### The only other source of acetylcholine (ACh) is synthetization from

<!-- chunk -->

### phosphatidylcholine (PC) via phosphatidylethanolamine N-

<!-- chunk -->

### methyltransferase (PEMT).189 And this ACh synthesis only happens in

<!-- chunk -->

### cholinergic receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

### So it would appear that DMAE cannot be converted to either choline or

<!-- chunk -->

### ACh. The only way DMAE can increase choline is by inhibiting choline

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### And the reason why choline levels rise in the brain when supplementing

<!-- chunk -->

### with DMAE is because the choline does not synthesize into acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### (ACh).190

<!-- chunk -->

### So why do some neurohackers experience a benefit in increased focus,

<!-- chunk -->

### clearer cognition, and even an antidepressant effect with DMAE?

<!-- chunk -->

### It could be that DMAE stimulates cholinergic receptors into acting.191 And

<!-- chunk -->

### with extra choline floating around because of DMAE, these neuroreceptors

<!-- chunk -->

### may decide to produce some extra ACh.192

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE may be useful to those dealing with a choline deficiency in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. And studies show that DMAE effectiveness in the brain depends on

<!-- chunk -->

### the health of the cholinergic system in your brain.193

<!-- chunk -->

### But as neurohackers we have more efficient options available for boosting

<!-- chunk -->

### choline in the brain. Centrophenoxine which is a combination of DMAE

<!-- chunk -->

### and pCPA (parachlorphenoxyacetic acid) seems to boost acetylcholine in

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain much more efficiently than DMAE.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does DMAE Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.DMAE is a neuroprotectant. Lipofuscin is a cellular waste product

<!-- chunk -->

### that accumulates in brain cells as we age. It’s the same waste

<!-- chunk -->

### product that causes brown spots on skin. Lipofuscin hides in cells

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout your body including your brain, eyes, liver, kidneys,

<!-- chunk -->

### heart, adrenals, and nerve cells (neurons).

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers often report that supplementing with DMAE produces

<!-- chunk -->

### enhanced vision. This vision effect may be DMAE’s ability to help remove

<!-- chunk -->

### waste like lipofuscin from cells that affect vision.

<!-- chunk -->

### This lipofuscin removal mechanism of action by DMAE has been shown

<!-- chunk -->

### in animal studies in the lab. Researchers used Centrophenoxine injections

<!-- chunk -->

### on 17-month old female mice. The animals were injected daily for

<!-- chunk -->

### months.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers studied changes in pigment layers of the retina of both

<!-- chunk -->

### eyes in the mice. And found there was significant reduction of lipofuscin

<!-- chunk -->

### pigment in the treated animals.194

<!-- chunk -->

### Centrophenoxine breaks down into DMAE once in your body. And it is the

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE in this nootropic that provides the lipofuscin scavenger affects.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.DMAE enhances attention and mood. DMAE has been reported by

<!-- chunk -->

### some neurohackers to improve vigilance, attention, mood and

<!-- chunk -->

### energy while alleviating depression. A study by German researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### may explain where this feeling of well-being comes from when

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with DMAE.

<!-- chunk -->

### This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial used 80 human subjects evenly

<!-- chunk -->

### split between male and female. The study analyzed their brain’s electrical

<!-- chunk -->

### reaction during presentation of five 7-minute video clips followed by a 3-

<!-- chunk -->

### minute pause for each.

<!-- chunk -->

### This procedure was repeated after 6 and 12 weeks of daily intake of

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE or a placebo. The subjects taking DMAE for 3 months developed

<!-- chunk -->

## significantly less theta and alpha brain waves.

<!-- chunk -->

### Decreases in theta and alpha brain waves have been associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### increased vigilance and attention. The subjects using DMAE were also

<!-- chunk -->

### more active and felt better.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that DMAE can induce a state of better feeling

<!-- chunk -->

### of well-being.195


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Concentration, working memory and executive function decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Cholinergic receptors degenerate

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ DMAE levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Lipofuscin and free radicals build up in brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these age-related changes could be influenced by declining DMAE

<!-- chunk -->

### levels. And are contributing factors to neurodegenerative diseases and


<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE levels are an inevitable consequence of aging. And may contribute

<!-- chunk -->

### to the onset of degenerative disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## DMAE benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE increases choline levels in your brain. This increase in choline and

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE’s ability to stimulate cholinergic receptors into action may lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### an increase in acetylcholine (ACh) levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### But DMAE does not directly elevate acetylcholine levels in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## DMAE is NOT a precursor to acetylcholine.196

<!-- chunk -->

### Increased ACh levels affect learning and memory. ACh helps the encoding

<!-- chunk -->

### of memories and your ability to concentrate. As neurohackers, we

<!-- chunk -->

### absolutely want to increase acetylcholine levels. Especially if our brain is

<!-- chunk -->

### low on ACh.

<!-- chunk -->

### But DMAE is not the best way to achieve the goal of elevated ACh levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research into DMAE is ongoing and there may be some benefits to DMAE

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation not yet known by the neurohacking or research

<!-- chunk -->

### community.197

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE has been used to treat a variety of conditions from cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders including ADHD. DMAE is also used in skin care products to

<!-- chunk -->

### help reduce age spots, fine lines, and wrinkles, and even sagging skin.198

<!-- chunk -->

### Free radicals can cause damage to DNA, upset cellular metabolism, and

<!-- chunk -->

### induce the creation of reactive oxygen species that kill brain cells.199 Some

<!-- chunk -->

### research has found that DMAE is a somewhat effective free radical

<!-- chunk -->

### scavenger.200

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE has been found to diminish the extent of “cross-linking” of

<!-- chunk -->

### proteins that have been implicated in diseases like Alzheimer’s.201

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers think this may be due to DMAE’s effectiveness as a free

<!-- chunk -->

### radical scavenger.202

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE is reported to induce lucid dreaming.203

<!-- chunk -->

## How does DMAE feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Some neurohackers report that DMAE supplementation causes a

<!-- chunk -->

### noticeable boost in their ability to concentrate.

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE users often report:

<!-- chunk -->

### •better memory (especially short-term memory)

<!-- chunk -->

### •mentally alert

<!-- chunk -->

### •improved focus

<!-- chunk -->

### •mental clarity

<!-- chunk -->

### •better sleep patterns

<!-- chunk -->

### Dosing more DMAE than recommended has been reported to make you

<!-- chunk -->

### feel edgy and tense. And you may experience muscles spasms, particularly

<!-- chunk -->

### in your shoulders and neck.


<!-- chunk -->

## Early DMAE Research

<!-- chunk -->

### A prescription form of DMAE called Deaner or Deanol was in clinical use

<!-- chunk -->

### as far back as the 1960’s and 70’s. Deanol was used for the treatment of

<!-- chunk -->

### learning and behavioral problems associated with shortened attention

<!-- chunk -->

### span.

<!-- chunk -->

### Two clinical trials conducted over 40 years ago proving the efficacy of

<!-- chunk -->

### using DMAE for treating what’s now known as ADHD are below.

<!-- chunk -->

### But in 1983, the FDA in all their wisdom insisted on additional studies to

<!-- chunk -->

### prove the effectiveness of DMAE. And because clinical trials would have

<!-- chunk -->

### been costlier than product sales could support, the company making

<!-- chunk -->

### Deanol and Deaner took them off the market.

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE is now available as a nootropic supplement. One that your doctor

<!-- chunk -->

### or psychiatrist is unlikely to prescribe to you for treating your ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

## DMAE to Treat ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### One double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE supplementation with methylphenidate (Ritalin) for treating

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD. 74 children diagnosed with learning problems and hyperactivity

<!-- chunk -->

### were referred to this study.

<!-- chunk -->

### The children received 40 mg of Ritalin, 500 mg of DMAE or a placebo

<!-- chunk -->

### daily for 3 months. Behavior, reaction times and other psychometric tests

<!-- chunk -->

### were done before and after treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Both ‘drugs’ proved to be effective according to several tests. The

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers concluded that DMAE supplementation significantly improved

<!-- chunk -->

### performance in children with learning and behavior disorders.204

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study conducted by Dr. Carl Pfeiffer of the Brain-Bio center in

<!-- chunk -->

### Princeton, New Jersey with 25 girls and 83 boys found similar results in

<!-- chunk -->

### using DMAE for treating ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, Dr. Pfeiffer found that DMAE enhanced the behavior in 2/3

<!-- chunk -->

### of the boys and 3/4 of the girls. Attention span was better, irritability and

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperactivity were decreased, scholastic ability improved and, in some

<!-- chunk -->

### cases, even IQ got a boost.205

<!-- chunk -->

### So if you’re ADHD, and using Ritalin or Adderall and looking for a

<!-- chunk -->

### natural alternative, you may want to try DMAE.

<!-- chunk -->

## DMAE use in Cosmetics

<!-- chunk -->

### Most of the research on DMAE in the 1950’s and 60’s centered around

<!-- chunk -->

### using this compound for cognitive function and brain health.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most recent research on DMAE is primarily for using the compound

<!-- chunk -->

### in skin cosmetic formulas.

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE has been shown to increase skin firmness even in young skin. One

<!-- chunk -->

### study with 30 healthy adults aged 36 – 49 applied DMAE gel or a placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### The results of the study showed that DMAE-treated skin was much

<!-- chunk -->

### firmer.206

<!-- chunk -->

### Another randomized clinical study used 3% DMAE facial gel applied

<!-- chunk -->

### daily for 16 weeks. The gel was able to reduce forehead lines, wrinkles

<!-- chunk -->

### around the eyes and improving lip shape and fullness. And the effects did

<!-- chunk -->

### not regress even 2-weeks after stopping application.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another open-label extension of the same trial showed that long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### application of DMAE gel had a good safety profile.207


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dosage of DMAE is 100 - 200 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE nootropic supplements are usually sold as DMAE bitartrate. A

<!-- chunk -->

### capsule of DMAE bitartrate is only 37% DMAE and the rest is 67%

<!-- chunk -->

### tartaric acid.

<!-- chunk -->

### A 250 mg capsule of DMAE bitartrate yields 92.5 mg of actual DMAE.

<!-- chunk -->

### Take your DMAE dose in the morning before or with breakfast. Dose

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE a few times a week, but not every day.

<!-- chunk -->

## If you are going to use DMAE, stack it with a good source of choline.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember that DMAE inhibits choline and metabolism of choline. And

<!-- chunk -->

### you absolutely need choline and acetylcholine for a fully optimized brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE inhibits phospholipid synthesis. This means you won’t get much

<!-- chunk -->

### help with choline precursors. You need a good source of choline.

<!-- chunk -->

### Without getting into a long explanation of the mechanics –

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylcholine (PC) or CDP-Choline and Omega-3’s (DHA) can help

<!-- chunk -->

### offset the damage caused by long-term DMAE use.


<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE is considered non-toxic and safe for short-term or intermittent use.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body naturally produces some DMAE on its own.

<!-- chunk -->

### You shouldn’t experience any side effects as long as you use DMAE in

<!-- chunk -->

### recommended doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some neurohackers report insomnia, headaches and muscle tension.

<!-- chunk -->

### Usually because the dose was too high.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have a negative reaction to DMAE stop using DMAE.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are planning on becoming pregnant do not use DMAE. Clinical

<!-- chunk -->

### studies have shown that DMAE may stunt the growth of the child’s

<!-- chunk -->

### brain.208

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have epilepsy or bipolar disorder, you should avoid using DMAE

<!-- chunk -->

### entirely.

<!-- chunk -->

### See “Dosage Notes” about how to stack DMAE if you’re going to

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement with this nootropic.


<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE is available in tablet, capsule, powder, liquid and creams.

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE tablets and capsules are usually DMAE bitartrate (see “Dosage

<!-- chunk -->

### Notes”) and 150 – 350 mg.

<!-- chunk -->

### Depending on the size of capsule or tablet, do the conversion for pure

<!-- chunk -->

### DMAE, and start slowly with a low dose of 50 mg. And see how you

<!-- chunk -->

### respond.


<!-- chunk -->

## DMAE 100 – 200 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I do NOT recommend using DMAE as a nootropic supplement. But if you

<!-- chunk -->

### must use DMAE, refer to the “Dosage Notes” and “Side Effects” in this

<!-- chunk -->

### chapter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does make some DMAE on its own. But DMAE production

<!-- chunk -->

### inevitably declines with age.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some neurohackers report that using DMAE has a significant effect on

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration, memory, alertness, focus and mental clarity.

<!-- chunk -->

### But here at Nootropics Expert, I feel there are much more effective and

<!-- chunk -->

### safe ways to improve alertness, concentration, focus, and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re going to use DMAE, start with 50 mg of DMAE per day. And see

<!-- chunk -->

### how you feel. Increase the dose no more than 50 mg at a time.

<!-- chunk -->

### And watch for side effects. Don’t forget to cycle it. Take it for a few days

<!-- chunk -->

### and take a couple of days off.


# 5-HTP

<!-- chunk -->

### 5-HTP is known for relieving depression and anxiety, fibromyalgia,

<!-- chunk -->

### insomnia, migraines, obesity, and symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease

<!-- chunk -->

## 5-HTP (5-Hydroxytryptophan or oxitriptan) is an amino acid that is

<!-- chunk -->

### naturally produced in your body. 5-HTP is synthesized from the amino

<!-- chunk -->

## acid tryptophan which we get from food.

<!-- chunk -->

## 5-HTP is the immediate precursor of serotonin. And as a nootropic and

<!-- chunk -->

### dietary supplement, 5-HTP is popular with those who advocate its

<!-- chunk -->

### effectiveness in treating depression. Along with a number of other

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin-related diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

### But using 5-HTP for treating depression and anxiety is not supported by

<!-- chunk -->

### science. The research is contrary to how 5-HTP is viewed by many,

<!-- chunk -->

### including medical doctors.

<!-- chunk -->

### When we dig into the research, we find that 5-HTP may be contraindicated

<!-- chunk -->

### for depression in those whom marketers advocate its use.209

<!-- chunk -->

### I’m all for boosting neurotransmitter levels and optimizing cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### performance here at Nootropics Expert. But now and again I run into a

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic or dietary supplement that may be popular. But also may be a

<!-- chunk -->

### particularly bad idea.

<!-- chunk -->

### We’re going to get to the bottom of how 5-HTP works in your brain in this

<!-- chunk -->

### chapter. We’ll examine why it’s critical for brain health. And reasons why

<!-- chunk -->

### you may want to find another way to boost serotonin levels in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## So again, 5-HTP is an amino acid that’s synthesized from the essential

<!-- chunk -->

## amino acid tryptophan.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan is hydroxylated by tryptophan hydroxylase to 5-HTP (5-

<!-- chunk -->

## hydroxytryptophan), then decarboxylated to serotonin (5-

<!-- chunk -->

### hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT).210

<!-- chunk -->

## Tryptophan → 5-HTP → serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### 80-90% of your body’s serotonin is made in your intestines. But serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. So all the serotonin that your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### needs has to be made within the brain. This is where 5-HTP comes in…

<!-- chunk -->

### 5-HTP crosses the blood-brain barrier more readily than tryptophan. And

<!-- chunk -->

### gets synthesized into serotonin at a faster rate than from tryptophan.211

<!-- chunk -->

### As a neurotransmitter, serotonin influences directly and indirectly, the

<!-- chunk -->

### majority of brain cells. So if you want to boost serotonin in your brain,

<!-- chunk -->

### some find that supplementing with 5-HTP is better than taking tryptophan.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan, which your body uses to make 5-HTP, can be found in turkey,

<!-- chunk -->

### chicken, milk, potatoes, pumpkin, sunflower seeds, turnip and collard

<!-- chunk -->

### greens, and seaweed.

<!-- chunk -->

### 5-HTP as a nootropic supplement is a naturally occurring amino acid

<!-- chunk -->

### derived from seed pods of Griffonia simplicifolia, found in West and

<!-- chunk -->

### Central Africa. 5-HTP content in extracts of this plant vary from 2 –

<!-- chunk -->

### 20.83% (from seeds obtained in Ghana).212

<!-- chunk -->

## How does 5-HTP Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## 5-HTP is a precursor to serotonin. The neurotransmitter serotonin plays

<!-- chunk -->

### a role in sleep, appetite, memory, learning, mood, and sexual function.

<!-- chunk -->

### When tryptophan’s role in converting to 5-HTP for boosting serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### doesn’t work efficiently, the result is often depression, chronic headache

<!-- chunk -->

### and insomnia.

<!-- chunk -->

### An open-label trial was conducted in Italy to determine the efficacy of

<!-- chunk -->

### using 5-HTP in young subjects with high levels of “romantic stress”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin has been linked to human romantic attachment. So researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### in this study set out to determine brain levels of Brain-Derived

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and serotonin in relation to changes in

<!-- chunk -->

### romantic stress (during the study).

<!-- chunk -->

### 15 healthy subjects (mean age 23.3 years) who had a “romantic breakup”

<!-- chunk -->

### took part. Participants received 60 mg of Griffonia simplicifolia extract

<!-- chunk -->

### containing 12.8 mg 5-HTP daily for 6 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The subjects were evaluated for BDNF and serotonin levels at the

<!-- chunk -->

### beginning of the study, at 3 weeks and then again at the end of the 6-week

<!-- chunk -->

### trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### The scientists observed significant improvements in romantic stress scores

<!-- chunk -->

### from weeks 0 through 3. So far, 5-HTP seems to be working. But no

<!-- chunk -->

### further improvement was seen from weeks 3 through 6. Even though the

<!-- chunk -->

### young people had significantly higher levels of BDNF and serotonin.213

<!-- chunk -->

## More Involved in Depression and Stress than Serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### This “romantic breakup” study is a classic illustration of why using 5-HTP

<!-- chunk -->

### alone to treat depression and stress may not work. And if it does work,

<!-- chunk -->

### why it may not work for long.

<!-- chunk -->

### Depression is often more than simple serotonin dysfunction. Depression

<!-- chunk -->

### can also be associated with catecholamine dysfunction, including

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine and/or norepinephrine. Or a combination of serotonin and

<!-- chunk -->

### catecholamine dysfunction.

<!-- chunk -->

## When you take 5-HTP alone, you are also depleting dopamine,

<!-- chunk -->

## norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Synthesis of serotonin from 5-HTP, and

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine from L-DOPA is catalyzed by the same enzyme, L-aromatic

<!-- chunk -->

### amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD).

<!-- chunk -->

### Dopamine and serotonin precursor supplementation must be taken in

<!-- chunk -->

### proper balance. Because when you use only 5-HTP, it dominates dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### at the AAAD enzyme synthesis level.

<!-- chunk -->

### Blocking dopamine synthesis at the AAAD enzyme through competitive

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibition will lead to depletion of dopamine and the rest of the

<!-- chunk -->

### catecholamines.214

<!-- chunk -->

### Going back to our Italian study of young people dealing with “romantic

<!-- chunk -->

### stress”, the subjects stopped responding to 5-HTP in the 2nd half of the

<!-- chunk -->

### study. Likely because their catecholamines became depleted through

<!-- chunk -->

### continuous 5-HTP supplementation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have found that when dopamine is depleted enough, 5-HTP will no

<!-- chunk -->

### longer function.215

<!-- chunk -->

## Catecholamine Dysfunction Affects More Than Just Depression

<!-- chunk -->

### When catecholamine neurotransmitter levels (dopamine and/or

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine) influence depression, supplementing with 5-HTP alone is

<!-- chunk -->

### not the way to go. Because you may deplete dopamine and norepinephrine,

<!-- chunk -->

### worsening the disease and its underlying cause.

<!-- chunk -->

### But this contraindication is not exclusive to depression. It extends to all

<!-- chunk -->

### other diseases where catecholamine dysfunction has been implicated.

<!-- chunk -->

### Including ADHD216, obesity, anxiety, seasonal affective disorder and

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s Disease.217


<!-- chunk -->

### Amino acid precursors of serotonin (i.e. 5-HTP) and dopamine (i.e. L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine) work together during synthesis, metabolism, and transport to the

<!-- chunk -->

### point that they function as one system.

<!-- chunk -->

### When serotonin and dopamine are properly balanced, functions that are

<!-- chunk -->

### regulated only by serotonin, can be regulated by manipulating dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### levels. And functions regulated only by dopamine in this balanced state

<!-- chunk -->

### can be regulated by manipulating serotonin.218

<!-- chunk -->

### When you mess with this balance and improperly supplement with

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin or dopamine precursors, you don’t get the desired effect of using

<!-- chunk -->

### that nootropic. And you increase the possibility of side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you supplement with only one precursor (i.e. 5-HTP to boost serotonin)

<!-- chunk -->

### that dominates the other system (i.e. dopamine synthesis), depletion of the

<!-- chunk -->

### dominated system will occur (i.e. depleted dopamine).

<!-- chunk -->

### And if this effect is pronounced enough, you will not get the benefit you

<!-- chunk -->

### were aiming for when supplementing with the original precursor (i.e. 5-

<!-- chunk -->

### HTP).

<!-- chunk -->

### A powerful example of this effect is in the management of Parkinson’s

<!-- chunk -->

### Disease where the effects of L-DOPA are no longer observed over time

<!-- chunk -->

### due to serotonin depletion.219

<!-- chunk -->

### Since serotonin and dopamine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, the

<!-- chunk -->

### number of serotonin and dopamine molecules in the brain is a function of

<!-- chunk -->

### the amount of nutrients (amino acid precursors) that are available to be

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesized into new neurotransmitter molecules.

<!-- chunk -->

### Optimizing brain function with minimal side effects is NOT a function of

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing until you get sufficiently high amino acid levels. It’s a

<!-- chunk -->

### function of achieving the proper balance between serotonin and dopamine.

<!-- chunk -->

## 5-HTP benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### 5-HTP is absolutely critical for synthesis of serotonin in your brain. But

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with 5-HTP to boost serotonin does not work well.

<!-- chunk -->

### Using 5-HTP to treat depression has had very little success over the last

<!-- chunk -->

### few decades of clinical trials and biohacking.

<!-- chunk -->

### Integrating 5-HTP into your nootropic stack is much more complicated

<!-- chunk -->

### than simply adding some 5-HTP in order to boost serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### 5-HTP alone will not work for depression, or any other issue you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### dealing with involving the catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine,

<!-- chunk -->

### epinephrine) because of 5-HTP’s tendency to deplete those

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters.

<!-- chunk -->

### 5-HTP will boost serotonin in your brain.220 But 5-HTP must be carefully

<!-- chunk -->

### stacked with precursors for dopamine and norepinephrine or you risk

<!-- chunk -->

### making the situation worse.

<!-- chunk -->

### You must avoid supplementing with only one of the serotonin or dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### amino acid precursors. When amino acid precursors are not in balance,

<!-- chunk -->

### you end up with decreased effectiveness of that nootropic, increased side

<!-- chunk -->

### effects, and depletion of the nondominant system.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does 5-HTP feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Reactions to supplementing with 5-HTP vary considerably. But the one

<!-- chunk -->

### consistent theme is initial feelings of well-being, better sleep, less need

<!-- chunk -->

### for sleep, improved mood, less social anxiety, lower appetite, improved

<!-- chunk -->

### tolerance for stress and improved cognitive function.

<!-- chunk -->

### And after a couple of weeks of dosing 5-HTP - side effects begin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin overload results in dopamine and norepinephrine depletion.

<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects include feelings of lethargy, depression, brain fog, stomach

<!-- chunk -->

### pain, and headaches. Worst case scenario is nausea, vomiting and even

<!-- chunk -->

### blacking out.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers who report consistent success supplementing with 5-HTP

<!-- chunk -->

### stack it with B-Vitamins, a dopamine precursor like NALT, and only use 5-

<!-- chunk -->

### HTP as needed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Those who have a bad experience with 5-HTP from the start often have no

<!-- chunk -->

### idea why they’ve reacted badly. But an educated guess is their depression

<!-- chunk -->

### was catecholamine (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine)-related. And

<!-- chunk -->

### boosting serotonin made their dopamine-related issues worse. Very

<!-- chunk -->

### quickly.

<!-- chunk -->

### One huge word of WARNING: Do NOT take 5-HTP with any

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant medication. You put yourself in the very real danger of

<!-- chunk -->

## Serotonin Syndrome which can ultimately kill you.


<!-- chunk -->

### 5-HTP supplements are heavily marketed as a natural remedy for

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. But the science does not support using 5-HTP for depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### We have decades of clinical trials available. And there is no evidence of

<!-- chunk -->

### the efficacy in using 5-HTP for depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Department of Public Health at the University of Queensland Medical

<!-- chunk -->

### School in Australia did a systematic review of literature dating from

<!-- chunk -->

### – 2000 for “5-HTP” and “depression”.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found 108 clinical studies of which only 2 studies, one

<!-- chunk -->

### with serotonin (5-HT) and one with L-Tryptophan for a total of 64 patients

<!-- chunk -->

### met sufficient quality criteria to be included. These studies suggest

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin (5-HT) and L-Tryptophan are better than placebo at alleviating


<!-- chunk -->

### But the researchers noted “the small size of the studies, and the large

<!-- chunk -->

### number of inadmissible, poorly executed studies, cast doubt on the results

<!-- chunk -->

### from potential publication bias, and suggests that they are insufficiently

<!-- chunk -->

### evaluated to assess their effectiveness.”221

<!-- chunk -->

## 5-HTP for Fibromyalgia

<!-- chunk -->

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Italy studied the efficacy of

<!-- chunk -->

### using 5-HTP in treating fibromyalgia symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### 50 patients with primary fibromyalgia syndrome were selected for this

<!-- chunk -->

### study. This 1990 study did not publish the amount of 5-HTP used. But the

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers found a significant improvement in fibromyalgia symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### with only mild and transient side effects.222

<!-- chunk -->

## 5-HTP for the Treatment of Depression

<!-- chunk -->

### Insufficient activity of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine

<!-- chunk -->

### is a central element of the model of depression most widely held by

<!-- chunk -->

### neurobiologists today.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the late 1970’s and 1980’s, numerous studies were performed in which

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed patients were treated with the serotonin precursors L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan and 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), and the dopamine and

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine precursors Tyrosine and L-Phenylalanine.

<!-- chunk -->

### A summary published in the Alternative Medicine Revue looked at the

<!-- chunk -->

### data from all these studies. The author noted that the nature of the studies

<!-- chunk -->

### makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the efficacy of

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter precursors for treating depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### While there is evidence that precursor loading could work, particularly for

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin precursor 5-HTP, more studies of suitable design and size

<!-- chunk -->

### “might lead to more conclusive results”.223

<!-- chunk -->

### Those studies have not materialized since that report was published

<!-- chunk -->

### years ago.


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dosage of 5-HTP if you’re going to try it, is 50 mg 1 –

<!-- chunk -->

### times per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some studies have used higher doses than my recommended dose, but 5-

<!-- chunk -->

### HTP can be toxic at high doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### For anxiety or depression, 5-HTP is dosed at 150 – 300 mg per day total.

<!-- chunk -->

### To relieve post MDMA (Ecstasy) depression, 5-HTP 100 mg on Day 3-7

<!-- chunk -->

### after MDMA use.224

<!-- chunk -->

### Successfully supplementing with 5-HTP requires stacking it with a

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine precursor like L-Tyrosine or L-DOPA along with B-Vitamins

<!-- chunk -->

### (for synthesis), and one of the sulfur-containing amino acids (methionine,

<!-- chunk -->

### cysteine, homocysteine, or taurine).

<!-- chunk -->

### And you must monitor the effects this stack is having on your body. If you

<!-- chunk -->

### start experiencing side effects of any kind, it’s a good indication that either

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin or dopamine is out of balance.

<!-- chunk -->

## DO NOT combine 5-HTP with any kind of antidepressant medication.

<!-- chunk -->

### Combining SSRI’s, Tricyclics or MAOI’s with 5-HTP will cause Serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### Syndrome. An extremely dangerous condition involving severe mental

<!-- chunk -->

### changes, hot flashes, rapidly fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate, and

<!-- chunk -->

### possibly coma.

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin Syndrome can kill you. And I’m not kidding here.


<!-- chunk -->

### 5-HTP supplementation can cause heartburn, heart palpitations, headache,

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, drowsiness, sexual problems,

<!-- chunk -->

### and muscle issues.

<!-- chunk -->

### 5-HTP can also cause some pretty radical mood changes including

<!-- chunk -->

### agitation, aggressiveness, anxiety, euphoria, poor decision-making,

<!-- chunk -->

### irritability, psychosis, restlessness and insomnia.

<!-- chunk -->

### 5-HTP can make the symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and

<!-- chunk -->

### other mental disorders worse.

<!-- chunk -->

### And I can’t emphasize this enough so I’m going to repeat it here in case

<!-- chunk -->

### you missed it…

<!-- chunk -->

## DO NOT combine 5-HTP with any kind of antidepressant medication.

<!-- chunk -->

### Combining SSRI’s, Tricyclics or MAOI’s with 5-HTP will cause Serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### Syndrome. An extremely dangerous condition involving severe mental

<!-- chunk -->

### changes, hot flashes, rapidly fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate, and

<!-- chunk -->

### possibly coma.

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin Syndrome can kill you. And I’m not kidding.


<!-- chunk -->

### 5-HTP is made from tryptophan in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### 5-HTP as a nootropic supplement is made from extracts of the African tree

<!-- chunk -->

### Griffonia simplicifolia. 5-HTP supplements are typically in tablet or

<!-- chunk -->

### capsule form.

<!-- chunk -->

### You’ll often find 5-HTP in many ready-made vitamin and herbal formulas.


<!-- chunk -->

## 5-HTP 50 mg up to 3-times per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I DO NOT recommend using 5-HTP as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does synthesize 5-HTP on its own to make serotonin in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. You can’t get 5-HTP from food. But you can get L-Tryptophan from

<!-- chunk -->

### food which is synthesized into 5-HTP in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### 5-HTP may help you if you’re dealing with depression. But you must stack

<!-- chunk -->

### it with a dopamine amino acid precursor, along with B-Vitamins, and a

<!-- chunk -->

### sulfur-containing amino acid. See the “Dosage Notes” in this chapter.

<!-- chunk -->

### IF you are going to try 5-HTP, I suggest starting with a dose of 50 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### daily. You may want to take it in the evening because it could help you

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Short-term dosing of 5-HTP of no more than 2 weeks seems to provide the

<!-- chunk -->

### most benefit if you’re going to benefit from this nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Or try using 5-HTP only on an “as needed” basis. For a mood boost,

<!-- chunk -->

### improve social anxiety, and provide a short-term boost in cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unless you are using 5-HTP to alleviate the symptoms after using Extasy

<!-- chunk -->

### (MDMA), 5-HTP supplementation on its own is NOT recommended. Nor

<!-- chunk -->

### is it recommended for long-term use.


# Fisetin

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin is anti-aging, has been shown to boost learning and memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### improve mood, reduce back & arthritic pain, reduce inflammation, improve

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition in Alzheimer’s, and reduce allergies

<!-- chunk -->

## Fisetin (3,3′,4′,7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a flavanol found in fruits and

<!-- chunk -->

### vegetables such as strawberries, apples, persimmons, grapes, onions, and

<!-- chunk -->

### cucumbers.225

<!-- chunk -->

### The highest concentration of Fisetin is found in strawberries followed by

<!-- chunk -->

### apple and persimmon.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recent anti-aging research has shown Fisetin to be the most potent

<!-- chunk -->

### senolytic compound compared to all other flavonoids. Senolytic means

<!-- chunk -->

### destroying dysfunctional cells that refuse to die.226

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin has been found to be anti-tumor, antioxidant, neurotrophic and

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-inflammatory. Fisetin also helps your body and brain to produce

<!-- chunk -->

## glutathione which is your master antioxidant.227,

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin is currently being studied for boosting memory performance and


<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin has been shown to increase long-term potentiation needed for

<!-- chunk -->

### encoding long-term memory.229

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have demonstrated Fisetin to be the most effective flavonoid to

<!-- chunk -->

### promote dendrite outgrowth. Dendrites are the equivalent to ‘receiving

<!-- chunk -->

### antenna” on neurons and used in brain cell signaling.230

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin protects neurons from damage due to oxidative stress. It boosts

<!-- chunk -->

## glutathione which is your main antioxidant protecting against

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### And it suppresses gene expression of tumor-necrosis factor – alpha (TNF-

<!-- chunk -->

### α), interleukin (IL)-1β, COX-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase which

<!-- chunk -->

### provides potent anti-inflammatory activity in brain microglia.231

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Fisetin work in the brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## Fisetin boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Fisetin is Anti-Aging. The most promising research and what has

<!-- chunk -->

### gained the most attention is Fisetin and its potential ability to extend

<!-- chunk -->

### lifespan.

<!-- chunk -->

### Senescent cells are cells that have become dysfunctional and are not

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminated from your system as you age. They just hang around in your

<!-- chunk -->

### body and release toxins that damage nearby healthy cells.232,

<!-- chunk -->

### The accumulation of senescent cells causes inflammation which results in

<!-- chunk -->

### age-related diseases such as osteoporosis, cancer, heart disease and

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive dysfunction.

<!-- chunk -->

### An animal study published in 2018 showed Fisetin effectively removes

<!-- chunk -->

### senescent cells. In aging mice, Fisetin helped increase their lifespan by

<!-- chunk -->

### percent.234,

<!-- chunk -->

### The Mayo Clinic are currently conducting a clinical trial with older

<!-- chunk -->

### postmenopausal women to determine if Fisetin is as effective at removing

<!-- chunk -->

### senescent cells in aging humans. And potentially extending lifespan.236

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Fisetin may help prevent Alzheimer’s. As you age, learning and

<!-- chunk -->

### memory decline partly because of increases in oxidative stress,

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation, cerebral blood flow decline, β-amyloid accumulation,

<!-- chunk -->

### and tau tangles.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study conducted at the Salk Institute using animal models of

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease and dementia found that Fisetin helped reduce

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive deficit in aging mice while restoring markers associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### impaired synaptic function, stress, and inflammation.237

<!-- chunk -->

## Another study showed that Fisetin helped reduce Alzheimer’s symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### by reducing the accumulation of β-amyloid proteins and reversed synaptic

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction resulting in improved learning and memory.238


<!-- chunk -->

### As you get older, the chemistry in your brain and energy metabolism


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neurons and synapses degenerate

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Recall, reaction time, memory, and mood diminish

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Cerebral circulation decreases

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Learning and memory decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Increased free radicals damage cells

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Inflammatory and oxidative stress damages brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### Age-related changes contributing to the neurodegenerative diseases of

<!-- chunk -->

### aging including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### But even if things have not degenerated to such a debilitating level, Fisetin


<!-- chunk -->

## Fisetin Benefits

<!-- chunk -->

## Fisetin is a polyphenol which are among the most effective natural ways

<!-- chunk -->

### to combat aging. And to prevent the health issues that often lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin has the unique ability to increase cell apoptosis. And promotes cell

<!-- chunk -->

### death which gives way for healthy new cells to thrive.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies conducted using Fisetin show increased brain antioxidant levels,

<!-- chunk -->

### which helps prevent microglia from releasing inflammatory compounds.239,


<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin has been shown in animal studies to help prevent cancer by

<!-- chunk -->

### reducing the formation of new blood vessels in various forms of cancer

<!-- chunk -->

### and starves tumor cells of oxygen and glucose.241

<!-- chunk -->

### In other animal studies Fisetin was shown to improve memory, reduce

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation, and prevent the loss of brain cell function. Fisetin has been

<!-- chunk -->

### shown to reduce β-amyloid plaque buildup and prevent the loss of healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells.242

<!-- chunk -->

### And Fisetin helps your body produce Glutathione which is your master

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant supporting healthy immune function.243

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Fisetin feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers who supplement with Fisetin report better focus, memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### and mood. Some say they are more alert even when they haven’t had

<!-- chunk -->

### sufficient sleep the night before.

<!-- chunk -->

### Several Fisetin users report less back pain and less arthritic pain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some Fisetin users report an increase in mental clarity and overall sense

<!-- chunk -->

### of well-being.

<!-- chunk -->

### And some say Fisetin helped reduce their allergies.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fisetin Clinical Research

<!-- chunk -->

### Note that nearly all clinical studies conducted with Fisetin so far have

<!-- chunk -->

### been animal studies or with cells in a petri dish.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fisetin for depression

<!-- chunk -->

### Anyone who suffers from depression knows the negative effects on quality

<!-- chunk -->

### of life.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recent animal studies demonstrated the anti-depressant effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with Fisetin.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, Fisetin provided its antidepressant effects by modulation of

<!-- chunk -->

### the serotonin pathway by inhibition of monoamine oxidase-A.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin also modulates norepinephrine which may also contribute to its

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-depressive effects.244

<!-- chunk -->

## Fisetin for memory and cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### When aging rats were given Fisetin, they experienced an improvement in

<!-- chunk -->

### learning and memory. Studies revealed that Fisetin activates pathways in

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain involved in encoding and storing memories.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study also showed that Fisetin prevented memory loss in mice exposed

<!-- chunk -->

### to toxins.245,

<!-- chunk -->

## Fisetin for neurodegenerative disease

<!-- chunk -->

### In one study, Fisetin improved brain antioxidant levels and prevented

<!-- chunk -->

### microglia from releasing inflammatory compounds in response to bacterial

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins.247,

<!-- chunk -->

### In mice with β-amyloid plaque accumulation, Fisetin improved memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### reduced inflammation, and prevented the loss of brain cell function. In

<!-- chunk -->

### mice with Alzheimer’s, it reduced β-amyloid plaque buildup and loss of

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells.249

<!-- chunk -->

## Fisetin protects against stroke

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin protects brain cells and reduces inflammation and damage due to

<!-- chunk -->

### stroke in mice and rats.250, 251,

<!-- chunk -->

### In a 2008 study conducted with rabbits, Fisetin prevented loss of balance,

<!-- chunk -->

### lack of energy, and uncontrolled eye movements caused by stroke.253

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin does this by reducing inflammation and brain damage after a

<!-- chunk -->

### stroke.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study was conducted with mice suffering from inflammation and

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidative stress caused by aluminum. Aluminum toxicity has been linked to

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease. Fisetin reduced inflammation and oxidative stress in

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain caused by aluminum.254,

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin supports the survival of brain cells by eliminating damaged or

<!-- chunk -->

### unneeded proteins.256

<!-- chunk -->

## Fisetin Recommended Dosage

<!-- chunk -->

### Since all clinical studies with Fisetin were conducted with animals and not

<!-- chunk -->

### humans there is no established recommended dosage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most Fisetin supplements range from 100-500 mg. In clinical trials, the

<!-- chunk -->

### equivalent human daily dose of 100-1400 mg of Fisetin were used.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and appears to promote cell

<!-- chunk -->

### communication in the hippocampus. A part of your brain associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### long-term memory.257

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin is fat-soluble and must be taken with a healthy fat like unrefined

<!-- chunk -->

### coconut oil to ensure absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fisetin Side Effects

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin is non-toxic and is well-tolerated by most people. We do not have

<!-- chunk -->

### any human studies on Fisetin and must rely on user reviews.

<!-- chunk -->

### And because we do not have any human studies to verify its safety, you

<!-- chunk -->

### may want to avoid using Fisetin if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.

<!-- chunk -->

## Type of Fisetin to Buy

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin supplements are available in tablets, softgels, and capsules.

<!-- chunk -->

### Capsules are typically 100-500 mg each.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fisetin is a natural bioflavonoid and polyphenol similar to Luteolin and

<!-- chunk -->

## Quercetin.

<!-- chunk -->

### You naturally get very small amounts of Fisetin by eating strawberries,

<!-- chunk -->

### apples, persimmons, grapes, onions, and cucumbers with the highest

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration found in strawberries.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Salk Institute for Biological Studies have been researching Fisetin for

<!-- chunk -->

### years and own a patent for Fisetin as a memory enhancer.258

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin is poorly absorbed by your digestive system so dietary supplement

<!-- chunk -->

### companies offer various unique solutions for enhancing absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

## Novusetin® – by Bioriginal Food & Science Corp. located in Saskatoon,

<!-- chunk -->

### Canada – is a patented form of Fisetin sourced from the Japanese fruit

<!-- chunk -->

### wax tree and licensed to supplement companies

<!-- chunk -->

## Liposomal Fisetin is another attempt to improve absorption by encasing

<!-- chunk -->

### the Fisetin molecule in a phospholipid. And is often combined with

<!-- chunk -->

## another polyphenol Quercetin which is also thought to boost absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fisetin is fat-soluble, so consuming it with a healthy fat promotes better

<!-- chunk -->

### absorption no matter what the supplement label states.


<!-- chunk -->

## Fisetin 100-500 mg a day

<!-- chunk -->

## I recommend supplementing with Fisetin as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Fisetin on its own. So, to get its benefits you

<!-- chunk -->

### must take it as a supplement. Or rely on the tiny amount you get from

<!-- chunk -->

### strawberries.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin is especially helpful for those suffering from allergies, arthritic

<!-- chunk -->

### pain, muscle soreness after a workout, or a cold.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin is gaining a reputation as an anti-aging supplement because it

<!-- chunk -->

### helps remove senescent cells which are dysfunctional cells that if left

<!-- chunk -->

### unchecked cause inflammation, oxidative stress, and eventually

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin is reported by aging neurohackers as helping with long-term


<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin also shows promise in animal studies for helping reduce some of

<!-- chunk -->

### the symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s. So, if you or a loved one are

<!-- chunk -->

### dealing with Alzheimer’s I highly recommend trying Fisetin and see if it

<!-- chunk -->

### helps.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin is fat-soluble so must be taken with a healthy fat like unrefined

<!-- chunk -->

### coconut oil to ensure absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fisetin is also not very bioavailable so consider trying Liposomal Fisetin

<!-- chunk -->

## or a supplement containing the patented form called Novusetin®.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fisetin as a nootropic seems to be effective starting at 100 mg up to

<!-- chunk -->

### mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dosages above 1,000 mg per day are used by some. But remember all we

<!-- chunk -->

# Forskolin

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin has been shown to boost memory and learning, improve

<!-- chunk -->

### motivation and mood, and stimulate cerebral circulation

<!-- chunk -->

## Forskolin (Coleus forskohlii) is the only known nootropic supplement to

<!-- chunk -->

### naturally boost cAMP (Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate) in your brain.259

<!-- chunk -->

### cAMP is important for neural signaling within brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a secondary messenger in neurons, cAMP produces proteins needed for

<!-- chunk -->

## neuron and synapse growth. This process is called Long-Term

<!-- chunk -->

## Potentiation (LTP).

<!-- chunk -->

### LTP is the process where synaptic connections get stronger in response to

<!-- chunk -->

### electrical stimulation in the brain. This process happens naturally through

<!-- chunk -->

### life experience. It’s a critical part of synaptic plasticity. And how

<!-- chunk -->

### experience is recorded through learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin is a chemical compound extracted from Coleus forskohlii

<!-- chunk -->

### (Plectranthus barbatus), a perennial plant native to India, Burma and

<!-- chunk -->

### Thailand.

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskohlii has been used for millennia in traditional Ayurvedic medicine

<!-- chunk -->

### to treat heart disease, convulsions, spasms, and painful urination.260

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin is used in Western homeopathic medicine to treat allergies, skin

<!-- chunk -->

### conditions, obesity, PMS, irritable bower syndrome, urinary tract

<!-- chunk -->

### infections, bladder infections, cancer, blood clots, male infertility,

<!-- chunk -->

### insomnia and convulsions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some healthcare providers even use Forskolin intravenously (IV) for heart

<!-- chunk -->

### failure.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers and holistic medical practitioners use the extract Forskolin to

<!-- chunk -->

### boost cerebral blood flow, lower blood pressure, treat hypertension,

<!-- chunk -->

### asthma, and congestive heart failure.

<!-- chunk -->

### But here, we’re looking at Forskolin as a nootropic. Recall that Forskolin

<!-- chunk -->

### boosts cAMP. cAMP was discovered in 1956 and its production is now

<!-- chunk -->

### known to be the final common pathway for many hormones and

<!-- chunk -->

### transmitter agents.

<!-- chunk -->

### To put this in practical perspective, hormones and neurotransmitters do not

<!-- chunk -->

### enter the cell. Instead, they activate a receptor on the cell membrane that

<!-- chunk -->

### is part of the adenylate cyclase enzyme complex.

<!-- chunk -->

### The production of cAMP in a cell is catalyzed by this complex. The cyclic

<!-- chunk -->

### AMP (cAMP) then activates cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA),

<!-- chunk -->

### which results in changes in the cell’s function.261 Based on input from the

<!-- chunk -->

### relevant hormone or neurotransmitter.

<!-- chunk -->

## The elevation of cAMP along with PKA is required for long-term

<!-- chunk -->

## potentiation (LTP). This increase in neuroplasticity is how long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### memories are formed and encoded in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers have found that increases in cAMP rapidly activates the

<!-- chunk -->

### Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) receptor TrkB and induces

<!-- chunk -->

## BDNF-dependent long-term potentiation at the Schaffer collateral-CA1

<!-- chunk -->

### synapse in the hippocampus.262

<!-- chunk -->

### In simpler terms, Forskolin boosts cAMP levels which affects long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### potentiation (LTP). LTP is an integral part of the process in developing

<!-- chunk -->

### and encoding long-term memories.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Forskolin work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Forskolin enhances memory. Forskolin as a nootropic has the

<!-- chunk -->

### unique ability to activate the enzyme adenylate cyclase (AC). The

<!-- chunk -->

### activated AC enzyme then converts to cAMP (Cyclic Adenosine

<!-- chunk -->

### Monophosphate), a secondary messenger used for intracellular

<!-- chunk -->

### communication.263

<!-- chunk -->

### cAMP helps stimulate the production of CREB (cAMP response element-

<!-- chunk -->

### binding protein). An increase in CREB enhances Long-Term Potentiation

<!-- chunk -->

### (LTP).

<!-- chunk -->

### LTP is the connection between brain synapses. Strengthening in response

<!-- chunk -->

### to stimulation by neurons on either side. A major component in both

<!-- chunk -->

### learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Memories are stored at a cellular level. And retrieved at a cellular level.

<!-- chunk -->

## This well-travelled pathway is strengthened by boosting cAMP with

<!-- chunk -->

## Forskolin.264

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Forskolin increases cerebral circulation. Coleus forskohlii has

<!-- chunk -->

### traditionally been used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure),

<!-- chunk -->

### congestive heart failure and angina (reduced blood flow to the

<!-- chunk -->

### heart).

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin is very effective in lowering blood pressure. And scientists

<!-- chunk -->

### believe this ability to boost blood flow is related to Forskolin’s cAMP-

<!-- chunk -->

### elevating ability.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers recruited 7 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).

<!-- chunk -->

### DCM is a condition in which the heart’s ability to pump blood is decreased

<!-- chunk -->

### due to the left heart ventricle being enlarged and weakened. Forskolin

<!-- chunk -->

### administration dramatically improved left ventricle function. And

<!-- chunk -->

### increased overall cardiovascular performance.265

<!-- chunk -->

### Another group of scientists set out to study the effects of Forskolin on

<!-- chunk -->

### cerebral circulation. In this study, rabbits were anesthetized and measuring

<!-- chunk -->

### devices were attached to blood vessels entering and coming out of the


<!-- chunk -->

### The study found that Forskolin was an effective cerebral vasodilator.

<!-- chunk -->

### Enlarging blood vessels in the brain boosted blood flow. Allowing for

<!-- chunk -->

### more efficient delivery of nutrients and oxygen to brain cells.266


<!-- chunk -->

### Environmental factors like the food we eat, exposure to toxins, polluted

<!-- chunk -->

### air, ADHD, illness, stress and aging changes our brain chemistry.

<!-- chunk -->

## ↓ Mood and motivation declines

<!-- chunk -->

## ↓ Memory and recall decline

<!-- chunk -->

## ↓ Long-term memory fades

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes are contributing factors to poor quality of life. And as

<!-- chunk -->

### they progress, to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, dementia

<!-- chunk -->

### and Parkinson’s.

<!-- chunk -->

## Forskolin benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Research from hundreds of studies, and feedback from neurohackers have

<!-- chunk -->

### shown that Forskolin can:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improve memory by boosting cAMP activity in the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boost catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine)

<!-- chunk -->

### in the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boost cerebral circulation

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin is fat-soluble and quickly enters your brain after you take it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once in your brain, it boosts cAMP activity. cAMP is involved in the

<!-- chunk -->

### Long-Term Potentiation process of preserving memories.

<!-- chunk -->

## Forskolin combined with Artichoke extract is even more effective.

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin effectively boosts cAMP levels but also increases PDE4 in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. PDE4 is a cAMP inhibitor and will counteract increases by

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin if left unchecked.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inhibiting PDE4 with Artichoke Extract and boosting cAMP with

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin also potentiates dopamine release in the brain. Boosting

<!-- chunk -->

### processes in this stream of chemical reactions in the brain increases

<!-- chunk -->

### learning and memory.267 Without the side effects of stimulating dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### production through the use of drugs like Adderall or Ritalin.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Forskolin feel?

<!-- chunk -->

## Many neurohackers report that Forskolin with Artichoke Extract

<!-- chunk -->

### improves mood. It motivates you to want to learn, and to get things done.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some say it works as good as Modafinil.

<!-- chunk -->

### The general consensus is:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improved long-term memory

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increased ability to retain information

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increased ability to study

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improved mood and motivation


<!-- chunk -->

## Forskolin as a nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

## cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) is a protein that

<!-- chunk -->

## modulates the transcription of genes. Increases in cAMP triggers the

<!-- chunk -->

### activation of CREB.

<!-- chunk -->

### And this transcription factor is a big part of intracellular signaling. It

<!-- chunk -->

### regulates everything from the production of new sperm cells in men

<!-- chunk -->

### (spermatogenesis), to the circadian rhythms that control your sleep and

<!-- chunk -->

### awake cycles, to memory formation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin increases cAMP which triggers the activation of CREB.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers have found through animal studies that CREB is required for

<!-- chunk -->

### a variety of complex forms of memory, including spatial memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### social learning.268

<!-- chunk -->

## Forskolin reduces anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### Benzodiazepines (Benzos) like Valium are a class of psychoactive drug

<!-- chunk -->

### used to treat anxiety, insomnia, agitation, muscle spasms, alcohol

<!-- chunk -->

### withdrawal and before medical and dental procedures to keep the patient

<!-- chunk -->

### calm.

<!-- chunk -->

### Benzodiazepines come with a whole host of negative side effects including

<!-- chunk -->

### addiction, cognitive impairment, decreasing effectiveness (tolerance) and

<!-- chunk -->

### nasty withdrawal symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists have been studying non-GABAergic substances that elevate

<!-- chunk -->

### cAMP, and have anti-anxiety activity. So they took a look at Forskolin.

<!-- chunk -->

### In one animal study, researchers compared the effects on anxiety of

<!-- chunk -->

## Forskolin compared to diazepam (Valium). And found that Forskolin

<!-- chunk -->

## produced significant anti-anxiety activity in both stressed and unstressed

<!-- chunk -->

### animals.

<!-- chunk -->

### Diazepam had an anti-anxiety effect on the unstressed animals. But did not

<!-- chunk -->

### work for stressed animals. The researchers noted that the anti-anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### activity of Forskolin was accompanied by a significant elevation of cAMP

<!-- chunk -->

### levels. There’s cAMP again…

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that Forskolin was a better option for treating

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety. This non-receptor mediated anti-anxiety action through cAMP

<!-- chunk -->

### elevation was preferable to the adverse reactions people get from using

<!-- chunk -->

### receptor-mediated drugs like Benzos.269

<!-- chunk -->

## Forskolin as a neuroprotectant in chemical warfare

<!-- chunk -->

### If you ever find yourself in a warzone, you may want to have a bottle of

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin with you.

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the primary cholinesterase in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### This enzyme catalyzes the breakdown of acetylcholine (ACh) once ACh is

<!-- chunk -->

### used in the synaptic cleft during neurotransmission. This is how it

<!-- chunk -->

### works…

<!-- chunk -->

### During neurotransmission, ACh is released from the first neuron into the

<!-- chunk -->

### synaptic cleft of the 2nd neuron where it binds to ACh receptors. And does

<!-- chunk -->

### its job of passing on the neural signal.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once ACh has done its job, AChE which is also located in that synaptic

<!-- chunk -->

### cleft, steps in and breaks down acetylcholine (ACh) by liberating the

<!-- chunk -->

### choline. The liberated choline is taken up again by another neuron, and

<!-- chunk -->

### ACh is synthesized by combining the free recycled choline with Acetyl-

<!-- chunk -->

### CoA through the action of choline acetyltransferase.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chemical warfare agents like Sarin gas, and insecticides like malathion,

<!-- chunk -->

### act to inhibit AChE. Which means they shut down this recycling process

<!-- chunk -->

### needed for acetylcholine production in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers have demonstrated that Forskolin is a very effective AChE

<!-- chunk -->

### promoter. Forskolin activates AChE and up-regulates its expression. Using

<!-- chunk -->

### mouse models, the scientists showed that Forskolin boosted AChE

<!-- chunk -->

### expression outside and inside the affected brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

## They concluded that Forskolin can sufficiently upregulate cellular AChE

<!-- chunk -->

## production and protect cells against chemical warfare agents like

<!-- chunk -->

## Sarin.270

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin works to protect your brain from damage caused by insecticides

<!-- chunk -->

### too. So if your using an insecticide in the house or out in your garden, you

<!-- chunk -->

### may want to protect your brain by dosing with Forskolin first.


<!-- chunk -->

## Recommended dosage for Forskolin is 250 mg of Coleus forskohlii at

<!-- chunk -->

### 10%, or 125 mg of Coleus forskohlii at 25%.

<!-- chunk -->

## For boosting cAMP in a CILTEP stack: 4 mg Forskolin extract per day

<!-- chunk -->

### along with 900 mg of Artichoke Extract for PDE4 suppression.

<!-- chunk -->

## NOTE: You will not get the full nootropic benefit of using Forskolin if

<!-- chunk -->

### you dose it on its own. Forskolin tends to boost cAMP and PDE4 levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### And PDE4 suppresses cAMP. Artichoke Extract helps control PDE4.

<!-- chunk -->

### And don’t worry about measuring out an accurate 4 mg for this CILTEP

<!-- chunk -->

### stack. I’ve been using 250 mg of Forskolin (10% ForsLean®) with 900 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### of Artichoke Extract (6%) with great success.

<!-- chunk -->

## For counteracting Forskolin’s effect on Acetylcholinesterase: 800 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR) – (200 mg of ALCAR for every 1 mg of

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin) per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many users of this stack report it helpful to supplement with 500 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine, a B-Vitamin Complex and caffeine (coffee or preferably

<!-- chunk -->

### green tea).


<!-- chunk -->

## Forskolin induces CYP3A gene expression in your liver. Which means,

<!-- chunk -->

### like grapefruit juice, Forskolin needs to be used cautiously as it will

<!-- chunk -->

### amplify the effects of other nootropics in your stack. And prescription

<!-- chunk -->

### meds.271

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetylcholinesterase is upregulated by cAMP which makes you sleepy.

<!-- chunk -->

### This means that available Acetylcholine (ACh) in your brain drops. You

<!-- chunk -->

### can counteract this with Acetyl-l-Carnitine (ALCAR), which calms the

<!-- chunk -->

### upregulation of Acetylcholinesterase.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most common side effect with Forskolin is diarrhea because increased

<!-- chunk -->

### cAMP affects the smooth muscle in your gastrointestinal tract. Things

<!-- chunk -->

### move through your intestines faster with Forskolin. But this side effect

<!-- chunk -->

### usually happens at much higher than recommended doses of Forskolin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin reduces blood pressure. So if you’re on high blood pressure

<!-- chunk -->

### meds or have naturally low blood pressure you should avoid using

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin.


<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin is usually marked as “Forskolin” or “Coleus forskohlii” on the

<!-- chunk -->

### bottle.

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin typically comes in 125 mg capsules of Coleus Forskohlii (25%

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin), or 250 mg capsules of Coleus Forskohlii (10% Forskolin).

<!-- chunk -->

## Look for a Coleus forskohlii or Forskolin supplement with the percentage

<!-- chunk -->

### of Forskolin extract clearly marked on the label.

<!-- chunk -->

## ForsLean® by Sabinsa Corporation is a branded and patented form of

<!-- chunk -->

### Coleus forskohlii that’s been used most often in human trials. So we prefer

<!-- chunk -->

### a supplement that uses ForsLean® as their source of Forskolin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in India reported that Forskolin concentration can change

<!-- chunk -->

### significantly depending on where the Coleus forskohlii is grown.272 And

<!-- chunk -->

### why we prefer a standardized version like ForsLean®.


<!-- chunk -->

## Forskolin Extract 125 - 250 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Forskolin as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Forskolin on its own. So to get its benefits you

<!-- chunk -->

### must take it as a standardized supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Forskolin on its own as a supplement for cognition and memory is not

<!-- chunk -->

## very effective because it increases PDE4 (a cAMP reducer) along with

<!-- chunk -->

## boosting cAMP. So the nootropic effects cancel each other out.

<!-- chunk -->

### But Forskolin is especially helpful when combined with Artichoke Extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### It helps boost memory, increases motivation and the desire to learn. And

<!-- chunk -->

### helps improve mood while controlling anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest dosing Forskolin 125 – 250 mg per day with 900 mg of Artichoke

<!-- chunk -->

## Extract taken in the morning. Stack this with at least 800 mg of ALCAR to

<!-- chunk -->

### keep your acetylcholine levels up.

<!-- chunk -->

## I’ve also found that combining this stack with caffeine is helpful. The L-

<!-- chunk -->

## Theanine in green tea comes with the caffeine boost we need. Without the

<!-- chunk -->

### side effects of coffee.

<!-- chunk -->

### And finally, we are making the effects of normal dopamine function more

<!-- chunk -->

### effective with this stack. It triggers the desirable downstream processes

<!-- chunk -->

### that increase learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### The chemical dynamics of the dopamine are preserved. And we don’t get

<!-- chunk -->

### the negative side effects of using a stimulant like Adderall or Ritalin.

<!-- chunk -->

### This Forskolin/Artichoke Extract stack increases mental endurance for

<!-- chunk -->

### encoding long-term memories.


# GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA has a calming effect on brain and body, helps relieve stress and

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, and boosts Human Growth Hormone

<!-- chunk -->

## GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is an amino acid and neurotransmitter.

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA is your brain’s primary inhibitory transmitter. Its role is to keep

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamate, the primary excitatory transmitter, from overwhelming you.

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA is synthesized in brain cells from glutamate. It’s estimated that

<!-- chunk -->

### 40% of the synapses in the human brain work with GABA and therefore

<!-- chunk -->

### have GABA receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA enhances normal sleep cycles and improves blood pressure. GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete Human Growth Hormone. And

<!-- chunk -->

### helps produce endorphins that make you feel good after a workout or sex.

<!-- chunk -->

## Too much glutamate can cause a seizure, and too much GABA can put you

<!-- chunk -->

### in a coma. A healthy brain maintains a critical balance of GABA and


<!-- chunk -->

### GABA acts like a “brake” on neuron circuits during stress. Low GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### levels can result in anxiety, insomnia, poor mood and restlessness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clinical studies show that boosting GABA with a supplement relieves

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, stress, and boosts the production of alpha brain waves.273 If GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### is optimized in your brain, you’ll feel focused, relaxed and stress-free.

<!-- chunk -->

### When you normalize GABA levels you’ll experience a reduction in

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, insomnia, nervousness, restlessness and stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Benzodiazepine drugs like Valium and Xanax work by increasing GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### receptor sensitivity.274

<!-- chunk -->

## How does GABA Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA helps brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

### 1.GABA works by preventing neural signaling associated with anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### from reaching other neurons. It does this by attaching to the

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors that would otherwise excite those neurons. Over-

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulating neurons in certain areas of your brain is what causes

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety-related symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Japan studied the calming effects of GABA with

<!-- chunk -->

### volunteers. They had study subjects cross a suspension bridge as the

<!-- chunk -->

### stressful stimulus.

<!-- chunk -->

### The placebo subjects in this group showed significant drops in blood level

<!-- chunk -->

### markers indicating high stress levels. While the GABA group showed

<!-- chunk -->

### significantly higher blood levels of these same markers.

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA worked as a natural relaxant and its effects could be seen within

<!-- chunk -->

### hour of taking GABA. The researchers concluded that GABA could

<!-- chunk -->

### enhance immunity from stress.275

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.GABA also helps decrease Beta brain waves and increase Alpha

<!-- chunk -->

### brain waves.276 Beta brain waves are important for attention,

<!-- chunk -->

### alertness, concentration and developing memories. But excess levels

<!-- chunk -->

### of concentration, particularly during stress, can lead to anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, insomnia and more stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### When you are in an alert state, both Alpha and Beta brain waves can be

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulated. But the type of alertness will determine which brain wave is

<!-- chunk -->

### produced.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alertness during an Alpha wave state is associated with a relaxed state.

<!-- chunk -->

### And a stressed alert state produces a Beta wave. But an excess of Beta

<!-- chunk -->

### brain waves contributes to a variety of nervous disorders including anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### and stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a side note, I’m writing this while listening to binaural music which

<!-- chunk -->

### produces an Alpha state. It allows for a relaxed environment which

<!-- chunk -->

### promotes creativity and productivity.


<!-- chunk -->

### Low levels of GABA are associated with a variety of health problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Anxiety277, panic attacks, stress and insomnia

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Muscle spasms, hypertension, convulsion, Tourette’s Syndrome, and

<!-- chunk -->

### epilepsy

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Dry skin and wrinkles

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Poor digestion, bloating, flatulence, and constipation

<!-- chunk -->

### When your neurotransmitters, including GABA, are in balance, you feel

<!-- chunk -->

### motivated, productive, and energetic. And you feel calm and relaxed

<!-- chunk -->

### during downtime.

<!-- chunk -->

### When GABA levels are low you feel filled with dread, you’re constantly

<!-- chunk -->

### worried, you have racing thoughts, and you’re frequently late and

<!-- chunk -->

### disorganized.278

<!-- chunk -->

### Many people in this GABA-slump resort to high carbohydrate foods, and

<!-- chunk -->

### drugs or alcohol to relax.

<!-- chunk -->

## GABA benefits

<!-- chunk -->

## The amino acid L-glutamine is the precursor to GABA production in your

<!-- chunk -->

### body. L-glutamine gets converted to glutamic acid or glutamate.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glutamate is your body’s most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Which is responsible for attention span, brain energy, learning ability,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, and staying awake.

<!-- chunk -->

## An enzyme called glutamate decarboxylase converts glutamate to GABA.

<!-- chunk -->

## It does it with the help of the active form of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (Pyridoxal-5-

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphate (P5P)).

<!-- chunk -->

## The amino acid taurine helps increase the communication and

<!-- chunk -->

## productivity of this enzyme. And zinc helps the release of GABA from its

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

### When this process works efficiently, you feel relaxed with no stress or

<!-- chunk -->

### feelings of anxiety. And you get a more restful night’s sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does GABA feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### When you balance GABA levels in your brain, you feel relaxed and calm.

<!-- chunk -->

### But many neurohackers who try using GABA as a supplement don’t feel

<!-- chunk -->

### the effects. Because the GABA molecule is too large to cross the blood-

<!-- chunk -->

### brain barrier.279

<!-- chunk -->

### If you do feel the calming effects of GABA within a ½ hour of taking it, it

<!-- chunk -->

### may mean you have a “leaky” blood-brain barrier. Not a good thing.280

<!-- chunk -->

### Because if GABA can get through, all kinds of nasty stuff can get through

<!-- chunk -->

### too. Including toxins, undigested food particles and anything else in your

<!-- chunk -->

### blood stream that shouldn’t be in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the good news is, supplementary GABA can also benefit other

<!-- chunk -->

### functions in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA is found in your adrenal glands, pituitary gland, pancreas and your

<!-- chunk -->

### sex organs.281 GABA is also anti-inflammatory and has an immune benefit.

<!-- chunk -->

### When all these are running optimally, you’ll feel good.

<!-- chunk -->

### We’ll also cover other ways to boost GABA levels in our brain in the

<!-- chunk -->

## “Available Forms” section of this chapter.


<!-- chunk -->

### GABA was identified as a neurotransmitter several decades ago. And there

<!-- chunk -->

### has been a lot of research on GABA published since. But most of it is

<!-- chunk -->

### focused on how GABA works. And the drugs and chemicals which affect

<!-- chunk -->

### its action.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is very little research available on using GABA as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Likely because most scientists believe that GABA taken as a supplement

<!-- chunk -->

### will not cross the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

## GABA Increases Human Growth Hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### Bodybuilders and athletes use supplementary GABA to help repair and

<!-- chunk -->

### build muscle. And there are several studies supporting the notion that

<!-- chunk -->

## GABA increases Human Growth Hormone.

<!-- chunk -->

### In one study, researchers worked with 19 subjects who were given a single

<!-- chunk -->

### oral dose of 5 grams of GABA. 18 subjects were given a placebo during

<!-- chunk -->

### this trial. 3 hours after the administration of GABA, blood samples were

<!-- chunk -->

### taken. The team reported that “GABA caused a significant elevation of

<!-- chunk -->

### plasma growth hormone levels”.282

<!-- chunk -->

## GABA helps Reduce Insomnia

<!-- chunk -->

### A Los Angeles study conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled trial with 18 patients with sleep disorders. The patients received

<!-- chunk -->

### either a placebo, or Gabadone (a combination of GABA and 5-

<!-- chunk -->

### hydroxytryptophan).

<!-- chunk -->

### The difference between the two groups of sleep-deprived patients was

<!-- chunk -->

### significant. The Gabadone group fell asleep faster, stayed asleep longer,

<!-- chunk -->

### and had a better quality of sleep than the placebo group.283


<!-- chunk -->

### The recommended daily dosage of GABA is 500 to 1000 mg for a

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxation or calming effect. Some neurohackers notice an immediate

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxing effect, while others need to take it for a couple weeks before it

<!-- chunk -->

### starts to kick in.

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Arginine which increases nitric oxide also helps supplementary GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### cross the blood-brain barrier.284

<!-- chunk -->

## PharmaGABA™ which is a natural form of GABA produced with the help

<!-- chunk -->

### of Lactobacillus hilgardii bacteria is dosed at 50 – 200 mg per day.


<!-- chunk -->

### GABA is considered very safe when taken in normal recommended doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bodybuilders who use much higher doses of GABA do report experiencing

<!-- chunk -->

### flushing, tingling, a spike in heart rate and blood pressure, and anxiety.


<!-- chunk -->

### GABA as a supplement is available in tablet, capsule and powder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists have shown that GABA does not readily cross the blood-brain

<!-- chunk -->

### barrier. But many neurohackers report feeling a calming effect when using

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA.

<!-- chunk -->

## PharmaGABA™ is a natural form of GABA made using Lactobacillus

<!-- chunk -->

### hilgardii bacteria. The same bacteria used to ferment vegetables when

<!-- chunk -->

### making the Korean cabbage dish called kimchi. This form seems to readily

<!-- chunk -->

### cross the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another safe way to change GABA action in the brain is to use any of

<!-- chunk -->

### following commonly used herbs, vitamins and minerals.

<!-- chunk -->

## Valerian root 285, American Ginseng and Kava Kava work by increasing

<!-- chunk -->

## the effect of GABA on its receptors. Extracts of green, black and oolong

<!-- chunk -->

## tea also elicit a GABA effect.286

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnesium binds to GABA receptor sites and increases its effect.287

<!-- chunk -->

## Taurine protects against glutamate overstimulation. And this inhibitory

<!-- chunk -->

### effect acts as an anxiolytic (anti-anxiety).

<!-- chunk -->

### The neurotransmitter Serotonin enhances GABA. So precursors to

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using GABA as a nootropic supplement if you’re feeling

# Ginkgo Biloba

<!-- chunk -->

### Gingko biloba extract has been shown to boost alertness, concentration,

<!-- chunk -->

### focus and memory

<!-- chunk -->

## Ginkgo biloba (Ginkgo or Maidenhair) is one of the oldest species of

<!-- chunk -->

### trees on earth. Scientists consider it a “living fossil” dating back

<!-- chunk -->

### million years.289 It has continued to survive even after major extinction

<!-- chunk -->

### events.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gingko tress can grow to 130 feet (39.6 meters). Some Ginkgo trees in

<!-- chunk -->

### China are thought to be over 2,500 years old. And a 3,000-year-old tree

<!-- chunk -->

### reportedly stands in the Chinese province of Shandong.

<!-- chunk -->

### Four Ginkgo trees survived the atomic explosion in Hiroshima. Only 1,130

<!-- chunk -->

### meters from the bombs epicenter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gingko biloba has been used for medicine in China for several millennia.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the oldest Chinese Materia Medica (2800 B.C.), Ginkgo biloba was

<!-- chunk -->

### recommended for asthma, swelling of the hands and feet, coughs, vascular

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, aging and for the brain.290

<!-- chunk -->

## An extract of Gingko leaves called EGb 761 is standardized to 24%

<!-- chunk -->

## flavone glycosides (flavonoids) and 6% terpenes (ginkgolides and

<!-- chunk -->

## bilobalides).

<!-- chunk -->

### This Gingko extract regulates neurotransmitters, protects from brain cell

<!-- chunk -->

### degeneration, increases blood vessel microcirculation (blood flow in the

<!-- chunk -->

### smallest of blood vessels). And has antioxidant activity.291

<!-- chunk -->

### But there’s more…

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginkgo biloba helps:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Neurotransmitters. Gingko biloba can increase dopamine in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. Ginkgo acts as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) which

<!-- chunk -->

### reduces levels of monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the brain. MAO

<!-- chunk -->

### breaks down dopamine.292 One of the benefits of boosting dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### is to reduce anxiety.293 And to treat ADHD.294

<!-- chunk -->

## •Cerebral Circulation. Ginkgo biloba increases cerebral blood flow.

<!-- chunk -->

### Improving oxygen and glucose availability to neurons for neuronal

<!-- chunk -->

### health. Improving memory, recall, cognition and learning.295,

<!-- chunk -->

## •Neuroprotection. Ginkgo Biloba helps boost cerebral blood flow,

<!-- chunk -->

### reduces oxidative stress by eliminating free radicals, and increases

<!-- chunk -->

### nitric oxide which dilates blood vessels.297

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, Ginkgo has been shown to be particularly effective in

<!-- chunk -->

### elderly memory loss, slow thinking and reasoning, and tinnitus. One study

<!-- chunk -->

### shows significant improvement in Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s patients.298

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Ginkgo Biloba Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginkgo Biloba boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Cerebral circulation. Ginkgo boosts several brain functions by

<!-- chunk -->

### improving blood circulation in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study in the Department of Radiology at Johns Hopkins University

<!-- chunk -->

### School of Medicine used MRI’s to measure blood flow in 9 healthy men.

<!-- chunk -->

### MRI’s were done before and after the men took Gingko Biloba Extract

<!-- chunk -->

### mg twice a day for 4 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study concluded that overall, all regions of the subject’s brains

<!-- chunk -->

### showed a significant change in cerebral blood flow after using Ginkgo.299

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Cognition and mental performance. Gingko is well known as a

<!-- chunk -->

### memory booster in the nootropics community. Studies have shown

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginkgo helps attention, mood and processing speed.

<!-- chunk -->

### One large study at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia was

<!-- chunk -->

### conducted with 262 healthy adults. This 6-week, double-blind, placebo-

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled trial had volunteers taking 180 mg of Ginkgo biloba extract, or

<!-- chunk -->

### a placebo daily for 6 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The subjects were put through several standardized tests. At the end of the

<!-- chunk -->

### 6-week trial, those using Ginkgo showed significant improvement in verbal

<!-- chunk -->

### and visual recall and memory.300


<!-- chunk -->

### Blood vessels in our brain shrink and get narrower. Preventing the free

<!-- chunk -->

### flow of oxygenated blood to neurons. Toxic waste and free radicals

<!-- chunk -->

### accumulate within brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Memory, recall, reaction time and mood diminish

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Critical neurotransmitters decline


<!-- chunk -->

### But even if you’re not concerned with the effects of aging, Ginkgo biloba


<!-- chunk -->

## Ginkgo Biloba benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Research from hundreds of studies have shown that Ginkgo biloba will:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improve memory and cognition301

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increase reaction time

<!-- chunk -->

### •Restore the availability of dopamine and other neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improve cerebral blood flow

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reduce stress302

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boost mood

<!-- chunk -->

### •Help repair brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### •Act as an antioxidant to eliminate free radicals

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Ginkgo Biloba feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Gingko improves circulation in your body and brain. Thinking, reaction

<!-- chunk -->

### time, energy, and memory should improve. Cold hands and feet are often

<!-- chunk -->

### an indication of poor circulation and Ginkgo could help.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginkgo has a reputation for helping reduce the symptoms of tinnitus. And

<!-- chunk -->

### it’s also developed a good rep for helping erectile dysfunction (ED) in

<!-- chunk -->

### men.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers report it takes several weeks of continued use of

<!-- chunk -->

### Gingko to experience all the benefits this healing herb provides.


<!-- chunk -->

### Age-related cognitive decline is expected as a normal part of aging in our

<!-- chunk -->

### society. This decline can lead to difficulty performing everyday activities

<!-- chunk -->

### like concentrating on what your loved one is saying. Or remembering to

<!-- chunk -->

### attend a family function you’ve been looking forward to for months.

<!-- chunk -->

### This decline will affect your quality of life and affect your mood. And it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### happening to younger and younger people. But many of us in the

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics community refuse to accept cognitive decline as “standard”.

<!-- chunk -->

## Note: One important consideration I found in the research on Gingko

<!-- chunk -->

### Biloba. Some of the findings have been contradictory. Some indicating

<!-- chunk -->

### that Gingko does not work.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the overwhelming impression we got from looking at decades of

<!-- chunk -->

### research was that Gingko Biloba takes a while to work. Often it can take

<!-- chunk -->

### many months of supplementation to see results. And extracts work far

<!-- chunk -->

### better than plain, powdered, ground Ginkgo.

<!-- chunk -->

## Ginkgo Biloba Improves Cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Germany set out to study the effects of Ginkgo Biloba in

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy adults. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial

<!-- chunk -->

### worked with 66 health volunteers for 4-weeks. One group was given a

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo, and the other group took 240 mg of Ginkgo Biloba extract daily.

<!-- chunk -->

### At the end of the trial, those taking Ginkgo Biloba extract saw significant

<!-- chunk -->

### improvements in their “self-perceived” mental health and quality of life.

<!-- chunk -->

### They performed far better on action and reaction tests. And reported a

<!-- chunk -->

### significant improvement in mood compared to those in the placebo

<!-- chunk -->

### group.303

<!-- chunk -->

## Ginkgo Biloba Improves Quality of Life

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study with 1,570 men and women in England took either no

<!-- chunk -->

### dietary supplement or 120 mg of Ginkgo Biloba extract daily for 4, 6, or

<!-- chunk -->

### 10 months.

<!-- chunk -->

### Participants who took Ginkgo extract experienced improvement in

<!-- chunk -->

## activities of daily living, mood and alertness compared to the control

<!-- chunk -->

### (who took nothing).

<!-- chunk -->

## Activities of daily living included multi-tasking, completing household

<!-- chunk -->

### tasks, concentrating during a conversation, remembering important dates,

<!-- chunk -->

### and giving and following directions.

<!-- chunk -->

## Measures of their mood included ratings of anxiety, depression, energy,

<!-- chunk -->

## drowsiness, sadness, and happiness. Alertness factor rated whether they

<!-- chunk -->

### felt alert, clumsy, dizzy, relaxed, and tired.

<!-- chunk -->

### Participants in this study who took Ginkgo Biloba extract the longest

<!-- chunk -->

### reported the greatest improvement in all ratings measured. 10 continuous

<!-- chunk -->

### months of supplementing with Ginkgo extract was more effective than

<!-- chunk -->

### months. Their life improved even more the longer they took Ginkgo Biloba

<!-- chunk -->

### extract.304

<!-- chunk -->

## Gingko Biloba Improves Attention and Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at the University of Northumbria in the UK set out to

<!-- chunk -->

### determine if a single dose of Gingko would improve attention and memory

<!-- chunk -->

### in healthy volunteers. This placebo-controlled, multi-dose, double-blind

<!-- chunk -->

### trial worked with 20 people.

<!-- chunk -->

### Participants were given either a placebo or single-dose of Gingko Biloba

<!-- chunk -->

### extract of 120, 240 or 360 mg. They were tested for their speed of

<!-- chunk -->

### attention, attention accuracy, memory speed and quality of memory. They

<!-- chunk -->

### were tested before the dose or placebo, and again at hours 1, 2.5, 4, and

<!-- chunk -->

### hours.

<!-- chunk -->

### The scientists reported that Ginkgo improved multiple cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### performance measures. Most dramatic were with “speed of attention”. And

<!-- chunk -->

### results were better with the highest dose of 360 mg compared to the

<!-- chunk -->

### mg dose.

<!-- chunk -->

### This improvement was noted at the 2.5-hour mark. But was still noticeable

<!-- chunk -->

### 6 hours after supplementing with Gingko.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that Ginkgo dosing can produce “sustained

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement in attention in healthy young volunteers”.305


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dose of Gingko biloba is 40 mg 3-times per day. But daily

<!-- chunk -->

### dosage can range from 120 – 600 mg depending on the disorder being

<!-- chunk -->

### treated.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most Ginkgo biloba products claim that a minimum of 4 weeks is required

<!-- chunk -->

### to achieve a boost in focus, memory and concentration.


<!-- chunk -->

### There is the potential for an increased risk of bleeding when Ginkgo biloba

<!-- chunk -->

### is used concurrently with antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel

<!-- chunk -->

### (Plavix®)), anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin (Coumadin®), enoxaparin

<!-- chunk -->

### (Lovenox®), heparin) or herbs with coumarin constituents (e.g., angelica,

<!-- chunk -->

### anise, capsicum, celery, chamomile, clove, danshen, garlic, ginger,

<!-- chunk -->

### horseradish, licorice, onion, papain, red clover).

<!-- chunk -->

### Hypomania has been reported in patients with depression when Ginkgo

<!-- chunk -->

### leaf extract was used in combination with fluoxetine (Prozac®)/buspirone

<!-- chunk -->

### (BuSpar®), St. John’s wort, and melatonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginkgo leaf extract can alter insulin secretion. So patients taking insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### should monitor glucose levels closely.

<!-- chunk -->

### There have also been reports of seizures associated with Ginkgo use with

<!-- chunk -->

### patients using medication used to lower seizure threshold. These drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### include propofol (Diprivan®), mexiletine (Mexitil®), amphotericin B

<!-- chunk -->

### (Fungizone®), penicillins, cephalosporins, imipenem/cilastatin

<!-- chunk -->

### (Primaxin®), bupropion (Wellbutrin®), cyclosporine (Neoral®), fentanyl

<!-- chunk -->

### (Sublimaze®), methylphenidate, and theophylline.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginkgo should be used with caution during pregnancy, due to the potential

<!-- chunk -->

### for increased bleeding risk. Ginkgo should be avoided during

<!-- chunk -->

### breastfeeding, due to a lack of sufficient data.


<!-- chunk -->

### Gingko leaf is produced from green, picked leaves grown on plantations

<!-- chunk -->

### specifically developed for pharmaceutical purposes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginkgo biloba extract is available in capsules, tablets, concentrated

<!-- chunk -->

### liquids, sublingual sprays, bars and cola drinks.

<!-- chunk -->

### Standardized products should contain at least 24% flavone glycosides and

<!-- chunk -->

### 6% terpenes (ginkgolides and bilobalides).

<!-- chunk -->

### The products most commonly used in clinical trials are Ginkgo biloba

<!-- chunk -->

### standardized extracts EGb 761 (Tanakan) and LI 1370 (Lichewer Pharma).


<!-- chunk -->

## Ginkgo Biloba extract up to 120 - 240 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Ginkgo Biloba as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Gingko biloba on its own. So you must take it as

<!-- chunk -->

### a standardized supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gingko biloba that has not been standardized to at least 24% flavone

<!-- chunk -->

### glycosides and 6% terpenes does not appear to be effective. So make sure

<!-- chunk -->

### you buy a standardized Ginkgo supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginkgo increases alertness, focus, concentration and memory even in the

<!-- chunk -->

### young and healthy. Many neurohackers report immediate effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with Gingko. But others find they need several weeks for

<!-- chunk -->

### the active compounds found in Ginkgo to take effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest dosing up to 240 mg per day split into 3 doses throughout your

<!-- chunk -->

### day. But please refer to the “Side Effects” section of this chapter before

<!-- chunk -->

### you start using Ginkgo. It’s a powerful supplement and could interact with

<!-- chunk -->

### some medications.


# Ginseng

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginseng is known for calming anxiety, and boosting attention,

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration and memory

<!-- chunk -->

## Ginseng is one of the most popular and well researched herbal medicines

<!-- chunk -->

### in the world. It has been used in North America and Asia for thousands of

<!-- chunk -->

### years.

<!-- chunk -->

### In all, there are 11 species of ginseng. But the name “ginseng” as a

<!-- chunk -->

## nootropic usually refers to either American ginseng (Panax

<!-- chunk -->

## quinquefolius), or Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng). Panax means “cure-

<!-- chunk -->

### all” in Greek.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in thousands of clinical trials have reported on the efficacy of

<!-- chunk -->

## ginseng for; anti-stress, cognition, memory, anti-wrinkle, flu, digestion,

<!-- chunk -->

## diabetes, erectile dysfunction, blood circulation, immune deficiency,

<!-- chunk -->

## menopause, anti-oxidant, cancer and much more.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginseng is rich in various pharmological compounds. Including a series of

<!-- chunk -->

### polyacetylenes, polyphenolic compounds, acidic polysaccharides, and

<!-- chunk -->

## tetracyclic triterpenoid saponins (ginsenosides).

<!-- chunk -->

### Both American and Asian Ginseng contain ginsenosides which researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### believe are the most active ingredient.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here we are investigating ginseng as a nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginseng helps:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Mood and Stress. Ginseng helps improve mood and reduce stress. It

<!-- chunk -->

### works as an adaptogen, reducing adrenal fatigue, boosting GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### and providing an anti-stress effect.306

<!-- chunk -->

## •Neurotransmitters. Ginseng provides neuro-protective effects on

<!-- chunk -->

### the dopaminergic-pathway which can help with ADHD.307 And

<!-- chunk -->

### ginseng is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.

<!-- chunk -->

### Working as an antidepressant and helping some symptoms of

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD.308

<!-- chunk -->

## •Brain Energy. Ginseng acts as an anti-inflammatory by reducing

<!-- chunk -->

### cytokines. And as an anti-oxidant. Boosting ATP production in

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, in part because this antioxidant effect shields

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria.309

<!-- chunk -->

## Overview

<!-- chunk -->

## Ginseng is the most famous medicinal herb in Asia. It must be grown for

<!-- chunk -->

### 5 years before its harvested. The maturity of the plant influences the

<!-- chunk -->

### density of active compounds beneficial to human health.

<!-- chunk -->

### The term “ginseng” comes from the Chinese word ‘rénshēn’ (person +

<!-- chunk -->

### plant root). Because the root shape of ginseng resembles the legs of a

<!-- chunk -->

### human.

<!-- chunk -->

### “Panax” comes from the Greek ‘pan’ (all) and ‘akos’ (cure). In traditional

<!-- chunk -->

### Asian medicine ginseng was used for many different issues affecting

<!-- chunk -->

### human health. An “over-all” cure.

<!-- chunk -->

### The four largest producers of ginseng are South Korea, China, Canada and

<!-- chunk -->

### the U.S, with Canada being the largest exporter. The largest consumer of

<!-- chunk -->

### ginseng is South Korea.

<!-- chunk -->

### South Korea also conducts the majority of research on ginseng. With 1,000

<!-- chunk -->

### scholars who publish at least 100 research papers per year.310

<!-- chunk -->

## The two primary ginsengs used for brain function are Asian Ginseng

<!-- chunk -->

## (Panax ginseng), and American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius).

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginsenosides increase protein synthesis and the activity of

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters in the brain. And ginseng stimulates the formation of

<!-- chunk -->

### blood vessels and improves blood circulation in the brain. Which improves

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and cognitive abilities.311

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Ginseng Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginseng boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Ginseng boosts physical and mental energy. Many of us deal with

<!-- chunk -->

### a lack of energy and chronic fatigue nearly every day. In today’s

<!-- chunk -->

### world, and particularly in Western society, we’re suffering from

<!-- chunk -->

### mental and physical fatigue. From overworked, stressed students to

<!-- chunk -->

### seniors.

<!-- chunk -->

### But this kind of fatigue is not a natural offshoot of ‘getting older’. Often

<!-- chunk -->

### it’s difficult to pinpoint what exactly is causing this fatigue. And the first

<!-- chunk -->

### thing most of us think of is reaching for an energy drink, caffeine, or a

<!-- chunk -->

### prescription stimulant.

<!-- chunk -->

### While these options may work in the short-term, they don’t produce

<!-- chunk -->

### natural energy in your body. This is where ginseng comes in and saves the


<!-- chunk -->

### One double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 30 healthy young adults

<!-- chunk -->

### demonstrated Panax ginseng’s cognitive benefits. The study found that a

<!-- chunk -->

### single dose of 200 mg or 400 mg of ginseng reduced blood glucose levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### And significantly reduced mental fatigue.312

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Ginseng improves memory and learning. Most people who use

<!-- chunk -->

### ginseng report feeling more alert. And several trials show Asian

<!-- chunk -->

### ginseng can improve thinking and learning. Some of the research

<!-- chunk -->

### shows Panax ginseng can boost performance on mental arithmetic,

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration, and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### One example of several that show how ginseng seems to affect memory

<!-- chunk -->

## and learning is by boosting nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurite growth

<!-- chunk -->

## in the brain. This study was done on chicks with the ginsenoside Rb1.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found this ginseng extract significantly potentiated NGF

<!-- chunk -->

### and showed neurite outgrowth.313


<!-- chunk -->

### Our brain chemistry and energy metabolism are constantly changing. And

<!-- chunk -->

### any number of factors from chronic stress to disease and environmental

<!-- chunk -->

### factors can degrade cognitive function.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Memory, recall, reaction time and mood decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neurotransmitters and cellular signaling breakdown

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Chronic stress reduces memory capacity and overall brain health

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Nerve growth factor and neurogenesis decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Free radicals and inflammation damage brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Immune system is compromised

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes can happen at any age. And are certainly contributing

<!-- chunk -->

### factors to age-related cognitive decline.

<!-- chunk -->

## Ginseng benefits

<!-- chunk -->

## Panax ginseng (Asian) and Panax quinquefolius (American) contain a

<!-- chunk -->

## collection of active compounds called ginsenosides. These triterpenoid

<!-- chunk -->

### saponins (plant chemicals) are unique to the ginseng species of plants.

<!-- chunk -->

### And are steroid-like in nature.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here’s a mind-blowing statistic; well over 100 different ginsenosides

<!-- chunk -->

### exist.314 The major ones are designated Ginsenoside Ro, Rb(1), Rb(2), Rc,

<!-- chunk -->

### etc. All are extracted from the rhizome (root) of the ginseng plant.

<!-- chunk -->

### You’ll notice if you’ve reviewed any of the other nootropics listed on my

<!-- chunk -->

### website NootropicsExpert.com, that I usually include a diagram of the

<!-- chunk -->

### active chemical compound in that nootropic. In this case I’m not including

<!-- chunk -->

### the diagram because each compound extracted from ginsenoside is

<!-- chunk -->

### different.

<!-- chunk -->

### Each ginsenoside has a unique effect in your body and brain. And is often

<!-- chunk -->

### even metabolized differently in your digestive system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other components of ginseng include:

<!-- chunk -->

## 3.Polysaccharide ‘Ginsan’ which is an immune system modulator315.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginsan is likely what helps tame inflammation in the brain. Which

<!-- chunk -->

### helps a host of cerebral functions like; neurotransmitters working

<!-- chunk -->

### more effectively, prevents apoptosis (cell death), improves memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### mental energy and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### Anti-inflammatories or not talked about much in the nootropics

<!-- chunk -->

### community. And I think in the future you’ll be hearing a lot more

<!-- chunk -->

### about how important they are to cognitive health and function.

<!-- chunk -->

### •MicroRNA’s which are gene modulators. Researchers have recently

<!-- chunk -->

### identified up to 73 MicroRNA’s in ginseng.316 These tiny non-coding

<!-- chunk -->

### molecules are capable to regulating the gene expression in the DNA

<!-- chunk -->

### of your brain cells. Which is an extremely complex subject in itself.

<!-- chunk -->

### And have the potential to affect nearly everything that happens in


<!-- chunk -->

### •Polysaccharides which have anti-cancer effects. Another subject not

<!-- chunk -->

### talked about in nootropic circles. But fundamentally important to

<!-- chunk -->

### brain health.317

<!-- chunk -->

### •The amino acids L-Arginine and GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid),

<!-- chunk -->

### and glutamate.318 The neurotransmitter GABA is naturally produced

<!-- chunk -->

### in your brain and provides anti-anxiety and calming effects. Likely

<!-- chunk -->

### why supplementing with ginseng has a calming and anti-anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### Several books could be written on how ginseng affects your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Including its appetite-suppressant qualities, ability to boost cognition,

<!-- chunk -->

### reducing fatigue, reducing depression, anxiety, stress, improving memory

<!-- chunk -->

### and learning, as a neuroprotectant, and increasing cerebral blood flow.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Ginseng feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with ginseng should boost your energy levels, both

<!-- chunk -->

### physical and mental. Ginseng has stimulant-like qualities and should help

<!-- chunk -->

### if you’re dealing with chronic fatigue. But unlike standard stimulants,

<!-- chunk -->

### your boost in energy will come with a more ‘relaxed’ feel.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginseng can boost mental alertness. And thinking should feel quicker and

<!-- chunk -->

### clearer. Recall and long-term memory should improve.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginseng also boosts your immune system so you may be able to avoid the

<!-- chunk -->

### flu or a cold. Ginseng is particularly helpful for anyone with a

<!-- chunk -->

### compromised immune system. And if you’re living with or working

<!-- chunk -->

### around anyone else who is sick.


<!-- chunk -->

### Much of the research on ginseng comes out of South Korea. And much of

<!-- chunk -->

## this research has been done with Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng). Showing

<!-- chunk -->

### how Panax ginseng improves cognitive function.

<!-- chunk -->

## American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) has a somewhat different

<!-- chunk -->

### ginsenoside profile from Panax ginseng. And it too shows promise in

<!-- chunk -->

### benefiting human cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

## American Ginseng Boosts Working Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### One double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted with 32 healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### young adults. In this trial, researchers used a highly standardized extract

<!-- chunk -->

### of American ginseng (Cereboost™). Cereboost™ is Panax quinquefolius

<!-- chunk -->

### standardized to 10.65% ginsenosides.

<!-- chunk -->

### This trial used doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg of standardized ginseng. And

<!-- chunk -->

### participants’ mood, cognitive function and blood glucose were measured

<!-- chunk -->

### at 1, 3 and 6 hours after taking the ginseng extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found that standardized American ginseng provided a

<!-- chunk -->

### significant improvement in working memory. Reaction time accuracy and

<!-- chunk -->

### ‘calmness’ significantly improved at just the 100 mg dose. And improved

<!-- chunk -->

### with higher doses.

<!-- chunk -->

## The scientists concluded that there was, “robust working memory

<!-- chunk -->

## enhancement following administration of American ginseng”. And these

<!-- chunk -->

### effects are distinct from that of Asian ginseng.

<!-- chunk -->

### The two ginsengs have different psychopharmacological properties that

<!-- chunk -->

### depend critically on ginsenoside profiles.319

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom-line of this study is that the kind of ginseng you use makes all

<!-- chunk -->

### the difference.

<!-- chunk -->

## Panax Ginseng Protects & Fuels Brain Mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### A stroke is caused by insufficient blood flow to that part of the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### where the stroke occurs. Lack of blood flow shuts down the oxygen and

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrient supply to brain cells. And things start to break down in the heart

<!-- chunk -->

### of the cell’s energy center - the mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### This study was done in the Neurology Department at Xijing Hospital in

<!-- chunk -->

## China. Researchers wanted to find out if ginsenoside Rd, one of the major

<!-- chunk -->

### active ingredients in Panax ginseng, could protect the brain from stroke.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rats were given ginsenoside Rd and then subjected to a stroke by reducing

<!-- chunk -->

### blood flow to part of their brain. (Note for gratitude journal – I’m thankful

<!-- chunk -->

### I’m not a lab rat).

<!-- chunk -->

### The scientists found this Panax ginseng extract protected the rat brain

<!-- chunk -->

### from stroke. And it appeared to do it by protecting brain cell mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### from dysfunction, and apoptosis (cell death).320

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers also demonstrated that ginseng activates multiple enzymes in

<!-- chunk -->

### the Krebs cycle. This helps mitochondria extract maximum energy in the

<!-- chunk -->

### form of ATP from glucose fuel.321 Which is one of the reasons why

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with Ginseng boosts mental energy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Ginseng Improves Mental Performance

<!-- chunk -->

## Actoprotector is a new term given to natural compounds that increase

<!-- chunk -->

### mental performance. And enhance your body’s ability to withstand

<!-- chunk -->

### physical loads without increasing oxygen consumption.322

<!-- chunk -->

### Actoprotectors are a new subclass of adaptogen that increase physical

<!-- chunk -->

### performance. And some extracts of Panax Ginseng are considered

<!-- chunk -->

### Actoprotectors.

<!-- chunk -->

## The main difference of Actoprotectors and psychostimulants (caffeine,

<!-- chunk -->

### Ritalin, modafinil, adrafinil, etc.) is that Actoprotectors cause no increase

<!-- chunk -->

### in oxygen consumption or heat production.

<!-- chunk -->

### The result in improved mental and physical performance are similar. But

<!-- chunk -->

### there’s no “crash” in 4 hours like you get from using a stimulant like

<!-- chunk -->

### Ritalin. You don’t experience the same kind of ‘mental load’ when using

<!-- chunk -->

### ginseng.323

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginseng’s steroid-like phytochemical called ginsenosides are what provide

<!-- chunk -->

### this stimulant-like action in the brain. And an improvement in overall

<!-- chunk -->

### quality of life.

<!-- chunk -->

### One report in 2003 evaluated 9 clinical trials done with humans with

<!-- chunk -->

### ginseng doses from 80 – 400 mg. Study duration spanned 2 – 9 months.

<!-- chunk -->

### And nearly every study evaluated demonstrated some improvement in

<!-- chunk -->

### Quality of Life score.324


<!-- chunk -->

### Dosage of ginseng depends on the extract used, and quality of the extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### And results seem to be largely dependent on the quantity used.325

<!-- chunk -->

### To complicate things even more, ginseng dosage depends on the region

<!-- chunk -->

### where its grown, extract strength, and individual needs.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Chinese for example recommend 2 grams daily while in Europe, the

<!-- chunk -->

### suggested range is 100 – 400 mg daily.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many naturopaths recommend cycling ginseng. Use it for 3 to 4 weeks and

<!-- chunk -->

### take a week break. Remember, ginseng has steroid-like active compounds.

<!-- chunk -->

### So taking it for extended periods without a break is not recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginseng has been and continues to be extensively researched. These doses

<!-- chunk -->

### are based on clinical trial data:

<!-- chunk -->

### •For stress, anxiety or fatigue: 1-gram ginseng daily dosed 500 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### twice per day

<!-- chunk -->

### •For Type 2 diabetes: 200 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### •For erectile dysfunction (ED): 900 mg of Panax ginseng 3-times per

<!-- chunk -->

### day

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom-line is to stay within the dosage recommended by the ginseng

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement manufacturer.


<!-- chunk -->

### Ginseng is a natural supplement and side effects are generally mild. But it

<!-- chunk -->

### can act as a stimulant in some people. Which can cause anxiety and


<!-- chunk -->

### Long-term use or higher than recommended doses can cause headache,

<!-- chunk -->

### dizziness and stomach upset. If you’re going to use ginseng you should

<!-- chunk -->

### cycle your dosing. Use the recommended dose for 3-4 weeks and take a

<!-- chunk -->

### week off before dosing again.

<!-- chunk -->

### Women may experience menstrual changes when supplementing with

<!-- chunk -->

### ginseng.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginseng is NOT recommended by the under-18 neurohacker. Or women

<!-- chunk -->

### who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginseng may affect blood sugar levels. So if you’re taking drugs for

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes, check with your doctor first before supplementing with ginseng.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginseng can interact with:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Blood-thinning medications

<!-- chunk -->

### •Antidepressants

<!-- chunk -->

### •Antipsychotic medications

<!-- chunk -->

### •Stimulants including caffeine, Ritalin, Adderall, modafinil,

<!-- chunk -->

### adrafinil, etc.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Morphine


<!-- chunk -->

### Ginseng supplements are made from ginseng root and root hairs. It’s

<!-- chunk -->

### available in dried, powdered, capsule and tablet form.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginseng is also included in some nootropic stacks and other combination

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement formulas. Some with patented ginseng extracts like

<!-- chunk -->

### Cereboost™, GS15-4, and others.

<!-- chunk -->

### Experienced users of ginseng seem to prefer American Ginseng (Panax

<!-- chunk -->

### quinquefolius) over Asian Ginseng (Panax ginseng). Each is a unique

<!-- chunk -->

### species of ginseng but both have ginsenosides.

<!-- chunk -->

### But American Ginseng is cultivated under stricter conditions avoiding

<!-- chunk -->

### pesticides and herbicides. And the colder growing climate encourages

<!-- chunk -->

### higher concentrations of the active ingredients in ginseng.

<!-- chunk -->

## When buying American ginseng, look for Panax quinquefolius. And when

<!-- chunk -->

## buying Asian ginseng, look for Korean, red or Panax ginseng.

<!-- chunk -->

### And finally, make sure you buy from a reputable supplement maker. Very

<!-- chunk -->

### recently GNC, Target, Walgreens and Walmart stores in the U.S. were

<!-- chunk -->

### found to contain either contaminants or little to zero ginseng. Walgreens

<!-- chunk -->

### ginseng brand was found to contain nothing but garlic powder and rice.326


<!-- chunk -->

## Ginseng 100 - 400 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Ginseng as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Ginseng on its own. So you must take it as a

<!-- chunk -->

### standardized supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginseng is especially helpful for chronic fatigue. And a great way to

<!-- chunk -->

### provide a natural physical and mental energy boost.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginseng provides anti-anxiety and calming effects. And can boost mental

<!-- chunk -->

### alertness, memory, recall, and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginseng is a powerful adaptogen that has been used for thousands of years.

<!-- chunk -->

### The ancient Chinese and other cultures used it for overall health.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest starting with a dose of 100 mg daily. You can safely boost it to 4-

<!-- chunk -->

### 500 mg per day depending on the brand and extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### But remember that ginseng has steroid-like qualities. So make sure you

<!-- chunk -->

### cycle it. Use it for 3-4 weeks and take a week off. And don’t take it late in

<!-- chunk -->

### the day as it may interfere with sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers prefer American over Asian ginseng. It has a slightly

<!-- chunk -->

### different ginsenoside profile. And is grown under stricter conditions

<!-- chunk -->

### ensuring quality and safety.


# Gotu Kola

<!-- chunk -->

### Gotu kola has been shown to increase memory and cognition, repair and

<!-- chunk -->

### reverse damage to brain cells, and boost acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

## Gotu Kola (Centella asiatica) is often called “the student herb” in Bali.

<!-- chunk -->

## Because it sharpens the mind. Gotu kola extract increases dendrite and

<!-- chunk -->

## axon growth in brain cells which helps memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Native to the wetlands of Asia, the ancient Ayurvedic medical system used

<!-- chunk -->

### gotu kola like a first-aid kit. It was used to treat mental fatigue, anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, memory loss, insomnia, fever, syphilis, hepatitis, epilepsy,

<!-- chunk -->

### diarrhea and asthma.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gotu kola even has a link to longevity. The ancients believed that

<!-- chunk -->

### elephants who ate gotu kola leaves lived longer than those that didn’t.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the U.S. and Europe gotu kola is typically used for varicose veins, poor

<!-- chunk -->

### blood circulation in the legs, to treat psoriasis and help heal minor skin

<!-- chunk -->

### wounds.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gotu kola is rich in triterpene saponosides. A study in Japan showed that

<!-- chunk -->

## one of these triterpenoids called asiatic acid was able to stop the growth of

<!-- chunk -->

### cancer cells.327

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, gotu kola has been shown to be particularly effective in

<!-- chunk -->

### elderly memory loss, slow thinking, and reasoning. One study shows

<!-- chunk -->

### significant improvement in Alzheimer’s patients.328

<!-- chunk -->

### And some of the most exciting new research on gotu kola shows it can

<!-- chunk -->

### spur growth in brain cells. Here we explore all the ways gotu kola can help


<!-- chunk -->

## How does Gotu Kola Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Gotu kola boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Neural dendrite and axon growth. Gotu kola helps increase the

<!-- chunk -->

### length and branches of neuron dendrites. And boosts axon growth.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dendrites are tree-like branches extending out from neurons in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### They receive incoming signals from other neurons. Those signals are

<!-- chunk -->

### transmitted from axons extending out from neighboring neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dendrites and axons can change over time, and in response to

<!-- chunk -->

### environmental cues. Learning something new for example cause dendrites

<!-- chunk -->

### to lengthen.

<!-- chunk -->

### But this natural signaling mechanism in your brain’s neurons degrade over

<!-- chunk -->

### time. And several studies have shown how gotu kola can reverse this

<!-- chunk -->

### damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists at the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, Oregon

<!-- chunk -->

### did their research with Sprague-Dawley rats. They put Centella ethaniloc

<!-- chunk -->

### extract, a compound in gotu kola, in the rat’s drinking water.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study concluded that axons grew at a faster rate. And the researchers

<!-- chunk -->

## stated that gotu kola extract was useful for accelerating repair of

<!-- chunk -->

## damaged neurons.329

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study showed rats given gotu kola leaf extract had an increase of

<!-- chunk -->

### 105% in dendrite growth.330

<!-- chunk -->

### A very recent study conducted at Northwestern University and published

<!-- chunk -->

### in Nature shows how dendrites are critical in memory formation.331

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Increase in memory and learning. Gotu kola has been revered for

<!-- chunk -->

### thousands of years for boosting memory. We know that gotu kola

<!-- chunk -->

## extract can increase the availability of acetylcholine (ACh) in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. It does it by preventing ACh from breaking down.

<!-- chunk -->

### This boost in memory may also benefit from gotu kola’s ability to boost

<!-- chunk -->

### the growth of neuron dendrites and axons.

<!-- chunk -->

### In one randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study done in

<!-- chunk -->

### Thailand, researchers gave 28 people gotu kola extract for 2 months. Daily

<!-- chunk -->

### doses ranged from 250, 500 to 750 mg per day. Cognition in these subjects

<!-- chunk -->

### increased, and they experienced a boost in working memory.332


<!-- chunk -->

### Over the course of your life, your brain will lose 5 – 10% of its weight. It

<!-- chunk -->

### starts in your early 20’s.333

<!-- chunk -->

### The Framingham Offspring Cohort Study included 1,352 adults who did

<!-- chunk -->

### not have dementia. 7 years after the start of the study they used an MRI to

<!-- chunk -->

### measure participants brain size. And gave them tests to gauge executive

<!-- chunk -->

### function, planning and organizational skills.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found that people with high blood pressure, diabetes,

<!-- chunk -->

### overweight or smoked had faster brain shrinkage. They showed declines in

<!-- chunk -->

### ability to make decisions, plan, organize and remember details.334

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Memory, cognition, learning and recall decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neuronal cell death results in shrinking gray matter

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neuroplasticity declines degrading long-term potentiation335

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain will shrink regardless of lifestyle. But you can reduce the speed

<!-- chunk -->

### of this shrinkage by using gotu kola.

<!-- chunk -->

## Gotu Kola benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Research from hundreds of studies have shown that gotu kola will:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improve memory and cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### •Restore the availability of acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improve cerebral blood flow

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reduce stress

<!-- chunk -->

### •Help repair brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### •Eliminate free radicals from within brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Gotu Kola feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Gotu kola improves acetylcholine levels in your brain. It increases blood

<!-- chunk -->

### flow and helps reduce oxidative damage and toxins in brain cells. As a

<!-- chunk -->

### result, you may feel a boost in mental activity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many say that taking Gotu Kola is like “energizing of the brain”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Particularly during a period of high mental demand. Mental blocks or

<!-- chunk -->

### mental fatigue feel like they’re swept away.

<!-- chunk -->

### Others report dreams seem more vivid and intense. And gotu kola seems

<!-- chunk -->

### to have an anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effect as well.


<!-- chunk -->

### Ever been on your way to a party with the thought, “I hope I don’t kill too

<!-- chunk -->

### many brain cells”. Science once believed that the adult human brain could

<!-- chunk -->

### not grow new brain cells. We were born with all the brain cells we’ll ever

<!-- chunk -->

### have. Once those cells were gone, they’re gone for good.

<!-- chunk -->

### Not too long ago a study was published in the Journal of Science. It

<!-- chunk -->

### detailed a discovery by scientists of the daily growth of new brain cells in

<!-- chunk -->

### the macaque monkey. And because of this study, we now know your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### can grow new cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the reality is, your brain will lose 5 – 10% of its weight. This

<!-- chunk -->

### shrinkage starts right around your 20th birthday.

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is you can prevent that shrinkage. And you can do it with

<!-- chunk -->

### gotu kola.

<!-- chunk -->

## Gotu Kola Improves Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurons connect to other neurons at a point called a synapse. Electrical

<!-- chunk -->

### pulses carry chemical messages across this gap. These chemical

<!-- chunk -->

### messengers are neurotransmitters. Each neuron in your brain can form

<!-- chunk -->

### thousands of these links.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dendrites extend out from each neuron to neighboring neurons to receive

<!-- chunk -->

### these messages. Your brain uses these neurons in a type of network. And as

<!-- chunk -->

### one neuron sends signals to another, the synapse between the two gets

<!-- chunk -->

### stronger.

<!-- chunk -->

### The more signals sent between these neurons, the stronger the connection

<!-- chunk -->

### grows. With each new experience, your brain slightly rewires this physical

<!-- chunk -->

### structure. This neuroplasticity determines how your brain is organized.

<!-- chunk -->

### And how memories are formed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gotu kola extends these neuron dendrites. And helps improve brain

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroplasticity. A study in animal models demonstrated neurite growth

<!-- chunk -->

## using a compound from gotu kola extract.336 And clearly showed how gotu

<!-- chunk -->

## kola works to boost memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## Gotu Kola Improves Mood and Cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### Gotu kola has been revered for thousands of years for its ability to enhance

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition. So researchers in Thailand worked with 28 people in a placebo-

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled, double-blind trial to put some science behind this reputation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Each participant in this study received an extract of gotu kola at various

<!-- chunk -->

### doses ranging 250, 500, and 750 mg once per day for 2 months. The study

<!-- chunk -->

## showed the higher dose of gotu kola enhanced working memory and

<!-- chunk -->

## mood.337

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in India set out evaluate the nootropic value of gotu kola.

<!-- chunk -->

### Three-month old Swiss albino mice were given doses of gotu kola extract

<!-- chunk -->

### for 15 and 30 days.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found that gotu kola increases acetylcholine activity. And

<!-- chunk -->

## increased dendrites in the mice hippocampus. Showing that gotu kola can

<!-- chunk -->

## promote higher brain function.338


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dose of gotu kola standardized extract is 50 – 250 mg taken

<!-- chunk -->

### 2 or 3 times daily.

<!-- chunk -->

### Standardized extracts should contain 40% asiaticoside, 29 to 30% asiatic

<!-- chunk -->

### acid, 29 to 30 % madecassic acid, and 1 to 2% madecassoside.

<!-- chunk -->

### In human studies in people with venous insufficiency (poor blood

<!-- chunk -->

### circulation in the legs), 90 – 180 mg daily worked well for these patients.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a tincture (1:2 w/v, 30% alcohol): 30 to 60 drops (equivalent to 1.5 to

<!-- chunk -->

### mL, there are 5 mL in a tsp.), 3 times daily.


<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects are rare with gotu kola. But may include skin allergy and

<!-- chunk -->

### burning sensations if you’re applying it on your skin. Taken internally,

<!-- chunk -->

### side effects could include headache, upset stomach, nausea, dizziness and

<!-- chunk -->

### drowsiness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gotu kola has been used in some studies that lasted up to one year. But

<!-- chunk -->

### please note that gotu kola has the potential to be harmful to the liver.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some medical authorities caution that it is best not to use gotu kola for

<!-- chunk -->

### more than 6 weeks without talking to your doctor.

<!-- chunk -->

### Asiaticoside, a major part of gotu kola, has also been linked with tumor

<!-- chunk -->

### growth in mice. If you have a history of precancerous or cancerous skin

<!-- chunk -->

### lesions, such as squamous cell, basal cell skin cancer, or melanoma, you

<!-- chunk -->

### should not use gotu kola.

<!-- chunk -->

### And if you have liver disease, or take medications that affect the liver, you

<!-- chunk -->

### should not take gotu kola. Again, check with your doctor if you take any

<!-- chunk -->

### prescription medications, or often take over-the-counter pain relievers that

<!-- chunk -->

### could affect your liver.


<!-- chunk -->

### Gotu kola is available in teas, dried leaf in powder form, tinctures,

<!-- chunk -->

### capsules, tablets and ointments.


<!-- chunk -->

## Gotu Kola extract up to 600 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Gotu Kola as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make gotu kola. So you must take it as a supplement to

<!-- chunk -->

### get its effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### This ancient herb has a long history of safe use as both an herbal remedy,

<!-- chunk -->

### and food throughout much of southeast Asia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here in the West, gotu kola is mostly used for healing varicose veins and

<!-- chunk -->

### skin conditions. But its overlooked as a nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gotu kola can improve your mood and memory. And protect your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### from free radicals and the toxins you’re exposed to everyday.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gotu kola as a nootropic has the potential to keep you mentally sharp for

<!-- chunk -->

### life. And if the ancients were right, may even help you live longer.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can even rid your day of stress and anxiety by sipping gotu kola tea.

<!-- chunk -->

### Or use a supplement as a cognitive enhancer.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re using gotu kola extract and dosing up to 600 mg per day, split

<!-- chunk -->

### your dose into 200 mg 3-times per day.


# Huperzine-A

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A improves cognition, memory, learning, recall, is an

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant, helps neuroplasticity, and protects against glutamate-toxicity

<!-- chunk -->

## Huperzine-A (Hup-A) is a water-soluble alkaloid nootropic derived from

<!-- chunk -->

### Chinese Club Moss (Huperzia serrata). This plant is native to southeast

<!-- chunk -->

### Asia. And has been used in traditional medicine for millennia to treat skin

<!-- chunk -->

### conditions, muscle problems and to boost blood circulation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A is a reversible acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. Which

<!-- chunk -->

### means it prevents the breakdown down of acetylcholine (ACh). Boosting

<!-- chunk -->

### short-term memory and long-term brain health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A is also a NMDA receptor antagonist. This glutamate

<!-- chunk -->

### receptor’s job is to control synaptic plasticity and memory function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Which is a positive thing. But blocking its function can also be effective at

<!-- chunk -->

### times. By preventing damage from too much acetylcholine. And blocking

<!-- chunk -->

### the toxicity from certain nerve agents.339

<!-- chunk -->

### This combination of boosting acetylcholine and blocking NMDA receptors

<!-- chunk -->

### requires a fine balance. And could explain why it’s beneficial to cycle the

<!-- chunk -->

### use of Huperzine-A. To maintain the delicate balance of neurochemistry in

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain while realizing Huperzine-A’s benefits.

<!-- chunk -->

## Huperzine-A vs. Huperzia serrata: What’s the Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

## Huperzine-A (Hup-A) is produced in the lab from Huperzia serrata

<!-- chunk -->

### (Chinese Club Moss). Huperzine-A is a standardized compound found in

<!-- chunk -->

### this naturally occurring plant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Note that Huperzine-A and Huperzine serrata are NOT the same


<!-- chunk -->

### Some nootropic supplement stacks substitute genuine Huperzine-A with

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzia serrata. All the research I’ve seen uses Huperzine-A in their

<!-- chunk -->

### trials. Not Huperzia serrata.

<!-- chunk -->

### Look for nootropic stacks with genuine Huperzine-A on the label. Or sold

<!-- chunk -->

### as a stand-alone supplement. And avoid stacks or supplements called

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine serrata.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Huperzine-A Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Huperzine-A acts as an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor.

<!-- chunk -->

### AChE is an enzyme that breaks down the important neurotransmitter

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine. So Hup-A helps prevent this breakdown. Allowing

<!-- chunk -->

### more acetylcholine to be available which improves memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### learning.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists at the Weizmann Institute in Israel uncovered how Huperzine A

<!-- chunk -->

### works to block acetylcholinesterase (AChE). They made a 3-D image of

<!-- chunk -->

### the structure of the AChE molecule. And found a deep chasm, called the

<!-- chunk -->

### “active-site gorge”.

<!-- chunk -->

### The scientists found the active-site gorge acts like a guide to funnel

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine into the interior of the enzyme where it is cut apart prior to

<!-- chunk -->

### recycling. This is how AChE blocks acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study revealed that Huperzine-A has the unique ability to fit into this

<!-- chunk -->

### active-site gorge. Like a key into a lock. And appears to bind more tightly

<!-- chunk -->

### and specifically to AChE than other AChE inhibitors.

<!-- chunk -->

### This ability for Huperzine-A to take acetylcholine’s place within the AChE

<!-- chunk -->

### enzyme is how more acetylcholine is made available in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Professor Joel Sussman said, “It is as if this natural substance were

<!-- chunk -->

### ingeniously designed to fit into the exact spot in AChE where it will do the

<!-- chunk -->

### most good.”340

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Huperzine-A also plays a neuroprotective role. Researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### discovered that Hup-A prevents glutamate-induced toxicity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Protecting hippocampus and other cerebral neurons from cell death

<!-- chunk -->

### caused by the amino acid glutamate.341

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to protecting from glutamate-induced toxicity, Huperzine-A

<!-- chunk -->

### also promotes new dendrite growth in neurons.342


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, our brain chemistry and metabolism changes.


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Concentration, attention and mental agility decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Nerve growth factor declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Free radicals damage brain cell mitochondria


<!-- chunk -->

### So Huperzine-A can help for age-related cognitive decline, as well as a

<!-- chunk -->

### student looking to do better in school. By boosting the availability of

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Huperzine-A benefits

<!-- chunk -->

## Huperzine-A boosts acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

## Huperzine-A boosts levels of available acetylcholine in the brain by

<!-- chunk -->

### blocking the effect of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE).

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetylcholine (ACh) is critical for encoding new memories, reasoning,

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration, cognition, and neuroplasticity. Not enough ACh can result

<!-- chunk -->

### in diseases like ADHD, Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A’s benefit as a nootropic can boost short-term mental

<!-- chunk -->

### performance like attention and memory. And even helping your brain for

<!-- chunk -->

### long-term brain health.

<!-- chunk -->

## Huperzine-A is an antioxidant

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A supports brain cell mitochondria. The main energy centers of

<!-- chunk -->

### each cell. It reduces free radical damage by acting as an antioxidant. Free

<!-- chunk -->

### radicals degrade mitochondria and their function. Studies have shown that

<!-- chunk -->

### Hup-A enhances the activities of other antioxidant enzymes as well.343

<!-- chunk -->

## Huperzine-A resists beta-amyloid dysfunction

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A boosts neuron resistance to beta-amyloid induced

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction that could lead to diseases like Alzheimer’s. Beta-amyloid

<!-- chunk -->

### affects ATP levels in mitochondria. Hup-A protects against this damage.344

<!-- chunk -->

## Huperzine-A prevents glutamate toxicity

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A protects brain cells from glutamate toxicity. Too much of the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter glutamate has been associated with brain cell

<!-- chunk -->

### degeneration. And other cognitive dysfunction and behavior. Hup-A seems

<!-- chunk -->

### to slow down this glutamate toxicity at least partly by acting as a NMDA

<!-- chunk -->

### receptor antagonist.345

<!-- chunk -->

## Huperzine-A increases nerve growth factor

<!-- chunk -->

## Huperzine-A boosts nerve growth factor (NGF) in the brain. NGF is

<!-- chunk -->

### critical in brain cell development, maintenance and repair. Declines in

<!-- chunk -->

### NGF-levels in the brain are associated with Alzheimer’s and other

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases. Studies show Hup-A not only prevents this

<!-- chunk -->

### drop of NGF from happening. It actually helps boost the production of

<!-- chunk -->

### NGF.346

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Huperzine-A feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Nootropics users report Huperzine-A provides a boost in mental energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Without the side effects normally associated with a stimulant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Improved cognition and clear thinking are common when using Hup-A.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many report a boost in short-term memory. Recall is better in the long-

<!-- chunk -->

### term.

<!-- chunk -->

### And some with Alzheimer’s report the progression of the disease slows

<!-- chunk -->

### down. Instead of advancing.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should be able to experience the effects of Huperzine-A soon after you

<!-- chunk -->

### take it. It’s water-soluble so it’s digested and enters your cells quickly.

<!-- chunk -->

### One thing to note is; Huperzine-A has a long half-life. In other words, it

<!-- chunk -->

### does not leave your system nearly as quickly as most other nootropics. So

<!-- chunk -->

### many neurohackers restrict their use of Hup-A to a couple of times per

<!-- chunk -->

### week.


<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A is most known for boosting acetylcholine (ACh) in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Efficient ACh neurotransmission is critical for learning, memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### attention.

<!-- chunk -->

### Reduced levels of ACh are associated with declines in cognition and

<!-- chunk -->

### memory. And are implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases

<!-- chunk -->

### including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, ALS and others.

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A supplementation helps even in those with no sign of brain

<!-- chunk -->

### disease. It can enhance attention and memory in most looking to boost


<!-- chunk -->

## Huperzine-A Provides Protection in Chemical Warfare

<!-- chunk -->

### If you ever find yourself in a warzone, you may want to stock up on

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington

<!-- chunk -->

### D.C. are investigating Huperzine-A’s potential as a pretreatment to protect

<!-- chunk -->

### soldiers against chemical warfare nerve agent poisoning.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the studies conducted at Walter Reed looked at Huperzine-A’s

<!-- chunk -->

### protective potential. Scientists found Hup-A to be twice as effective in

<!-- chunk -->

### protecting against the lethal effects of the nerve agent soman as the

<!-- chunk -->

### leading drug in that role called physostigmine. Huperzine-A’s effects

<!-- chunk -->

### lasted for six hours compared to only 90 minutes for the drug.347

<!-- chunk -->

## Huperzine-A Improves Learning & Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### This study is verification of using Huperzine-A as a nootropic at any age.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in China selected 68 students who complained of bad

<!-- chunk -->

### memory. And their learning performance was getting worse in school.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial students were given either

<!-- chunk -->

### 100 mcg of Hup-A or a placebo for 4 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### At the conclusion of the trial, researchers found that the students using

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A scored higher on memory testing than those who took the

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo.348

<!-- chunk -->

## Huperzine-A Improves Cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### Much of the research on Huperzine-A has been done in China. And many

<!-- chunk -->

### of the studies have been with patients suffering from neurodegenerative

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases like Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study done in Shanghai worked with 200 patients who met the criteria

<!-- chunk -->

### for having Alzheimer’s Disease. Researchers gave one group of patients

<!-- chunk -->

### 300-500 mcg of Hup-A daily for 8 – 24 weeks. The other group got a

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### The results of the study showed that Huperzine-A’s effects increased over

<!-- chunk -->

### time. The patients that used Hup-A showed significant improvements in

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition, orientation, attention, memory, mood and behavior.349


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended Huperzine-A dosage is 50 – 200 mcg per day. Hup-A is

<!-- chunk -->

### water-soluble, so you don’t need to take it with a meal, or healthy fat like

<!-- chunk -->

### some nootropics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A is typically sold as 50, 100, or 200 mcg tablets or capsules.

<!-- chunk -->

### Several retail nootropic stacks often include Huperzine-A in their formula.

<!-- chunk -->

### So you should not supplement with more Hup-A while using these pre-

<!-- chunk -->

### made stacks.

<!-- chunk -->

### Since Huperzine-A has at least a 12-hour half-life most neurohackers

<!-- chunk -->

### prefer cycling. This means using Hup-A every 2nd day or even only twice

<!-- chunk -->

### per week.

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A is also available as an injection for therapeutic use. Typically

<!-- chunk -->

### used to treat diseases like Alzheimer’s. Or the muscle weakness condition

<!-- chunk -->

### called myasthenia gravis.


<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A can be toxic if used in larger than recommended doses. Or if

<!-- chunk -->

### you already have too much acetylcholine(ACh) in your system. Remember,

<!-- chunk -->

### Hup-A boosts levels of ACh.

<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects with Huperzine-A are rare but can include symptoms similar

<!-- chunk -->

### to choline-overload like fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, insomnia,

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, dizziness, thirst and constipation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Very rarely will Huperzine-A cause cardiac arrhythmia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Symptoms of acute toxicity are similar to those of other cholinergic

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibitors. And can include fatigue, muscle tremors, drooling, tears,

<!-- chunk -->

### bronchial mucous and incontinence.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do not use Huperzine-A if you’re dealing with epilepsy. And if you have

<!-- chunk -->

### heart disease, use Hup-A with caution. It can slow heart rate.

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A may make asthma or emphysema worse. Because it can

<!-- chunk -->

### cause mucous in the lungs. The same goes for those dealing with urinary

<!-- chunk -->

### tract or reproductive system blockages. It can cause mucous buildup there

<!-- chunk -->

### as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### An important note for Alzheimer’s patients: Huperzine-A can increase the

<!-- chunk -->

### effects of drugs you may already be taking. Talk to your doctor before

<!-- chunk -->

### trying Hup-A.


<!-- chunk -->

## Huperzine-A is sold in tablet or capsule form. Tablets and capsules are

<!-- chunk -->

### usually 50 – 200 mcg each.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some ready-made nootropic stacks include Huperzine-A in their formula.

<!-- chunk -->

## Huperzia serrata is simply raw, powdered Chinese Club Moss and should

<!-- chunk -->

### be avoided. It’s not standardized so you don’t know how much you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### getting. And it’s NOT the same as Huperzine-A.


<!-- chunk -->

## Huperzine-A 200 mcg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Huperzine-A as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does not make Huperzine-A on its own. So to get its benefits


<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A is especially helpful for those suffering from cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction caused by diseases like Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A is also particularly useful to students and executives who

<!-- chunk -->

### want to boost cognition, learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A is a fast-acting nootropic that can also help prevent brain

<!-- chunk -->

### degeneration later in life.

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A does have a long half-life so you may want to cycle it. Either

<!-- chunk -->

### take it every 2nd day, or even twice per week. The benefits are long-lasting

<!-- chunk -->

### and will stay with you.


# Iodine

<!-- chunk -->

### Iodine improves energy levels, cognition, memory and mood

<!-- chunk -->

## Iodine is an essential trace element that combines with the amino acid

<!-- chunk -->

### tyrosine to form thyroid hormones T


<!-- chunk -->

## . Thyroxine (T

<!-- chunk -->

## 4

<!-- chunk -->

## ) contains four

<!-- chunk -->

## iodine atoms, and triiodothyronine (T


<!-- chunk -->

## ) contains three iodine atoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Iodine deficiency is recognized as the most common cause of preventable

<!-- chunk -->

### brain damage in the world. Even moderate deficiency results in a loss of at

<!-- chunk -->

### least 10 – 15 IQ points.350 And the reason I’ve added iodine to our list of

<!-- chunk -->

### essential nootropics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Insufficient iodine is not only a problem in developing countries. Studies

<!-- chunk -->

### have found even in Western countries; iodine deficiency has become a

<!-- chunk -->

### critical health problem.351

<!-- chunk -->

### Your thyroid gland absorbs iodine from your blood supply to make and

<!-- chunk -->

### release thyroid hormones. Your thyroid affects every cell in your body and

<!-- chunk -->

### brain through the hormones T


<!-- chunk -->

### Within your brain, T


<!-- chunk -->

### is converted to T


<!-- chunk -->

### by selenium which then affects

<!-- chunk -->

### gene expression controlling metabolism within cells. And activates the

<!-- chunk -->

### catecholamines dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Malfunctioning thyroid function which is often caused by insufficient

<!-- chunk -->

### iodine results in poor cognition, difficulty learning, problems with recall,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most abundant source of Iodine in our diet comes from seafood like

<!-- chunk -->

### kelp, saltwater fish, seal meat, whale meat, oysters, mussels and lobster.

<!-- chunk -->

### Iodine is also found in beans, milk and milk products, eggs, spinach and

<!-- chunk -->

### vegetables grown in or produced from soil rich in iodine. Typically found

<!-- chunk -->

### near coastal areas of the world.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most seriously iodine-deficient parts of the world are mountainous

<!-- chunk -->

### and inland areas. Including much of the agricultural producing areas of

<!-- chunk -->

### Western countries like Australia, Canada, USA and Europe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nearly all of your body’s functions in nearly every tissue rely on thyroid

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones. Their actions and influence are so wide ranging that you cannot

<!-- chunk -->

### live without them.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thyroid hormones affect brain development, heart rate, lung function,

<!-- chunk -->

### blood function, bone growth, steroid hormone production, including the

<!-- chunk -->

### breakdown of sugar, fat and protein. And even some immune processes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Iodine is even involved in how the other nootropics in your stack are

<!-- chunk -->

### utilized by cells in your brain. The bottom-line is Iodine could be one of

<!-- chunk -->

### the most important additions to any nootropic stack.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Iodine work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Iodine boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Iodine is critical for neurotransmitters. Iodine is required for the

<!-- chunk -->

### production of thyroid hormones T


<!-- chunk -->

### . Thyroid hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors in the brain help regulate the production and use of all

<!-- chunk -->

### important neurotransmitters.

<!-- chunk -->

### Not enough iodine results in too little T


<!-- chunk -->

### in your body. Symptoms of

<!-- chunk -->

### inadequate thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism) include insomnia, fatigue,

<!-- chunk -->

### difficulty concentrating, depression, dry skin and hair, cold sensitivity,

<!-- chunk -->

### frequent and heavy periods for woman, and joint and muscle pain.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Iodine is required for a healthy immune system. Iodine is

<!-- chunk -->

### antibacterial, antiparasitic, antiviral and has anticancer properties.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your thyroid is the main storage site for iodine. But this mineral is also

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrated in your glandular system including your salivary and sweat

<!-- chunk -->

### glands. Ovaries, breasts, pancreas, cerebral spinal fluid, skin, stomach,

<!-- chunk -->

### prostate and your brain all contain high concentrations of iodine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Iodine is a powerful method for removing heavy metals and halides like

<!-- chunk -->

### fluoride, chlorine and bromine from your system. These chemicals

<!-- chunk -->

### compete for the same thyroid receptors in cells used by thyroid hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

### So removing these toxins will help thyroid hormones do their job of gene

<!-- chunk -->

### expression and metabolism.


<!-- chunk -->

### Iodine is needed by the thyroid to produce the thyroid hormones T


<!-- chunk -->

### Part of the endocrine system, the thyroid secretes hormones that enter your

<!-- chunk -->

### circulatory system. And are transported throughout your body. Every cell

<!-- chunk -->

### has receptor sites for thyroid hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurotransmitters are used by neurons to communicate with one another.

<!-- chunk -->

### The presynaptic neuron releases a neurotransmitter which then binds to a

<!-- chunk -->

### receptor on the postsynaptic cell.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here we’re going to explore how neurotransmitters relate to the endocrine

<!-- chunk -->

### system and thyroid health. And what can go wrong.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thyroid hormones are involved in the gene expression needed for

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter release.352 Low levels of iodine result in low levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### thyroid hormones which result in low neurotransmitter levels.

<!-- chunk -->

## Iodine and Serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### Several studies have shown that low T


<!-- chunk -->

### results in reduced levels of

<!-- chunk -->

## serotonin in the brain. If you don’t respond to SSRI’s for depression it

<!-- chunk -->

### could be due to a thyroid hormone imbalance.353 The result is depression.

<!-- chunk -->

## Iodine and GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### In animals and humans there is a direct link between thyroid levels and

<!-- chunk -->

## GABA. Thyroid hormones affect enzymes responsible for synthesis and

<!-- chunk -->

### degradation of GABA, levels of glutamate and GABA, GABA release and

<!-- chunk -->

### reuptake, and GABA(A) receptor expression and function.354

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA is your brain’s natural Valium. GABA can help turn off stress after

<!-- chunk -->

### you get upset. Or even prevent a stress response in the first place. Low

<!-- chunk -->

### iodine results in low levels of thyroid hormones affecting GABA. Which

<!-- chunk -->

### can lead to depression or anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

## Iodine and Dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

## Thyroid hormones play a role in dopamine release in the brain.355 One

<!-- chunk -->

### study showed that an imbalance between thyroid hormones and dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### could be responsible for restless leg syndrome.356

<!-- chunk -->

## Iodine and Acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

## Thyrotrophic-releasing hormone (TRH) increases acetylcholine (ACh)

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis.357 One study showed that those with hypothyroidism had

<!-- chunk -->

### significantly decreased acetylcholine in the hippocampus. And that

<!-- chunk -->

### administration of T


<!-- chunk -->

### normalized ACh levels.358

<!-- chunk -->

### Insufficient iodine can result in hypothyroidism. And negatively affect

<!-- chunk -->

### ACh synthesis in the brain. Affecting cognition, memory, learning, recall

<!-- chunk -->

### and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Not enough iodine in your diet negatively affects neurotransmitters in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. And can result in depression, brain fog, anxiety, learning and

<!-- chunk -->

### memory problems, and ultimately lead to neurodegenerative diseases like

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

<!-- chunk -->

## Iodine benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Most neurohackers associate Iodine with the thyroid because Iodine is

<!-- chunk -->

### needed to produce thyroid hormones T


<!-- chunk -->

### . But Iodine is also

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrated in your salivary glands, stomach, breasts, ovaries, eyes and in


<!-- chunk -->

### Deficiency in Iodine in any tissue will cause problems in that area of your

<!-- chunk -->

### body. And weaken your immune system. Symptoms of low Iodine show up

<!-- chunk -->

### as brain fog, skin problems, fibroids, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

## Iodine can kill bacteria, fungal infections, and viruses. Iodine will

<!-- chunk -->

### remove fluoride, chlorine and bromine.359 And helps your body detox

<!-- chunk -->

### heavy metals like mercury and cadmium that other detox methods can’t

<!-- chunk -->

### remove.

<!-- chunk -->

## Iodine helps prevent and even reverse breast cancer. And helps prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### mental retardation in young children.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain needs sufficient Iodine for cognition through several

<!-- chunk -->

### mechanisms of action. This essential element is involved in gene

<!-- chunk -->

### expression that controls the synthesis of neurotransmitters in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### And how they work.

<!-- chunk -->

## Iodine helps remove fluoride throughout your body including your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show that fluoride can damage your brain, reduce intelligence, and

<!-- chunk -->

### impair memory. Fluoride has even been associated with dementia

<!-- chunk -->

### according to a study by The National Academies of Science, Engineering

<!-- chunk -->

### and Medicine.360

<!-- chunk -->

### One recent study showed that water fluoridation in England is linked to

<!-- chunk -->

### higher rates of underactive thyroid.361 One of the simplest things you can

<!-- chunk -->

### do to boost cognition and your thyroid is to stop using fluoridated water

<!-- chunk -->

### and toothpaste. And start supplementing with Iodine to remove the

<!-- chunk -->

### fluoride toxicity and boost thyroid health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Iodine Deficiency Disorders are considered one of the biggest worldwide

<!-- chunk -->

### public health problems today. Studies around the world show none of us

<!-- chunk -->

### are immune from Iodine deficiency. Estimates range from 10 – 90% of the

<!-- chunk -->

### world population don’t get sufficient Iodine depending on where you

<!-- chunk -->

### live.362

<!-- chunk -->

### Adding Iodine to your stack if you are deficient is one of the easiest and

<!-- chunk -->

### least expensive ways to prevent and even cure a host of health problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Including boosting cognition and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Iodine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers report an increased level of focus, energy, memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### and cognitive ability when supplementing with Iodine.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should also experience improved quality of sleep. And have an overall

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement in mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Others report a profound difference in energy levels, they are more alert,

<!-- chunk -->

### and fatigue in the afternoon disappears. A few even report a significant

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement in tinnitus.


<!-- chunk -->

### One of the most common reasons we use nootropics is to boost memory

<!-- chunk -->

### and mental energy. Memory loss drastically reduces quality of life. And

<!-- chunk -->

### simple brain fog makes it difficult to accomplish the simplest of tasks.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research has shown that Iodine is involved in memory, learning and

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition on several levels. And supplementing with Iodine is one of the

<!-- chunk -->

### most fundamental things you can do to boost cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

## Iodine raises the world’s IQ

<!-- chunk -->

### The world’s greatest concentration of iodine deficient countries in the

<!-- chunk -->

### 1990’s was the former Soviet republics of Central Asia. Worldwide, about

<!-- chunk -->

### 2 billion people or a 3rd of the world population get too little iodine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show that iodine deficiency is the leading preventable cause of

<!-- chunk -->

## mental disorders. Even moderate deficiency lowers intelligence by 10 –

<!-- chunk -->

## 15 IQ points.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most visible and severe effects manifest as goiters, dwarfism and

<!-- chunk -->

## cretinism. Ever hear someone use the derogatory term “cretin” to describe

<!-- chunk -->

### someone with low intelligence?

<!-- chunk -->

### Cretin describes a child born and raised with severe mental disabilities,

<!-- chunk -->

### small stature and weakness all due to not enough Iodine in the mother’s

<!-- chunk -->

### diet when she was pregnant.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Japan, people get Iodine from seafood, seaweed, vegetables grown in

<!-- chunk -->

### Iodine-rich soil or animals that eat grass grown in that soil. But even in

<!-- chunk -->

### wealthy nations like the USA and the UK, people still need to supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Usually by using iodized salt. Or adding it to their stack as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### According to Dr. Gerald Burrow, a former dean of Yale’s medical school,

<!-- chunk -->

### “For 5 cents per person per year, you can make the whole population

<!-- chunk -->

### smarter than before”. Simply by adding iodine to the salt supply.

<!-- chunk -->

### Back in the old Soviet republic, Kazakh children were stunted compared to

<!-- chunk -->

### same-age Russian children. A survey of 5,000 households in 1996 found

<!-- chunk -->

### that 10 percent of children were stunted. And iodine deficiency identified

<!-- chunk -->

### as the main culprit.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan

<!-- chunk -->

### campaigns were run promoting iodized salt. Salt companies were

<!-- chunk -->

### persuaded to add iodine to salt before putting it in stores.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Kazakhstan in 1999, only 29% of households were using iodized salt.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now, 94% of households are. And in 2007, the United Nations certified the

<!-- chunk -->

### country officially free of iodine deficiency disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### In raising the world’s IQ, the secret’s in the salt.363

<!-- chunk -->

## Iodine deficiency and ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### A 10-year study conducted in Italy investigated children born to 16 women

<!-- chunk -->

### from an iodine-deficient area (Area A) and 11 control women in an iodine-

<!-- chunk -->

### sufficient area (Area B).

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD was diagnosed in 11 of the 16 children born in Area A but none in

<!-- chunk -->

### Area B. Total IQ score was nearly 20-points lower in Area A children

<!-- chunk -->

### compared to Area B.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers noted that the prevalence of ADHD in children born in

<!-- chunk -->

### Area A could only be compared to similar children with a resistance to

<!-- chunk -->

### thyroid hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

### And that iodine-deficiency was the likely cause of ADHD due to a critical

<!-- chunk -->

### reduction in intracellular thyroid hormone T


<!-- chunk -->

### available to the developing

<!-- chunk -->

### brain.364


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended Iodine dosage is very difficult because everyone needs

<!-- chunk -->

### different amounts based on your body’s ability to use the Iodine. And the

<!-- chunk -->

### level of exposure you have to daily toxins like fluoride, chlorine, and other

<!-- chunk -->

### halides.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are dealing with a severe health problem, then your dosages would

<!-- chunk -->

### need to be higher that someone trying to maintain good health.

<!-- chunk -->

## Maintenance and for optimal cognition – Natural health doctors have

<!-- chunk -->

### been recommending up to 50 mg of Iodine per day. But I’ve since revised

<!-- chunk -->

### my recommendations based on the latest research and potential health

<!-- chunk -->

### problems caused by iodine toxicity.

<!-- chunk -->

### The maximum adult dosage for adult is 1 mg Iodine per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended maintenance dosage is the same.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cancer – Cancer is a result of mutated cells. Iodine is critical for the P53

<!-- chunk -->

### gene which prevents damaged cells from dividing.365 Iodine and selenium

<!-- chunk -->

### helps P53 do its job of eliminating abnormal cells. Cancer patients have

<!-- chunk -->

### used 50 – 300 mg of Iodine per day successfully.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supporting supplements to take with Iodine include:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Selenium – 200 mcg per day. Selenium is required for the

<!-- chunk -->

### production of T


<!-- chunk -->

### . And assists in detox.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Vitamin C – 2,000 – 5,000 mg per day helps support thyroid

<!-- chunk -->

### symporters which transport thyroid hormones through the body

<!-- chunk -->

### including across the blood-brain barrier. And assists in detox.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Magnesium – 400 mg per day. (See my chapter on Magnesium as a

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic).

<!-- chunk -->

### Iodine is fat-soluble and should be taken with food particularly if you have

<!-- chunk -->

### a sensitive stomach. The supporting supplements can be taken at the same

<!-- chunk -->

### time as your Iodine dose.

<!-- chunk -->

### Iodine should be taken early in the day because it can increase energy

<!-- chunk -->

### levels so much you could have problems sleeping.


<!-- chunk -->

### Most forms of Iodine can cause diarrhea and bloating. Particularly at

<!-- chunk -->

### higher doses. Those with a sensitive stomach could experience stomach

<!-- chunk -->

### pain and is the reason I suggest taking Iodine with food.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is also possible to overdose on Iodine. So please start at a lower dose

<!-- chunk -->

### and see how your body reacts. Symptoms of Iodine overdose include

<!-- chunk -->

### abdominal pain, delirium, fever, vomiting and shortness of breath.

<!-- chunk -->

### Iodine is a powerful method for removing toxins and heavy metals from

<!-- chunk -->

### your body which can also produce unpleasant effects. If you experience

<!-- chunk -->

### flu-like symptoms when starting Iodine its very likely you’re feeling the

<!-- chunk -->

### effects of toxins being flushed out of your cells and your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### For more on Iodine toxicity you can browse an extremely poorly

<!-- chunk -->

### formatted, very long post about Iodine on the Toxicology Data Network.


<!-- chunk -->

## Iodine is sold in many forms but the main thing to look for; does the

<!-- chunk -->

### product contain both Iodine and Iodide. Your body needs both forms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Breasts look for Iodine and the thyroid needs Iodide. Contrary to some

<!-- chunk -->

### sources; your body cannot convert supplemental Iodine to Iodide.

<!-- chunk -->

### Also important is to find a product that provides milligram (Mg) doses vs.

<!-- chunk -->

### microgram (Mcg) amounts. Mcg doses will offer very little health benefit.

<!-- chunk -->

### And are much more expensive compared to Lugol’s.

<!-- chunk -->

## Recommended forms

<!-- chunk -->

### •Lugol’s liquid – Iodine/Potassium Iodide – 2% and 5% solutions. 2%

<!-- chunk -->

### solution is 2.5 mg/drop and 5% solution is 6.25 mg/drop

<!-- chunk -->

### •Iodoral – Lugol’s formula in pill form – Iodine/Potassium Iodide –

<!-- chunk -->

### 12.5 mg and 50 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### •Biotics Research Iodizyme – 12.5 mg per tablet of Iodine/Iodide

<!-- chunk -->

### •Tri-Iodine by Vitaminlife – 12.5 mg per tablet of Iodine/Iodide

<!-- chunk -->

## Other forms not recommended

<!-- chunk -->

### •“Nascent Iodine” which is iodine in its atomic state and is a very

<!-- chunk -->

### low dose. Not enough to detox heavy metals, fluoride, bromine and

<!-- chunk -->

### chloride. Or to saturate tissues.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Iosol which is Iodine only, and the micro doses have the same issues

<!-- chunk -->

### as Nascent Iodine

<!-- chunk -->

### •Prolamine which has 3 mg of Iodine and 20 mg of Calcium which is

<!-- chunk -->

### too low to detox the body and saturate tissues

<!-- chunk -->

### •Pure Encapsulations, Solaray, Source Naturals, Progressive Labs and

<!-- chunk -->

### NOW all offer mcg doses of Iodide only

<!-- chunk -->

### •Kelp because of low Iodine status, not being able to determine levels

<!-- chunk -->

### of Iodine and possibly toxic due to arsenic and halides


<!-- chunk -->

## Iodine up to 1 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Iodine as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does not make Iodine on its own. So to get its benefits it needs

<!-- chunk -->

### to come from your diet. Or you must take it as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Iodine is especially helpful for those dealing with brain fog, poor

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition and memory, low energy levels and a sluggish thyroid.

<!-- chunk -->

### Iodine is also particularly useful to help rid your body of the daily toxins

<!-- chunk -->

### we’re exposed to every day including heavy metals, fluoride, chloride,

<!-- chunk -->

### bromine, and other halides.

<!-- chunk -->

### While most forms of Iodine are helpful for overall health, keep in mind

<!-- chunk -->

### it’s the thyroid hormones T


<!-- chunk -->

### which influence cognitive health.

<!-- chunk -->

## Thyroid hormones are produced from tyrosine and Iodine. And the

<!-- chunk -->

### production of T


<!-- chunk -->

### from T


<!-- chunk -->

### requires selenium which should be a part of your

<!-- chunk -->

### stack when using Iodine.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend an Iodine supplement which contains both Iodine and

<!-- chunk -->

### Potassium Iodide to boost cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

## Iodine is a fast-acting nootropic that can also help prevent brain

<!-- chunk -->

### degeneration later in life.


# Kava

<!-- chunk -->

### Kava is known for its anti-anxiety and calming effects, improving

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition & memory, and reducing irritability and depression

<!-- chunk -->

## Kava (Piper methysticum) is a small shrub native to the South Pacific

<!-- chunk -->

### islands including Vanuatu, Fiji, Hawaii, and others. And has been safely

<!-- chunk -->

### used by islanders for 3,000 years. Piper methysticum (Piper is Latin for

<!-- chunk -->

### ‘pepper’. And methysticum is derived from the Greek for ‘intoxicating’).

<!-- chunk -->

### In Polynesia and Micronesia, Kava has been traditionally used as a

<!-- chunk -->

### ceremonial drink. Kava is best known for elevating contentment, mood,

<!-- chunk -->

### well-being and a sense of relaxation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Several clinical studies have found kava to be effective in treating

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of anxiety. Other studies have shown kava to help improve

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep quality.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, kava is used primarily to lower anxiety with a potency

<!-- chunk -->

### rivalling some anti-anxiety prescription drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Kava helps:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Neurotransmitters. Kava affects brain levels of GABA receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA is the ‘calming’ neurotransmitter. And an increase in

<!-- chunk -->

### receptor sites for GABA accounts for Kava’s anti-anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### properties.366

<!-- chunk -->

## •Neuroprotection. Kava provides protective effects against strokes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Two of Kava’s compounds, dihydromethysticin and methysticin are

<!-- chunk -->

### similar in potency to Memantine which is used to treat Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### Disease.367

<!-- chunk -->

## •Cognition. Kava improves reaction time and cognitive function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Kavalactones in Kava interact with ion channels in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Influencing neurotransmitter function.368

<!-- chunk -->

### Kava continues to have a central place in everyday life in the islands

<!-- chunk -->

### where its grown.369 It’s used as a ceremonial beverage in Fiji where it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### commonly given to the Head of State.370

<!-- chunk -->

### Kava root contains a collection of 6 bioactive compounds called

<!-- chunk -->

### kavalactones (kavapyrones); including kawain, dihydrokavain,

<!-- chunk -->

### methysticin, dihydromethysticin, yangonin, and desmethoxyyangonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Kava also contains small amounts of other alkaloids, flavonoids and

<!-- chunk -->

### glutathione.

<!-- chunk -->

### The presence of glutathione seems to reduce the toxicity of some other

<!-- chunk -->

### kavalactones. Standardized extracts are important in deciding on what

<!-- chunk -->

### Kava supplement to buy to ensure reliability and safety.371

<!-- chunk -->

### The main compounds in Kava readily cross the blood-brain barrier. And

<!-- chunk -->

### reaches your brain in about 45 minutes after taking the supplement.372

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Kava work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## Kava boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Kava boosts cognition. Kava relaxes the muscles and mind, but it

<!-- chunk -->

### doesn’t affect cognition the way other antidepressants and anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety drugs do.

<!-- chunk -->

### After a review of 10 clinical studies of Kava, scientists at Australia’s

<!-- chunk -->

### Brain Sciences Institute at Melbourne University found Kava did not

<!-- chunk -->

### negatively affect cognition. In fact, some studies on Kava show it

<!-- chunk -->

### “significantly improved visual attention and working memory processes”.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team stated that Kava’s “enhanced cognition may be

<!-- chunk -->

### attributed to the ability of Kava to inhibit re-uptake of noradrenaline in

<!-- chunk -->

### the pre-frontal cortex”.373

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Kava relieves anxiety. Several clinical studies have shown that

<!-- chunk -->

### Kava relieves anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### California’s Global Neuroscience Initiative Foundation took a look at

<!-- chunk -->

### studies of Kava and other herbal medicines for anxiety. And there was

<!-- chunk -->

### substantial evidence that Kava relieved not only anxiety, but also

<!-- chunk -->

### restlessness and insomnia.

<!-- chunk -->

### They even looked at animal studies that showed Kava has anxiolytic

<!-- chunk -->

### effects “but not sedative or mental impairing” effects “which are typical

<!-- chunk -->

### side effects caused by benzodiazepines”.374


<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic stress, anxiety, loss of neuroreceptors and neurotransmitters can

<!-- chunk -->

### damage your brain. And one of the ways this manifests is memory loss.

<!-- chunk -->

### It comes as no surprise that people with memory loss experience higher

<!-- chunk -->

### rates of anxiety and depression. As verified in one Australian research

<!-- chunk -->

### study.375


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Bioavailability of neurotransmitters decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Number of neuroreceptors decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Increase in anxiety destroys quality of life

<!-- chunk -->

### Under conditions of chronic stress your brain loses the capacity to

<!-- chunk -->

### transmit signals between neurons efficiently. Memory, cognition, and

<!-- chunk -->

### decision-making all suffer as a result.

<!-- chunk -->

## Kava benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Kava has a long and proven record of medicinal therapeutic value. Much

<!-- chunk -->

### of the clinical evidence supports the use of Kava in treatment of anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unlike benzodiazepines, Kava does not have similar sedative and mental

<!-- chunk -->

### impairing effects. And Kava seems to provide this calming effect by

<!-- chunk -->

### increasing the number of GABA-a receptors.376

<!-- chunk -->

### Kava extracts have also been seen to bind to GABA, dopamine, serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### and opioid receptors as well.377 This implies that more of each

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter is available to the brain since their associated receptors

<!-- chunk -->

### are blocked or inhibited by Kava.

<!-- chunk -->

### Kava extracts have also shown antidepressant effects. Some of the trials

<!-- chunk -->

### demonstrating this effect on depression also noted that Kava raised no

<!-- chunk -->

### safety concerns at the doses and duration studied. Unlike some well-

<!-- chunk -->

### known pharmaceutical antidepressants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Kava has also been shown to boost cognition and attention. In one study

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers stated that Kava’s “enhanced cognition may be attributed to

<!-- chunk -->

### the ability of kava to inhibit re-uptake of noradrenaline in the pre-frontal

<!-- chunk -->

### cortex…”

<!-- chunk -->

### And finally, Kava also prevents and may even treat several types of cancer.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows for example that one of the components of Kava,

<!-- chunk -->

### Flavokavain B reduces prostate tumor growth and inhibits cancer.378

<!-- chunk -->

### And that’s just one of many examples of how different components of

<!-- chunk -->

### Kava can fight cancer in the lung, bladder, and other organs.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Kava feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### This can be a little complicated so stay with me. Any particular

<!-- chunk -->

### preparation of Kava will contain up to 18 different kavalactones. Each will

<!-- chunk -->

### have some type of psychoactive effect in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### And to complicate things even more, there are several distinct strains of

<!-- chunk -->

### Kava grown in Hawaii and the South Pacific today. All with their own

<!-- chunk -->

### unique profiles of kavalactones and as a result, their own subtle

<!-- chunk -->

### differences in effect.

<!-- chunk -->

## In general, supplementing with Kava (Piper methysticum) can make you

<!-- chunk -->

### feel relaxed, enhancing calmness and lowering anxiety while promoting

<!-- chunk -->

### sociability.

<!-- chunk -->

### Higher doses can generate feelings of gentle euphoria, with greater

<!-- chunk -->

### sedation and mild motor impairment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers say that at lower doses, Kava’s effects are a little like

<!-- chunk -->

### those generated by alcohol and certain kinds of anti-anxiety medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some users say it works as well as popping a Xanax.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should experience an increase in focus along with a sense of calm.

<!-- chunk -->

### And even though Kava works well as a sleep aid, taking it during the day

<!-- chunk -->

### shouldn’t make you drowsy.


<!-- chunk -->

### Kava has a lot of clinical research to back up its reputation as a nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research studies have been noted throughout this chapter. Here are two

<!-- chunk -->

### more…

<!-- chunk -->

## Kava as an anti-anxiety therapy

<!-- chunk -->

### A study at the University of Melbourne, revealed that Kava could be an

<!-- chunk -->

### alternative treatment for those suffering from Generalized Anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### Disorder (GAD).

<!-- chunk -->

### In this 6-week placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, 75 patients with

<!-- chunk -->

### clinically diagnosed GAD were given Kava or a placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### Participants were given Kava extract tablets twice per day for a total dose

<!-- chunk -->

### of 120 mg kavalactones for the first 3 weeks. In cases of non-response, the

<!-- chunk -->

### dose was increased to a double-dose twice per day for the 2nd three weeks

<!-- chunk -->

### of the trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and noradrenaline transporter

<!-- chunk -->

### polymorphisms were analyzed as potential pharmacogenetic markers of

<!-- chunk -->

### response. Reduction in anxiety was measured using the Hamilton Anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### Rating Scale (HAMA) as the primary outcome.

<!-- chunk -->

### Kava was well-tolerated. And results showed no significant differences in

<!-- chunk -->

### liver function. One interesting observation during this study was that

<!-- chunk -->

### subjects who had genetic differences in GABA transporters modified their

<!-- chunk -->

### response to Kava.

<!-- chunk -->

### NOTE: This last observation is just another clue on why some people

<!-- chunk -->

### respond to some nootropics different than others. And why we often say

<!-- chunk -->

### that “Your Mileage May Vary” when using a nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### At the conclusion of this trial, 26% of the Kava group were considered in

<!-- chunk -->

### remission for their anxiety symptoms compared to the placebo group.

<!-- chunk -->

### Overall, all participants who received Kava, showed a significant

<!-- chunk -->

### reduction in anxiety levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### And one additional finding of this study was that Kava increased the

<!-- chunk -->

### female participants sex drive.379

<!-- chunk -->

## Kava enhances cognitive performance

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy volunteers. The purpose of the trial was to investigate the effects

<!-- chunk -->

### of Kava on emotions and cognitive performance.

<!-- chunk -->

### One group was given a single dose of Kava extract (300 mg). And that

<!-- chunk -->

### single dose led to an increase in “cheerfulness”, improved accuracy and

<!-- chunk -->

### speed in task performance, increased visual attention and a boost in short-

<!-- chunk -->

### term memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team compared the effects of Kava to conventional

<!-- chunk -->

### benzodiazepine-type anxiolytics which tend to impair cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### performance. The team concluded Kava is a potent anxiolytic agent which

<!-- chunk -->

### can boost cognitive function.380


<!-- chunk -->

### Kava extracts are made with a variety of different strengths, and from

<!-- chunk -->

### different source plant material. So it’s difficult to recommend exact

<!-- chunk -->

### dosages.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fortunately, Kava is relatively forgiving as far as dose is concerned. So

<!-- chunk -->

### taking 2-3 times the recommended dose of an extract should cause no

<!-- chunk -->

### issues.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some neurohackers claim that extracts are just not strong enough. And the

<!-- chunk -->

### only way to get the full effect of Kava is to use ground Kava root which

<!-- chunk -->

### can be found at some natural food stores. Make sure it smells fresh (it

<!-- chunk -->

### should have a relatively strong smell).

<!-- chunk -->

### Fresh powder is used to make a cold tea by making a cold water

<!-- chunk -->

### extraction. Fresh powder is soaked in cold water for 15-20 minutes or

<!-- chunk -->

### more, stirring or shaking occasionally. You can then strain out the powder

<!-- chunk -->

### if you like.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you want to go the capsule route, look for a Kava extract called

<!-- chunk -->

### “WS1490”. For anxiety and other cognitive issues use 300 mg of this

<!-- chunk -->

### extract daily. Preferably split into three 100 mg doses. One dose in the

<!-- chunk -->

### morning, one early afternoon and the last in the evening.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can also choose a Kava extract supplement with 250 mg total

<!-- chunk -->

### kavalactones. You can use this multiple times throughout the day. If you

<!-- chunk -->

### use only a single dose, take it just prior to sleep.


<!-- chunk -->

### Kava has a long and proven track record of medicinal therapeutic value.

<!-- chunk -->

### But if you start doing research on Kava, you’ll see reports of possible liver

<!-- chunk -->

### toxicity. Let’s address this right now.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most research shows there is little to no evidence to support this notion of

<!-- chunk -->

### liver damage when using Kava. For example, one large review out of the

<!-- chunk -->

### University of Melbourne included 24 clinical studies.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the researchers stated, “Of the 435 clinical trial participants taking

<!-- chunk -->

### Kava supplements in our review, some at high doses, no liver issues were

<!-- chunk -->

### reported. Therefore, the current review supports the conclusion that liver

<!-- chunk -->

### toxicity is indeed a rare side effect.”381

<!-- chunk -->

### For most of the history of the Kava industry, it’s been harvested and

<!-- chunk -->

### prepared by native, Pacific Islanders. Roots are stored in bulk after

<!-- chunk -->

### harvest. And could develop mold or acquire other contaminants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Increasingly, many Kava suppliers harvest and process their Kava using

<!-- chunk -->

### international manufacturing standards such as ISO, GMP and others. And

<!-- chunk -->

### because of the restrictions by first world countries (esp. the European

<!-- chunk -->

### Union) on the importation of raw ingredients, these protocols are now

<!-- chunk -->

### stricter.

<!-- chunk -->

### So when selecting a Kava product, make sure the manufacturer is adhering

<!-- chunk -->

### to good manufacturing practices.

<!-- chunk -->

### Long-term heavy and consistent consumption of Kava could cause a scaly

<!-- chunk -->

### skin rash called dermopathy. This is reversible when Kava use stops.

<!-- chunk -->

### And finally, Kava should not be mixed with prescription drugs. Don’t use

<!-- chunk -->

### Kava if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. Kava use may make you unable

<!-- chunk -->

### to drive (similar to alcohol). Don’t use Kava if you have liver problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### And avoid combining Kava with Xanax, clonazepam, lorazepam,

<!-- chunk -->

### phenobarbital, and Ambien.


<!-- chunk -->

### In the South Pacific, whole Kava root are chewed for their medicinal

<!-- chunk -->

### value.

<!-- chunk -->

### Kava is also available in liquid form, as tinctures, and standardized

<!-- chunk -->

### extracts as capsules or tablets.


<!-- chunk -->

## Kava extract 250 - 500 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Kava as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Kava on its own. So you must take it as a


<!-- chunk -->

### Kava is especially helpful for those suffering from anxiety and stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show it helps stop and reverse the devastating effects of anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### and stress in your brain, and body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Kava also has a reputation for lifting mood. And doesn’t have the same

<!-- chunk -->

### side effects as prescription antidepressants.

<!-- chunk -->

### And unlike pharmaceuticals like benzodiazepines, Kava boosts cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### and short-term memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### The usual serving of prepared Kava in the South Pacific is 2-4 fluid

<!-- chunk -->

### ounces. Depending on how its prepared, a bilo (coconut half shell) can

<!-- chunk -->

### contain anywhere from 150 – 500 mg of kavalactones. And native

<!-- chunk -->

### islanders often consume several bilos in a Kava drinking session.

<!-- chunk -->

### Although the local Kava Committee has issued an advisory upper limit of

<!-- chunk -->

### 300 mg of kavalactones per day, many Pacific islanders consume far more,

<!-- chunk -->

### without any ill effects.


# L-Carnosine

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnosine improves cognition, memory, energy levels, prevents brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cell death, and is anti-aging

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is a dipeptide of the amino acids beta-

<!-- chunk -->

### alanine and histidine. Carnosine is found throughout your body. The

<!-- chunk -->

### highest concentrations are in high energy demand areas such as your brain,

<!-- chunk -->

## heart and muscles. (Don’t mistake l-carnosine for l-carnitine).

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnosine is known as the ‘longevity molecule’. But don’t let that put

<!-- chunk -->

### you off if you’re not concerned about anti-aging. Carnosine levels

<!-- chunk -->

### decrease with age – starting at age 10! And decrease by 63% by the time

<!-- chunk -->

### you reach 70 years.382

<!-- chunk -->

## It removes heavy metals which accumulate in, and damage brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### causing diseases like Alzheimer’s.383 And it prevents cross-linking of

<!-- chunk -->

### proteins which cause the neurofibrillary tangles found in Alzheimer’s.384

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnosine is one of the most powerful antioxidants known. It’s a heavy-

<!-- chunk -->

### metal scavenger. It’s a super auto-regulator. And it stands alone when it

<!-- chunk -->

## comes to preventing and reversing advanced glycation end products

<!-- chunk -->

## (AGEs) or cross-linking. And it’s highly concentrated in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain uses l-carnosine to repair tissue and clear away toxins. And

<!-- chunk -->

### increase the energy output of your mitochondria. It suppresses excess

<!-- chunk -->

### immune responses when your immune system is in hyper mode. And it

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulates the immune response if you have a weakened immune system.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnosine even seems to have the ability to normalize brain waves.

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Carnosine fights mitochondrial dysfunction by relieving oxidative

<!-- chunk -->

### stress caused by accumulation of free radicals in cells.385

<!-- chunk -->

### This not only works in your brain cells. L-Carnosine is used by athletes to

<!-- chunk -->

### achieve better results. Its buffering nature contributes to the acid-base

<!-- chunk -->

### balance in muscles.

<!-- chunk -->

## Researchers have found l-carnosine restores neurotransmitter receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

### Receptors that were damaged from stroke or glutamate toxicity.386

<!-- chunk -->

## And l-carnosine reduces damage to telomeres. These caps on the end of

<!-- chunk -->

### DNA strands shorten with each cell replication. This natural, ongoing

<!-- chunk -->

### process is used for example in long-term potentiation needed to form

<!-- chunk -->

### memories. L-carnosine slows the rate of shortening of telomeres.387

<!-- chunk -->

### Some l-carnosine is naturally produced in your body by the enzyme

<!-- chunk -->

### carnosine synthetase. And you can get l-carnosine from food - primarily

<!-- chunk -->

### from red meat and poultry. But a typical meal provides only about 250 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### of carnosine. It’s then quickly degraded in your body by the carnosinase

<!-- chunk -->

### enzyme.

<!-- chunk -->

### This means carnosine from food doesn’t last long enough in your body to

<!-- chunk -->

### provide much benefit. And if you’re a vegetarian, you won’t be getting

<!-- chunk -->

### much carnosine other than what’s naturally produced in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with at least 1,000 mg of l-carnosine per day overwhelms

<!-- chunk -->

### that carnosinase enzyme. Allowing you to maintain consistent blood levels

<!-- chunk -->

### of this vital nutrient.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does L-Carnosine Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnosine boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.L-Carnosine is critical for brain health. L-Carnosine’s

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant, neuroprotective, chelating, and anti-glycation activity

<!-- chunk -->

### not only maintains optimal brain health. This dipeptide can be used

<!-- chunk -->

### to prevent and treat neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, diseases

<!-- chunk -->

### of the sense organs (i.e. eyes) and cancer.388

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnosine has been shown to reduce oxidative and glycemic stress.389

<!-- chunk -->

### And it reduces inflammation. L-carnosine reduces the accumulation of b-

<!-- chunk -->

### amyloid plaque which plays a role in cognitive dysfunction and

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s. And it helps remove heavy metals that cross the blood-brain

<!-- chunk -->

### barrier and accumulate in brain cells.390

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.L-Carnosine is required for healthy mitochondria. In your brain,

<!-- chunk -->

### you can have thousands of mitochondria in each cell. And they

<!-- chunk -->

### pump out energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). 20%

<!-- chunk -->

### of your body’s total ATP is located in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glycation during this energy production reduces the functionality and

<!-- chunk -->

### efficiency of mitochondria. This is turn can cause apoptosis (cell death).391

<!-- chunk -->

### Glycation happens when proteins or DNA bond chemically to sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### molecules.

<!-- chunk -->

### These sugar molecules go on to form advanced glycation end products

<!-- chunk -->

### (AGEs). These AGEs are implicated in Alzheimer’s, skin wrinkles,

<!-- chunk -->

### hardened arteries, and reducing the function of most major organs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Including your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study in the Netherland was done to examine the association between

<!-- chunk -->

### AGEs and cognitive function. This population-based study also included

<!-- chunk -->

### 215 people with type 2 diabetes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers tested for global cognitive functioning, information

<!-- chunk -->

### processing speed, verbal memory (immediate and delayed word recall),

<!-- chunk -->

### and response inhibition.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study found there was a direct correlation with markers measured for

<!-- chunk -->

### AGEs and decreased cognitive performance. And the associations were no

<!-- chunk -->

### different between healthy people and those with diabetes.392

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study out of the University of California determined that l-

<!-- chunk -->

### carnosine was able to prevent AGEs.393

<!-- chunk -->

### Free electrons are a byproduct of this energy production. These electrons

<!-- chunk -->

### convert oxygen to a highly reactive form capable of damaging brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### And wreaking havoc with DNA in the long-term.

<!-- chunk -->

### If left unchecked, it leads to neurodegenerative disease like memory loss,

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition dysfunction, and eventually diseases like Alzheimer’s.


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, our brain chemistry and metabolism changes.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ ATP levels decline in mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Cognition, learning, memory and recall decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ AGEs damage brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Free radicals damage brain cell mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes can happen at any age. And can start at age 10 or

<!-- chunk -->

### earlier (in the case of autism).

<!-- chunk -->

### So l-carnosine supplementation can help for age-related cognitive decline,

<!-- chunk -->

### as well as anyone who wants to boost cognition, learning, recall and


<!-- chunk -->

## L-Carnosine benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### There is a proven high correlation between human lifespan and l-

<!-- chunk -->

### carnosine levels. L-carnosine is highly concentrated in your muscles and

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. And is directly involved in a number of life-extending activities.

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Carnosine helps prevent the buildup of advanced glycation end

<!-- chunk -->

## products (AGEs) that damage mitochondria. And eventually end in

<!-- chunk -->

### premature cell death.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is a heavy metal chelator and works by removing heavy metal

<!-- chunk -->

### accumulation in brain cells. L-carnosine is an anti-oxidant and pH buffer

<!-- chunk -->

### in muscle cells preventing lactic acid buildup.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does L-Carnosine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### When you supplement with l-carnosine you’ll notice younger looking skin.

<!-- chunk -->

### And you’ll have more energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should experience a boost in cognition and decision-making

<!-- chunk -->

### capability. Thinking could be more fluid and your motivation may see a

<!-- chunk -->

### boost.

<!-- chunk -->

### These changes are reported by neurohackers in their 20’s and 30’s as well

<!-- chunk -->

### as the more senior user.

<!-- chunk -->

### But most of the talk and research on l-carnosine is on its anti-aging and

<!-- chunk -->

### longevity benefits. So what if I told you, it also helps fight the flu?

<!-- chunk -->

### It turns out that the influenza virus raises nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen

<!-- chunk -->

### free radicals such as superoxide anion (O


<!-- chunk -->

### -). When NO and O


<!-- chunk -->

### - interact,

<!-- chunk -->

### they form peroxynitrite, the pathogen that causes pneumonia.

<!-- chunk -->

### The excess amount of toxicity and oxygen radicals generated overwhelms

<!-- chunk -->

### your immune system. A study in the American Journal of Therapeutics

<!-- chunk -->

### reports that l-carnitine can put a stop to this overwhelm. And help you

<!-- chunk -->

### avoid or get rid of the flu or cold.

<!-- chunk -->

### And eating chicken soup to make you feel better when your sick is not an

<!-- chunk -->

### ‘old wife’s tale’ after all. Chicken soup is rich in l-carnosine.394


<!-- chunk -->

## L-Carnosine improves cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### Animal and human studies suggest NMDA antagonists worsen executive

<!-- chunk -->

### function. This dysfunction is often caused by glutamate toxicity. And if

<!-- chunk -->

### this persists, you end up with diseases like schizophrenia.

<!-- chunk -->

### This double-blind, placebo-controlled study worked with 75 adults with

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia. They were stable in their symptoms at the time of the study.

<!-- chunk -->

### Subjects were randomly selected to receive 2 grams of l-carnosine per day

<!-- chunk -->

### for 3 months.

<!-- chunk -->

### Executive dysfunction, memory, attention and motor speed were assessed

<!-- chunk -->

### at the beginning, and at 4 and 12 weeks. The l-carnosine group performed

<!-- chunk -->

### much better in executive function tests. And were better at strategy with

<!-- chunk -->

### fewer errors than the placebo group.395

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Carnosine improves autism symptoms in children

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnosine enhances frontal lobe function in your brain. And acts as a

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroprotectant. It also works with GABA for an anticonvulsive effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### This double-blind study worked with 31 children with autism for 8 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### They were given 800 mg of l-carnosine per day. The scientists then used

<!-- chunk -->

### several autism rating scales to measure results.

<!-- chunk -->

### After 8 weeks of l-carnosine use, the children showed significant

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement in behavior, sociability, communication and vocabulary. The

<!-- chunk -->

## researchers concluded that l-carnosine enhanced neurologic function.396

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Carnosine is anti-aging

<!-- chunk -->

### In 1965, Dr. Leonard Hayflick found that human cells have a limited

<!-- chunk -->

### capacity to divide. After which they become ‘senescent’. This is now

<!-- chunk -->

## known as the “Hayflick Limit”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hayflick discovered that your cells go through 3 phases. First is rapid cell

<!-- chunk -->

### division called ‘mitosis’. The 2nd is where mitosis slows. And the 3rd stage

<!-- chunk -->

### is ‘senescence’ where the cell stops dividing entirely. They remain alive

<!-- chunk -->

### for a while and then do a particularly disturbing thing. They commit

<!-- chunk -->

### suicide. This programmed cell death is called ‘apoptosis’.

<!-- chunk -->

### This cell life cycle occurs throughout your body and its trillions of cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Including in your brain. But what if there was some way to slow down this

<!-- chunk -->

### programmed cell death?

<!-- chunk -->

### Turns out there is. And it’s called L-Carnosine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at Sydney Laboratory in Australia found that l-carnosine

<!-- chunk -->

### extended cell life. They put cultured aged human cells in a petri dish with

<!-- chunk -->

### carnosine. The cells reverted back to juvenile cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### When they put those same newly rejuvenated cells in a culture that had no

<!-- chunk -->

### carnosine, they reverted back to their old self again. Put them back in

<!-- chunk -->

### carnosine and they got young again.397

<!-- chunk -->

### This experiment has been done again and again in labs around the world.

<!-- chunk -->

### Establishing l-carnosine as the best anti-aging thing since Ponce de Leon

<!-- chunk -->

### was searching for the Fountain of Youth right here in Florida (where I’m

<!-- chunk -->

### writing this chapter).

<!-- chunk -->

### David Guetta thinks that Miami is “the sexiest city in the world”. Could be

<!-- chunk -->

### that everybody in Miami is using l-carnosine.


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended L-Carnosine dosage in 1,000 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### To keep a consistent level of l-carnosine in your body, split your dose into

<!-- chunk -->

### two 500 mg doses. One in the morning and one later in the afternoon.

<!-- chunk -->

### One important note on l-carnosine. When you supplement with l-carnosine

<!-- chunk -->

### it binds to aldehydes. Preventing them from making proteins. The

<!-- chunk -->

### byproduct is lipofuscin. This age pigment is not dangerous. But shows up

<!-- chunk -->

### as brown spots on your brain, skin and other organs.

<!-- chunk -->

### As lipofuscin builds up over time, and this process is accelerated when

<!-- chunk -->

### using l-carnosine, it can interfere with proper organ and cellular functions.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is why we recommend stacking l-carnosine with DMAE and acetyl-L-

<!-- chunk -->

### carnitine (ALCAR). DMAE is a naturally occurring nutrient that boosts

<!-- chunk -->

### available choline. And ALCAR boosts mitochondrial energy production

<!-- chunk -->

### while acting as a neuroprotectant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Both DMAE and ALCAR help flush lipofuscin from your brain and body.

<!-- chunk -->

### So stack your daily dose of 1,000 mg of l-carnosine with DMAE and

<!-- chunk -->

### ALCAR at their recommended doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnosine is water-soluble, so you don’t need to take it with a meal, or

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy fat like some nootropics.


<!-- chunk -->

### Carnosine is considered extremely non-toxic and safe. High doses can

<!-- chunk -->

### cause insomnia. And l-carnosine can cause a stimulant effect. So take your

<!-- chunk -->

### 2nd dose before evening.


<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnosine comes in powder, capsule, tablet, and liquid form.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most major supplement manufacturers offer 500 mg tablets or capsules.

<!-- chunk -->

### But make sure you read the labels and get l-carnosine from a trusted

<!-- chunk -->

### manufacturer who tests their raw ingredients coming into their plant. Tests

<!-- chunk -->

### during encapsulation and then uses 3rd party testing before shipping their

<!-- chunk -->

### product.

<!-- chunk -->

### And choose a L-Carnosine supplement that is pure and free of toxic “other

<!-- chunk -->

### ingredients”. Avoid magnesium stearate and silicon dioxide in your


<!-- chunk -->

## L-Carnosine 1,000 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using L-Carnosine as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does make some L-Carnosine on its own from the amino acids

<!-- chunk -->

### beta-alanine and histidine. And you can get small quantities from red

<!-- chunk -->

### meat and poultry. But it’s easily and quickly broken down by the enzyme

<!-- chunk -->

### carnosine synthetase.

<!-- chunk -->

### So to get its benefits, and enough to overwhelm the carnosine synthetase

<!-- chunk -->

### enzyme, you must take it as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnosine is especially helpful for repairing brain cells at the

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial level. It removes heavy metals, works as a very powerful

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant, and gets rid of AGEs.

<!-- chunk -->

## Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) kill brain cells. Foods that are

<!-- chunk -->

### high in AGEs include roasted, fried, sautéed, and barbecued meats, nuts

<!-- chunk -->

### and tofu. Those fries you had for lunch. Brain cell death.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your natural production of l-carnosine starts to drop at age 10. So anyone

<!-- chunk -->

### will benefit from supplementing with this anti-aging nutrient.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnosine helps control blood glucose levels, prevent Alzheimer’s,

<!-- chunk -->

### wound healing, protects from the side effects of chemo therapy, alcohol-

<!-- chunk -->

### induced liver damage, combatting heart disease, and eye health by

<!-- chunk -->

### protecting or repairing cataracts.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Carnosine is also particularly useful if you’re dealing with autism or

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s. For autism, dose up to 800 mg per day. For Alzheimer’s,

<!-- chunk -->

### dose at least 1,000 mg per day.


# L-DOPA

<!-- chunk -->

### L-DOPA (Mucuna Pruriens) is known for improving brain health, is an

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant and heavy metal chelator, improves memory & cognition,

<!-- chunk -->

### lowers symptoms of depression, and boosts libido

<!-- chunk -->

## L-DOPA (levodopa, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) is an amino acid

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesized in your brain by the amino acid l-tyrosine.

<!-- chunk -->

## L-DOPA is a necessary precursor to the neurotransmitter dopamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Called a catecholamine, dopamine is then synthesized into the other

<!-- chunk -->

## catecholamines epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine

<!-- chunk -->

### (noradrenaline).

<!-- chunk -->

## And for a dopamine boost, neurohackers use Mucuna Pruriens, which

<!-- chunk -->

### contains high levels of L-DOPA.398 This legume, native to the tropical

<!-- chunk -->

## regions of India, Africa, and the West Indies, and also known as velvet

<!-- chunk -->

## bean, has been used in Ayurveda medicine since 1500 B.C.

<!-- chunk -->

### The ancients used Mucuna Pruriens to treat things like snakebite,

<!-- chunk -->

### intestinal problems, sexual issues, and a melancholy mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Raising levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine in your brain helps

<!-- chunk -->

### regulate mood and cognition.399

<!-- chunk -->

### Dopamine and norepinephrine are essential for memory, cognition, and a

<!-- chunk -->

### positive mood. A lack of either of these neurotransmitters can lead to a

<!-- chunk -->

### lower mood state, loss of memory, brain fog, poor energy, and more. And

<!-- chunk -->

### if left unchecked will eventually result in neurodegenerative diseases like


<!-- chunk -->

## Mucuna Pruriens vs. L-DOPA: What’s the Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

## Mucuna Pruriens is an extract of the velvet bean plant that grows 3 –

<!-- chunk -->

## meters in height. L-DOPA (levodopa) is generally synthetic and made in

<!-- chunk -->

### the lab.

<!-- chunk -->

### The natural version of L-DOPA from Mucuna Pruriens is generally well-

<!-- chunk -->

### tolerated by most people. And the compounds in the plant are bio-identical

<!-- chunk -->

### to those chemicals naturally made in your body. Not so with synthetic L-

<!-- chunk -->

### DOPA.

<!-- chunk -->

### Synthetic L-DOPA is metabolized into dopamine in your body by an

<!-- chunk -->

### enzyme called aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). And the

<!-- chunk -->

### majority of synthetic L-DOPA will be converted peripherally (not in the

<!-- chunk -->

### central nervous system and brain). This can cause problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### So when used therapeutically, as in treating Parkinson’s Disease, L-DOPA

<!-- chunk -->

### is administered in combination with an inhibitor of peripheral AADC.

<!-- chunk -->

## Drugs like carbidopa (or other AACD inhibitors) ensure most of the L-

<!-- chunk -->

### DOPA is preserved for conversion to dopamine in the brain. And not the

<!-- chunk -->

### rest of your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is critical for nootropic users to keep in mind. Chronic, or prolonged

<!-- chunk -->

### use of synthetic L-DOPA can lead to things like dyskinesia. This is a

<!-- chunk -->

### movement disorder where neurological discoordination results in

<!-- chunk -->

### uncontrollable, involuntary movements.400

<!-- chunk -->

### We’re not telling you this to dissuade you from using L-DOPA. Stick with

<!-- chunk -->

### an extract of Mucuna Pruriens and you should be fine.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does L-DOPA Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### L-DOPA boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.L-DOPA improves memory. It’s metabolized into dopamine in

<!-- chunk -->

### your body by an enzyme called aromatic L-amino acid

<!-- chunk -->

### decarboxylase (AADC). This increases dopamine levels in your


<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at the University of Münster in Germany conducted a study

<!-- chunk -->

### with 40 healthy people. In this randomized double-blind study, they gave

<!-- chunk -->

### one group 100 mg of levodopa daily for 5 days. The other group took a

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### 90 minutes later on each day, subjects were given a memory test based on

<!-- chunk -->

### vocabulary. The study found that levodopa significantly enhanced the

<!-- chunk -->

### speed, overall success, and long-term retention of novel words.401

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.L-DOPA promotes brain health. Research suggests Mucuna

<!-- chunk -->

### Pruriens protects your brain by regulating cognitive and neural

<!-- chunk -->

### functions. And even encouraging neural activity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in India showed that Mucuna Pruriens is a potent antioxidant.

<!-- chunk -->

### They performed assays to evaluate the enzymatic and nonenzymatic

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidants in extracts. They found high levels of flavonoids, alkaloids,

<!-- chunk -->

### tannic acids, gallic acids, quercetin equivalents, and sitosterol

<!-- chunk -->

### equivalents.402

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these compounds scavenge for free radicals in your brain. Free

<!-- chunk -->

### radicals are formed during normal brain activity, like the synthesis of ATP

<!-- chunk -->

### within your mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain is equipped to eliminate some of these free radicals on its own.

<!-- chunk -->

### But especially in today’s environment in which we live, your brain is

<!-- chunk -->

### overwhelmed. Free radicals cause inflammation which damage and can

<!-- chunk -->

### kill brain cells. Affecting memory, learning, recall, cognition and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mucuna Pruriens has been proven to be a very effective brain

<!-- chunk -->

## inflammation fighter. It even has the ability to chelate heavy metals like

<!-- chunk -->

### mercury and lead in brain cells. And it’s antibacterial.403

<!-- chunk -->

### Mucuna Pruriens helps your brain make naturally occurring neuronal

<!-- chunk -->

### pigments called neuromelanins. They’re similar to the melanin found in

<!-- chunk -->

### your skin. And they’re often found in regions of your brain where

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine is active.

<!-- chunk -->

### The synthesis of neuromelanins in the various regions of your brain is an

<!-- chunk -->

### important protective process. The melanic component is generated through

<!-- chunk -->

### the removal of reactive/toxic quinones that would otherwise cause

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotoxicity.

<!-- chunk -->

### This melanic component promoted by Mucuna Pruriens is what chelates

<!-- chunk -->

### and accumulates toxic, heavy metals like mercury and lead.404


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Dopaminergic neurons are damaged or die

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Dopamine levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Stress levels increase

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Long-term memory and mood decline


<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases of aging, including Parkinson’s Disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## L-DOPA benefits

<!-- chunk -->

## Mucuna Pruriens extract contains high levels of L-DOPA, the precursor to

<!-- chunk -->

## the crucial neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is further synthesized

<!-- chunk -->

## into the neurotransmitters epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine

<!-- chunk -->

### (noradrenaline).

<!-- chunk -->

### Dopamine plays a critical role in learning and absorbing new information.

<!-- chunk -->

### Increasing brain levels of dopamine helps regulate mood and boost


<!-- chunk -->

### Research also suggests that Mucuna Pruriens provides antioxidants that

<!-- chunk -->

### defend against oxidative damage caused by free radicals.405

<!-- chunk -->

## How does L-DOPA feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report that using Mucuna Pruriens helps in multi-tasking,

<!-- chunk -->

### improving motivation, more focus, less stress, and a sense of calm.

<!-- chunk -->

### You could find your energy levels increase, less brain fog, and a boost in

<!-- chunk -->

### overall mood. A more positive outlook on life. And an increase in libido.


<!-- chunk -->

## Mucuna Pruriens helps reduce stress

<!-- chunk -->

### A study was conducted to assess the role of Mucuna Pruriens in infertile

<!-- chunk -->

### men. It was done at King George’s Medical University in Lucknow, India.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study included 60 men who were undergoing infertility screening. And

<!-- chunk -->

### no surprise here; were found to be suffering from stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### The control group in this study were 60 age-matched men who had

<!-- chunk -->

### initiated at least one pregnancy. The infertile men were given 5 grams of

<!-- chunk -->

### Mucuna Pruriens seed powder per day for 3 months. Semen samples were

<!-- chunk -->

### collected at the beginning of the study. And after 3 months of treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found that treatment with Mucuna Pruriens significantly

<!-- chunk -->

### decreased stress levels. And increased sperm count to the same level as the

<!-- chunk -->

### fertile control group of men.

<!-- chunk -->

### They “concluded that M. pruriens not only reactivates the anti-oxidant

<!-- chunk -->

### defense system of infertile men but it also helps in the management of

<!-- chunk -->

### stress and improves semen quality.”406

<!-- chunk -->

## L-DOPA improves learning

<!-- chunk -->

### This study in Germany was done with 40 healthy subjects. They were

<!-- chunk -->

### given 100 mg of L-DOPA or a placebo for 5 days in a randomized, double-

<!-- chunk -->

### blind trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### Subjects were trained on artificial vocabulary using a high-frequency,

<!-- chunk -->

### repetitive approach. This was done 90 minutes after L-DOPA

<!-- chunk -->

### administration on each day of the trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found that L-DOPA significantly enhanced the speed,

<!-- chunk -->

### overall success, and long-term retention of the words.407

<!-- chunk -->

## L-DOPA as an antidepressant

<!-- chunk -->

### Increasing dopamine in your brain also boosts your mood and libido. This

<!-- chunk -->

### study was done in India with mice. Researchers used the well-known

<!-- chunk -->

### Forced Swimming Test (FST), Tail Suspension Test (TST), and Chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS) test.

<!-- chunk -->

### The mice were fed Mucuna Pruriens seed extract, and then evaluated while

<!-- chunk -->

### performing, well… what mice do in the lab. The research team found that

<!-- chunk -->

### Mucuna Pruriens seed extract has significant antidepressant qualities.

<!-- chunk -->

### Which would simply verify what we already know in humans.408

<!-- chunk -->

### Using Mucuna Pruriens extract is a great anti-depressant.


<!-- chunk -->

### L-DOPA (Mucuna Pruriens 98% extract) suggested dosage for cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits is 250 – 500 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend that you cycle the use of L-DOPA (Mucuna Pruriens). And

<!-- chunk -->

### use it only 4 or 5 days a week. This will help avoid tolerances and

<!-- chunk -->

### dependencies (which are common with any dopamine agonist).


<!-- chunk -->

### L-DOPA is produced naturally in your body. So is considered well-

<!-- chunk -->

### tolerated and safe. And L-DOPA from Mucuna Pruriens extract is

<!-- chunk -->

### particularly well tolerated by most people.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows that the natural form of L-DOPA from Mucuna Pruriens

<!-- chunk -->

### compared to synthetic versions of L-DOPA provides similar results. But

<!-- chunk -->

### without the common side effects of nausea, vomiting, and involuntary

<!-- chunk -->

### muscle movement.409

<!-- chunk -->

## But be very careful when working with dopamine. Too much and you can

<!-- chunk -->

### experience symptoms like hair loss, auditory or visual hallucinations,

<!-- chunk -->

### psychosis, Dyskinesia and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### Of course, if you begin to experience any of these side effects, stop

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with L-DOPA (Mucuna Pruriens) immediately.

<!-- chunk -->

### Like any natural supplement, it’s always better to find an organic source.


<!-- chunk -->

## Mucuna Pruriens is typically available in powder, capsule, or tablet form.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some are pure, dried Mucuna Pruriens powder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Several manufacturers offer Mucuna Pruriens extracts ranging from 15% -

<!-- chunk -->

### 98% L-DOPA. Or they tell you how many mg of L-DOPA is in each

<!-- chunk -->

### capsule or tablet.

<!-- chunk -->

### A few manufacturers call it “Velvet Bean Extract” with the percentage of

<!-- chunk -->

### L-DOPA in each capsule or tablet. It’s the same as Mucuna Pruriens.

<!-- chunk -->

### Try to find “organic” or “certified organic” if you can. And for Nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### use, avoid synthetic L-DOPA which is typically used to treat Parkinson’s


<!-- chunk -->

## L-DOPA (Mucuna Pruriens) 250 - 500 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using L-DOPA as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does synthesize some L-DOPA on its own. And converts it into

<!-- chunk -->

### the essential neurotransmitters dopamine, epinephrine, and

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine.

<!-- chunk -->

### But as you get older, dopamine receptors die. Or your body doesn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### convert the necessary amino acids well enough to supply the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters you need for an optimized brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-DOPA is helpful to boost energy levels, clear brain fog, improve mood

<!-- chunk -->

### and libido.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-DOPA is especially helpful for those suffering from neurodegenerative

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases like Parkinson’s. And the natural form of L-DOPA from Mucuna

<!-- chunk -->

### Pruriens often offers better results with fewer side effects than

<!-- chunk -->

### prescription drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest starting with a dose of 100 - 250 mg daily for nootropic use. You

<!-- chunk -->

### may want to cycle L-DOPA. Use it for 4 or 5 days and take a break unless

<!-- chunk -->

### you are treating something specific like Parkinson’s. Tolerance can be a

<!-- chunk -->

### problem when working with dopamine. As is dependence or addiction.


# Lemon Balm

<!-- chunk -->

### Lemon Balm is known for its anti-anxiety and calming effects, improving

<!-- chunk -->

### focus, memory and cognition, and reducing irritability and depression

<!-- chunk -->

## Lemon Balm (Melissa officinalis) is an herb that’s native the

<!-- chunk -->

### Mediterranean region. And now found in gardens throughout Europe and

<!-- chunk -->

### North America.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lemon balm has a long history as a treatment for stress, anxiety, thyroid

<!-- chunk -->

### issues, indigestion, infections, viruses, and inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Related to the mint family of herbs, lemon balm has a subtle lemon scent.

<!-- chunk -->

### And its small white flowers attract bees. Hence the botanical name

<!-- chunk -->

### ‘Melissa’, which is Greek for honey bee.

<!-- chunk -->

### The first recorded medical use of lemon balm dates back to Dioscorides,

<!-- chunk -->

### the ancient Greek physician, who used the herb for its anti-bacterial and

<!-- chunk -->

### soothing properties. The famous Swiss Renaissance physician, Paracelsus,

<!-- chunk -->

### called it the “elixir of life”.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the 16th century, English botanist John Gerard, gave it to his students to

<!-- chunk -->

### “quicken the senses”. This appears to be the first recorded use of the herb

<!-- chunk -->

### for brain and cognitive health.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most recent research shows lemon balm has remarkable healing and

<!-- chunk -->

### regenerative effects on your brain. It stimulates memory, and supports the

<!-- chunk -->

### health of your brain’s white matter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lemon balm’s two primary compounds that affect brain health are eugenol

<!-- chunk -->

### and rosmarinic acid.410

<!-- chunk -->

## Eugenol is an antioxidant 5-times more potent than alpha-tocopherol

<!-- chunk -->

### found in Vitamin E. So lemon balm acts to boost your body’s natural

<!-- chunk -->

### healing processes by eliminating free radicals that damage brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### And lemon balm helps increase levels of your body’s most powerful built-

<!-- chunk -->

### in antioxidants, dismutase and glutathione peroxidase.411

<!-- chunk -->

## Rosmarinic acid promotes an anti-depressant effect in your brain by

<!-- chunk -->

### downregulating mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (Mkp-1).

<!-- chunk -->

### And it upregulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), along with

<!-- chunk -->

### boosting dopamine synthesis.412

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Lemon Balm work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## Lemon Balm boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Lemon Balm boosts memory. Lemon balm increases the activity of

<!-- chunk -->

## the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in your brain. When your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain sends signals, it uses acetylcholine to keep the signals moving.

<!-- chunk -->

### But once used, your brain removes acetylcholine with an enzyme

<!-- chunk -->

### called acetylcholinesterase (AChE).413

<!-- chunk -->

### But if you have too much AChE, as is the case with Alzheimer’s patients,

<!-- chunk -->

### it restricts brain signaling. One way to prevent this signal failure is to

<!-- chunk -->

### prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

## The compound rosmarinic acid in lemon balm encourages blood flow,

<!-- chunk -->

### which helps to keep brain cells from dying.414 And it inhibits the formation

<!-- chunk -->

### of AChE.

<!-- chunk -->

### The result is that your brain is stimulated, memories continue to form, and

<!-- chunk -->

### brain fog is eliminated.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Lemon Balm reduces stress. One-way lemon balm does this is to

<!-- chunk -->

## promote GABA, a glutamate inhibitor in your brain. Glutamate

<!-- chunk -->

### excites brain cells to act. While this excitation is necessary, too

<!-- chunk -->

### much glutamate results in cell death.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lemon balm promotes a better balance in glutamate levels and helps new

<!-- chunk -->

### cell growth.415 The result is a boost in memory and reduction in stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Largely due to eugenol, one of the components of lemon balm.


<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic stress, anxiety, poor blood flow and free radicals (oxidation) can

<!-- chunk -->

### damage your brain. And one of the ways this manifests is memory loss.

<!-- chunk -->

### It comes as no surprise that people with memory loss experience higher

<!-- chunk -->

### rates of anxiety and depression. As verified in one Australian research

<!-- chunk -->

### study.416


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Toxins kill brain cells from the inside


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Acetylcholine (ACh) levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) declines

<!-- chunk -->

### Under conditions of chronic stress your brain loses the capacity to

<!-- chunk -->

### transmit signals between neurons efficiently. Memory, cognition, and

<!-- chunk -->

### decision-making all suffer as a result.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lemon Balm benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Lemon Balm undoes damage to the brain caused by chronic stress and

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidative damage. It boosts GABA levels and keeps toxic glutamate

<!-- chunk -->

### overload in check.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lemon balm inhibits the enzyme AChE that breaks down acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### (ACh) levels in your brain. Boosting ACh improves memory, recall and


<!-- chunk -->

## Rosmarinic acid in lemon balm works as an antidepressant. And boosts

<!-- chunk -->

## brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which promotes the growth,

<!-- chunk -->

### maturation and maintenance of brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

## And the eugenol in lemon balm is a very powerful antioxidant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eliminating oxidative damage in brain cells by neutralizing free radicals.

<!-- chunk -->

### And boosting your brain’s own antioxidants to provide even more

<!-- chunk -->

### protection.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Lemon Balm feel?

<!-- chunk -->

## The effects of supplementing with Lemon Balm (Melissa officinalis) can

<!-- chunk -->

### provide an anti-anxiety effect within minutes of taking it. Some users say

<!-- chunk -->

### it works as well as popping a Xanax.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should experience an increase in focus along with a sense of calm.

<!-- chunk -->

### And even though lemon balm works well as a sleep aid, taking it during

<!-- chunk -->

### the day shouldn’t make you drowsy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Users report lemon balm effective in taming racing thoughts that come

<!-- chunk -->

### with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Some even use lemon balm

<!-- chunk -->

### as an effective way to control irritable bowel syndrome.


<!-- chunk -->

### Research continues in medicinal plants and herbs that have been used for

<!-- chunk -->

### millennia to treat cognition and memory problems. One study conducted

<!-- chunk -->

### at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in the UK, found Melissa

<!-- chunk -->

### officinalis to be one of the strongest in its effects on acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors. And being an effective aid for memory.417

<!-- chunk -->

## Lemon Balm as a Nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### Lemon Balm has been shown to improve problem-solving and memory in

<!-- chunk -->

### both human and animal models. And age seems to make no difference. All

<!-- chunk -->

### groups using lemon balm showed better recall and problem-solving.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some recent studies with Alzheimer’s patients have shown improvement

<!-- chunk -->

### when using lemon balm. In one study done in China, researchers gave

<!-- chunk -->

### Sprague Dawley rats eugenol.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the active compounds found in lemon balm, eugenol is a potent

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant. In this case it helped test subjects get their memory back.418

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study noted that lemon balm inhibits acetylcholinesterase

<!-- chunk -->

### (AChE). This enzyme breaks down the critical neurotransmitter

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine (ACh). ACh is crucial to creating memories and cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lemon balm was shown to boost and support mood and memory.419

<!-- chunk -->

## Lemon Balm for Stress Reduction

<!-- chunk -->

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment was conducted in the UK

<!-- chunk -->

### with 18 healthy volunteers. The subjects received two separate single

<!-- chunk -->

### doses of standardized lemon balm extract (300 mg and 600 mg), or a

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo, on separate days. Followed by a 7-day washout period.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mood was assessed before dosing, and 1-hour after dosing with lemon

<!-- chunk -->

### balm extract. The study subjects did a 20-minute version of the Defined

<!-- chunk -->

### Intensity Stressor Simulation (DISS) battery of tests.

<!-- chunk -->

### The results showed that a 600 mg dose of lemon balm eliminated the

<!-- chunk -->

### negative mood effects of doing the DISS tests. They reported an increase

<!-- chunk -->

### in calmness and reduced alertness.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers also reported a significant increase in mathematical

<!-- chunk -->

### processing, with no reduction in accuracy. This was after taking the lower

<!-- chunk -->

### 300 mg dose.

<!-- chunk -->

### The nootropic benefits of lemon balm, according to this test, was a boost

<!-- chunk -->

### in cognition, and had a calming effect.420


<!-- chunk -->

### Lemon balm has a long history of use in treating a host of ailments.

<!-- chunk -->

### Including memory and cognition, gas, bloating, earache, vomiting,

<!-- chunk -->

### headache, toothache and insomnia.

<!-- chunk -->

## For nootropic use, Melissa officinalis (lemon balm) comes in tea and

<!-- chunk -->

### capsule form. For the most potent dosage, find lemon balm extract in

<!-- chunk -->

### capsules.

<!-- chunk -->

### The suggested dose by most naturopaths and alternative health doctors is

<!-- chunk -->

### 300 mg of lemon balm extract 2-3 times per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dosage of lemon balm leaf as a tea is 1 – 2 grams per cup of tea.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can use lemon balm in the morning to address daytime anxiety. And

<!-- chunk -->

### towards evening to support relaxation and sleep.


<!-- chunk -->

### Lemon balm is considered non-toxic and very safe for most users. Most

<!-- chunk -->

### neurohackers won’t experience any side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Note: Lemon balm may have an “antithyrotropic effect”. So if you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### hypothyroid, and on thyroid medication, you may want to avoid using

<!-- chunk -->

### lemon balm.

<!-- chunk -->

### And use caution when combining lemon balm with; anti-anxiety meds,

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-histamines, muscle relaxers, anti-seizure drugs or tranquilizers.


<!-- chunk -->

### For nootropic use, lemon balm supplements are available as loose-leaf tea,

<!-- chunk -->

### tinctures, and capsules. Most neurohackers use lemon balm capsules

<!-- chunk -->

### which come as ground leaves, or an extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### The lowest active dose is 300 mg of standard lemon balm. Supplementing

<!-- chunk -->

### above this dose seems to offer dose-dependent benefits. In other words,

<!-- chunk -->

### you’ll get more benefit by taking higher doses. (i.e. 300 mg lemon balm 2-

<!-- chunk -->

### times per day).


<!-- chunk -->

## Lemon Balm extract 300 - 600 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Lemon Balm as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Lemon Balm on its own. So you must take it as a


<!-- chunk -->

### Lemon Balm is especially helpful for those suffering from anxiety and

<!-- chunk -->

### stress. Studies show it helps stop and reverse the devastating effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety and stress on your brain, and body. This nootropic helps repair

<!-- chunk -->

### damage to brain cells caused by chronic stress and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lemon balm is reported to work well for those dealing with Obsessive

<!-- chunk -->

### Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Taming racing thoughts, and helpful in

<!-- chunk -->

### dealing with stressful situations.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lemon balm is also helpful for those suffering from Alzheimer’s. It has

<!-- chunk -->

### been shown to help reduce agitation and improve symptoms of mild to

<!-- chunk -->

### moderate Alzheimer’s disease. It may also be of benefit in relieving some

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely take up to 900 mg of Lemon Balm (Melissa officinalis)

<!-- chunk -->

### extract daily if needed. One dose first thing in the morning. One dose early

<!-- chunk -->

### afternoon. And the last dose in the evening.

<!-- chunk -->

### And for memory, lemon balm is great to stack with CDP Choline and

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetyl L-carnitine.


# L-Glutamine

<!-- chunk -->

### L-glutamine can help improve alertness, concentration, focus, memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### mood, boost Human Growth Hormone and reduce anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

## L-glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid and main precursor

<!-- chunk -->

### for the production of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA (γ-

<!-- chunk -->

### aminobutyric acid) in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-glutamine supplementation is mostly talked about in athletic and body

<!-- chunk -->

### building circles for its effect on human growth hormone and muscle

<!-- chunk -->

### recovery after a workout. But L-glutamine is largely ignored by the

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics community.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-glutamine is so critically important to the optimized brain that by

<!-- chunk -->

### reading this chapter, you’ll understand why it may be an important

<!-- chunk -->

### addition to your nootropic stack.

<!-- chunk -->

### As an ‘excitatory’ neurotransmitter, glutamate is released from pre-

<!-- chunk -->

### synaptic cells and then binds to post-synaptic cells inducing activation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Too much glutamate and neurons become overactive causing a toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### environment that is harmful to neurons. And to cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### To keep this process in check, glutamate is also a precursor to the

<!-- chunk -->

## ‘inhibitory’ neurotransmitter GABA. GABA works by preventing neural

<!-- chunk -->

### signaling in over-excited neurons caused by glutamate that could result in

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety and depression.421

<!-- chunk -->

### The balance of glutamine and glutamate has been identified in an array of

<!-- chunk -->

### brain conditions (i.e. mental illness, tumor, neurodegeneration) as well as

<!-- chunk -->

### in normal brain function.422

<!-- chunk -->

### The precursor relationship between glutamine and glutamate/GABA is

<!-- chunk -->

## often referred to in scientific and research circles as the Gln/Gly(GABA)

<!-- chunk -->

## cycle.423 Glutamine is naturally synthesized from glutamate and ammonia

<!-- chunk -->

### in brain cells called astrocytes in a reaction catalyzed by glutamine

<!-- chunk -->

### synthetase (GS).

<!-- chunk -->

### Newly synthesized glutamine is transferred to neurons and hydrolyzed by

<!-- chunk -->

### phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG) to then produce glutamate. A

<!-- chunk -->

### portion of which may be decarboxylated to GABA or transaminated to

<!-- chunk -->

### Aspartate.

<!-- chunk -->

## Glutamate, the excitatory neurotransmitter, and GABA, the calming

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter rely on this cycle to maintain homeostasis within your

<!-- chunk -->

## brain. Glutamine also modulates the synthesis of Nitric Oxide by

<!-- chunk -->

## controlling the supply of its precursor arginine.

<!-- chunk -->

### When this cycle gets out of whack, things start to break down. The results

<!-- chunk -->

### can be particularly nasty. And result in conditions like epilepsy, or hepatic

<!-- chunk -->

### encephalopathy which effects behavior, mood, speech, sleep and the way

<!-- chunk -->

### you move.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-glutamine becomes a “conditionally” essential amino acid when your

<!-- chunk -->

### body can’t produce enough on its own. And you need to replenish L-

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamine levels either through supplementation or food.424

<!-- chunk -->

### L-glutamine can be found in foods such as beef, pork, fish, eggs, milk and

<!-- chunk -->

### dairy products, wheat, cabbage, beets, beans, spinach and parsley.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does L-glutamine work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### L-glutamine helps brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.L-glutamine is critical for an optimized brain. L-glutamine is a

<!-- chunk -->

### precursor to the neurotransmitter glutamate in your brain. The

<!-- chunk -->

### balance of glutamine and glutamate is crucial to an optimized and

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The normal cycling of glutamine and glutamate takes a huge amount of

<!-- chunk -->

## energy in the brain. Research has estimated that the Gln/Gly(GABA) cycle

<!-- chunk -->

### accounts for more than 80% of cerebral glucose consumption.425 So when

<!-- chunk -->

### you’re using nootropics like Resveratrol or PQQ to boost mental energy,

<!-- chunk -->

### much of that energy is going towards maintaining this Gln/Gly(GABA)

<!-- chunk -->

### cycle.

<!-- chunk -->

### A disruption of this cycle results in all kinds of problems including Reye’s

<!-- chunk -->

### Syndrome, epilepsy, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### and alcohol addiction.426

<!-- chunk -->

### One Korean study measured Glutamate and Glutamine concentrations in

<!-- chunk -->

### the prefrontal cortex of mice infused with an astrocyte toxin. And they

<!-- chunk -->

## used other inhibitors to disrupt the Glu/Gln cycle.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glutamate and glutamine levels decreased on the 5th day in the mice. The

<!-- chunk -->

### animals experienced immobility and a decreased preference for sucrose

<!-- chunk -->

### (sugar). A sure indication in mice of depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Direct infusion of L-glutamine completely reversed all the impairments

<!-- chunk -->

### that were originally induced in the animals. And the researchers concluded

<!-- chunk -->

## that neuronal deficiency of L-glutamine causes depression.427

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.L-glutamine also helps prevent brain aging. Researchers have

<!-- chunk -->

### long been on the hunt to determine what causes the human brain to

<!-- chunk -->

### age. Recently, mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the

<!-- chunk -->

### loss of brain function in neurodegenerative diseases and aging.428

<!-- chunk -->

### Leading to an abnormal increase in the excitatory neurotransmitter


<!-- chunk -->

### A study at the New York University School of Medicine used 28 patients

<!-- chunk -->

### with mild traumatic brain injury and 22 matched controls. Gray and white

<!-- chunk -->

### matter in their brains was measured using MRI’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study found that one year after traumatic brain injury there was

<!-- chunk -->

### significant global brain atrophy. Much larger than in the control subjects.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team noted the amount of brain damage from just one concussion.

<!-- chunk -->

### And that this type of injury was not exclusive to a severe blow to the head.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even mild injury could cause brain damage.429 Most of the damage was

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with a disrupted Glu/Gln cycle and an abnormal increase in

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamate levels.430


<!-- chunk -->

### Low levels of L-glutamine are associated with a variety of health

<!-- chunk -->

### problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Cellular energy drops and immune system weakens

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Short- and long-term memory declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Anxiety, insomnia and lack of concentration

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Muscle spasms, hypertension, convulsion, Tourette’s Syndrome and

<!-- chunk -->

### epilepsy

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Ammonia levels rise in brain cells431

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓Poor digestion, bloating, flatulence, and constipation

<!-- chunk -->

### When your neurotransmitters, including L-glutamine and glutamate are in

<!-- chunk -->

### balance, you feel motivated, productive, and energetic. And you feel calm

<!-- chunk -->

### and relaxed during downtime.

<!-- chunk -->

### When L-glutamine levels are low you feel filled with dread, you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### constantly worried, you have racing thoughts, and you’re frequently late

<!-- chunk -->

### and disorganized.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many people in this L-glutamine -slump resort to high carbohydrate foods,

<!-- chunk -->

### and drugs or alcohol to relax.

<!-- chunk -->

## L-glutamine benefits

<!-- chunk -->

## The amino acid L-glutamine is the precursor to L-glutamate production in

<!-- chunk -->

### your body. L-glutamate gets converted to GABA.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glutamate is your body’s most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Which is responsible for attention span, brain energy, learning ability,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, and staying awake.

<!-- chunk -->

## An enzyme called glutamate decarboxylase converts glutamate to GABA.

<!-- chunk -->

## It does it with the help of the active form of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (Pyridoxal-5-

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphate (P5P)).

<!-- chunk -->

## The amino acid taurine helps increase the communication and

<!-- chunk -->

## productivity of this enzyme. And zinc helps the release of GABA from its

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

## When this Gln/Gly(GABA) cycle works efficiently, you feel relaxed with

<!-- chunk -->

### no stress or feelings of anxiety. Detoxification of your liver results in a

<!-- chunk -->

### more restful night’s sleep. Focus, concentration, memory and mood all

<!-- chunk -->

### improve.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does L-glutamine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### During times of chronic, long-term stress caused by physical exertion or

<!-- chunk -->

### illness, glutamine levels in your body can drop by 50% or more.432

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with L-glutamine can improve your quality of life,

<!-- chunk -->

### increase energy levels, reduce muscle aches, improve digestion, and gut

<!-- chunk -->

### health, improve quality of sleep, and reduce pain and fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

### When you balance L-glutamine levels in your brain, you feel relaxed and

<!-- chunk -->

### calm. Cravings for sugar and alcohol will decline.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-glutamine will help in recovery from workouts and improve

<!-- chunk -->

### performance. You may find it easier to lose weight.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers use L-glutamine to help heal Leaky Gut Syndrome and

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce the symptoms of Crohn’s and Celiac Disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, L-glutamine can help improve alertness, concentration,

<!-- chunk -->

### focus, memory and mood.


<!-- chunk -->

### L-glutamine was identified as a neurotransmitter several decades ago. And

<!-- chunk -->

### there has been a lot of research on L-glutamine published since. But most

<!-- chunk -->

### of it is focused on strength training and maintaining muscle mass in

<!-- chunk -->

### athletes. And for people healing from surgery or recovering from illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### But L-glutamine can be a powerful nootropic as well. Here are a couple of

<!-- chunk -->

### studies looking at L-glutamine for brain health.

<!-- chunk -->

## L-glutamine Increases Human Growth Hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### Bodybuilders and athletes use supplementary L-glutamine to help repair

<!-- chunk -->

### and build muscle. And there are several studies supporting the notion that

<!-- chunk -->

## L-glutamine increases Human Growth Hormone.

<!-- chunk -->

### In one study, researchers worked with 9 healthy subjects and gave them

<!-- chunk -->

### grams of L-glutamine in a cola drink. Blood samples were taken before

<!-- chunk -->

### drinking the cola-spiked drink, then again at 30 mins., 60 and 90 mins.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found that both blood L-glutamine and human growth

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone levels were significantly higher than before taking L-glutamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team concluded that “a surprisingly small oral L-glutamine load was

<!-- chunk -->

### capable of elevating growth hormone”.433

<!-- chunk -->

## Human growth hormone and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)

<!-- chunk -->

## are intricately linked. BDNF is involved in Long-Term Potentiation and

<!-- chunk -->

### the encoding of long-term memories.

<!-- chunk -->

## L-glutamine Improves Cerebral Performance

<!-- chunk -->

### Lack of concentration and poor memory can be improved by

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with L-glutamine and Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (niacin). Some of the

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamine in your blood is transformed into glutamic acid in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glutamic acid functions first as fuel, but it also gets rid of excess

<!-- chunk -->

### ammonia by binding to this cellular toxin and converting it into glutamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study in the Netherlands conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled trial with 42 healthy men and woman aged 40 – 76 years.

<!-- chunk -->

### Subjects received a 5-gram stack containing glycine, L-glutamine and

<!-- chunk -->

### niacin twice daily for 3 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

## The L-glutamine stack increased Human Growth Hormone a whopping

<!-- chunk -->

### 70% compared to placebo. But surprisingly it wasn’t the growth hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### that improved memory and vigor. It was insulin-like growth factor-I that

<!-- chunk -->

### improved memory and vigor. Attributed to the L-Glutamine stack the

<!-- chunk -->

### subjects took for 3 weeks.434


<!-- chunk -->

### Most people don’t get enough L-glutamine from food alone. And why

<!-- chunk -->

### adding L-glutamine to your nootropic stack can boost your immune

<!-- chunk -->

### system, improve your ability to fight infection and diseases, and boost


<!-- chunk -->

### The recommended daily dosage of L-glutamine is 2 to 5 grams per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Serious power athletes often dose up to 10 grams of L-glutamine per day.


<!-- chunk -->

### L-glutamine is considered very safe when taken in normal recommended

<!-- chunk -->

### doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rarely do people report side effects like nausea, vomiting, flatulence,

<!-- chunk -->

### abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, hemorrhoids, dizziness,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, skin rashes, insomnia and increased sweating. Remember, the

<!-- chunk -->

### balance between L-glutamine and glutamate (Gln/Gly(GABA) cycle) is

<!-- chunk -->

### critical for optimal health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some recent research has shown that L-glutamine can stimulate tumor

<!-- chunk -->

### growth. So if you are dealing with any form of cancer you should not use

<!-- chunk -->

### L-glutamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are dealing with cirrhosis of the liver, you should avoid L-

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamine. If you have severe liver disease that includes difficulty

<!-- chunk -->

### thinking or confusion (hepatic encephalopathy), don’t use L-glutamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are allergic or sensitive to Monosodium glutamate (MSG), you may

<!-- chunk -->

### be sensitive to L-glutamine because your body converts it to glutamate.

<!-- chunk -->

### And if you have a severe mental disorder including mania or frequently

<!-- chunk -->

### have seizures you may want to avoid L-glutamine.


<!-- chunk -->

### L-glutamine as a supplement is available in tablets, capsules and powder.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most commonly available form of L-glutamine as a nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement is called “free form” glutamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Trans-Alanyl or Alanyl-L-glutamine is an amino acid attached to another

<!-- chunk -->

### amino acid which aids in digestion of this supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are using it to boost athletic performance and speed recovery, both

<!-- chunk -->

### forms of L-glutamine are best taken right before or after a workout. Using

<!-- chunk -->

### it with small meals before or after your workout session can help support

<!-- chunk -->

### your metabolism and weight loss goals. And will assist in muscle building,

<!-- chunk -->

### recovery and maintenance.


<!-- chunk -->

## L-glutamine 2 – 5 grams per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using L-glutamine as a nootropic supplement if you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### dealing with anxiety or stress. And to calm or keep in check some of the

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulatory effects of some nootropics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does make L-glutamine on its own from glutamate in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. But most people do not maintain an adequate supply of L-glutamine

<!-- chunk -->

### in their system.

<!-- chunk -->

### And if you’re dealing with illness, recovery from surgery, strenuous

<!-- chunk -->

### physical activity like working out, Leaky Gut Syndrome, Crohn’s, or

<!-- chunk -->

### Celiac Disease, and need some help in recovery, L-glutamine can help.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-glutamine also helps to curb the desire for sugar, carbs, and alcohol.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest first trying a L-glutamine supplement at a dose of 500 mg. And

<!-- chunk -->

### see how you react. You can safely dose up to 20 grams of L-glutamine per

<!-- chunk -->

### day. But most neurohackers find much lower doses effective for boosting

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition, mood and memory.


# Lion’s Mane

<!-- chunk -->

### Lion’s Mane Mushroom is known for stimulating Nerve Growth Factor,

<!-- chunk -->

### improving cognition and memory, and relieving depression

<!-- chunk -->

## Lion’s Mane (Hericium erinaceus) is a medicinal mushroom proven to

<!-- chunk -->

### benefit the brain, nerves, and immune system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unlike other mushrooms sporting a cap and stem, Lion’s Mane has long,

<!-- chunk -->

### flowing, white tendrils. Resembling a Lion’s Mane. Other names include

<!-- chunk -->

### Monkey’s Head, Bearded Tooth, Pom Pom Blanc, Hedgehog Mushroom and

<!-- chunk -->

### Satyr’s Beard.

<!-- chunk -->

### This parasitic fungus grows hanging off logs and trees. And is native to

<!-- chunk -->

### North American, Europe and Southeast Asia. In Japan, it’s called

<!-- chunk -->

### yamabushitake or “those who sleep in mountains”. Referring to the

<!-- chunk -->

### Shugendo sect of hermit monks and their long, flowing robes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Known for its powerful effects as a “brain tonic”, Lion’s Mane is said to

<!-- chunk -->

### have been used as a tea for thousands of years by Buddhist monks. To

<!-- chunk -->

### enhance brain power and heighten their ability to focus during meditation.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, Lion’s Mane has been shown to be particularly effective in

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulating Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### NGF is produced in the hippocampus throughout life. Modulating

<!-- chunk -->

### cholinergic receptors and neuroplasticity.435 And is essential for learning.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nerve Growth Factor are special proteins that function to regenerate

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons. Lion’s Mane contains two unique classes of NGF’s – hericenones

<!-- chunk -->

### and erinacines which easily cross the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lion’s Mane, like other medicinal mushrooms, contain high amounts of

<!-- chunk -->

### the antioxidant beta-glucoxylan and four other polysaccharides and

<!-- chunk -->

### polypeptides. Having a significant impact on enhancing your immune

<!-- chunk -->

### system. And decreasing tumor growth.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lion’s Mane has also been studied in reducing amyloid plaques. These

<!-- chunk -->

### clumps of beta-amyloid proteins block signals between neurons. And are

<!-- chunk -->

### implicated in Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lions’ Mane is also used to treat Lyme’s Disease, and digestive tract

<!-- chunk -->

### issues.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here we’re talking about Lion’s Mane Mushroom and its effects on brain

<!-- chunk -->

### health and chemistry.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Lion’s Mane Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Lion’s Mane boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Lion’s Mane Mushroom stimulates the synthesis of Nerve Growth

<!-- chunk -->

## Factor (NGF). NGF is a protein that plays a major role in the

<!-- chunk -->

### maintenance, survival, and regeneration of neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### NGF is required by your brain to keep neurons strong and healthy. When

<!-- chunk -->

### various neurological disorders occur, your brain is unable to produce its

<!-- chunk -->

### own internal source of NGF.

<!-- chunk -->

### In a study done in Kuala Lumpur in 2013, scientists showed that Lion’s

<!-- chunk -->

### Mane extract induced NGF synthesis and promoted neurite outgrowth.436

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Lion’s Mane is effective in reducing anxiety and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some even call it the “smart mushroom” for its ability to improve

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition, memory and work as an anti-depressant.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study by researchers in Japan worked with 30 women. The female

<!-- chunk -->

### subjects had been complaining about menopause, depression, sleep quality

<!-- chunk -->

### and other issues.

<!-- chunk -->

### The women randomly received Lion’s Mane-laced cookies or a placebo for

<!-- chunk -->

### 4 weeks. The researchers found that Lion’s Mane “has the possibility to

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce depression and anxiety, and these results suggest a different

<!-- chunk -->

### mechanism from NGF-enhancing action of H. erinaceus”.437


<!-- chunk -->

### Science once believed that the brain could not grow new brain cells. That

<!-- chunk -->

### once our brain developed during childhood, and we reached adulthood, we

<!-- chunk -->

### had all the brain cells we’d ever have.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now we know that neurons can regenerate. But that doesn’t mean they will

<!-- chunk -->

### regenerate. A number of health issues can contribute to neurodegeneration.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Decrease in Nerve Growth Factor = Decrease in Long-Term Potentiation

<!-- chunk -->

### affecting long-term memory438

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Brain cells die and are not replaced

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neuroplasticity declines resulting in poor memory

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neurotransmitters decline resulting in anxiety, poor mood and

<!-- chunk -->

### depression

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these age-related changes are contributing factors to

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and others. And

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, depression and mood disorders affect quality of life.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lion’s Mane benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### At least a dozen peer-reviewed studies have been published on Lion’s

<!-- chunk -->

### Mane benefits to brain health since 1991. Dr. Kawagishi of Japan was first

<!-- chunk -->

### to identify the Nerve Growth Factor properties of Lion’s Mane

<!-- chunk -->

### Mushroom.439

<!-- chunk -->

### In one double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, researchers in Japan worked

<!-- chunk -->

### with 50 – 80 year men and women. All suffered from mild cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### impairment.

<!-- chunk -->

### The trial subjects received four 250 mg tablets containing 96% of

<!-- chunk -->

### Yamabushitake (Lion’s Mane) dry powder three times a day for 16 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The men and women were tested at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### At each of the testing periods, the subjects who had used Lion’s Mane

<!-- chunk -->

### showed a significant improvement in cognitive scores. And their scores

<!-- chunk -->

### were increasing while on Lion’s Mane supplementation. But 4 weeks after

<!-- chunk -->

### stopping Lion’s mane supplementation, their cognitive scores decreased

<!-- chunk -->

### significantly.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that Lion’s Mane Mushroom is effective in

<!-- chunk -->

### improving mild cognitive impairment.440

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Lion’s Mane feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### You may not experience the effects of supplementing with Lion’s Mane

<!-- chunk -->

### Mushroom immediately. But many users report with continued use of

<!-- chunk -->

### Lion’s Mane, a boost in mood and mental energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some report it increases depth perception. And an improvement in sense

<!-- chunk -->

### of smell.

<!-- chunk -->

### Others testify to improved decision-making, the ability to solve problems

<!-- chunk -->

### and learning. Likely due to Lion’s Mane ability to improve neuroplasticity.

<!-- chunk -->

### The overall consensus is Lion’s Mane Mushroom’s ability to lessen

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, reduce depression, and improve concentration.


<!-- chunk -->

### Lion’s Mane Mushroom has been used as a food and herbal medicine since

<!-- chunk -->

### ancient times in East Asia. And it has been reported in scientific research

<!-- chunk -->

### that Lion’s Mane promotes Nerve Growth Factor both in the petri dish as

<!-- chunk -->

### well as in animal and human test subjects.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lion’s Mane Prevents Cognitive Dysfunction

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, researchers examined the effects of Lion’s Mane on amyloid

<!-- chunk -->

### β(25-35) peptide-induced learning and memory deficits in mice. Amyloid

<!-- chunk -->

### β(25-35) peptide is implicated in diseases like Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mice were injected with the peptide on days 7 and 14 of the trial. And they

<!-- chunk -->

### were fed a diet containing Lion’s Mane over 23-days of the experiment.

<!-- chunk -->

### The results showed that Lion’s Mane prevented short-term and visual

<!-- chunk -->

### recognition memory induced by amyloid β(25-35) peptide.

<!-- chunk -->

### They concluded that Lion’s Mane Mushroom “may be useful in the

<!-- chunk -->

### prevention of cognitive dysfunction”.441

<!-- chunk -->

## Lion’s Mane Induces Nerve Growth Factor

<!-- chunk -->

### In this trial, mice were fed Lion’s Mane 5% freeze-dried powdered extract

<!-- chunk -->

### for 7 days. Researchers found an increase in the level of Nerve Growth

<!-- chunk -->

### Factor (NGF) in the hippocampus of the mice. Concluding that Lion’s

<!-- chunk -->

### Mane “contains active compounds that stimulate NGF synthesis”.442

<!-- chunk -->

## Lion’s Mane Repairs Nerves

<!-- chunk -->

### This study done with rats, Lion’s Mane extract was able to promote neuron

<!-- chunk -->

### regrowth after injury. Rats with gluteal nerve damage were able to walk

<!-- chunk -->

### again after consuming water containing Lion’s Mane extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that Lion’s Mane regenerates damaged nerve

<!-- chunk -->

### cells. In this case, the reversal was so profound, the rats went from being

<!-- chunk -->

### totally disabled to walking again.443


<!-- chunk -->

### Dosing of Lion’s Mane Mushroom depends on the strength of the extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s available in capsule or powder form.

<!-- chunk -->

### For Lion’s Mane 10:1 extract (30% polysaccharide), daily dosage is 500 –

<!-- chunk -->

### 1,000 mg taken 1 to 3 times per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other retail extract dosages of Lion’s Mane ranges from 300 mg to

<!-- chunk -->

### mg dosed 1 – 3 times per day. Check the label and see what the

<!-- chunk -->

### manufacturer recommends. And when first using the supplement, start

<!-- chunk -->

### with the lowest dose and see how your body reacts.


<!-- chunk -->

### Lion’s Mane Mushroom is non-toxic and considered very safe. So there

<!-- chunk -->

### are very few side effects reported.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some neurohackers report itchy skin from higher doses. Likely

<!-- chunk -->

### attributable to a boost in Nerve Growth Factor.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lion’s Mane has been tested in animals showing no side effects or toxicity

<!-- chunk -->

### even up to 5 grams per kilogram.


<!-- chunk -->

### Lion’s Mane Mushroom (Hericium erinaceus) as a supplement is usually

<!-- chunk -->

### offered as an extract. In powdered form, or in a capsule.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplement makers of nootropic stacks sometime include Lion’s Mane as

<!-- chunk -->

### well. For example, Mind Lab Pro® includes 500 mg of the full fruit extract

<!-- chunk -->

### in their formula. Each formula will be different depending on synergy with

<!-- chunk -->

### the stack, and type of extract used.

<!-- chunk -->

### When choosing a Lion’s Mane supplement, there’s debate over the best

<!-- chunk -->

### form of extraction to achieve the mushroom’s full medicinal benefit.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some say your best option is a hot water extraction. Another says alcohol

<!-- chunk -->

### extraction. Another claims both are necessary.

<!-- chunk -->

### But when it comes to mushrooms, saying that one is “more potent” than

<!-- chunk -->

### another is just too simplified to be true. This is as much an art as it is

<!-- chunk -->

### science.

<!-- chunk -->

### Much more important is choosing a supplement that includes the

<!-- chunk -->

## mycelium of Lions Mane Mushroom. In this mushroom, the fruiting body

<!-- chunk -->

## does not contain erinacines which is the compound that boosts Nerve

<!-- chunk -->

### Growth Factor (NGF).

<!-- chunk -->

### The nootropic benefits of hericenones only found in the fruiting body or

<!-- chunk -->

### top of the mushroom help support your immune system and get rid of

<!-- chunk -->

### Amyloid β(25-35) peptide implicated in diseases like Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### The challenge is getting a Lions Mane Mushroom extract that contains the

<!-- chunk -->

## full spectrum found in both the mycelium and fruiting body. But the

<!-- chunk -->

### mushroom must be grown in liquid and not a solid substrate like grain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Otherwise you’ll get ground up grain without the important erinacines

<!-- chunk -->

### needed for increased NGF.

<!-- chunk -->

### Look at the manufacturers literature and marketing material and find out

<!-- chunk -->

### how their Lions Mane is grown. And read the reviews on shopping sites as

<!-- chunk -->

### well as forums.

<!-- chunk -->

### Types of Lion’s Mane available:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Plain Lion’s Mane: Pure, powdered mushroom. Often freeze-dried,

<!-- chunk -->

### and the cheapest form available. Can be added to water, juice or

<!-- chunk -->

### smoothies.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Lion’s Mane Extracts: A more potent form of mushroom. Often

<!-- chunk -->

### presented as 14:1 or 10:1 extracts (14 pounds or 10 pounds reduced

<!-- chunk -->

### to 1 pound of extract).

<!-- chunk -->

## •Standardized Lion’s Mane: Processed to provide exact levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### active ingredients. You can get Lion’s Mane standardized to 30%

<!-- chunk -->

### and 50% polysaccharides (the active hericenones and erinacines are

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolites of polysaccharides).

<!-- chunk -->

## •Lion’s Mane tea: Since this is a popular mushroom in the kitchen,

<!-- chunk -->

### the taste is acceptable. But it’s hard to get a handle on how much

<!-- chunk -->

### actual active ingredient you’re getting.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Amycenone®/PLM-Fraction: This “branded” product is

<!-- chunk -->

### standardized to Hericenones 0.5%, Amyloban 6%. It seems to target

<!-- chunk -->

### a lesser-known Lion’s Mane active ingredient–Amyloban–which is

<!-- chunk -->

### positioned as a mushroom compound that fights beta-amyloid

<!-- chunk -->

### proteins. Originating in Japan, it is extremely expensive, and may be

<!-- chunk -->

### found in a supplement called Amyloban®3399.

<!-- chunk -->

### And if you decide to pick your own, before consuming any wild mushroom,

<!-- chunk -->

### make sure that it is accurately identified. Mushroom poisoning is a real

<!-- chunk -->

### problem if you pick the wrong one.

<!-- chunk -->

<!-- chunk -->

### North American Mycological Association website (www.namyco.org).


<!-- chunk -->

## Lion’s Mane 300 to 3,000 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Lion’s Mane as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Lion’s Mane on its own. So you need to take it

<!-- chunk -->

### as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lion’s Mane is especially helpful for regenerating brain cells. It prevents

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### And it boosts long-term potentiation for memory and mental sharpness.

<!-- chunk -->

### By stimulating Nerve Growth Factor.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lion’s Mane also helps boost mood, tame anxiety and relieve depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### For a better quality of life.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest starting with a dose of 500 mg daily. The best human study used

<!-- chunk -->

### 750 mg per day. But another researcher found lower concentrations may

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulate NGF better than higher concentrations.444

<!-- chunk -->

### Start at 500 mg per day and see how it works for you. If you don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### experience a benefit, boost Lion’s Mane in small increments of 250 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### per day until you notice an improvement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lion’s Mane is a great compliment to a nootropic stack including

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam, Alpha GPC, ALCAR, and Omega-3’s for an immediate

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive boost.


# L-Theanine

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Theanine is known for boosting alpha and theta brain waves, anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, boosting cognition, improving memory, and better-quality sleep

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Theanine (r-glutamylethylamide) is a non-dietary amino acid found in

<!-- chunk -->

### tea. And especially high levels in green tea (camellia sinensis). L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Theanine was first isolated from green tea in Japan by Sakato in 1949.

<!-- chunk -->

### As an analogue of glutamate and glutamine, it’s hydrolyzed in your

<!-- chunk -->

### intestine and liver into l-glutamate and ethylamine. And easily crosses

<!-- chunk -->

### your blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Theanine is one of the very few nootropics known to modulate brain

<!-- chunk -->

## waves. It affects alpha brain waves which are associated with relaxation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Providing an alert calmness, L-Theanine helps in promoting super-

<!-- chunk -->

### learning, flow states and joy.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Theanine boosts the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine and GABA in

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain. As well as increasing Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor

<!-- chunk -->

### (BDNF) and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF).445

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Theanine is known for helping to relieve stress, improve cognition,

<!-- chunk -->

### boost mood and cognitive function.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does L-Theanine Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Theanine boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.L-Theanine reduces physical and mental stress. L- Theanine helps

<!-- chunk -->

### increase alpha brain waves which are associated with mental

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxation and concentration.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study in South Korea worked with 20 healthy male volunteers aged

<!-- chunk -->

### – 30 years. One group was given L-Theanine tablets, and the other group a

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo daily for 7 days.

<!-- chunk -->

### Brain waves were measured 40 minutes after administration of the tablets.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers analyzed alpha wave power values. And concluded that L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Theanine tablets promoted the release of alpha brain waves related to

<!-- chunk -->

### mental relaxation and concentration.446

<!-- chunk -->

### In May 2016, researchers at Simon Fraser University in Canada developed

<!-- chunk -->

### a technology to clinically measure brain wave patterns. With this

<!-- chunk -->

### technology, we’re now able to detect cognitive dysfunction before it

<!-- chunk -->

### happens. Imagine the implications of this new technology when applied to

<!-- chunk -->

### the nootropics world.447

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.L-Theanine increases neurotransmitters. Research shows that L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Theanine increases dopamine, serotonin, and GABA in your brain.448

<!-- chunk -->

### And it reduces the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate which is

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with stress, tension and agitation.449

<!-- chunk -->

### A study done in Japan worked with 12 people who underwent 4 separate

<!-- chunk -->

### trials. One in which they took L-Theanine at the start of the experiment.

<!-- chunk -->

### One in which they took it half-way through. And two control trials in

<!-- chunk -->

### which they took either a placebo or nothing.

<!-- chunk -->

### The results showed that L-Theanine resulted in a reduction in heart rate

<!-- chunk -->

### and s-IgA associated with acute stress. The researchers concluded that L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Theanine could cause anti-stress effects via the inhibition of cortical

<!-- chunk -->

### neuron excitation.450

<!-- chunk -->

## How things go bad:


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Glutamate levels increase

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Stress levels increase

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Long-term memory and mood decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Quality of sleep declines

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes can happen at any age once we reach adulthood. And

<!-- chunk -->

### are contributing factors to the neurodegenerative diseases of aging, and

<!-- chunk -->

### quality of life.

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Theanine benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Theanine energizes without draining, calms without putting you to

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep, and motivates without causing a jagged edge.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tea (as a source of L-Theanine) can have as much caffeine as some

<!-- chunk -->

### coffees. And yet doesn’t exert the same “speedy” effect. And the reason is

<!-- chunk -->

## the ingredient L-Theanine.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can actually see L-Theanine’s effect in your brain using an EEG.

<!-- chunk -->

### Brain waves are smoothed out rather than flattened out.451 So your body is

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxed, your mind is calmed, but you don’t get sleepy. And L-Theanine,

<!-- chunk -->

### once it crosses the blood-brain barrier, raises levels of serotonin and

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine.452

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Theanine even improves your quality of sleep. Researchers in Japan

<!-- chunk -->

### gave volunteers 200 mg of L-Theanine daily and recorded their sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### patterns. Sleep quality, recovery from exhaustion, and feeling refreshed

<!-- chunk -->

### were all enhanced by L-Theanine.453

<!-- chunk -->

### And L-Theanine puts you in a better mood. Once it crosses your blood-

<!-- chunk -->

### brain barrier, L-Theanine changes levels of amino acids affecting

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin, dopamine, and GABA. Having a modulating effect on mood.454

<!-- chunk -->

## How does L-Theanine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Your unique neurochemistry including neurotransmitters, brain waves,

<!-- chunk -->

### brain structure and even regional brain activity will influence your

<!-- chunk -->

### response to L-Theanine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most neurohackers report a calming effect within 30 – 45 minutes of

<!-- chunk -->

### taking L-Theanine. Cognition gets a boost, and energy levels rise without

<!-- chunk -->

### the jitteriness caused by stimulants like caffeine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some report L-Theanine has stopped their anxiety and panic attacks. Just

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t combine it with anti-anxiety meds like Xanax.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most report an overall improvement in the sense of well-being and quality

<!-- chunk -->

### of life. And nearly all remark on better quality sleep.


<!-- chunk -->

## Green Tea reduces incidence of stroke

<!-- chunk -->

### Research has found that if L-Theanine is present in the body at the time

<!-- chunk -->

### stroke occurs, brain damage will be significantly reduced.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this monster study done in China, researchers selected 14,212 subjects

<!-- chunk -->

### from 12 provinces. Ages ranged from 35 – 60 years old. The study looked

<!-- chunk -->

### at tea drinking status, dose, and type of teas.

<!-- chunk -->

### This study concluded there was a 40% decreased risk of stroke in those

<!-- chunk -->

### who drank green, black, or jasmine teas.455

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Theanine improves memory

<!-- chunk -->

### In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the effect of L-Theanine on

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and attention was investigated.

<!-- chunk -->

### 91 subjects with mild cognitive impairment were enrolled in this study.

<!-- chunk -->

### One group received 1,680 mg of L-Theanine daily for 16 weeks. And the

<!-- chunk -->

### control group received a placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study concluded that L-Theanine increased brain Theta waves

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with cognitive alertness and creativity. And there were

<!-- chunk -->

### improvements in memory. The results of this study suggested that L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Theanine has potential as an intervention for cognitive improvement.456

<!-- chunk -->

### And that is an understatement by any stretch. People spend years

<!-- chunk -->

### meditating. With the goal of reaching consistent access to brain wave

<!-- chunk -->

### states like Theta. In this trial, they did it with a dose of L-Theanine. The

<!-- chunk -->

### same type of dose you could get with a few cups of quality green tea.

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Theanine reduces stress

<!-- chunk -->

### Considerable research has been dedicated to L-Theanine and its benefits to

<!-- chunk -->

### stress reduction in both animal and human studies. And we have ample

<!-- chunk -->

### documentation that corticosterone and stress exert negative effects on

<!-- chunk -->

### memory.457

<!-- chunk -->

### Corticosteroids which are secreted after stress, have a profound impact on

<!-- chunk -->

### long-term potentiation and memory formation.458

<!-- chunk -->

### In this animal study, rats were fed water containing L-Theanine for

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks and put through some stress inducing exercise. The researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### found that corticosterone levels were lower in the rats who used L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Theanine compared to those who had none.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, stress had no effect on the animals who were fed L-Theanine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Memory was not affected. The researchers concluded that L-Theanine

<!-- chunk -->

### modified corticosterone secretion. And L-Theanine is a strong preventive

<!-- chunk -->

### measure in preventing memory loss otherwise induced by stress.459


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dosage of L-Theanine is 200 – 400 mg once or twice per

<!-- chunk -->

### day. With a maximum of 1,200 mg per day according to the Cleveland

<!-- chunk -->

### Clinic.460

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Theanine is water soluble so you can take it with water.

<!-- chunk -->

### Labels on quality green tea often only display the amount of green tea leaf

<!-- chunk -->

### available in each bag in milligrams (mg). But not it’s L-Theanine content.

<!-- chunk -->

### Green tea that’s steeped correctly will offer 1-2% L-Theanine per cup. So

<!-- chunk -->

### 1,500 mg of green tea leaf would be about 30 mg. of L-Theanine (at 2%).

<!-- chunk -->

### We often say that YMMV, and this is especially applicable to L-Theanine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Find out what works best for you. Start at a lower dose like 100 mg. And

<!-- chunk -->

### work your way up until you achieve the effects you’re looking for.


<!-- chunk -->

### L-Theanine is a naturally occurring amino acid found in plants like tea or

<!-- chunk -->

### one species of mushroom. So it’s considered non-toxic and very safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Theanine seems to decrease blood pressure. So if you’re on meds for high

<!-- chunk -->

### blood pressure, use L-Theanine with caution. Your blood pressure could go

<!-- chunk -->

### too low.


<!-- chunk -->

### L-Theanine is available in green, black, and white teas. Green tea contains

<!-- chunk -->

### the most L-Theanine.

<!-- chunk -->

## A great side benefit for neurohackers is green tea also contains caffeine.

<!-- chunk -->

### A cup of good quality green tea has less caffeine than a cup of coffee.

<!-- chunk -->

### About 10 mg less.

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Theanine + Caffeine stack

<!-- chunk -->

### One study done at Unilever in the UK looked at the combined effects of L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Theanine and caffeine on cognitive performance and mood. They

<!-- chunk -->

### compared 50 mg of caffeine with and without 100 mg of L-Theanine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team had 27 volunteers participate. And based measurements

<!-- chunk -->

### on word recognition, rapid visual information processing, critical flicker

<!-- chunk -->

### fusion threshold, attention switching and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Performance was measured at the beginning, and again 60 minutes and

<!-- chunk -->

### minutes after consumption. Separated by a 7-day washout period.

<!-- chunk -->

### Caffeine improved alertness at 60 mins. And accuracy on attention-

<!-- chunk -->

### switching at 90 mins. The L-Theanine and caffeine combination improved

<!-- chunk -->

### both speed and accuracy, and reduced susceptibility to distracting

<!-- chunk -->

### information on the memory task.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team concluded that, “L-Theanine and caffeine in

<!-- chunk -->

### combination are beneficial for improving performance on cognitively

<!-- chunk -->

### demanding tasks”.461

<!-- chunk -->

### And for an added bonus, L-Theanine takes the jittery-edge off of caffeine

<!-- chunk -->

### consumption.

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Theanine from green tea

<!-- chunk -->

### Extracting the optimal amount of L-Theanine from green tea is both art

<!-- chunk -->

### and science.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at the University of Newcastle in Australia set out to

<!-- chunk -->

### determine optimal conditions for water extraction of L-Theanine from

<!-- chunk -->

### green tea. They examined 4 different extraction methods. And learned that

<!-- chunk -->

### temperature, extraction time, ration of water-to-tea and tea particle size

<!-- chunk -->

### had significant impacts on extraction yield of L-Theanine from green tea.

<!-- chunk -->

### They concluded, “The optimal conditions for extracting theanine from

<!-- chunk -->

### green tea using water were found to be extraction at 80 °C for 30 min with

<!-- chunk -->

### a water-to-tea ratio of 20:1 mL/g and a tea particle size of 0.5-1 mm.”462

<!-- chunk -->

### So to get the most nootropic value when using green tea as your L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Theanine source – follow the directions. Just sayin’…

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Theanine Supplements

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Theanine is available in capsule or tablet form from several supplement

<!-- chunk -->

### manufacturers. Japanese company Taiyo is the oldest and most established

<!-- chunk -->

### company in the green tea supplement industry. Taiyo developed and

<!-- chunk -->

### patented a method for L-Theanine extraction from green tea called

<!-- chunk -->

## ‘Suntheanine®’.

<!-- chunk -->

### Suntheanine is included as the L-Theanine source from several large

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement makers including Mind Lab Pro®. And if it has Suntheanine on

<!-- chunk -->

### the label, you are assured that the amount of L-Theanine listed is the

<!-- chunk -->

### actual amount in each capsule.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research has shown that some supplement makers using their own

<!-- chunk -->

### extraction method for L-Theanine, contain more than just the “L” form of

<!-- chunk -->

### Theanine. Turns out if it’s not done exactly right, you end up with a “D”

<!-- chunk -->

### form of Theanine.

<!-- chunk -->

### D-Theanine may have a very different action in your body than L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Theanine. We’re not saying it’s dangerous. You just may not get all the

<!-- chunk -->

### benefit of pure L-Theanine.

<!-- chunk -->

### So read the labels and reviews by people who have tried the product. With

<!-- chunk -->

### a little experimentation you’ll find a L-Theanine supplement that works

<!-- chunk -->

### for you.


<!-- chunk -->

## L-Theanine 250 - 500 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using L-Theanine as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body cannot make L-Theanine on its own. It’s a non-dietary amino

<!-- chunk -->

### acid only available from tea (and one little-known mushroom).

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Theanine affects Alpha and Theta brain waves. This alone will help calm

<!-- chunk -->

### your mind, reduce stress, and help you stay alert. You’ll get even more

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive benefit by stacking L-Theanine with caffeine.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Theanine helps boosts the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA. Improving alertness and attention. And boosting cognition and


<!-- chunk -->

### And it reduces the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate which is

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with stress, tension and agitation.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Theanine helps to prevent strokes, and even reduces the damaging

<!-- chunk -->

### effects if you’ve had a stroke.

<!-- chunk -->

### And L-Theanine has been shown to improve sleep quality.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest starting with a dose of 100 - 250 mg of L-Theanine daily for

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic use. Using either a quality supplement, or high quality green tea.


# Magnesium

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium improves cognition, memory, learning, recall, reduces brain

<!-- chunk -->

### fog, is an antioxidant, helps neuroplasticity, and protects against

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamate-toxicity

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnesium is the 4th most abundant mineral in your body. And critical for

<!-- chunk -->

### optimal cognitive health. It is a cofactor in more than 300 enzymatic

<!-- chunk -->

### reactions in your body.463

<!-- chunk -->

### But many of us in Western society are living with a magnesium deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### And most are unaware of this deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium in our diet comes from foods like green leafy vegetables,

<!-- chunk -->

### beans, nuts, seeds, whole grains, poultry, beef, and salmon. Tap, mineral

<!-- chunk -->

### and bottled water also used to be good sources of magnesium. But varies

<!-- chunk -->

### by brand, source and if the magnesium has been filtered out during

<!-- chunk -->

### processing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium assists in converting energy supplied by food to a useable

<!-- chunk -->

## form to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The primary fuel source

<!-- chunk -->

### produced within your mitochondria. Magnesium is also needed for the

<!-- chunk -->

## synthesis of RNA and DNA.464

<!-- chunk -->

### In your brain, magnesium regulates the activity in neuron ion channels.

<!-- chunk -->

### These channels are like tiny electrical switches. Governing the flow of

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters within neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium also regulates brain synaptic plasticity. Which is critical for

<!-- chunk -->

### learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium is critical to all of your body’s electrical and electrochemical

<!-- chunk -->

### activities. It’s involved in muscle contractions, heart rhythm, nerve

<!-- chunk -->

### function and brain cell activity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Low blood magnesium levels show up as seizures, hypertension, stroke,

<!-- chunk -->

### migraines, and ADHD. It can also result in insulin resistance and type II

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium is an essential part of neuroplasticity. Brain plasticity is the

<!-- chunk -->

### ability of your neurons to make cell-to-cell connections to form and

<!-- chunk -->

### regulate learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### With aging, or insufficient magnesium in our diet, we lose brain plasticity

<!-- chunk -->

### which results in a loss of cognitive function.465 This is why a young

<!-- chunk -->

### person, with an active, flexible brain easily catches new ideas. And simply

<!-- chunk -->

### thinks faster than a person whose brain has lost plasticity and is more

<!-- chunk -->

### fixed in their patterns.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium is even involved in how the other nootropics in your stack are

<!-- chunk -->

### utilized by cells in your brain. The bottom-line is magnesium could be one

<!-- chunk -->

### of the most important additions to any nootropic stack.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Magnesium Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Magnesium is critical for neuroplasticity. Your brain is capable of

<!-- chunk -->

### forming new connections between neurons. When you take in new

<!-- chunk -->

### information, a signal is sent across the synaptic space between

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons. The ability of your brain to form these new connections is

<!-- chunk -->

## referred to as neuroplasticity.

<!-- chunk -->

### This neuroplasticity is how learning and memories are formed. When

<!-- chunk -->

### these signaling pathways break down, memories fade. And you start to

<!-- chunk -->

### forget simple things like people’s names or phone numbers.

<!-- chunk -->

### A simple example of how this works is reading this article. As you read

<!-- chunk -->

### this, your brain is forming and reforming new neural connections. When

<!-- chunk -->

### things aren’t optimal, you find yourself reading and re-reading sentences.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium is critical for maintaining this neuroplasticity. And your

<!-- chunk -->

### ability to learn and form memories. Magnesium ions control the ion

<!-- chunk -->

### channels, or electrical switches for this signaling.466

<!-- chunk -->

### The more signals that these ion channels transmit, the stronger the

<!-- chunk -->

### connections between neurons. And the stronger the formation of the

<!-- chunk -->

### resulting memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many studies demonstrate the detrimental impact of insufficient

<!-- chunk -->

### magnesium on optimal cognitive function.467

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Magnesium is required for ATP synthesis. ATP (adenosine

<!-- chunk -->

### triphosphate) is the main energy source produced within

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria in brain cells. 20% of your body’s total ATP is located

<!-- chunk -->

### in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### For ATP to be biologically active, it must be bound to a magnesium ion

<!-- chunk -->

### (Mg-ATP).468 About two thirds of your brain’s energy budget is used to

<!-- chunk -->

### help neurons send signals to neighboring neurons. The remaining third is

<!-- chunk -->

### used for housekeeping, or cellular maintenance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Wei Chen, a radiologist at the University of Minnesota Medical School

<!-- chunk -->

### was co-author of a study on the brain’s use of ATP. The team used

<!-- chunk -->

### magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure the brain’s energy

<!-- chunk -->

### production during shifts in activity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Their study on lab rats noted that when the rats were knocked out, they

<!-- chunk -->

### produced 50% fewer ATP molecules than when mildly anesthetized. Chen

<!-- chunk -->

### noted that the ATP produced when the brain is inactive goes to cell

<!-- chunk -->

### maintenance.469 This housekeeping is important for keeping the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue alive.

<!-- chunk -->

### The other two thirds are needed for other cellular processes including

<!-- chunk -->

### recharging neurons so they can fire. And create the electrical signals

<!-- chunk -->

### needed for neuron communication. Required for learning, memory, recall

<!-- chunk -->

### and cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Without magnesium, your brain cannot produce ATP, and all brain

<!-- chunk -->

### function breaks down.


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, our brain chemistry and metabolism changes.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ ATP levels decline in mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Cognition, learning, memory and recall decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Brain cell plasticity declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Free radicals damage brain cell mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes can happen at any age. And can be a result of not

<!-- chunk -->

### getting an adequate supply of magnesium.

<!-- chunk -->

### So magnesium supplementation can help for age-related cognitive decline,

<!-- chunk -->

### as well as anyone who wants to boost cognition, learning, recall and


<!-- chunk -->

## Magnesium benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium plays a critical role in supporting neuroplasticity which is

<!-- chunk -->

### fundamental for a youthful, flexible brain. A brain that is optimized to

<!-- chunk -->

### support cognition, learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Raising brain magnesium levels has been proven to restore neuroplasticity

<!-- chunk -->

### and improve cognitive function.470

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium deficiency has been associated with Alzheimer’s Disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists have found that treatment with magnesium-L-threonate

<!-- chunk -->

### decreases β-amyloid deposits in the brain. And is able to rebuild signaling

<!-- chunk -->

### pathways in neurons helping to restore memory.471

<!-- chunk -->

### And magnesium is required for ATP synthesis in brain cells. Providing the

<!-- chunk -->

### mental energy needed for cognition, memory, recall and learning.472

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Magnesium feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Most neurohackers report an increased level of focus, energy, memory, and

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive ability when supplementing with magnesium.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should also experience an improved quality of sleep. And have an

<!-- chunk -->

### overall improvement in mood.


<!-- chunk -->

### One of most common reasons we use nootropics is to boost memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### mental energy. Memory loss drastically reduces quality of life. And simple

<!-- chunk -->

### brain fog makes it difficult to accomplish the simplest of tasks.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research has shown that magnesium is involved in memory, learning and

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition on several levels. And supplementing with magnesium is one of

<!-- chunk -->

### the most fundamental things you can do to boost cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnesium improves long-term memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Synapses in the hippocampus and other areas of the brain strengthen the

<!-- chunk -->

### more they’re used. Even brief repetitive activity results in a substantial

<!-- chunk -->

### increase in synaptic strength. The results can last for several hours. Or

<!-- chunk -->

### even weeks afterwards. This is called ‘long-term potentiation’.473

<!-- chunk -->

### Several studies have been conducted on magnesium supplementation and

<!-- chunk -->

### its effects on memory in the last 20 years. With positive results. This study

<!-- chunk -->

### on aged and young rats found that adding magnesium to their food

<!-- chunk -->

### improved learning.474

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnesium relieves depression

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers have found magnesium works in the hippocampus to suppress

<!-- chunk -->

### the release of the stress hormone ACTH (adrenocorticotrophic hormone).

<!-- chunk -->

### This is the hormone that tells your adrenal glands to release more cortisol

<!-- chunk -->

### and adrenaline.

<!-- chunk -->

### Too much cortisol eventually damages the hippocampus in the brain. This

<!-- chunk -->

### causes a negative feedback loop which results in even more stress. Which

<!-- chunk -->

### is toxic to the brain and your entire body. And one of the causes of chronic


<!-- chunk -->

### A study was done with 5,708 people aged 46-49 and 70-74 years old in

<!-- chunk -->

### Norway. The aim of the study was to examine the association between

<!-- chunk -->

### magnesium intake and depression and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that low magnesium intake is related to

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. And they stated, “These findings may have public health and

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment implications.”475

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study done with 12 subjects found that magnesium

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation improved sleep and lowered the stress hormone cortisol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Concluding that magnesium has “possible efficacy… as a mood

<!-- chunk -->

### stabilizer”.476

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnesium may relieve symptoms of ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium in the treatment of ADHD is becoming more mainstream. And

<!-- chunk -->

### there is a growing body of research that supports the idea that one of the

<!-- chunk -->

### factors causing ADHD is a lack of magnesium.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study in Poland showed that 95% of the children examined with ADD or

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD were magnesium deficient.477


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended magnesium dosage in most common forms is 400 mg per

<!-- chunk -->

### day. But the problem is most magnesium supplements don’t work well as a

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic. Because they don’t cross the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research begun at MIT by Dr. Inna Slutsky came up with a new

<!-- chunk -->

### magnesium supplement called Magnesium-L-threonate (MgT). This new

<!-- chunk -->

### magnesium compound easily crosses the blood-brain barrier.478

<!-- chunk -->

### This form of magnesium was patented and now produced by Magtein™

<!-- chunk -->

### Science. Several supplement companies sell magnesium with this branded

<!-- chunk -->

### form.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dose of Magnesium-L-threonate is 1 gram per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium is water-soluble so you don’t need to take it with a meal, or a

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy fat like you do with some nootropics.


<!-- chunk -->

### Most forms of magnesium can cause diarrhea and bloating. Magnesium-l-

<!-- chunk -->

### threonate contains less elemental magnesium per dose and should not

<!-- chunk -->

### cause gastrointestinal upset.


<!-- chunk -->

## Magnesium is sold as magnesium aspartate, citrate, lactate, chloride and

<!-- chunk -->

### magnesium L-threonate.

<!-- chunk -->

### Depending on the type of magnesium; it comes in capsules, chewable

<!-- chunk -->

### tablets, powder, extended-release tablets, or in a liquid solution.

<!-- chunk -->

## A more bioavailable form of magnesium is now available. Magnesium-l-

<!-- chunk -->

## threonate (MgT) is patented and is called Magtein™.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium-l-threonate easily crosses the blood-brain barrier. And is

<!-- chunk -->

### recommended if you’re adding magnesium to your stack.


<!-- chunk -->

## Magnesium-L-threonate 1 gram per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Magnesium-L-threonate as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does not make Magnesium on its own. So to get its benefits it

<!-- chunk -->

### needs to come from your diet. Or you must take it as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium is especially helpful for boosting memory, learning, recall,

<!-- chunk -->

### mood and cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium is also particularly useful to help alleviate some of the

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of ADHD. And to help restore memory caused by

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### While most forms of magnesium are helpful for overall health, most are

<!-- chunk -->

### not very helpful for cognitive health.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend Magnesium-L-threonate (MgT). MgT has been proven in the

<!-- chunk -->

### lab to easily cross the blood-brain barrier. And to boost cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnesium-L-threonate is a fast-acting nootropic that can also help

<!-- chunk -->

### prevent brain degeneration later in life.


# Magnolia Bark

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark is known for its anti-anxiety and stress-relieving effects,

<!-- chunk -->

### reducing depression, and promoting restful sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnolia Bark (Magnolia officinalis, Magnoliae cortex, Houpo, Chua

<!-- chunk -->

### houpu) comes from the Magnolia tree originally found in Southeast Asia,

<!-- chunk -->

### Eastern North America, Central America, and the Himalayas. Its flowers

<!-- chunk -->

### are fragrant with white petals.479

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark was first recorded in the “Shennong Herbal Classic” from

<!-- chunk -->

### the Qin and Han Dynasty around 221 B.C. to 220 A.D. It was used to get

<!-- chunk -->

### rid of phlegm, lower Qi, and for abdominal swelling.

<!-- chunk -->

### More than 250 different chemical compounds have been identified in the

<!-- chunk -->

### flowers, bark, and leaves of the Magnolia. But most of its therapeutic

<!-- chunk -->

### potential comes from the bark and roots.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Magnolia bud is almost exclusively used to treat sinus congestion and

<!-- chunk -->

### sinus headache.480

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark is harvested in the spring from April to June. The root and

<!-- chunk -->

### branch bark are boiled in water and set aside until it turns a purplish brown

<!-- chunk -->

### color. This concoction is then steamed, rolled, and dried.

<!-- chunk -->

### Early chemical studies identified two main active ingredients in the

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnolia Bark: magnolol and honokiol. These neolignanes are the main

<!-- chunk -->

### active components providing its nootropic benefit.481

<!-- chunk -->

### Other bioactive compounds from Magnolia Bark are the alkaloids benzyl-

<!-- chunk -->

### tetrahydroisoquinoline and aporphine which are found in the leaves,

<!-- chunk -->

### branches, and bark. These alkaloids may also have antispasmodic and

<!-- chunk -->

### muscle relaxant benefits.482

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark has been traditionally used to treat diabetes,

<!-- chunk -->

### atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, gastrointestinal disorders, asthma,

<!-- chunk -->

### and microbial infections.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies in human cells indicate a growth inhibitor effect of honokiol and

<!-- chunk -->

### magnolol on human melanoma and carcinoma cells. There is increased

<!-- chunk -->

### interest in developing a novel analogue for chemotherapy derived from

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark.483

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, Magnolia Bark interacts with the adenosine A


<!-- chunk -->

### receptor,

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine transporter, dopamine D


<!-- chunk -->

### receptor (antagonist), serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors 5-HT

1B

<!-- chunk -->

### and 5-HT


<!-- chunk -->

### (antagonist), GABA


<!-- chunk -->

### receptors, hippocampus

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine release, and modulates serotonin activity.484 And is an

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor.485

<!-- chunk -->

### The compounds honokiol and magnolol found in Magnolia Bark have been

<!-- chunk -->

### shown to significantly decrease β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced neuronal death

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with Alzheimer’s Disease.486

<!-- chunk -->

### And the compound honokiol found in Magnolia Bark is said by users to be

<!-- chunk -->

### as effective as diazepam for relieving anxiety with fewer side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Magnolia Bark work in the brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnolia Bark boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Magnolia Bark is anti-anxiety. Magnolia Bark is known for its

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-anxiety benefits as an alternative to benzodiazepines.487

<!-- chunk -->

### Honokiol found in Magnolia Bark has been shown to act on the GABA


<!-- chunk -->

### receptor subunit α-2 which provides some of its anti-anxiety benefits.488

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Magnolia Bark as an antidepressant. Main-stream psychiatric

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine often treats depression using SSRI’s. Which affects

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin reuptake in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Traditional Chinese medicine uses Magnolia Bark to treat depression

<!-- chunk -->

### instead. Studies have demonstrated the honokiol and magnolol found in

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark help prevent decreases in serotonin in the frontal cortex,

<!-- chunk -->

### hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus, and nucleus accumbens.

<!-- chunk -->

### The combination of honokiol and magnolol also normalize hypothalamic-

<!-- chunk -->

### pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hyperactivity. And induce reductions in platelet

<!-- chunk -->

### activity by upregulating the cAMP pathway.

<!-- chunk -->

### The results of these studies show how Magnolia Bark provides its potent

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-depressant benefits.489

<!-- chunk -->

### There is also growing evidence that inflammation in the brain contributes

<!-- chunk -->

### to depression. Here again, Magnolia Bark has been shown to significantly

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines; tumor necrosis factor α

<!-- chunk -->

### (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and interferon γ (IFN-γ).

<!-- chunk -->

## Reducing inflammation in the brain may affect tryptophan metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

## which increases serotonin. Providing another way Magnolia Bark as a

<!-- chunk -->

### naturally effective option for dealing with depression.490


<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic stress, anxiety, poor blood flow and free radicals (oxidative

<!-- chunk -->

### stress) can damage your brain. And one of the ways this manifests is

<!-- chunk -->

### memory loss.

<!-- chunk -->

### It comes as no surprise that people with memory loss experience higher

<!-- chunk -->

### rates of anxiety and depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ inflammation kills brain cells


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Acetylcholine (ACh) levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Learning and memory decline

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark helps reduce inflammation, restores acetylcholine levels,

<!-- chunk -->

### and supports memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnolia Bark benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark taken as a nootropic supplement easily crosses the blood-

<!-- chunk -->

### brain barrier helping reduce oxidative stress in the brain and throughout

<!-- chunk -->

### the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark is widely used to elevate mood, decrease pain, and improve

<!-- chunk -->

### immune health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark activates cannabinoid receptors in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cannabinoid receptors include CB1 and CB2.

<!-- chunk -->

### CB1 receptor activation regulates memory, cognition, and motor control.

<!-- chunk -->

### Relieving pain, vomiting, reducing hyperexcitability in epilepsy, stimulates

<!-- chunk -->

### appetite, and euphoria.

<!-- chunk -->

### CB2 receptor activation provides pain relief and reduces inflammation.491

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark helps reduce stress by suppressing adrenaline and

<!-- chunk -->

### maintaining healthy cortisol levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have shown that honokiol works as effectively as the anti-anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### drug Valium® (diazepam) without the associated side effects.492

<!-- chunk -->

### And Magnolia Bark extract helps prevent memory loss because of its anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory effects in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Magnolia Bark feel?

<!-- chunk -->

## Neurohackers report that supplementing with Magnolia Bark provides an

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-anxiety effect within minutes of taking it. Some users say it works as

<!-- chunk -->

### well as diazepine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most say they feel relaxed and ready to sleep after taking Magnolia Bark.

<!-- chunk -->

### Using it as a sleep supplement helps them fall asleep and stay asleep

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout the night.

<!-- chunk -->

### But dosage is important. And many users say you will not get the benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### of Magnolia Bark if you don’t follow dosage recommendations.

<!-- chunk -->

### Feelings of anxiety and depression can be reduced significantly with

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark daily supplementation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most report that Magnolia Bark is a great way to quickly reduce stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnolia Bark Clinical Research

<!-- chunk -->

### Most of the clinical research for Magnolia Bark are animal studies with

<!-- chunk -->

### very few conducted with humans.

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnolia Bark is anti-anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark has long been used as an anxiolytic. Most users report a

<!-- chunk -->

### reduction in anxiety when using it as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### A 2013 review by researchers at Emory University in Atlanta found that

<!-- chunk -->

### the compound honokiol in Magnolia Bark interacts with the GABA


<!-- chunk -->

### receptor. The same receptor targeted by anti-anxiety drugs like diazepam

<!-- chunk -->

### and without the side effects caused by benzodiazepines.493

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine

<!-- chunk -->

### reported that magnolol and honokiol enhanced both pre-synaptic and post-

<!-- chunk -->

### synaptic GABA transmission in hippocampus neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark modulated all sub-receptors in this group regardless of the

<!-- chunk -->

### α, β, or γ subunit subtype. Suggesting that supplements containing

<!-- chunk -->

### magnolol and/or honokiol would be effective anxiolytics, sedatives and

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-convulsants.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the researchers also noted side-effects and significant risk of drug

<!-- chunk -->

### interactions could also be expected.494

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnolia Bark for sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### User reviews of Magnolia Bark extract supplements often report using it

<!-- chunk -->

## for sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show Magnolia Bark holds promise for those who have trouble

<!-- chunk -->

### falling and staying asleep.

<!-- chunk -->

## The compound honokiol significantly shortened the time to fall asleep to

<!-- chunk -->

### non-rapid eye movement (non-REM, NREM) sleep and increased the

<!-- chunk -->

### amount of non-REM sleep in animal studies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Honokiol increased the number of state transitions from wakefulness to

<!-- chunk -->

### non-REM sleep, and from non-REM sleep to wakefulness.

<!-- chunk -->

### But honokiol has no effect on either the amount of REM sleep or depth of

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study concluded that “honokiol promoted NREM sleep by modulating

<!-- chunk -->

### the benzodiazepine site of the GABA


<!-- chunk -->

### receptor, suggesting potential

<!-- chunk -->

### applications in the treatment of insomnia, especially for patients who

<!-- chunk -->

### experience difficulty in falling and staying asleep.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Clearly, those who use Magnolia Bark extract for insomnia have the

<!-- chunk -->

### clinical evidence to back up their claims.495

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnolia Bark may prevent seizures

<!-- chunk -->

### A study was conducted in Belgium with the aim of discovering natural

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds that could be further tested for the treatment of epilepsy.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers collected 14 herbs used in Traditional Chinese Medicine

<!-- chunk -->

### used to treat epilepsy. Of six extracts that tested positive in an animal

<!-- chunk -->

### model for epilepsy, only Magnolia Bark extract showed antiseizure

<!-- chunk -->

### activity.496

<!-- chunk -->

### Honokiol has been shown to inhibit repetitive firing by blocking glutamate,

<!-- chunk -->

### NMDA and K+ evoked cationic influx. Both honokiol and magnolol were

<!-- chunk -->

### found to increase seizure thresholds but honokiol appeared to be more

<!-- chunk -->

### potent in animal studies.497

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnolia Bark recommended dosage

<!-- chunk -->

### Manufacturers of Magnolia Bark extract generally recommend a nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### dosage of up to 500 mg per day. Effective dosage depends on the strength

<!-- chunk -->

### of the extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### We do not have access to clinical data stating the maximum recommended

<!-- chunk -->

### daily dosage for Magnolia Bark.

<!-- chunk -->

### But do NOT exceed the recommended dosage because studies show in

<!-- chunk -->

### excess, Magnolia Bark can be toxic and cause neuronal cell death.498

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark is fat-soluble and can easily cross the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because it is fat-soluble, Magnolia Bark must be taken with a healthy fat

<!-- chunk -->

### like unrefined coconut oil or other healthy oil to ensure absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnolia Bark side effects

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnolia Bark is non-toxic and safe for use as a nootropic supplement

<!-- chunk -->

### based on years of recent food safety studies.499

<!-- chunk -->

### However, although rare, side effects can include tremors, dizziness,

<!-- chunk -->

### excessive sleepiness, and muscle weakness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do NOT use Magnolia Bark if you are on blood-thinning meds. And

<!-- chunk -->

### discontinue its use at least two weeks prior to surgery.

<!-- chunk -->

## Avoid using Magnolia Bark if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. One

<!-- chunk -->

### animal study documented honokiol and magnolol blocked calcium-

<!-- chunk -->

### dependent uterine contractions in rats.500

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark should NOT be used if you are taking benzodiazepines

<!-- chunk -->

### because studies show this powerful herb significantly increases the

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitivity of GABA


<!-- chunk -->

### benzo receptors.501 Combining the drug with

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark may result in a benzodiazepine overdose.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark extract can cause sleepiness, vertigo, and dizziness if you

<!-- chunk -->

### are using muscle relaxants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolol in Magnolia Bark will stimulate corticosterone secretion which

<!-- chunk -->

### will likely cause problems if you are using steroid medication.

<!-- chunk -->

### We have reports spanning the last few decades of women developing

<!-- chunk -->

### kidney failure resulting in dialysis after using a Magnolia Bark

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement as part of a weight loss program.

<!-- chunk -->

### Further investigation showed different alkaloid profiles from those

<!-- chunk -->

### expected from Magnolia Bark. Which likely means something other than

<!-- chunk -->

### pure Magnolia Bark extract was used.502

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom-line is make sure you are buying a genuine and pure Magnolia

<!-- chunk -->

### Bark supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Type of Magnolia Bark to buy

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnolia Bark extract is available in capsules, tablets, bags of powder,

<!-- chunk -->

### loose bark tea, and liquid extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark extract is offered in various strengths. Including a certain

<!-- chunk -->

### percentage of honokiol and magnolol which are the two active compounds

<!-- chunk -->

### found in this herb.

<!-- chunk -->

## Relora® is a proprietary and patented blend of Magnolia Bark extract and

<!-- chunk -->

### Phellondendron amurense bark extract made by Lonza. And licensed for

<!-- chunk -->

### use by dietary supplement manufacturers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Relora® is supported by 3 peer-reviewed, randomized, double-blind,

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo-controlled studies demonstrating a 42% improvement in mood

<!-- chunk -->

### states, 18% increase in vigor, 11% overall reduction in stress, and a 20%

<!-- chunk -->

### reduction in depression.503

<!-- chunk -->

### Do your best to choose a Magnolia Bark extract supplement made in a

<!-- chunk -->

### GMP facility with no “other ingredients” other than the capsule. And a

<!-- chunk -->

### testing program in place ensuring quality and purity.


<!-- chunk -->

## Magnolia Bark extract up to 500 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Magnolia Bark extract as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make the compounds honokiol and magnolol found in

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark on its own. So, to get its benefits you must take it as a


<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark is especially helpful for those dealing with anxiety and

<!-- chunk -->

### stress. Studies show and users report it as effective for taming anxiety as

<!-- chunk -->

### benzodiazepines. But without the side effects associated with these drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark is reported to work well for those suffering from insomnia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taken as a sleep aid, Magnolia Bark extract helps you fall asleep faster,

<!-- chunk -->

### and stay asleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnolia Bark extract is also helpful for those suffering from

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s. It acts as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor which increases

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine levels often lacking in the Alzheimer’s brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### This nootropic herb helps relieve symptoms of depression by maintaining

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy serotonin levels. And reducing the pro-inflammatory cytokines

<!-- chunk -->

### often found elevated in those with depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Keep in mind that Magnolia Bark is fat-soluble and requires healthy fats

<!-- chunk -->

### from a meal, or a tablespoon of unrefined coconut oil or MCT Oil for

<!-- chunk -->

### absorption.


# Medicinal Nootropic Mushrooms

<!-- chunk -->

### Mushrooms have been used by humans for thousands of years as food and

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### More than 14,000 species of mushrooms have been identified and about

<!-- chunk -->

### 2,000 of them are edible.

<!-- chunk -->

### Of 2,000 edible mushrooms, 270 species have potential therapeutic or

<!-- chunk -->

### preventative agents that ensure human health.

<!-- chunk -->

### But of 270 medicinal mushrooms, only 6 are considered nootropics. And

<!-- chunk -->

### provide some type of benefit for your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this chapter you’ll discover the nootropic value of those 6 mushrooms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Including how they benefit learning and memory, anxiety, fatigue, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### potential for Alzheimer’s Disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Then you’ll learn how to identify a genuine nootropic mushroom

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement. We’ll also cover how to avoid misleading marketing tactics

<!-- chunk -->

### that could trick you into buying bogus mushroom supplements.

<!-- chunk -->

### And the last section of this chapter provides suggestions on where to buy

<!-- chunk -->

### the highest quality nootropic mushrooms.

<!-- chunk -->

## Top 6 Nootropic Mushrooms

<!-- chunk -->

### 270 species of edible mushrooms have been researched and tested as

<!-- chunk -->

### providing therapeutic or preventive benefits.

<!-- chunk -->

### But so far, only 6 mushroom species have been identified with plenty of

<!-- chunk -->

### evidence to work as a nootropic and benefit your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Chaga (Inonotus obliquus)

<!-- chunk -->

### Chaga mushrooms grow naturally on the bark of birch trees in northern

<!-- chunk -->

### Canada, Alaska, Siberia, Northern Europe, and Korea.

<!-- chunk -->

### Traditional medicine in the Northern Hemisphere used Chaga Mushrooms

<!-- chunk -->

### to inhibit cancer progression, stimulate immunity, reduce inflammation,

<!-- chunk -->

### and liver protection.504

<!-- chunk -->

### In the lab, Chaga has been shown to be antitumor, anti-mutagenic,

<!-- chunk -->

### antiviral, antidiabetic, antioxidant, and analgesic (pain relief).

<!-- chunk -->

### Animal studies demonstrated Chaga as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor

<!-- chunk -->

### which boosts acetylcholine for better learning and memory.505

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study showed Chaga is a potent antioxidant and free radical

<!-- chunk -->

### scavenger.506

<!-- chunk -->

### Do not use Chaga Mushrooms if you’re on blood thinning medication,

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes medication or if you have kidney disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chaga is high in oxalates, which may prevent the absorption of some

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrients and can be toxic in high doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chaga Mushroom is available in capsules, bottled tinctures, as an extract,

<!-- chunk -->

### in tea bags, and fresh raw mushroom. Dosages vary between brands.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other than as an extract, Chaga is best absorbed in hot water, alcohol, or

<!-- chunk -->

### fermented. If you’re using Chaga powder or tea bags, let it steep in hot

<!-- chunk -->

### water for 5 minutes before using it.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cordyceps (Cordyceps militaris)

<!-- chunk -->

### In the wild, Cordyceps (sinensis) grows as a parasitic fungus on

<!-- chunk -->

### caterpillars. Cultivated Cordyceps (militaris) which is mass produced for

<!-- chunk -->

### the supplement industry has been found to have similar components as

<!-- chunk -->

### sinensis. And may yield higher quantities of active compounds.507

<!-- chunk -->

### Cordyceps mushrooms have been used in traditional Chinese medicine to

<!-- chunk -->

### treat fatigue, respiratory and kidney disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Over 200 clinical studies show Cordyceps mushrooms improves

<!-- chunk -->

### performance by increasing blood flow, boosts ATP synthesis for more

<!-- chunk -->

### natural energy, acts as an antioxidant, enhances lactate clearance,

<!-- chunk -->

### increases the release of catecholamines, and reduces oxidative stress, and

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue.508

<!-- chunk -->

### Cordyceps first gained attention in 1993, when world record-breaking

<!-- chunk -->

### performances of Chinese female athletes were attributed to a vigorous

<!-- chunk -->

### training and nutrition regimen that involved Cordyceps supplementation.509

<!-- chunk -->

### A study conducted in Japan showed significant increases in the

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrations of creatine, and all the catecholamines in men over of the

<!-- chunk -->

### course of 2 weeks who were supplementing with Cordyceps sinensis.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that “during this prolonged exercise, ingesting

<!-- chunk -->

### with Cordyceps mushrooms might elicit the superior efficiency and the

<!-- chunk -->

### economical function on the energy metabolism”.510

<!-- chunk -->

### You will get the most benefit of supplementing with Cordyceps by using

<!-- chunk -->

### grams per day for at least 3 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lion’s Mane (Hericium erinaceu)

<!-- chunk -->

### Lion’s Mane Mushroom is an ancient Chinese remedy for improving

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive performance, and for overall health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Known for its powerful effects as a “brain tonic”, Lion’s Mane is said to

<!-- chunk -->

### have been used as a tea for thousands of years by Buddhist monks. To

<!-- chunk -->

### enhance brain power and heighten their ability to focus during meditation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lion’s Mane stimulates enzyme production that releases Nerve Growth

<!-- chunk -->

### Factor (NGF). In a study done in Kuala Lumpur in 2013, scientists showed

<!-- chunk -->

### that Lion’s Mane extract induced NGF synthesis and promoted neurite

<!-- chunk -->

### outgrowth.511

<!-- chunk -->

### Nerve Growth Factor helps repair neurons in your brain and boosts the

<!-- chunk -->

### growth of new neurons (neurogenesis). For better learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dosage of Lion’s Mane depends on the strength of the extract. Ranging

<!-- chunk -->

### from 300 mg to 3000 mg dosed 1 – 3 times per day.

<!-- chunk -->

## Maitake (Grifola frondosa)

<!-- chunk -->

### The Maitake mushroom is native to northeastern Japan. Its rippling

<!-- chunk -->

### appearance with no caps is a bit like that of dancing butterflies. Hence its

<!-- chunk -->

### name is derived from the Japanese words Mai (dance) and take

<!-- chunk -->

### (mushroom).

<!-- chunk -->

### Maitake mushrooms are used to support some cancer therapies, chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue, hepatitis, allergies, high blood pressure and cholesterol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Its nootropic value comes from its ability to relieve depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show that the expression of AMPA receptors are reduced in

<!-- chunk -->

### patients with depression.512 And antagonists that sensitize AMPA receptors

<!-- chunk -->

### help prevent depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Animal models show that supplementing with Maitake provides an

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant effect by sensitizing AMPA receptors. And the researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### concluded that “patients may just eat Maitake as a supplement for the

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment of depression”.513

<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dosage of Maitake Mushroom extract is 250 – 500 mg per


<!-- chunk -->

## Oyster (Pleurotus ostreatus)

<!-- chunk -->

### Oyster mushrooms are of Asian origin, but first cultivated in Germany

<!-- chunk -->

### during the first World War as an alternative food source. It’s now the 3rd

<!-- chunk -->

### highest in quantity of the commercially produced mushrooms worldwide.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oyster mushrooms are high in protein and a good alternative to animal

<!-- chunk -->

### meat because they contain some of the same amino acids as found in

<!-- chunk -->

### animal protein. Making Oyster mushrooms a good protein source for

<!-- chunk -->

### vegetarians.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oyster mushrooms are also a good source of the B-Vitamins, Vitamin C,

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D, and several minerals.514

<!-- chunk -->

### The nootropic benefits of Oyster mushroom extract are attributed to and

<!-- chunk -->

### include anti-bacterial, antiviral, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and works

<!-- chunk -->

### as an antioxidant by suppressing oxidative stress and as a free radical

<!-- chunk -->

### scavenger.

<!-- chunk -->

### Trials are undergoing and testing Oyster Mushrooms ability to degrade

<!-- chunk -->

### plastic waste, crude oil, and even radioactive waste.515

<!-- chunk -->

## Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum)

<!-- chunk -->

### Reishi mushroom has been used for over 2000 years in traditional Chinese

<!-- chunk -->

### Medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### In China, G. lucidum is called lingzhi. In Japan, the name for the

<!-- chunk -->

### Ganodermataceae family is reishi or mannentake.516

<!-- chunk -->

### Reishi mushroom benefits include blood sugar regulation, antioxidant,

<!-- chunk -->

### antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-tumor.517

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, Reishi is used for its anti-anxiety benefits518 and for

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic fatigue syndrome.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study at Mae Fah Luang University in Thailand recruited 50 volunteers

<!-- chunk -->

### suffering Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Each were given Reishi mushroom

<!-- chunk -->

### extract or placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### Each person was asked to respond to a questionnaire for quality-of-life

<!-- chunk -->

### score and level of fatigue before and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the first dose.

<!-- chunk -->

### At the end of the study, those who used Reishi mushroom extract reported

<!-- chunk -->

### a significant increase in quality of life compared to placebo with a

<!-- chunk -->

### decrease in fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that “G. lucidum extract could be potentially

<!-- chunk -->

### effective in the treatment of fatigue and improve quality of life in Chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### Fatigue Syndrome patients.”519

<!-- chunk -->

### Many ‘in-vivo’ studies demonstrate the benefits of Reishi mushroom to

<!-- chunk -->

### include boosting your immune system,520 preventing abnormal blood vessel

<!-- chunk -->

### formations, it’s anti-tumor, and helps reverse liver damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another animal study showed that Reishi mushroom could play an

<!-- chunk -->

### important role in Alzheimer’s Disease treatment. And as a nootropic, it

<!-- chunk -->

### supports the growth of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF).[xviii] NGF boosts

<!-- chunk -->

### learning, memory, and longevity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Reishi mushroom is available in capsules, as a powder, and as an extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dosages vary depending on the strength or how concentrated the extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Pharmacopoeia of the People’s Republic of China recommends 6 to

<!-- chunk -->

### g reishi extract daily.

<!-- chunk -->

## How to Buy Genuine Nootropic Mushrooms

<!-- chunk -->

### The beauty of mushrooms as a food and the few that are considered for

<!-- chunk -->

### their nootropic cognitive benefit is that they’re natural, and free of

<!-- chunk -->

### pesticides.

<!-- chunk -->

### And as nootropics or functional food, are high in vitamin, mineral and

<!-- chunk -->

### protein content. As well as being neuro-active and as antioxidants.

<!-- chunk -->

### But a word of caution here.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can usually find any of the 6 mushrooms I detailed above in a vitamin

<!-- chunk -->

### shop or online for use as a nootropic supplement. But the challenge is

<!-- chunk -->

### choosing nootropic mushroom supplements that work as claimed.

<!-- chunk -->

### How the mushroom is grown and processed as well as the part of the

<!-- chunk -->

### mushroom used will affect its value as a nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Just one of many examples, the processing method (oven-dried vs freeze-

<!-- chunk -->

### dried) for Lion’s Mane Mushroom has been shown to affect its neurite

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulation activity.521

<!-- chunk -->

### Here you’ll learn about the different parts of a mushroom. And depending

<!-- chunk -->

### on how its grown and the part used, which supplements will offer the most

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic value.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choose the wrong supplement and you won’t get its benefit.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, manufacturers often make it difficult to discern what

<!-- chunk -->

### method was used to make their mushroom supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once you learn how to read the label, you’ll have more confidence

<!-- chunk -->

### knowing you’re buying the best nootropic mushrooms.

<!-- chunk -->

## Understanding the Market of Nootropic Mushrooms

<!-- chunk -->

## What we call a “mushroom” is made up of two parts – the mycelium and

<!-- chunk -->

## the fruiting body. The top of the mushroom is the fruiting body. And its

<!-- chunk -->

### stem is the mycelium.

<!-- chunk -->

### NOTE: mycelium and mushroom is not synonymous.

<!-- chunk -->

### If the supplement label states that the contents are ‘mycelium’, you’ll

<!-- chunk -->

### know you’re NOT getting a mushroom supplement. More on that in the

<!-- chunk -->

### next section.

<!-- chunk -->

### The active components in a mushroom are what dictate their benefit to

<!-- chunk -->

### your cognition and overall health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Those active components are beta-D-glucans, triterpenoids and

<!-- chunk -->

### ergosterol.522

<!-- chunk -->

### Beta-D-glucans are the primary source of nootropic activity. They make

<!-- chunk -->

### up the natural structural component of the cell walls of the fruiting body of

<!-- chunk -->

### the mushroom.

<!-- chunk -->

### Triterpenoids compliment beta-D-glucans in immune system activity. And

<!-- chunk -->

### along with Ergosterol offer antioxidant activity, reduced inflammation,

<!-- chunk -->

### liver protection and reduced histamine response.

<!-- chunk -->

## Genuine Mushrooms vs Mycelium

<!-- chunk -->

### What you refer to as a ‘mushroom’ is actually the ‘fruiting body’ of the

<!-- chunk -->

### mushroom. Which develops from a spore, grows into the mycelium, and

<!-- chunk -->

### then tops it off with a mushroom (fruiting body).

<!-- chunk -->

### Mycelium is the underground network that acts like a root which feeds off

<!-- chunk -->

### of organic plant matter.

<!-- chunk -->

### This plant matter is usually referred to as substrate. The mycelium

<!-- chunk -->

### becomes woven into whatever that substrate is and is inseparable from the

<!-- chunk -->

### substrate material.

<!-- chunk -->

### If all goes well, the mycelium produces a mushroom (fruiting body). The

<!-- chunk -->

### fruiting body is the reproductive mechanism of this organism.

<!-- chunk -->

### When fully mature, the fruiting body produces spores that enter the

<!-- chunk -->

### substrate matter. To go on to produce more mycelium.

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom-line is a mushroom is not mycelium, and mycelium is not a

<!-- chunk -->

### mushroom.

<!-- chunk -->

### The only exception to this ‘rule’ is Lion’s Mane Mushroom. Because the

<!-- chunk -->

### fruiting body does not contain erinacines which is the compound that

<!-- chunk -->

### boosts Nerve Growth Factor (NGF).

<!-- chunk -->

### The nootropic benefits of hericenones are only found in the fruiting body

<!-- chunk -->

### or top of the mushroom help support your immune system and get rid of

<!-- chunk -->

### Amyloid β(25-35) peptide implicated in diseases like Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### The challenge is getting a Lion’s Mane Mushroom extract that contains the

<!-- chunk -->

## full spectrum found in both the mycelium and fruiting body.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the mushroom must be grown in liquid and not a solid substrate like

<!-- chunk -->

### grain. Otherwise you’ll get ground up grain without the important

<!-- chunk -->

### erinacines needed for increased NGF.

<!-- chunk -->

## The nootropic value of mushrooms: beta-D-glucans

<!-- chunk -->

### Functional nootropic mushroom benefits come from their active

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds which are found primarily in the mushroom (fruiting body).

<!-- chunk -->

### And much less so in the mycelium.

<!-- chunk -->

### The fruiting body contains Beta-D-glucans which modulate your immune

<!-- chunk -->

### system, reduce inflammation, control blood sugar, help reverse fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms, and increase overall performance endurance.523

<!-- chunk -->

### As the mycelium grows down into the substrate matter the two become

<!-- chunk -->

### interwoven. And cannot be separated during processing when

<!-- chunk -->

### manufacturing supplements.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mushroom supplement manufacturers often claim their product is pure

<!-- chunk -->

### “mushroom” extract. But what you may be getting instead is a mycelium

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement combined with substrate matter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Check the ‘Supplement Facts’ label on the back of a “mushroom”

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement to ensure you’re getting the “fruiting body” and not

<!-- chunk -->

### “mycelium” instead.

<!-- chunk -->

## Polysaccharides does NOT Equal Mushroom Quality

<!-- chunk -->

## Polysaccharides is another term you’ll come across on mushroom

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement labels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Truth is they are a key component in nootropic mushrooms. And

<!-- chunk -->

### companies boast about their high polysaccharide numbers.

<!-- chunk -->

### But here’s the problem with evaluating a mushroom supplement simply by

<!-- chunk -->

### measuring polysaccharides.

<!-- chunk -->

### Polysaccharides are long chain carbohydrates made up of components

<!-- chunk -->

## like beta-glucans, chitin, cellulose, glucose, and fructose.

<!-- chunk -->

### But polysaccharides also include alpha-glucans such as glycogen, dextran,

<!-- chunk -->

### pullulan, and starch.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many so-called “mushroom” products are made up of alpha-glucans and

<!-- chunk -->

## not beta-glucans.

<!-- chunk -->

### The thing is a lot of medicinal mushroom supplements on the market are

<!-- chunk -->

### just mycelium which is grown on grain. And the grain cannot be separated

<!-- chunk -->

### from the mycelium that it’s entangled with.

<!-- chunk -->

### These grains are alpha-glucans, starches, and other fillers which are part

<!-- chunk -->

### of the grain substrate the mushroom is grown on. And are passed off as

<!-- chunk -->

### “mushroom” supplements to those who haven’t done their homework.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha-glucans provide no nootropic benefit.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unless you inspect the nootropic mushroom label carefully, you may be

<!-- chunk -->

### misled into believing that you are buying a genuine mushroom supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### When in fact, you could be buying a bottle filled with mycelium/grain

<!-- chunk -->

### powder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Six researchers conducted and published a study in partnership with the

<!-- chunk -->

### US Pharmacopoeia to evaluate 19 Reishi mushrooms. The supplements

<!-- chunk -->

### were purchased online from Amazon and eBay.

<!-- chunk -->

### Only 5 of the 19 supplements tested contained genuine Reishi mushroom.

<!-- chunk -->

### The supplements evaluated in this study included 6 fruiting body powders,

<!-- chunk -->

### 1 fruiting body powder with added polysaccharides, 1 reishi mycelium

<!-- chunk -->

### product and 11 extracts.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that several so-called ‘Reishi’ mushroom

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements did NOT contain what consumers expected based on product

<!-- chunk -->

### information and labels.524

<!-- chunk -->

### The big take-away here is just because you see a picture of a mushroom on

<!-- chunk -->

### the front of a supplement bottle does NOT guarantee any genuine

<!-- chunk -->

### mushroom fruiting body in the supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### To get the most potent nootropic mushroom supplement, look for extracts

<!-- chunk -->

### made from the mushroom (fruiting body) and which also specifies beta-

<!-- chunk -->

### glucan content.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do NOT buy a mushroom supplement if the manufacturer neglects to state

<!-- chunk -->

### the part of the mushroom they use.

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottle or package should say whether you’re getting the mushroom

<!-- chunk -->

### (fruiting body), the mycelium, or a blend of both. How much of each

<!-- chunk -->

## including the percentage (%) of beta-glucan content. If not, put it back on

<!-- chunk -->

### the shelf.

<!-- chunk -->

## Summary

<!-- chunk -->

### China is the leading grower worldwide of medicinal mushrooms

<!-- chunk -->

### accounting for 90 – 95% of world production.

<!-- chunk -->

### China first began growing mushrooms for food and medicine in the 13th

<!-- chunk -->

### century. Many of the research centers dedicated to the study and

<!-- chunk -->

### development of mushrooms are in China.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mushrooms grown in the United States or Canada are too expensive for

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic supplement use.

<!-- chunk -->

### If your supplement label states “Made in the USA” double-check and make

<!-- chunk -->

### sure that you are buying genuine mushroom. Because if it’s an extract and

<!-- chunk -->

### whole “fruiting body”, the mushrooms are grown China. Even if the

<!-- chunk -->

### extract was manufactured in the USA.

<!-- chunk -->

### If the company insists their product was grown in the USA or Canada, you

<!-- chunk -->

### can be sure that the contents of that supplement are mycelium/grain

<!-- chunk -->

### powder and not genuine mushroom (fruiting body).

<!-- chunk -->

### When choosing a nootropic mushroom it’s important to keep in mind that

<!-- chunk -->

### for you to get it’s nootropic benefit it needs to be 100% mushroom

<!-- chunk -->

### (fruiting body), with verified levels of beta-glucans, zero fillers, and

<!-- chunk -->

### preferably certified organic.


# Melatonin

<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin is known for helping insomnia, is a powerful antioxidant and

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-inflammatory, protects against neurodegenerative diseases, stroke and

<!-- chunk -->

### brain trauma

<!-- chunk -->

## Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone produced in

<!-- chunk -->

## your pineal gland. Melatonin is often referred to as the “sleep hormone”.

<!-- chunk -->

### As your body’s central clock, melatonin tells your body, brain and organs

<!-- chunk -->

### when to be active and when to take a break and rest.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your pineal gland is a pea-sized organ located in the center of your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### and shaped like a tiny pine cone (hence its name).

<!-- chunk -->

### Your pineal gland is filled with cells that respond to light and darkness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many Eastern traditions refer to the pineal gland as the “third eye” for this

<!-- chunk -->

### reason.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your pineal gland acts as your body’s central clock through its secretion of

<!-- chunk -->

### melatonin. Telling your brain, body, and organs when it’s time to be active

<!-- chunk -->

### and when it’s time to rest. This is the reason why melatonin is referred to

<!-- chunk -->

### as the “sleep hormone”.

<!-- chunk -->

## Melatonin and the neurotransmitter serotonin are both derived from the

<!-- chunk -->

## amino acid L-tryptophan. First L-tryptophan is hydroxylated by the

<!-- chunk -->

### enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase. The intermediate is decarboxylated by

<!-- chunk -->

### PLP and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HTP) to produce serotonin (5-HT or

<!-- chunk -->

### 5-hydroxytryptamine).

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin acts as a neurotransmitter on its own. But is also converted into

<!-- chunk -->

### N-acetyl-serotonin by the enzymes serotonin N-acetyl transferase and

<!-- chunk -->

## Acetyl-CoA. Hydroxyindole O-methyl transferase and SAMe convert N-

<!-- chunk -->

## acetyl-serotonin into melatonin through methylation of the hydroxyl

<!-- chunk -->

### group.525

<!-- chunk -->

### This process is first fueled by the tryptophan you get from foods like

<!-- chunk -->

### turkey, chicken, tuna, oats, bananas, peanuts, and chocolate. Or from a L-

<!-- chunk -->

### tryptophan supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can also supplement with 5-HTP to produce serotonin which will

<!-- chunk -->

### create melatonin. Or supplement with SAMe to produce melatonin. Or you

<!-- chunk -->

### can take a melatonin supplement on its own and bypass this entire process.

<!-- chunk -->

### Besides acting as your body’s biological clock, melatonin is also a potent

<!-- chunk -->

## free-radical scavenger. And a wide-spectrum antioxidant. The beauty of

<!-- chunk -->

### melatonin as an antioxidant is its ability to easily cross the blood-brain

<!-- chunk -->

### barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Age-related decline in melatonin levels is a primary contributing factor to

<!-- chunk -->

### several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s,

<!-- chunk -->

### ALS, Huntington’s Disease, stroke, and brain trauma.526

<!-- chunk -->

### Adding melatonin to your nootropic stack gives you a head-start in

<!-- chunk -->

### protecting yourself against Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### decreases your chance of stroke, and helps reverse the brain damage

<!-- chunk -->

### caused by stroke or brain injury.

<!-- chunk -->

### The bonus is a good night’s sleep and feeling refreshed the next day. With

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain firing on all cylinders.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Melatonin work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin helps brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Melatonin promotes quality sleep. Your pineal gland acts as your

<!-- chunk -->

### body’s central clock by secreting melatonin. This action tells your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain and other organs when it’s time to be active, and when it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### time to rest. Melatonin helps regulate other hormones and maintains

<!-- chunk -->

### your body’s circadian rhythm.527

<!-- chunk -->

### Your pineal gland responds to darkness by producing melatonin. Blood

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of melatonin are low during the day, with peak levels occurring

<!-- chunk -->

### from 2 – 4 AM.528

<!-- chunk -->

### One study at Duke University Hospital surveyed clinical trials from

<!-- chunk -->

### – 2009. Researchers found that children with ADHD using melatonin

<!-- chunk -->

### doses of 3 – 6 mg showed improvement in how fast the kids went to sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### And significantly better quality of sleep.529

<!-- chunk -->

### Another extensive survey of clinical trials was conducted by the U.S.

<!-- chunk -->

### Department of Health and Human Services on melatonin use for sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### The overall conclusion of this research showed melatonin effective in

<!-- chunk -->

### improving quality of sleep and how fast a person went to sleep. This study

<!-- chunk -->

### included those who did not suffer with insomnia, those who did, and others

<!-- chunk -->

### who had messed up circadian rhythm patterns due to shift work and jet

<!-- chunk -->

### lag.530

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Melatonin prevents neurodegenerative disease. Melatonin

<!-- chunk -->

### improves longevity by increasing the longevity gene called SIRT1.

<!-- chunk -->

### This gene plays an important role in maintaining metabolism and

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroplasticity.531

<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin is a powerful antioxidant protecting your brain from free

<!-- chunk -->

### radicals and oxidative damage. It stimulates gene expression of

<!-- chunk -->

### intracellular antioxidant systems. And melatonin helps relieve the free

<!-- chunk -->

### radical damage that occurs after traumatic brain injury or stroke.532

<!-- chunk -->

### Research has found that melatonin levels and Alzheimer’s Disease are

<!-- chunk -->

### closely linked. Greatly reduced melatonin levels have been found in

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s patients.533

<!-- chunk -->

### High levels of melatonin are maintained throughout your youth and

<!-- chunk -->

### middle age. But as you age and melatonin levels drop, you are at greater

<!-- chunk -->

### risk for brain damage both now and in the future. Your chances of having a

<!-- chunk -->

### stroke greatly increase as melatonin levels decline.534


<!-- chunk -->

### Low Melatonin levels are associated with a variety of health problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Much more than just insomnia.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Insomnia, restlessness and poor sleep quality (sundowning)

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Circadian rhythm goes out of sync

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Agitation and activity increases later in the day (sundowning)

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Benzodiazepines like Valium® and Xanax® suppress melatonin levels535

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Stroke risk increases

<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin deficiency is one of the earliest indicators of Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### Disease.536 Abnormal oxidation and inflammatory protein accumulation

<!-- chunk -->

### can lead to Parkinson’s Disease. And is associated with low levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### melatonin in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Low levels of melatonin lead to increased free radical production and risk

<!-- chunk -->

### of stroke goes up. Oxidative damage to brain cells is a leading culprit in

<!-- chunk -->

### traumatic brain injury.

<!-- chunk -->

## Melatonin benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin is both a neurotransmitter and hormone. This ‘neurohormone’

<!-- chunk -->

### is produced in your pineal gland from the neurotransmitter serotonin with

<!-- chunk -->

### the assistance of SAMe and other enzymes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin is the mechanism used by your pineal gland to function as your

<!-- chunk -->

### body’s biological “clock”. And is in charge of the “circadian rhythm” that

<!-- chunk -->

### tells your system when to be active, and when to rest.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic supplement and sleep aid, melatonin exerts its effects by

<!-- chunk -->

### acting as a ‘phase re-setter’ rather than as a hypnotic-type drug.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with inexpensive melatonin helps restore your body’s

<!-- chunk -->

### natural antioxidant protection. Guarding against age-related changes in


<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin protects cholinergic neurons from the amyloid and tau protein

<!-- chunk -->

### buildups related to Alzheimer’s Disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin offers potent antioxidant protection for your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with melatonin helps protect your brain against

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative disease, reduces stroke risk and guards against brain

<!-- chunk -->

### trauma.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Melatonin feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### I use melatonin every night to help me sleep. I open and empty 3 mg of a

<!-- chunk -->

### Now Foods 5 mg melatonin capsule in about 4 oz. of tart cherry juice. And

<!-- chunk -->

### take it 90 minutes before bedtime. Sleep comes on within 5 minutes of

<!-- chunk -->

### hitting the pillow. And I sleep through the night.

<!-- chunk -->

### But melatonin as a sleep aid has mixed reviews among neurohackers. And

<!-- chunk -->

### for good reason. Melatonin is a hormone that your body naturally produces

<!-- chunk -->

### from serotonin. Too much melatonin is not good.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some find that supplementing with melatonin works well, and others find

<!-- chunk -->

### it disrupts sleep patterns. If you are perfectly healthy and do not deal with

<!-- chunk -->

### insomnia on a regular basis, you don’t need to supplement with melatonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Everyone’s body chemistry is unique. Some find that a ½ mg of melatonin

<!-- chunk -->

### works well. And others require 5 mg. Experimentation is key with this

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some have found that melatonin helps regulate disrupted circadian

<!-- chunk -->

### rhythms caused by jet lag or night shift work.


<!-- chunk -->

## Melatonin Lowers Cholesterol

<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin levels decrease as we age, and the possibility of heart disease

<!-- chunk -->

### increases. And studies in the last 10 years show that melatonin and your

<!-- chunk -->

### cardiovascular system are linked. Patients with cardiovascular disease

<!-- chunk -->

### have decreased melatonin levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies also show that people with heart disease have high levels of LDL-

<!-- chunk -->

### cholesterol. Research has found that supplemental melatonin decreases

<!-- chunk -->

### cholesterol by 38%. And reduces LDL accumulation by 42%.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study demonstrated that just 1 mg of melatonin reduced blood

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure within 90 minutes of supplementation. Melatonin reduces blood

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure through its antioxidant properties, by decreasing norepinephrine

<!-- chunk -->

### and epinephrine, and relaxing the smooth muscle of the heart aorta wall.537

<!-- chunk -->

## Melatonin Helps Reduce Insomnia

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show that sleep disorders affect 50 – 70 million Americans, or

<!-- chunk -->

### about 20% of the population. A sleep disorder exists whenever a lower

<!-- chunk -->

### quality of sleep results in impaired functioning, or excessive sleepiness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder affecting 6 – 12% of the

<!-- chunk -->

### adult population.

<!-- chunk -->

### A double-blind placebo-controlled study in France worked with 244 adults

<!-- chunk -->

### with primary insomnia. Patients received prolonged-release melatonin

<!-- chunk -->

### nightly for up to 12 months of the trial, followed by a 2-week withdrawal

<!-- chunk -->

### period.

<!-- chunk -->

### Outcome was measured based on the patient’s sleep diary, adverse events,

<!-- chunk -->

### vital signs and lab tests recorded at each visit. The study concluded that

<!-- chunk -->

## prolonged-release melatonin was helpful in relieving insomnia during the

<!-- chunk -->

### trial. And patients did not experience any adverse events or withdrawal

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms when they stopped using melatonin.538

<!-- chunk -->

## Melatonin Relieves Mild Cognitive Impairment

<!-- chunk -->

### Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often the final step before dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Approximately 12% of MCI patients convert to Alzheimer’s Disease or

<!-- chunk -->

### other dementia disorders every year.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Argentina took a look at the first and final assessment of

<!-- chunk -->

### MCI patients, 25 of whom had received a daily dose of 3-9 mg of

<!-- chunk -->

### melatonin at bedtime for 9 – 18 months.

<!-- chunk -->

### Patients who took melatonin showed significantly better performance in

<!-- chunk -->

### the mini Mental State examination and the cognitive test used to assess

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s. The team conducted several other tests and found better

<!-- chunk -->

### performance in every test but one.

<!-- chunk -->

## The researchers concluded that melatonin can be a useful drug for

<!-- chunk -->

## treating mild cognitive impairment.539

<!-- chunk -->

## Melatonin Replaces Benzos for Sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### Many people use benzodiazepines for sleep. Drugs like Xanax®, Valium®

<!-- chunk -->

### and Ativan® all have nasty side effects. And studies going back 25 years

<!-- chunk -->

### show benzos depress natural melatonin levels.540

<!-- chunk -->

### This is a problem because drugs taken for sleep are depleting the very

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone your body uses for sleep. To make matters worse, regular

<!-- chunk -->

### benzodiazepine use is now recognized as putting you at greater risk for

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia.541

<!-- chunk -->

### This study done in Argentine had subjects use fast release melatonin 3 –

<!-- chunk -->

### mg daily for 3 years just before bedtime. And it significantly improved

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive and emotional performance. Including the daily sleep-awake

<!-- chunk -->

### cycles of patients.

<!-- chunk -->

### A follow up study was done with 91 MCI patients. 61 patients received 3 –

<!-- chunk -->

### 24 mg of fast release melatonin at bedtime for 15 to 60 months. Patients

<!-- chunk -->

### given melatonin showed significantly better cognitive performance and

<!-- chunk -->

### every other parameter tested.

<!-- chunk -->

### Depression scores in the patients also decreased. And showed an

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement in quality of sleep and wakefulness. Before the study began,

<!-- chunk -->

### 62.8% of the patients were using benzodiazepines to help them sleep. At

<!-- chunk -->

### the conclusion of the study only 9.8% were using benzos to help them

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep along with melatonin.542

<!-- chunk -->

### My recommendation is if you are using one of these drugs for sleep, it

<!-- chunk -->

### would be wise to start using melatonin instead. And start weaning yourself

<!-- chunk -->

### off the benzos.


<!-- chunk -->

### Unlike all the other nootropics we talk about on Nootropics Expert, and in

<!-- chunk -->

### this book, there is no recommended dosage for melatonin

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation. Everyone has different responses to its effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lower doses like ½ mg of melatonin work well for some who are

<!-- chunk -->

### especially sensitive. And higher doses can cause anxiety and irritability.

<!-- chunk -->

### The best approach is to start with very low doses of melatonin (i.e. ½ mg)

<!-- chunk -->

### and see how your body reacts.

<!-- chunk -->

### The right dose should produce a restful night’s sleep with no irritability or

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue the next day.

<!-- chunk -->

### For jet lag: ½ - 5 mg of melatonin an hour before bedtime at your final

<!-- chunk -->

### destination.


<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin is considered very safe when taken in normal recommended

<!-- chunk -->

### low doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some may experience nightmares or vivid dreams when supplementing

<!-- chunk -->

### with melatonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin can cause drowsiness if taken during the day. And if you

<!-- chunk -->

### experience a “sleep hangover” the next day, you took too much melatonin

<!-- chunk -->

### the night before.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other side effects include abdominal cramps, dizziness, headache,

<!-- chunk -->

### irritability, decreased libido, breast enlargement in men and reduced

<!-- chunk -->

### sperm count.

<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin can interfere with fertility if you’re trying to get pregnant. Do

<!-- chunk -->

### not use melatonin while you’re pregnant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin can worsen symptoms of depression. So if you’re dealing with

<!-- chunk -->

### depression or are using antidepressant medications you should avoid

<!-- chunk -->

### melatonin.

<!-- chunk -->

## Remember that melatonin is a hormone. So if you have hormone-related

<!-- chunk -->

### issues you must be careful about using melatonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin may increase the risk of bleeding and should be avoided if

<!-- chunk -->

### you’re taking anticoagulant medications. Or are anticipating surgery.

<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin can interfere with steroids and immunosuppressant medications

<!-- chunk -->

### and cause them to lose their effectiveness.


<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin is available in capsules, tablets, and liquid. Capsules and tablets

<!-- chunk -->

### usually range from 1 – 5 mg.


<!-- chunk -->

## Melatonin 1 – 3 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using melatonin as a nootropic supplement. But see my

<!-- chunk -->

### review above on how melatonin supplements vary and how melatonin

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement labels can be misleading.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does make melatonin on its own from serotonin in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most healthy people have an adequate supply of melatonin. But if you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### dealing with insomnia and need some extra help in getting to sleep and

<!-- chunk -->

### staying asleep, melatonin can help.

<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin easily crosses the blood-brain barrier, and takes effect in about

<!-- chunk -->

### 90 minutes. Avoid taking melatonin immediately before bed because you

<!-- chunk -->

### may have trouble falling asleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin is especially helpful to those dealing with jet lag or shift work

<!-- chunk -->

### that has you working nights. Disrupted natural circadian rhythms can be

<!-- chunk -->

### normalized by supplementing with melatonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest first trying a melatonin supplement at a dose of ½ - 1 mg taken

<!-- chunk -->

### 90 minutes before bedtime. And see how you feel. If you readily fall and

<!-- chunk -->

### stay asleep until morning you know you’ve got the dose right.

<!-- chunk -->

### Then adjust your dose up or down depending on how you react. Most

<!-- chunk -->

### people don’t need more than 0.5 – 5 mg per night.


# Methylene Blue

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue boosts mitochondrial energy, is anti-aging, and improves

<!-- chunk -->

### mood and memory

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylene Blue (methylthioninium chloride) is a synthetic compound

<!-- chunk -->

### used as a nootropic to increase memory, mood, and longevity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Soon after Methylene Blue was synthesized as a textile dye in the late

<!-- chunk -->

### 1800’s, it became the first synthetic drug to be used in humans for the

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment of malaria

<!-- chunk -->

### In the early 20th century, psychiatrists were using Methylene Blue in the

<!-- chunk -->

### experimental treatment of schizophrenia.543

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue is currently being studied as potential therapy for mild

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, and other

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative disorders. All sharing a common problem with

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain’s neurons rely almost entirely on mitochondria-derived energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Failure of mitochondrial function can affect the rest of your body. But it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### particularly detrimental to your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is where Methylene Blue steps in as possibly one of the most

<!-- chunk -->

### important anti-aging and neurological disease preventing nootropics, we

<!-- chunk -->

### have available today.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, Methylene Blue quickly crosses the blood-brain barrier. It

<!-- chunk -->

### improves mitochondrial efficiency and respiration, acts as an antioxidant,

<!-- chunk -->

### and increases brain cell lifespan. Resulting in improved memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here we’ll dive into over 140 years of research on how Methylene Blue

<!-- chunk -->

### helps your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylene Blue was first synthesized in 1876 by German chemist Heinrich

<!-- chunk -->

### Caro at BASF as an aniline-based dye for cotton staining.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 1891, German physician and Noble Prize recipient Paul Ehrlich

<!-- chunk -->

### pioneered the use of Methylene Blue in the treatment of malaria.544

<!-- chunk -->

### Ehrlich discovered that when MB was injected into animals in the lab, it

<!-- chunk -->

### would quickly concentrate in the brain. And had an uncanny ability to

<!-- chunk -->

### selectively target diseased tissues in the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### It was Ehrlich who coined the term “Magic Bullet” for this unique action

<!-- chunk -->

### displayed by Methylene Blue. A term still in use today.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue has since been used to treat dementia, cancer

<!-- chunk -->

### chemotherapy, malaria, methemoglobinemia, urinary tract infections,

<!-- chunk -->

### cyanide, and carbon monoxide poisoning.545

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, Methylene Blue is used to enhance mitochondrial function,

<!-- chunk -->

### increase cerebral blood flow, and acts as an antidepressant.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Methylene Blue work in the brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Methylene Blue improves memory. Unlike other nootropics which

<!-- chunk -->

### often work by increasing neurotransmitter synthesis and neural

<!-- chunk -->

### signaling, MB improves memory by increasing brain cell

<!-- chunk -->

### respiration. Or how the brain cell utilizes oxygen.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show dramatic increases of cellular oxygen consumption and

<!-- chunk -->

### glucose uptake when using Methylene Blue. MB increases CMRO


<!-- chunk -->

### (cerebral metabolic rate) through increased activity in the mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### electron transport chain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue functions as an alternative electron carrier in the electron

<!-- chunk -->

## transport chain in mitochondria. It accepts electrons from NADH and

<!-- chunk -->

### transfers them to cytochrome c.546

<!-- chunk -->

### Cytochrome complex (cytochrome c) is a component of the electron

<!-- chunk -->

### transport chain in mitochondria. Playing a role in apoptosis and as an

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue also stimulates glucose metabolism. Taken together,

<!-- chunk -->

### increases in CMRO


<!-- chunk -->

### and glucose uptake means that MB elevates oxygen

<!-- chunk -->

### consumption which helps glucose increase ATP production.

<!-- chunk -->

### Increases in ATP production provides more cellular energy for better

<!-- chunk -->

### overall brain function including cognition, mood, and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Methylene Blue is an antioxidant. MB has a unique mechanism of

<!-- chunk -->

### action that is fundamentally different from traditional antioxidants.

<!-- chunk -->

### During cellular respiration, the first free radical formed inside a cell

<!-- chunk -->

### is superoxide (O


<!-- chunk -->

### ).

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue binds to superoxide and reduces it to water. It stops the

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidative cascade at its very beginning. Before it gets a chance to do

<!-- chunk -->

### damage.547

<!-- chunk -->

### So think of Methylene Blue as having a unique dual property. First, it

<!-- chunk -->

### increases cellular energy production which normally leads to oxidative

<!-- chunk -->

### stress. And second, it eliminates this oxidative stress. Making it a

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic enhancer and an antioxidant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers tested Methylene Blue in animal models of neurological

<!-- chunk -->

### disease. First, researchers used rotenone (a potent pesticide) which causes

<!-- chunk -->

### severe dopamine depletion in the part of the brain associated with


<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue rescued brain cell mitochondria from the damaging effects

<!-- chunk -->

### of this toxin. By donating electrons in the electron transport chain broken

<!-- chunk -->

### by rotenone. Essentially bypassing the broken transport chain with

<!-- chunk -->

### donated electrons as an alternative electron carrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue also countered cerebral ischemia reperfusion damage. The

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue damage caused when blood supply returns to tissue after a lack of

<!-- chunk -->

### oxygen. As can occur with Traumatic Brain Injury. MB accomplished this

<!-- chunk -->

### by rerouting mitochondrial electron transfer.

<!-- chunk -->

### This means that Methylene Blue dramatically countered the behavioral,

<!-- chunk -->

### neurochemical, and neuropathological impairment found in Parkinson’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease.548


<!-- chunk -->

### As we live life, our brain chemistry and metabolism changes.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Mitochondrial energy levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Attention, memory and mental agility decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Tau proteins and amyloid plaques clog the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Free radicals damage brain cell mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Cerebral blood flow declines


<!-- chunk -->

### So Methylene Blue can help for age-related cognitive decline, as well as a

<!-- chunk -->

### student looking to do better in school. By boosting brain cell mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### energy levels. And improving cerebral blood flow.

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylene Blue benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Low dose Methylene Blue supplementation provides memory enhancing

<!-- chunk -->

### effects in animals and humans. It works as an antidepressant, is anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### aging, helps dementia, Huntington’s, and Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue increases low blood pressure, improves cognition in

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy people, boosts mitochondrial function, is anti-microbial, can

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminate fear, and even slow skin aging.

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylene Blue boosts acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows that Methylene Blue is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor

<!-- chunk -->

### with a preference for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Meaning MB

<!-- chunk -->

### prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine and making more available in

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain.549

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylene Blue is an antidepressant

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). It inhibits

<!-- chunk -->

### MAO-A more than MAO-B but inhibits both at large doses.550

<!-- chunk -->

### One study in 1987 showed that 15 mg per day of Methylene Blue was a

<!-- chunk -->

### potent antidepressant in those with severe depression.551

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study with 31 bipolar disorder patients compared 300 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### of Methylene Blue with 15 mg per day. The patients were also on lithium

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study showed that the 300 mg dose of Methylene Blue was a “useful

<!-- chunk -->

### addition to lithium in the long-term treatment of manic-depressive

<!-- chunk -->

### psychosis”. And patients were significantly less depressed.552

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylene Blue resists Alzheimer’s Disease

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia are associated with a

<!-- chunk -->

### buildup of the protein Tau. Clinical trials show that Methylene Blue

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibits Tau formation. And is under consideration as a treatment for

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s.553

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue has an inhibitory action on the cGMP pathway, and affects

<!-- chunk -->

### other molecular events closely related to the progression of Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue boosts neuron resistance to the formation of amyloid

<!-- chunk -->

### plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. And helps repair impairments in

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research also shows that cholinergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic

<!-- chunk -->

### systems all play important roles in the development of Alzheimer’s and

<!-- chunk -->

### other cognitive disorders. Methylene Blue provides beneficial effects in

<!-- chunk -->

### mediating these pathways.554

<!-- chunk -->

### This is particularly significant because most existing treatments for

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s can only prevent the disease before it is diagnosed. But

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue shows promise in delaying the effects of Alzheimer’s and

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia after it is diagnosed.

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylene Blue is anti-aging

<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows that Methylene Blue is an effective anti-aging nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

## MB increases mitochondrial complex IV by 30%, enhances cellular

<!-- chunk -->

## oxygen consumption by 37-70%, increases heme synthesis, and reverses

<!-- chunk -->

## premature senescence caused by H


<!-- chunk -->

### O


<!-- chunk -->

### or cadmium.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue is considered a redox agent. Meaning it cycles between

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidized and reduced forms. This cycling by MB helps block oxidant

<!-- chunk -->

### production in brain cell mitochondria.555

<!-- chunk -->

## Mitochondrial complex IV is the last enzyme in the respiratory electron

<!-- chunk -->

### transport chain of mitochondria. The last step in synthesizing ATP. Your

<!-- chunk -->

### cellular and mitochondrial source of energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Iron (heme) is an essential element and participates in oxygen transport,

<!-- chunk -->

## DNA synthesis and electron transport. Heme synthesis begins in

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. Every cell requires heme to function properly.556

<!-- chunk -->

### Senescence or biological aging is the gradual deterioration of cellular

<!-- chunk -->

### function. And is caused by telomere shortening that triggers DNA damage

<!-- chunk -->

### in response to reactive oxygen species, hydrogen peroxide (H


<!-- chunk -->

### O


<!-- chunk -->

### ),

<!-- chunk -->

## cadmium and other toxins. Methylene Blue helps prevent premature

<!-- chunk -->

## senescence or premature cell death.

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylene Blue improves memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Animal studies have shown that a single low dose of Methylene Blue

<!-- chunk -->

### enhances long-term contextual memory. This type of memory is the

<!-- chunk -->

### conscious recall of the source and circumstances of a specific memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other studies show that Methylene Blue in low doses taken after the event

<!-- chunk -->

### helps memory retention of the event. A study done with rats revealed why

<!-- chunk -->

### this works.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, rats received 1 mg/kg of MB post-training for 3 days. The

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers then measured cytochrome c oxidation in participants brains.

<!-- chunk -->

### The idea was to determine if an increase in metabolic energy was behind

<!-- chunk -->

### the memory enhancing qualities of MB.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study found that in the Methylene Blue treated group, brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cytochrome oxidase activity was 70% higher than in the placebo-treated

<!-- chunk -->

### group.

<!-- chunk -->

### The findings suggest that repeated post-training supplementation of

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue improves memory consolidation. And this memory boost is

<!-- chunk -->

### due to the increased metabolic capacity in brain regions that require more

<!-- chunk -->

### energy during discrimination learning.557

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Methylene Blue feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue as a nootropic will likely feel different than any other

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement you’ve ever tried.

<!-- chunk -->

### When reading or studying, once you’re done, you should feel like you

<!-- chunk -->

### fully understand the subject material. And you’ll be able to use what you

<!-- chunk -->

### learned in the future.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue seems to facilitate a full understanding of something on

<!-- chunk -->

### the first try.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers report the biggest nootropic effect they experience

<!-- chunk -->

### with Methylene Blue is “after the fact learning”. You take in the

<!-- chunk -->

### information. And it’s like your brain sorts through the material. Then

<!-- chunk -->

### stores it in a form you can easily access later.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue has this uncanny ability to rewire your brain to forget

<!-- chunk -->

### about any negative associations you have of a situation. And only retains

<!-- chunk -->

### the positive aspects of that memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some report that Methylene Blue makes you “feel young again”. It

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminates social anxiety. You’ll feel focused and more confident.

<!-- chunk -->

### Workouts seem easier because you have more energy. Your mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### are energized. And you may find that recovery from workouts is easier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue helps eliminate stress. So you have more energy in any

<!-- chunk -->

### situation with a relaxed state of mind.

<!-- chunk -->

### And one recurring theme from many is improved sleep while using

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue.

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylene Blue Clinical Research

<!-- chunk -->

### Research into Methylene Blue for its therapeutic value goes back to the

<!-- chunk -->

### late 1800’s. But it’s only in the last couple of decades that scientists have

<!-- chunk -->

### been able to decode exactly how Methylene Blue works in the brain. All

<!-- chunk -->

### the way down to the molecular level in mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study in 2017 found that Alzheimer’s Disease could be caused by more

<!-- chunk -->

### than the accumulation of amyloid beta in the brain. The scientists looked

<!-- chunk -->

### into the two main components that produce energy in cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### 1.Glycolysis is the mechanism used to convert glucose into a useable

<!-- chunk -->

### form for adenosine triphosphate phosphate (ATP) production in

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.The production of ATP in mitochondria uses oxygen in a process

<!-- chunk -->

### called mitochondrial respiration.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found that as the brain ages, mitochondrial metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

### deteriorates. Resulting in a reduction in the molecules needed for energy

<!-- chunk -->

### production. And possibly the main culprit behind many neurological

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.558

<!-- chunk -->

### A study conducted at Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute may

<!-- chunk -->

### have found the solution to this mitochondrial energy problem in brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found that Methylene Blue can prevent or slow the decline

<!-- chunk -->

### of mitochondrial function.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the key aspects of Alzheimer’s is mitochondrial dysfunction.

<!-- chunk -->

### Specifically complex IV dysfunction. And this is where Methylene Blue

<!-- chunk -->

### steps in.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study found that Methylene Blue enhances complex IV in

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. It increases oxygen consumption. And it reverses premature

<!-- chunk -->

### cell death.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that Methylene Blue may be useful to delay

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction with aging and the decrease in complex IV in

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease.559

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylene Blue Improves Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### 26 healthy volunteers aged 22 – 62 participated in a double-blind,

<!-- chunk -->

### randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Purpose of the study was to

<!-- chunk -->

### measure the effects of Methylene Blue on working memory and sustained

<!-- chunk -->

### attention.

<!-- chunk -->

### Study results showed that a single low dose of Methylene Blue resulted in

<!-- chunk -->

### an increase in short-term memory ability. In an area of the brain associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with the senses and visual processing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Timothy Duong, Ph.D., the study author concluded Methylene Blue showed

<!-- chunk -->

### promise “in healthy aging, cognitive impairment, dementia and other

<!-- chunk -->

### conditions that might benefit from drug-induced memory enhancement”.560

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry tested fear

<!-- chunk -->

### extinction (elimination of fear) and contextual memory. Both are forms of

<!-- chunk -->

### long-term memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, participants received either Methylene Blue or a placebo

<!-- chunk -->

### after being placed in a small dark chamber for a couple of minutes to

<!-- chunk -->

### address their fear.

<!-- chunk -->

### One month later, participants that had used Methylene Blue had less

<!-- chunk -->

### retained fear than those given a placebo. The study authors concluded,

<!-- chunk -->

### “Methylene Blue enhances memory and the retention of fear extinction”.561

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylene Blue helps Bipolar Disorder

<!-- chunk -->

### Increasing evidence shows that bipolar disorder may be a progressive

<!-- chunk -->

### condition. Dealing with bipolar symptoms long-term results in

<!-- chunk -->

### deterioration of the cortex and less gray matter.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study at Dalhousie University in Halifax compared the effectiveness of

<!-- chunk -->

### lamotrigine (Lamictal®) along with daily supplementation of either

<!-- chunk -->

### mg or 15 mg of Methylene Blue in patients with bipolar disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Patients took a dose (Lamictal and either 195 mg or 15 mg of Methylene

<!-- chunk -->

### Blue) for three months. Then switched to the other dose for 3 months. The

<!-- chunk -->

### team found that bipolar participants had reduced depression and anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### when taking the higher dose of Methylene Blue compared to when they

<!-- chunk -->

### were on the lower dose.

<!-- chunk -->

### Several bipolar disorder patients in the study chose to continue using

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue after the study concluded.562

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylene Blue Recommended Dosage

<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended safe doses based on clinical studies with animals and

<!-- chunk -->

### humans ranges from 0.5 – 4 mg/kg. So a 90 kg (200 lb.) body weight

<!-- chunk -->

### translates to 45 – 360 mg of Methylene Blue.

<!-- chunk -->

### 45 mg of Methylene Blue is a safe starting dose. But 360 mg of MB is

<!-- chunk -->

### much too high in my opinion even if you’re 200 lbs.

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom line is there is no true recommended dose for Methylene Blue.

<!-- chunk -->

### My recommendation is start with the lowest dose of 0.5 mg/kg and see

<!-- chunk -->

### how you react.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue is water-soluble, so you don’t need to take it with a meal,

<!-- chunk -->

### or healthy fat like some nootropics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue has a half-life of about 5 hours. So you can dose twice a


<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue is famous for turning urine blue. But for most

<!-- chunk -->

### neurohackers, your urine will only stain blue at doses roughly exceeding

<!-- chunk -->

### 500 mcg. Some recommend preventing blue urine by mixing Methylene

<!-- chunk -->

### Blue with ascorbic acid for 3 hours before taking it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue is also available as a doctor-administered injection for

<!-- chunk -->

### therapeutic use. Typically used to treat diseases like malaria or with anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### cancer therapy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylene Blue Side Effects

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue shows a hormetic dose-response, with opposite effects at

<!-- chunk -->

### low and high doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### In other words, lower doses of Methylene Blue work well as a nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### But high doses do not because MB can potentially “steal” electrons away

<!-- chunk -->

### from the electron transport chain. Disrupting the redox balance and acting

<!-- chunk -->

### as a pro-oxidant (instead of an antioxidant).563

<!-- chunk -->

### Adverse effects of Methylene Blue also come from chemical impurity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even pharmaceutical (USP) grade Methylene Blue can contain impurities

<!-- chunk -->

### like arsenic, aluminum, cadmium, mercury, and lead.

<!-- chunk -->

### At low doses, these contaminants are not that big of a problem. But higher

<!-- chunk -->

### doses will result in the accumulation of these toxins in your cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects with Methylene Blue are rare when doses are under 2 mg/kg.

<!-- chunk -->

### But can include stomach pain, chest pain, dizziness, headache, sweating,

<!-- chunk -->

### confusion, high blood pressure, shortness of breath, accelerated heartbeat,

<!-- chunk -->

### tremor, skin turning blue, urine turning blue or green, reduction of red

<!-- chunk -->

### blood cells, or jaundice (only reported in infants).

<!-- chunk -->

### Monoamine Oxidase (MAOI) inhibition becomes a big problem at around

<!-- chunk -->

### 2 mg/kg of Methylene Blue. So if you are using antidepressants or

<!-- chunk -->

### antianxiety medications that affect serotonin, you should NOT use

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue.

<!-- chunk -->

### This includes SSRI’s and MAOI’s such as citalopram, escitalopram,

<!-- chunk -->

### fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, Zimelidine, bupropion,

<!-- chunk -->

### buspirone, clomipramine, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do not use Methylene Blue if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.

<!-- chunk -->

## Type of Methylene Blue to buy

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylene Blue is sold as a liquid, and in crystalline powder form.

<!-- chunk -->

### Industrial-grade and chemical-grade Methylene Blue is sold as a dye or

<!-- chunk -->

### stain. And can consist of more than 8% - 11% of various contaminants.

<!-- chunk -->

### And should NOT be used as a nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Only pharmaceutical (USP) grade Methylene Blue should be used as a

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic. Ask for a Certificate of Analysis which should include the

<!-- chunk -->

### amount of contaminants such as arsenic, aluminum, cadmium, mercury,

<!-- chunk -->

### and lead.


<!-- chunk -->

## Methylene Blue 0.5 – 4 mg/kg of body weight per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Methylene Blue as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does not make Methylene Blue on its own. So to get its benefits


<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue is especially helpful for those dealing with anxiety and


<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue is also particularly useful to students and executives who

<!-- chunk -->

### want to boost cognition, learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue is a fast-acting nootropic that can also help prevent brain

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial degeneration.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylene Blue donates electrons in the electron transport chain in your

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. So experienced neurohackers suggest avoiding CoQ-10 or

<!-- chunk -->

### idebenone when using MB because it seems to make Methylene Blue much

<!-- chunk -->

### less effective.

<!-- chunk -->

### Idebenone is an Alzheimer’s drug that has some nootropic benefit. But it

<!-- chunk -->

### works similar to Methylene Blue because it acts as a transporter in the

<!-- chunk -->

### electron transport chain of mitochondria. Competing with Methylene Blue.


# N-Acetyl L-Cysteine

<!-- chunk -->

### N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC) is a powerful antioxidant, can boost mood,

<!-- chunk -->

### lower anxiety, improve memory, and reduce compulsive behavior

<!-- chunk -->

## N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC or N-acetylcysteine) is the N-acetyl derivative

<!-- chunk -->

### of the naturally occurring amino acid L-cysteine. And works primarily by

<!-- chunk -->

## helping restore the body’s natural antioxidant glutathione (γ-

<!-- chunk -->

## glutamylcysteinylglycine; GSH).

<!-- chunk -->

### As the most abundant antioxidant in your body, GSH is responsible for

<!-- chunk -->

### maintaining oxidative balance in each of your cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taking glutathione as a nootropic supplement does not adequately restore

<!-- chunk -->

### GSH levels in your brain because it can’t cross the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### This vastly underrated nootropic, NAC easily penetrates the blood-brain

<!-- chunk -->

### barrier and raises glutathione levels in your brain.564

<!-- chunk -->

### NAC has been used to treat acetaminophen poisoning for decades.565 Every

<!-- chunk -->

### year there are 56,000 ER visits from Tylenol overdose, resulting in at least

<!-- chunk -->

### 100 deaths.566 NAC provides the glutathione your liver needs to fight off

<!-- chunk -->

### the metabolite NAPQI in Tylenol that does severe liver damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, NAC helps prevent glutamate toxicity, boosts dopamine,

<!-- chunk -->

### and reduces inflammation, oxidative and free radical damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Cysteine is naturally produced in your body using the amino acid

<!-- chunk -->

### methionine. You can also get L-Cysteine from eating ricotta and cottage

<!-- chunk -->

### cheese, yogurt, pork, chicken, turkey, duck, wheat germ, granola and oat

<!-- chunk -->

### flakes.

<!-- chunk -->

### But acute stress, illness, or a poor diet can deplete L-Cysteine levels in

<!-- chunk -->

### your body and brain. The quickest and most efficient way to boost levels

<!-- chunk -->

## of L-Cysteine is to supplement with N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC).

<!-- chunk -->

## NAC regulates the amount of glutamate in your brain. Glutamate is a

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter that is responsible for sending signals between neurons in

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain. This plays an important role in learning and forming memories.

<!-- chunk -->

### But too much glutamate can be toxic to brain cells. NAC regulates the

<!-- chunk -->

### amount of glutamate and keeps it at safe, healthy levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### NAC influences the amount of dopamine available in your brain. It works

<!-- chunk -->

### to keep dopamine receptors healthy and able to transmit and receive

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine. These neurotransmitters are crucial for cognitive energy and

<!-- chunk -->

### drive, motor control, feelings of pleasure, and focus.

<!-- chunk -->

## NAC is a precursor to the powerful anti-oxidant glutathione (GSH). GSH

<!-- chunk -->

### is a potent anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and free radical scavenger.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain is especially vulnerable to inflammation, free radical and

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidative damage. If left unchecked, inflammation, oxidation and free

<!-- chunk -->

### radicals can negatively affect cognition, long-term potentiation, memory

<!-- chunk -->

### and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, NAC can boost glutathione and dopamine levels in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. NAC is also used by medical professionals to treat serious cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe depression and

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does N-Acetyl L-Cysteine work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### N-Acetyl L-Cysteine boosts brain health and function in several ways. But


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.N-Acetyl L-Cysteine reduces oxidative stress. Oxidative stress

<!-- chunk -->

### results in free radical damage in brain cells. Leading to

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegeneration and ultimately Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and

<!-- chunk -->

### other age-related neuronal disorders. Proteins and DNA are injured,

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation, tissue damage and cellular apoptosis (cell death) are

<!-- chunk -->

### the result.

<!-- chunk -->

### And neurohackers are not immune to oxidative stress no matter what your

<!-- chunk -->

### age. Keep this in mind the next time you reach for a Diet Coke.

<!-- chunk -->

### Consumption of the artificial sweetener aspartame induces cortical

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation and oxidative stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers did a study with 30 adult male Wistar rats randomly divided

<!-- chunk -->

### into 3 groups. The control group received distilled water. The second

<!-- chunk -->

### group was given aspartame. And the third group was given aspartame and

<!-- chunk -->

### NAC. Oral administration was done in the morning daily for 90 days.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study found that NAC boosted Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor

<!-- chunk -->

### (BDNF) levels, blocked the COX-2 and PGE


<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory enzymes, and

<!-- chunk -->

### reduced the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α

<!-- chunk -->

### (TNF-α) inflammatory cytokines in the rat cerebral cortex. They also

<!-- chunk -->

### found that NAC replenished glutathione levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that NAC prevented neurotoxicity and improved

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological function, suppressed brain inflammation, and oxidative stress

<!-- chunk -->

### response.567

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.N-Acetyl L-Cysteine relieves depression. Major depressive

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder is one of the most common psychiatric disorders. It’s a

<!-- chunk -->

### burden on the individual, family, and the community. And the

<!-- chunk -->

### pharmaceutical companies are making literally billions on selling

<!-- chunk -->

### various anti-depressants. Not treating the cause, producing a host of

<!-- chunk -->

### side effects, and in most cases just ‘dumbing down’ the symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the pipeline for new anti-depressant drug discovery is at a near stand-

<!-- chunk -->

### still for treating problems like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression

<!-- chunk -->

### and common forms of autism.

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is that neuroscience continues to work on the problem. And

<!-- chunk -->

### have shown that many of these disorders share inflammation and oxidative

<!-- chunk -->

### stress as part of their disease physiology.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neuroscientists also discovered that associated pathways causing these

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases include a reduction in proteins that stimulate neuron growth

<!-- chunk -->

### (neurotrophins), increased apoptosis (cell death), and reduced energy

<!-- chunk -->

### generation in mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### It turns out that NAC seems to have multiple effects on all these pathways.

<!-- chunk -->

## NAC reduces the core symptoms of schizophrenia, reduces depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### and reduces cravings for a number of addictions including cocaine,

<!-- chunk -->

### cannabis and tobacco.568


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older or suffer from chronic illness, our brain and body

<!-- chunk -->

### chemistry and energy metabolism changes.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Oxidative stress in brain cells increase

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Free radicals damage neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Dopamine receptors stop working

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Glutamate toxicity causes cell damage and apoptosis

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Mitochondria energy declines

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes are often attributed to chronic illness, lifestyle

<!-- chunk -->

### choices, and aging.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unchecked, they could lead to neurodegenerative diseases like

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, major depression, schizophrenia, OCD,

<!-- chunk -->

### addictions, autism, and a drop in quality of life.

<!-- chunk -->

## N-Acetyl L-Cysteine benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC) is a slightly modified version of the sulfur-

<!-- chunk -->

### containing amino acid L-Cysteine. When taken as a supplement, NAC

<!-- chunk -->

### replenishes intracellular levels of the natural antioxidant glutathione

<!-- chunk -->

### (GSH). Restoring your cells’ ability to fight damage from reactive oxygen

<!-- chunk -->

### species (ROS).

<!-- chunk -->

### Conventional medicine has used NAC for decades as an inhaled mucous

<!-- chunk -->

### thinner to treat symptoms of cystic fibrosis. NAC is given intravenously

<!-- chunk -->

### (IV) or orally as a treatment for acute acetaminophen poisoning. NAC

<!-- chunk -->

### quickly restores glutathione levels, averting permanent disability or death.

<!-- chunk -->

### The nootropics community has recently discovered NAC as a way to

<!-- chunk -->

### suppress inflammation in the brain. NAC prevents oxidative stress on brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells, eliminates free radicals, restores Brain-Derived Neurotrophic

<!-- chunk -->

### Factor (BDNF), rejuvenates dopamine receptors, and improves overall

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive function.

<!-- chunk -->

### NAC can help boost cognition, Long-Term Potentiation for long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### memory formation, short-term and working memory, improve your mood

<!-- chunk -->

### and quell anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does N-Acetyl L-Cysteine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report that supplementing with NAC could be the best

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic they’ve ever used for their brain and overall health. Comments

<!-- chunk -->

### include:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Thinking is clearer (less brain fog)

<!-- chunk -->

### •Memory improves

<!-- chunk -->

### •Concentration and attention improves

<!-- chunk -->

### •Less anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### •Less depression

<!-- chunk -->

### •Less irritable

<!-- chunk -->

### •Mood improves (like a ‘clean high’)

<!-- chunk -->

### •Symptoms caused by ADHD meds disappear

<!-- chunk -->

### •Obsessive Compulsive behavior decreases

<!-- chunk -->

### •Sleep quality improves

<!-- chunk -->

### •Energy levels increase

<!-- chunk -->

## N-Acetyl L-Cysteine increases dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### Treatments for Parkinson’s Disease are limited to replacing dopamine in

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain. As well as some medications designed to slow down the disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 2016, researchers at Thomas Jefferson University showed the oxidative

<!-- chunk -->

### stress in the brain could play a critical role in the progression of

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s. And this stress lowers levels of glutathione, a compound

<!-- chunk -->

### produced in the brain to counteract oxidative stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show that N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC) helps reduce oxidative

<!-- chunk -->

### damage to neurons by helping restore the levels of the antioxidant

<!-- chunk -->

### glutathione.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, Parkinson’s patients were placed into two groups. The first

<!-- chunk -->

### group received 50 mg/kg NAC intravenously (IV) once per week. And

<!-- chunk -->

### mg of NAC as a supplement twice a day on non-IV days.

<!-- chunk -->

### The second control group received only their standard Parkinson’s

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment. Patients were evaluated at the beginning of the study and again

<!-- chunk -->

### 3 months later.

<!-- chunk -->

### The evaluation consisted of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale

<!-- chunk -->

### (UPDRS), and a SPECT brain scan which measures the amount of

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine transporter in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Compared to controls, the patients receiving NAC had significant

<!-- chunk -->

### improvements in their scores. One of the study authors said, “We have not

<!-- chunk -->

### previously seen an intervention for Parkinson’s disease have this kind of

<!-- chunk -->

### effect on the brain”. This study demonstrated for the first time the direct

<!-- chunk -->

### effect of NAC on the brain’s dopamine system. NAC has the unique ability

<!-- chunk -->

### to enable dopamine neurons to recover their function.569

<!-- chunk -->

## N-Acetyl L-Cysteine repairs Traumatic Brain Injury

<!-- chunk -->

### Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health issue affecting 1.7

<!-- chunk -->

## million Americans each year.570 TBI can be caused by sports injuries, work

<!-- chunk -->

### accidents, car and motorcycle accidents, falls, and your wife hitting you

<!-- chunk -->

### over the head with a frying pan.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many survivors end up with long-term or even permanent neurocognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction. Affecting cognition, motor function (movement) and

<!-- chunk -->

### personality. These disabilities are estimated to cost $9.2 billion in lifetime

<!-- chunk -->

### medical costs and $51.2 billion in productivity losses.571

<!-- chunk -->

### A major cause of TBI comes from blast exposure on the battlefield.

<!-- chunk -->

### Symptoms are similar to other causes of TBI; dizziness, hearing loss,

<!-- chunk -->

### headache, memory loss, sleep issues, and neurocognitive dysfunction.

<!-- chunk -->

### In a brain subjected to TBI there is glutamate toxicity, free-radical injury

<!-- chunk -->

### to brain cells, electrolyte imbalances, mitochondrial dysfunction,

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation, apoptosis (cell death) and stroke.572,

<!-- chunk -->

### This double blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted with 81 active

<!-- chunk -->

### duty service members at a forward deployed field hospital in Iraq. All

<!-- chunk -->

### service members in this study were exposed to significant ordinance blast

<!-- chunk -->

### and met the criteria for TBI.

<!-- chunk -->

### Service members were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or N-

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC) for 7 days. The resolution after 7 days of all the

<!-- chunk -->

### TBI symptoms listed above was the main outcome measure of this study.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that NAC was a safe pharmaceutical

<!-- chunk -->

### countermeasure of blast-induced TBI. And that further work on long term

<!-- chunk -->

### outcomes and the potential use of NAC in civilian TBI is warranted.574

<!-- chunk -->

## N-Acetyl L-Cysteine helps alleviate depression

<!-- chunk -->

### Both depression and bipolar disorder are complicated by glutathione

<!-- chunk -->

### depletion. The researchers in this double-blind, multicenter, placebo-

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled study worked with 75 subjects with bipolar disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Subjects received 1 gram of NAC twice daily for 24 weeks. NAC

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment caused a significant improvement with depression with those

<!-- chunk -->

### using NAC.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded, “NAC appears a safe and effective

<!-- chunk -->

### augmentation strategy for depressive symptoms”. In this case with people

<!-- chunk -->

### suffering from bipolar disorder.575


<!-- chunk -->

### N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC) suggested dosage for cognitive benefit is

<!-- chunk -->

### mg 3-times per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clinical studies have found that doses up to 2,000 mg per day are safe and

<!-- chunk -->

### effective.

<!-- chunk -->

### And one German study showed the safety of 2,800 mg per day for

<!-- chunk -->

### months in patients with cystic fibrosis.576

<!-- chunk -->

### NAC has also proven effective against seasonal influenza and flu-like

<!-- chunk -->

### illnesses. One large study of older adults in Italy took 600 mg of NAC

<!-- chunk -->

### twice daily for 6 months. Only 25% of those adults who used NAC

<!-- chunk -->

### experienced flu-like episodes compared to 79% in the placebo group.577


<!-- chunk -->

## N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC) is the N-acetyl form of the naturally occurring

<!-- chunk -->

### amino acid L-Cysteine. NAC is considered non-toxic and very safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### NAC is a slightly modified version of the sulfur-containing amino acid L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Cysteine. So NAC in powder form can have an unpleasant smell.

<!-- chunk -->

### Very rarely can NAC cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even more rare are rashes, fever, headache, drowsiness, low blood

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure and liver problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects can be a result of very high doses of NAC. And if you have a

<!-- chunk -->

### genetic condition called Cystinuria do not use NAC. This rare condition

<!-- chunk -->

### causes stones to form in the kidneys, ureter, and bladder from cysteine.

<!-- chunk -->

### NAC is the N-Acetyl form of Cysteine.


<!-- chunk -->

### N-Acetyl L-Cysteine is available in powder, tablet and capsule form. NAC

<!-- chunk -->

### capsules and tablets are usually 600 mg.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some supplement makers add other compounds to their formula. So

<!-- chunk -->

### ensure you read labels carefully. And stick with manufacturers who follow

<!-- chunk -->

### Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). And are GMP-Certified.


<!-- chunk -->

## N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC) 600 mg, 3-times per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I highly recommend using N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC) as a nootropic


<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does synthesize some L-Cysteine from methionine. And you

<!-- chunk -->

### can get L-Cysteine from foods such as dairy, poultry, pork, and some

<!-- chunk -->

### grains and nuts.

<!-- chunk -->

### But most of us don’t get enough N-Acetyl L-Cysteine from our diet. So

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation will help. And N-Acetyl L-Cysteine is a highly

<!-- chunk -->

### bioavailable form of L-Cysteine. So you should feel its effects faster.

<!-- chunk -->

### NAC is helpful for most neurohackers to improve mood, memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition, and concentration. And NAC helps alleviate brain fog, anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### and irritability.

<!-- chunk -->

### NAC is especially helpful to those dealing with Obsessive Compulsive

<!-- chunk -->

### Disorder (OCD). And stacked with ADHD meds, NAC helps alleviate

<!-- chunk -->

### some of the negative side effects associated with stimulants.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely use up to 1,800 mg of NAC per day. The usual dose for

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive improvement is 600 mg dosed 3 times throughout your day.


# N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine

<!-- chunk -->

### N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine (NALT) enhances working memory, executive

<!-- chunk -->

### function, creative flow states, stress reduction, better mood, anti-anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### and lessens symptoms of ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

## N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine (NALT or NAT) is a highly bio-available form of the

<!-- chunk -->

### amino acid L-Tyrosine. Your brain uses the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase to

<!-- chunk -->

### convert L-Tyrosine into L-DOPA. Decarboxylation of L-DOPA results in

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine.578

<!-- chunk -->

### “Tyrosine” is derived from the Greek word tyros, meaning cheese. It was

<!-- chunk -->

### first discovered by German chemist Justus von Liebig in 1846 in the

<!-- chunk -->

### protein casein from cheese.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine is considered a non-essential amino acid because it can be

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesized in your body from phenylalanine. Which is found in many

<!-- chunk -->

### high-protein foods such as poultry, fish, dairy, nuts, soy products, lima

<!-- chunk -->

### beans, avocados and bananas.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once converted into dopamine, the enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase

<!-- chunk -->

### converts it into the neurotransmitters norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and

<!-- chunk -->

### epinephrine (adrenaline). This triad of neurotransmitters are collectively

<!-- chunk -->

### referred to as “catecholamines”.

<!-- chunk -->

### N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine can be a highly effective nootropic for boosting

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive function. And is particularly helpful in maintaining cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### performance when you’re under practically any kind of stress. Particularly

<!-- chunk -->

### for musicians playing live music like I did for many years. NALT helps

<!-- chunk -->

### maintain optimal cognitive performance during music played above

<!-- chunk -->

### dB’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine works in synergy with stimulants like

<!-- chunk -->

### methylphenidate (i.e. Ritalin).579 Drugs like Ritalin work by blocking the

<!-- chunk -->

### reuptake of the neurotransmitters dopamine, and norepinephrine. And if

<!-- chunk -->

### there’s not enough dopamine available to do the job, Ritalin doesn’t work

<!-- chunk -->

### very well. NALT potentiates increases in extracellular dopamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### NALT also stimulates the production of thyroid hormones T


<!-- chunk -->

### (triiodothyronine) and T


<!-- chunk -->

### (thyroxine) which are crucial in maintaining

<!-- chunk -->

### both overall physical and cognitive health.

<!-- chunk -->

### NALT can boost libido, memory, focus, concentration, mood, offers anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### depressant effects, and improves executive function in those with ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### NALT enhances working memory and executive function in the prefrontal

<!-- chunk -->

### cortex. It helps with creative flow states, is fuel for inspiration, cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### flexibility, and the kind of “convergent thinking” you do in multiple choice

<!-- chunk -->

### exams.

<!-- chunk -->

## N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine (NALT) vs. L-Tyrosine: What’s the Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

### N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine (NALT) is the amino acid L-Tyrosine with an acetyl

<!-- chunk -->

### group added. When you take NALT as a supplement, it breaks down in

<!-- chunk -->

### your kidneys back into L-Tyrosine. So in theory, the two supplements offer

<!-- chunk -->

### the same benefits.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is some debate in the nootropics community on which is more

<!-- chunk -->

### effective; NALT or plain L-Tyrosine. NALT is a more soluble form of L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine so it should be more bioavailable to your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, some studies report that in some cases, a sizeable percentage of

<!-- chunk -->

### supplemental NALT is excreted in urine before it’s converted into L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine.580

<!-- chunk -->

### On a personal note, I haven’t had any issues using NALT as a source of L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine. It gives me a dopamine and adrenal boost you’d expect from

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with a dopamine precursor.

<!-- chunk -->

### When dealing with ADHD/ADD it’s particularly effective when stacked

<!-- chunk -->

### with ALCAR (Acetyl-L-Carnitine). ALCAR easily crosses the blood-brain

<!-- chunk -->

### barrier for boosting acetylcholine levels. And seems to positively

<!-- chunk -->

### influence serotonin levels. And NALT provides my brain with the

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine it needs to mitigate symptoms of ADHD/ADD.

<!-- chunk -->

### But in the interests of full transparency, I stack this with 20 mg of Ritalin

<!-- chunk -->

### twice a day. Clearly, my brain doesn’t have the capacity to produce enough

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine on its own. And needs the boost that comes from supplementing

<!-- chunk -->

### with NALT.

<!-- chunk -->

### So like all nootropics, your mileage may vary. Always consider how each

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic works synergistically with others in your stack. And how they

<!-- chunk -->

### work with any meds you need to take.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is as much art as it is science. And experimentation is key for optimal

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition, and a ‘Limitless’ mindset.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine boosts brain health and function in several ways. But


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine improves memory and cognition under

<!-- chunk -->

## acute stress. Acute stress is defined as short-term stressors that can

<!-- chunk -->

### affect cognition. Examples are extreme heat or cold. Things like

<!-- chunk -->

### cold showers, extreme sports, car accidents, relationship problems,

<!-- chunk -->

### intense movies, business deals gone awry, exams and war zones.

<!-- chunk -->

### In one study done at the University of Bedfordshire in the UK, the effect of

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tyrosine on cognitive performance was measured before an exercise

<!-- chunk -->

### task.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers recruited 8 soccer players. And had them complete a 90-

<!-- chunk -->

### minute soccer simulation performance test in an environmental chamber

<!-- chunk -->

### set at 77 degrees Fahrenheit.

<!-- chunk -->

### The soccer players were given either L-Tyrosine before exercise or a

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo. Cognitive performance was measured before the exercise task.

<!-- chunk -->

### Then again at “half-time”, following half time, and following the entire

<!-- chunk -->

### simulation.

<!-- chunk -->

### The cognitive performance task assessed dual-task and vigilance. The

<!-- chunk -->

### outcome revealed that cognitive vigilance and reaction time among soccer

<!-- chunk -->

### players significantly improved following administration of L-Tyrosine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Results showed that in warm-weather conditions, L-Tyrosine could

<!-- chunk -->

### enhance cognitive function and prevent cognitive impairment during

<!-- chunk -->

### exposure to exercise-heat stress.581

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine boosts neurotransmitters. NALT turns into

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tyrosine once taken as a supplement. It then converts into the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is used to control movement

<!-- chunk -->

### in your body, is fundamental to memory, attention and problem

<!-- chunk -->

### solving.

<!-- chunk -->

### The unused dopamine can then convert into the neurotransmitters


<!-- chunk -->

### Norepinephrine is important for attentiveness, emotions, sleeping,

<!-- chunk -->

### dreaming, and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

### Epinephrine drives your ‘flight-or-flight’ response. It’s what prompts your

<!-- chunk -->

### reaction to dangerous circumstances, emergency situations, or in stressful

<!-- chunk -->

### situations or environments.

<!-- chunk -->

### In one study done in the Netherlands, researchers determined if L-Tyrosine

<!-- chunk -->

### could boost cognitive resources associated with cognitive control. They

<!-- chunk -->

### performed tests designed to measure “working memory” using the N-Back

<!-- chunk -->

### Test.

<!-- chunk -->

### Study participants were asked to engage in a “1-back” condition of easy

<!-- chunk -->

### difficulty and then a 2-back condition of tougher difficulty. Those that

<!-- chunk -->

### used L-Tyrosine demonstrated superior performance in the 2-back test, but

<!-- chunk -->

### not the 1-back test.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study authors suggested that L-Tyrosine provides greater cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### enhancement when cognitive demand increases. The bottom-line;

<!-- chunk -->

## supplementation of L-Tyrosine may help you increase your IQ score due to

<!-- chunk -->

### maximizing catecholamine reserves.582


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, our brain and body chemistry and energy metabolism


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Dopaminergic neurons are damaged or die


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Thyroid hormones decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Stress levels increase

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Working memory and mood decline

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes are often attributed to aging. But could be a result of

<!-- chunk -->

### dietary and lifestyle choices. Unchecked, they could lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s, a drop in quality of life and


<!-- chunk -->

## N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine (NALT) can boost levels of the neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine. And can help a sluggish

<!-- chunk -->

### thyroid produce more T


<!-- chunk -->

### NALT can help boost cognition especially in stressful situations. It helps

<!-- chunk -->

### improve decision making, ‘flow state’ and creativity, cognitive flexibility,

<!-- chunk -->

### and working memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### NALT converts into L-Tyrosine which then converts into L-DOPA to

<!-- chunk -->

### produce dopamine. L-DOPA is also used to make melanin in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### This conversion process helps in the removal of neurotoxic quinones. And

<!-- chunk -->

### chelates heavy metals like mercury and lead which can accumulate in and

<!-- chunk -->

### damage neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### The dopamine that is not used by your brain is available to produce

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine (noradrenaline) which is important for attentiveness,

<!-- chunk -->

### emotions, sleeping, dreaming and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

### NALT can be an effective nootropic when stacked with ADHD/ADD meds

<!-- chunk -->

### like Ritalin or Adderall. It helps supply extracellular dopamine needed to

<!-- chunk -->

### improve the effectiveness of stimulants used to boost the uptake of

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Keep in mind that NALT is a precursor to catecholamines. So if you’re not

<!-- chunk -->

### ‘low’ on dopamine, norepinephrine or epinephrine – you may not ‘feel’

<!-- chunk -->

### anything.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers report a lift in mood, better focus, concentration,

<!-- chunk -->

### increased energy, and an overall sense of well-being. NALT can help

<!-- chunk -->

### readjust your motivation levels. It can help lower anxiety levels,

<!-- chunk -->

### especially social anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine can help bring your blood

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure down if it’s elevated from a stressful situation or environment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Take it before the stressful event if you can.

<!-- chunk -->

### NALT helps buffer the effects of stimulants like caffeine or

<!-- chunk -->

### amphetamines. It helps potentiate and prolong the effects of Ritalin or

<!-- chunk -->

### Adderall, and reduces the crash.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re into athletics or do manual work, you’ll find that supplementing

<!-- chunk -->

### with NALT before a workout or construction job will leave you feeling

<!-- chunk -->

### great afterwards. It helps mitigate many of the effects of acute stress

<!-- chunk -->

### caused by short-term stressors.

<!-- chunk -->

### And NALT helps your body to produce melanin, so you may find it easier

<!-- chunk -->

### to get a tan while at the beach.


<!-- chunk -->

## N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine to treat ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### Several studies have investigated using L-Tyrosine for the treatment of

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD. One informal study published in the 1980’s determined that L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine resulted in short-term relief from ADHD symptoms. But subjects

<!-- chunk -->

### eventually reached tolerance and a diminished effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is important for neurohackers to keep in mind. It seems that NALT on

<!-- chunk -->

### its own can benefit some more than others. Whether you’re treating

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD, or are perfectly cognitively healthy.

<!-- chunk -->

### I’ve seen more than one report of nootropic users experiencing tolerance

<!-- chunk -->

### after just a week of supplementing with NALT. But most peer-reviewed,

<!-- chunk -->

### published studies show positive results.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study published in Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment in

<!-- chunk -->

### looked at using amino acid precursors for the treatment of ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### Including L-Tyrosine for dopamine, and 5-HTP for serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study used 85 young people aged 4 – 18 years old, all with a clinical

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosis of ADHD. They were treated for an initial period of 8 –

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks. Urinary samples to determine serotonin and dopamine levels were

<!-- chunk -->

### collected within the first 4 weeks. If they didn’t reach adequate levels,

<!-- chunk -->

### subjects were moved to higher dosing levels 2 and then 3 until they got

<!-- chunk -->

### relief from symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers found that the dopamine and serotonin precursors yielded

<!-- chunk -->

## similar results to Strattera and Ritalin. And “the amino acid protocol may

<!-- chunk -->

## be equal in efficacy to potent, pharmaceutical ADHD medications”.583

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Tyrosine reduces blood pressure under stress

<!-- chunk -->

### This study is particularly interesting for its nootropic application. It’s

<!-- chunk -->

### commonly understood that blood pressure rises when we’re under stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### The source of stress doesn’t really matter. Stress up = blood pressure up.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study in Amsterdam showed that L-Tyrosine administration decreased

<!-- chunk -->

### blood pressure about 15 minutes after ingestion. This study involved

<!-- chunk -->

### assessing task performance following acute stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## Acute stress is usually short-term and can be caused by driving, fighting,

<!-- chunk -->

### athletics, martial arts training, war, combat training, CrossFit, cold

<!-- chunk -->

### showers, loud music, intense movies, loud noises, business deals,

<!-- chunk -->

### relationships, school, exams and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### The point is, this study is applicable to every one of us. The study found

<!-- chunk -->

## that L-Tyrosine reduced diastolic blood pressure within 15 minutes of

<!-- chunk -->

### taking the supplement. And blood pressure normalized within 1 hour.

<!-- chunk -->

### This study tells us that L-Tyrosine (and NALT) may promote a decrease in

<!-- chunk -->

### blood pressure caused by stress. And could be used to mitigate the effects

<!-- chunk -->

### of stressful situations if taken prior to the stressful event.584

<!-- chunk -->

## N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine promotes cognitive flexibility

<!-- chunk -->

## Cognitive flexibility applies to those who can adjust their thinking quickly

<!-- chunk -->

### to adapt to novel situations and stimuli. A high degree of cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### flexibility is associated with increased fluid intelligence, superior reading

<!-- chunk -->

### and comprehension, and a healthier brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recent research (2015) supports the idea that L-Tyrosine (and NALT)

<!-- chunk -->

### promotes cognitive flexibility. In this trial, researchers recruited 22 adults.

<!-- chunk -->

### And setup a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

<!-- chunk -->

### All subjects were assigned a task switching procedure to measure their

<!-- chunk -->

### flexibility. The results showed that receiving L-Tyrosine supplements

<!-- chunk -->

### increased cognitive flexibility compared to the placebo group. The

<!-- chunk -->

## researchers determined that “L-Tyrosine can facilitate cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

## flexibility by repleting cognitive resources”.585

<!-- chunk -->

### The team observed that increased cognitive flexibility was likely due to a

<!-- chunk -->

### boost in dopamine concentrations. They noted that L-Tyrosine enhanced

<!-- chunk -->

### usage of various cognitive resources. And one way to increase your

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive flexibility would be to start supplementing with N-Acetyl L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine.

<!-- chunk -->

### It stands to reason that people who are close-minded, set it their ways, are

<!-- chunk -->

### resistant to change and can’t cope with unexpected stimuli or situations

<!-- chunk -->

### have “cognitive rigidity”. And it’s likely due to suboptimal dopamine


<!-- chunk -->

### N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine (NALT) suggested dosage for cognitive benefit is

<!-- chunk -->

### 350 – 500 mg twice per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### You may find your body responds to smaller doses. Or even more if your

<!-- chunk -->

### stacking it with stimulants like ADHD meds. Listen to your body and see

<!-- chunk -->

### how you react.


<!-- chunk -->

### NALT quickly turns into the non-essential amino acid L-Tyrosine once you

<!-- chunk -->

### take it. So is considered non-toxic and very safe. Most neurohackers don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### have any negative side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### At higher doses there are reports of stomach issues and migraines.

<!-- chunk -->

### Migraine problems usually happen to those who already suffer from

<!-- chunk -->

### migraines. This may be an indication that your neurotransmitter levels are

<!-- chunk -->

### already optimal, and you don’t need to supplement with NALT.

<!-- chunk -->

### NALT can increase your thyroid hormones. So if you’re hyperthyroid you

<!-- chunk -->

### shouldn’t use NALT.

<!-- chunk -->

### And if you’re taking MAO inhibitors (MAOI’s) like selegiline, Azilect,

<!-- chunk -->

### Marplan or Nardil you should not use NALT. MAOI’s work in your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### and effect neurotransmitters. So using NALT in combination with MAOI’s

<!-- chunk -->

### could throw off the delicate balance of neurotransmitters needed for

<!-- chunk -->

### optimal brain health and cognition.


<!-- chunk -->

### N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine is available in powder, capsule, and tablet form.

<!-- chunk -->

### Capsules and tablets are usually 300 – 500 mg.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some pre-made nootropic stacks and workout stacks also include NALT as

<!-- chunk -->

### part of their formula.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ensure you read labels carefully and stick with manufacturers who follow

<!-- chunk -->

### Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). And are GMP-Certified.


<!-- chunk -->

## N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine (NALT) 350 – 500 mg twice per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine (NALT) as a nootropic


<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does synthesize some L-Tyrosine from phenylalanine which

<!-- chunk -->

### comes from high-protein foods like chicken, fish, almonds, avocados and

<!-- chunk -->

### bananas.

<!-- chunk -->

### But most of us don’t get enough L-Tyrosine from our diet. So

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation will help. And N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine is a highly

<!-- chunk -->

### bioavailable form of L-Tyrosine. So you should feel its effects faster.

<!-- chunk -->

### NALT is helpful for most neurohackers to combat stress and sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### deprivation. It’ll boost dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s particularly helpful if you take NALT prior to a stressful situation,

<!-- chunk -->

### workout or physically demanding job.

<!-- chunk -->

### NALT is especially helpful to those dealing with ADHD/ADD. It’s a great

<!-- chunk -->

### compliment to stack with stimulant meds like Ritalin or Adderall. NALT

<!-- chunk -->

### will provide the dopamine your brain needs. It will help smooth out and

<!-- chunk -->

### prolong the effects of stimulant meds. And help prevent the associated

<!-- chunk -->

### crash when they wear off.

<!-- chunk -->

### A good stack for ADHD is using your usual med dose with NALT 500 mg,

<!-- chunk -->

### CDP-Choline 300 mg, and ALCAR 500 mg.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely use up to 1,500 mg per day when stacking with ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### meds. But dosed throughout your day.


# NADH

<!-- chunk -->

### NADH is known for increased alertness, clarity, focus, memory, enhanced

<!-- chunk -->

### mood and energy, and is a potent antioxidant and free radical scavenger

<!-- chunk -->

## NADH (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide + Hydrogen, or coenzyme 1)

<!-- chunk -->

### is the active coenzyme form of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (niacin). Discovered early in the

<!-- chunk -->

## 1900’s, it’s also known as Coenzyme 1. Every cell in your body contains

<!-- chunk -->

### NADH.

<!-- chunk -->

### NADH is the primary carrier of electrons in the transfer of food from your

<!-- chunk -->

## diet into energy. This energy is stored as adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

<!-- chunk -->

### ATP which is synthesized within mitochondria in each of your cells. Not

<!-- chunk -->

### enough NADH leads to ATP depletion, which can eventually lead to cell

<!-- chunk -->

### death.586

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have shown that supplementing with NADH improves cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### function, enhances cellular energy, increases endurance, switches ‘off’

<!-- chunk -->

### aging genes, and extends life span.

<!-- chunk -->

### You get small amounts of NADH by eating meat, poultry, and fish.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vegetables have very low concentrations of NADH. So vegetarians are

### typically low in NADH. And since NADH is very unstable, much of it is

<!-- chunk -->

### lost through cooking.

<!-- chunk -->

### When you supplement with NADH, cerebral electrical activity increases in

<!-- chunk -->

### areas of your brain used for attention, cognition, focus, memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration, and decision making.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does NADH work in the brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## NADH boosts brain health in several ways. But two in particular stand out.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1.NADH increases the production ATP. NADH carries the electrons

<!-- chunk -->

### needed for the synthesis of ATP. Your brain cell mitochondria create

<!-- chunk -->

### this fuel (ATP) for brain cells to function and stay healthy.

<!-- chunk -->

### By providing the means for ATP synthesis, NADH is involved in

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition, focus, concentration, memory, and processing speed.587 And

<!-- chunk -->

### NADH plays an important role in mediating brain aging and tissue

<!-- chunk -->

### damage. Even decreasing the damage done by strokes.588

<!-- chunk -->

### In one double-blind, placebo-controlled study researchers did a 3-month

<!-- chunk -->

### trial with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patients. 86 patients were chosen to

<!-- chunk -->

### receive either 20 mg of NADH daily or a placebo for the first 2-months.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mean age of the participants was 47 years.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study measured the intensity of fatigue, functional performance, mood

<!-- chunk -->

### state, functional impact of fatigue, quality of life, sleep quality, and

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise capacity. Each was measured prior to the study. And then at 30,

<!-- chunk -->

### and 90 days of treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study found that oral administration of NADH resulted in decreased

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety and maximum heart rate.589

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.NADH increases neurotransmitters. NADH is directly involved in

<!-- chunk -->

### the production of the critical neurotransmitters dopamine and

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dopamine is usually made inside the neurons that use it. The amino acid

<!-- chunk -->

### tyrosine is first converted to L-DOPA through the enzyme tyrosine

<!-- chunk -->

### hydroxylase. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows that tyrosine hydroxylase is the rate-limiting controller of

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine synthesis. This is seen in Parkinson’s patients where tyrosine

<!-- chunk -->

### hydroxylase is much lower than in healthy people.

<!-- chunk -->

### To complicate things even more, we need to understand what makes

<!-- chunk -->

### tyrosine hydroxylase work. The coenzyme that activates tyrosine

<!-- chunk -->

## hydroxylase is tetrahydrobiopterin (H4BP). And it’s NADH that activates

<!-- chunk -->

### this enzyme, and helps produce H4BP.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Austria conducted an open label trial with 885 Parkinson’s

<!-- chunk -->

### patients. The study was conducted to try a therapy that might increase the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain’s own dopamine production instead of directly giving the patents L-

<!-- chunk -->

### DOPA.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, 415 patients received intravenous (IV) NADH, and

<!-- chunk -->

### patients got an oral dose of NADH. Both groups showed overall good

<!-- chunk -->

### response to treatment including improvements in motor function, walking,

<!-- chunk -->

### pushing, posture, and speech. They also experienced improvements in

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found increased dopamine metabolites in the urine of the

<!-- chunk -->

## patients. Indicating that NADH induced an increase in dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

## production. Most of the Parkinson’s patients were able to reduce and even

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminate their other Parkinson medications.590


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, NADH levels decline. And no amount of healthy eating or

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise can stop this decline.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Dopamine and norepinephrine levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Intra-cellular genome communications break down

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Energy levels decline


<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases of aging, including Alzheimer’s and


<!-- chunk -->

### But even if things haven’t degenerated to such a debilitating level, NADH

<!-- chunk -->

### can help. In fact, it’s required for dopamine synthesis.

<!-- chunk -->

## NADH benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Research has shown that people with low NADH levels are far more

<!-- chunk -->

### vulnerable to addiction, disease, and other chronic conditions. Low NADH

<!-- chunk -->

### levels can happen at any age. Even at birth.

<!-- chunk -->

### In our Western society, NADH is lost in cooking and food processing. And

<!-- chunk -->

### what little remains is broken down by stomach acid and degraded before

<!-- chunk -->

### it’s absorbed in your digestive tract.

<!-- chunk -->

### When you take NADH as a supplement, your cells think oxygen levels are

<!-- chunk -->

### normal and start working as if they were younger, undamaged cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research from hundreds of studies have shown that NADH will:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boost energy levels and stamina

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reduce fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reduce the possibility of age-related diseases

<!-- chunk -->

### •Lower blood pressure

<!-- chunk -->

### •Provide protection and energy to your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boost cerebral blood flow

<!-- chunk -->

## How does NADH feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Using NADH as a nootropic can boost ATP synthesis in your brain. And

<!-- chunk -->

### increase the production of the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine

<!-- chunk -->

### and serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should experience a boost in mental and physical energy levels, a

<!-- chunk -->

### better mood, improved cognition and alertness.

<!-- chunk -->

### NADH even helps relieve symptoms related to jet lag. And has been

<!-- chunk -->

### shown to alleviate the symptoms of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome including

<!-- chunk -->

### less brain fog, improved mood and energy, and better cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### And neurohackers report more endurance during workouts and running.


<!-- chunk -->

## NADH helps reduce Jet Lag

<!-- chunk -->

### Current remedies for jet lag don’t work very well. Chronic commuters

<!-- chunk -->

### have resorted to melatonin, stimulants, sedatives, and phototherapy. And

<!-- chunk -->

### all have produced dismal results in recovering from jet lag.

<!-- chunk -->

### NASA investigated the efficacy of using NADH as a countermeasure for

<!-- chunk -->

### jet lag. NADH increases cellular production of ATP and facilitates

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine synthesis. So the thinking was NADH could counteract the

<!-- chunk -->

### effects of jet lag on cognitive function and sleepiness.

<!-- chunk -->

### 35 healthy frequent travelers were recruited in this double-blind, placebo-

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled study. Testing was conducted on the West Coast before subjects

<!-- chunk -->

### flew overnight to the East Coast.

<!-- chunk -->

### Subjects were given either 20 mg of sublingual NADH, or a placebo. All

<!-- chunk -->

### underwent testing to assess cognitive function, mood, and sleepiness in the

<!-- chunk -->

### morning and afternoon the day after the red-eye flight.

<!-- chunk -->

### Jet lag resulted in sleepiness for half the participants, and a third of them

<!-- chunk -->

### experienced deterioration of cognitive function. The morning following

<!-- chunk -->

### the flight, subjects experienced lapses of attention, disruptions to working

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, divided attention and visual perceptual speed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Those who received NADH performed significantly better on cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### and motor tests, showed better performance on other measures, and

<!-- chunk -->

### reported less sleepiness than those who took a placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### NASA concluded that, “Stabilized NADH significantly reduced jet lag-

<!-- chunk -->

### induced disruptions of cognitive functioning, was easily administered, and

<!-- chunk -->

### was found to have no adverse side effects”.591

<!-- chunk -->

## NADH regenerates stem cells in the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### Researcher Hongbo Zhang wanted to understand how the regeneration

<!-- chunk -->

### process deteriorated with age. So he teamed up with colleagues from ETH

<!-- chunk -->

### Zurich, the University of Zurich and universities in Canada and Brazil.

<!-- chunk -->

### Under normal conditions, stem cells react to signals sent by your body, and

<!-- chunk -->

### regenerate damaged organs by producing new specific cells. Fatigue in

<!-- chunk -->

### stem cells is one of the main causes of poor regeneration. Resulting in

<!-- chunk -->

### degeneration in tissues, organs and the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team set out to revitalize stem cells in the muscles of elderly

<!-- chunk -->

### mice. They gave nicotinamide riboside to 2-year-old mice (which is

<!-- chunk -->

### considered “old” for a mouse). Nicotinamide riboside is a precursor to

# NADH.

<!-- chunk -->

### The results showed muscular regeneration was much better in mice that

<!-- chunk -->

### received nicotinamide riboside. They lived longer than the mice that didn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### get it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Parallel studies have revealed a comparable effect on stem cells of the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain and skin. This work on the aging process has potential for treating

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases that can affect, and be fatal even in young people, with illnesses

<!-- chunk -->

### like muscular dystrophy.

<!-- chunk -->

### No negative side effects were observed in any of the studies following use

<!-- chunk -->

### of nicotinamide riboside, or stabilized NADH. It appears to boost the

<!-- chunk -->

### functioning of all cells. Including cells that have been damaged.592

<!-- chunk -->

## NADH decreases anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show that NADH may be low in those suffering chronic fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

### syndrome (CFS). So researchers in Spain set out to evaluate the efficacy of

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing NADH in those with CFS.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team recruited 86 CFS patients with a mean age of 47 years

<!-- chunk -->

### to take part in a 3-month double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The

<!-- chunk -->

### patients were given 20 mg of NADH or a placebo for 2 months.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team found that those using NADH experienced a significant decrease

<!-- chunk -->

### in anxiety symptoms. And maximum heart rate dropped.593

<!-- chunk -->

## NADH reduces symptoms of Chronic Fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) has baffled researchers and the medical

<!-- chunk -->

### community for years. Its cause is unknown, and it’s associated with a

<!-- chunk -->

### myriad of symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the main common denominator in all Chronic Fatigue cases is severe

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue. And no therapeutic regimen has proven effective for this

<!-- chunk -->

### condition.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, 31 patients fulfilling the criteria for CFS were selected to

<!-- chunk -->

### participate. They were given NADH or other nutritional supplements for

<!-- chunk -->

### 24 months.

<!-- chunk -->

### The 12 patients who received NADH had a dramatic and statistically

<!-- chunk -->

### significant reduction of chronic fatigue symptoms.594


<!-- chunk -->

### NADH is a coenzyme, antioxidant form of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (niacin). It’s a

<!-- chunk -->

### naturally occurring enzyme found in all living cells. And necessary for

<!-- chunk -->

### cellular ATP synthesis and energy production.

<!-- chunk -->

### NADH is available in tablet form as 5, 10 and 20 mg tablets. It’s faster-

<!-- chunk -->

### acting if you can find sublingual tablets.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re looking to boost dopamine, stack your NADH with N-Acetyl L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine (NALT). Because NADH converts tyrosine to dopamine.


<!-- chunk -->

### Your body naturally produces NADH. So it’s non-toxic and very well

<!-- chunk -->

### tolerated. NADH should not produce side effects.


<!-- chunk -->

### NADH is highly unstable and for it to remain effective needs to be in a

<!-- chunk -->

### stabilized form.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most neurohackers recommend the patented, stabilized form of NADH

<!-- chunk -->

### that’s made by a German company called ENADA. A couple of major

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement manufacturers license the ENADA brand of NADH. Check the

<!-- chunk -->

### label.


<!-- chunk -->

## NADH 10 mg per pay

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using NADH as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does make some NADH on its own. And from eating meat,

<!-- chunk -->

### poultry and fish. But studies have shown we don’t get an adequate supply

<!-- chunk -->

### of NADH from food sources because most of it is lost in cooking.

<!-- chunk -->

### NADH is particularly helpful for vegetarians because very little NADH is

<!-- chunk -->

### available from vegetables.

<!-- chunk -->

### NADH is especially helpful for those suffering Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest starting with a dose of 10 mg daily. And NADH is a great

<!-- chunk -->

### compliment to a stack with any nootropic. Do your best to find a stabilized

<!-- chunk -->

### form of NADH like the patented ENAND.

<!-- chunk -->

### For a more effective dopamine boost, stack your NADH with NALT.

<!-- chunk -->

### NADH converts tyrosine to dopamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### You need to provide your brain mitochondria with the tools they need to

<!-- chunk -->

### create ATP which is the energy each of your brain cells demand. Or

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons start to break down from the inside. Signs that your lacking

<!-- chunk -->

### adequate NADH is brain fog, slow thinking, fatigue and low endurance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some clinics in the USA and other countries are using NADH therapy as a

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment for addiction, anxiety, depression, chronic stress and post-

<!-- chunk -->

### traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

<!-- chunk -->

### Intravenous (IV) NADH has been used effectively since the 1960’s for

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxing patients from alcohol, opiates, tranquilizers, and stimulants.595


# Nefiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam has been shown to reduce apathy, improve cognition,

<!-- chunk -->

### learning, and long-term memory, reduce anxiety, depression and stress,

<!-- chunk -->

### boost nerve growth factor, and is neuroprotective

<!-- chunk -->

## Nefiracetam (DM-9384, N-(2, 6-dimethylphenyl)-2-(2-oxopyrrolidine-1-

<!-- chunk -->

## yl)-acetamide) is in the racetam-family of nootropic compounds. It is a

<!-- chunk -->

### fat-soluble nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam was developed by Daiichi Seiyaku in the 1990’s as a

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment for cerebrovascular disorders. In 1999, Nefiracetam was in

<!-- chunk -->

### phase II clinical trials in the USA for treatment of cognition problems as a

<!-- chunk -->

### consequence of stroke, and Alzheimer’s type dementia.596

<!-- chunk -->

### It is similar in structure to Piracetam with a phenyl group and two methyl

<!-- chunk -->

### groups added to the amine of Piracetam. Nefiracetam, like all racetam

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics, has a pyrrolidone nucleus at its core. The structure of

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam is similar to Aniracetam.

<!-- chunk -->

## And Nefiracetam is a cholinergic compound, meaning it affects

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine levels in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam is used as a prescription drug in Japan. And as a supplement

<!-- chunk -->

### in the United States.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the most recent synthetic nootropic compounds, it is known as a

<!-- chunk -->

## cognitive enhancer. And is known for its anxiolytic, or anti-anxiety


<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam is considered to be much more potent than Piracetam. As a

<!-- chunk -->

## nootropic, it helps increase attention span, alertness, cognition, learning

<!-- chunk -->

## and boosts memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nefiracetam vs. Piracetam: What’s the Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

### Japan-based pharmaceutical company Daiichi Seiyaku developed

<!-- chunk -->

## Nefiracetam in the late 1990’s as a derivative of Piracetam.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nefiracetam is fat-soluble while Piracetam is water-soluble. Fat-soluble

<!-- chunk -->

### molecules cross the blood-brain barrier more easily than water-soluble

<!-- chunk -->

### molecules.

<!-- chunk -->

### Both Nefiracetam and Piracetam are cognitive enhancers. And both have

<!-- chunk -->

## neuroprotective qualities. Both racetams are able to improve learning and

<!-- chunk -->

## memory. And both are able to prevent brain damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam has additional benefits not shared with Piracetam.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nefiracetam can reduce anxiety and depression. And exhibits several other

<!-- chunk -->

### memory enhancing qualities over Piracetam.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam increases the amount of time calcium channels in neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### remain open. Tied to protein kinase A (PKA) and the G


<!-- chunk -->

### alpha subunit (G

i/o

<!-- chunk -->

### protein), signaling is enhanced in the neuroreceptor independent of the

<!-- chunk -->

### synapse. This calcium channel pathway is critical for long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### potentiation (LTP) and the formation of long-term memories.597

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam also potentiates protein kinase C alpha (PKCα) which is

<!-- chunk -->

### involved in long-term potentiation (LTP).598 PKCα is dependent on

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamate signaling.

<!-- chunk -->

### And Nefiracetam activates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II

<!-- chunk -->

### (CaMKII) which is critical in memory formation. Again dependent on

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamate signaling.599

<!-- chunk -->

### Finally, Nefiracetam potentiates acetylcholine receptors in the

<!-- chunk -->

### hippocampus which encourages glutamate release and LPT. Piracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### does not share this memory enhancing quality.600

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom-line is Nefiracetam seems to be a much more potent memory

<!-- chunk -->

### enhancer that the original nootropic Piracetam.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Nefiracetam work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Nefiracetam enhances memory. In several studies and clinical

<!-- chunk -->

### trials, researchers have noted Nefiracetam’s anti-amnesia effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### And they’ve arrived at this observation by noting Nefiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### interacting with individual acetylcholine receptors in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study conducted at the Albert Einstein Healthcare Network in

<!-- chunk -->

### Philadelphia worked with older rabbits. Researchers use a technique called

<!-- chunk -->

### the “nictitating membrane (NM)/eyeblink response” in rabbits which is

<!-- chunk -->

### used in the lab to study age-related memory disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this case, the team used Nefiracetam to study its effect on retention and

<!-- chunk -->

### relearning. The scientists administered 5, 10 or 15 mg/kg of Nefiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### to 34 “retired” rabbits over 15 days. And then tested retention and

<!-- chunk -->

### relearning 1, 5 and 12-weeks post-training.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found that the effect of Nefiracetam on the ability of older

<!-- chunk -->

### rabbits to relearn was apparent up to 5 weeks after using Nefiracetam. In

<!-- chunk -->

### other words, Nefiracetam had a significant effect on memory long after the

<!-- chunk -->

### rabbits stopped using it.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that Nefiracetam likely has an even greater

<!-- chunk -->

### effect on memory the longer you use it.601

<!-- chunk -->

### This testing model is dependent on cholinergic (acetylcholine) firing in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain.602

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Nefiracetam alleviates depression. Nefiracetam enhances signaling

<!-- chunk -->

### of GABA on GABA


<!-- chunk -->

### receptors when GABA is too low. And has a

<!-- chunk -->

### suppressive effect when GABA is too high.603 Leading to stabilized

<!-- chunk -->

### mood and sociability. No mood swings!

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam also provides an antidepressant effect by activating the

<!-- chunk -->

### enzyme Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII).

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists in Japan worked with mice with depressive-like behaviors. The

<!-- chunk -->

### mice were given 1 mg/kg per day of Nefiracetam. And noticed

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant effects within a day of supplementation.604

<!-- chunk -->

### Note that this antidepressant effect takes a completely different approach

<!-- chunk -->

### to controlling depression compared to SSRI’s. Prescription antidepressants

<!-- chunk -->

### like SSRI’s mess with serotonin levels in your brain to control depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### And unlike Nefiracetam, come with a host of side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Also note that the CaMKII enzyme is associated with a boost in long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### memory formation.


<!-- chunk -->

### Glutamate is an excitatory relative of GABA. While GABA has a calming

<!-- chunk -->

### effect, glutamate stimulates. Glutamate is the most common

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glutamate can be toxic to neurons. And too much of it in your brain can

<!-- chunk -->

### kill brain cells. Lou Gehrig’s Disease for example, is caused by excess


<!-- chunk -->

### But glutamate is a pivotal neurotransmitter in the brain. It links the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### circuits involved in memory, learning and perception.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Too much glutamate can kill neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Too much GABA can cause brain damage

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Too little GABA can cause depression

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Too little glutamate can cause problems with memory, learning and

<!-- chunk -->

### perception


<!-- chunk -->

### So Nefiracetam can help for age-related cognitive decline, as well as a

<!-- chunk -->

### student looking to do better in school. By boosting acetylcholine and

<!-- chunk -->

### controlling glutamate and GABA in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nefiracetam benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam modulates GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Its role is to

<!-- chunk -->

### keep glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter from

<!-- chunk -->

### overwhelming your brain. And causing damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### When GABA levels are too low, you experience anxiety, insomnia, poor

<!-- chunk -->

### mood and restlessness. Left unchecked it can lead to neurodegenerative

<!-- chunk -->

### disease and a very poor quality of life.

<!-- chunk -->

### But when GABA is too high, you have a toxic environment in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Causing damage to neurons and other areas of your brain. Nefiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### modulates GABA levels, keeping them steady for a healthy brain. And

<!-- chunk -->

### improved long-term memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nefiracetam contributes to learning by enhancing long-term potentiation

<!-- chunk -->

## (LTP). Enhancing NMDA-dependent LTP at low concentrations and

<!-- chunk -->

### AMPA dependent LTP at higher concentrations.605

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam combined with choline boosts the production of the crucial

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Improving memory, recall and focus.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam is fat-soluble and quickly enters your brain after you take it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once in your brain, it boosts signal transmission, and protects neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam boosts acetylcholine so you should add a good choline source.

<!-- chunk -->

### Try Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline with Nefiracetam. And give your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### the choline it needs.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Nefiracetam feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Several studies have noted that short-term or one-time use of Nefiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### doesn’t do much. Supplementing Nefiracetam every day for 7 days or

<!-- chunk -->

### more is needed to experience the full benefit of this nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nootropics users report:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Nefiracetam as a study aid. Nefiracetam provides calm focus,

<!-- chunk -->

### recall and cognition for many neurohackers. It improves attention

<!-- chunk -->

### span, motivation, and alleviates apathy and mental fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Increased visual acuity. The visual effects of Nefiracetam feel like

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain is processing a broader spectrum of what’s in your visual

<!-- chunk -->

### range. Nature and your surroundings look more vibrant and

<!-- chunk -->

### beautiful.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Mood. Many users report a calm focus and being able to articulate

<!-- chunk -->

### thoughts, and improved speaking ability. Language and your

<!-- chunk -->

### vocabulary seem to flow effortlessly. Thoughts and ideas come with

<!-- chunk -->

### less effort.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some experienced users of Aniracetam say they prefer Nefiracetam. You

<!-- chunk -->

### may recall that the chemical structure of Nefiracetam is very similar to

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam. And the clinical studies support its superior ability to affect


<!-- chunk -->

### You should be able to experience the full effects of Nefiracetam within

<!-- chunk -->

### days of starting to supplement with it. It’s fat-soluble so it’s digested and

<!-- chunk -->

### enters your cells quickly.


<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam was developed by a company in Japan in the late 1990’s. As a

<!-- chunk -->

### result, the majority of the published research available in the Western

<!-- chunk -->

### directories was conducted in Japan. And most of it on rats and mice.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clinical trials for Nefiracetam have been conducted in China and the USA

<!-- chunk -->

### for use in treating Alzheimer’s Disease. So far, no large pharmaceutical

<!-- chunk -->

### company in the USA has formulated a prescription drug version of

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam to my knowledge.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nefiracetam as an Antidepressant

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at The University of Iowa in the USA conducted a double-

<!-- chunk -->

### blind, placebo-controlled trial with 159 stroke patients with major

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. Patients received 600 mg or 900 mg of Nefiracetam or a

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo within 10 days to 3 months after their stroke.

<!-- chunk -->

### The trial ran for 12 weeks with patients evaluated at 4, 9 and 12 weeks of

<!-- chunk -->

### the trial. The study concluded that Nefiracetam produced a significant

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement in the most severely depressed patients.606

<!-- chunk -->

## Nefiracetam Improves Learning & Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Much of the research on Nefiracetam has been done with learning and

<!-- chunk -->

### memory in mind.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study conducted in Ireland used Nefiracetam with rats. Scopolamine,

<!-- chunk -->

### a memory inhibitor, was given to the rats while they were in training.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scopolamine is used to purposely inhibit memory. When the researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### gave the memory-deprived rats Nefiracetam, task recall improved and

<!-- chunk -->

### significantly improved memory deficits.607

<!-- chunk -->

### Another Irish study with rats showed 40-days of Nefiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation induced Nerve Growth Factor and neurogenesis. Proving

<!-- chunk -->

### that Nefiracetam could facilitate long-term memory consolidation.608

<!-- chunk -->

## Nefiracetam Reduces Apathy

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with Nefiracetam is reported by many neurohackers to

<!-- chunk -->

### boost motivation and a “get it done” attitude. Which is the opposite of

<!-- chunk -->

### ‘apathy’.

<!-- chunk -->

### Stroke patients who suffer depression commonly experience apathy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at The University of Iowa conducted a study with 137 stroke

<!-- chunk -->

### patients with major depression. 70 of which also met published diagnostic

<!-- chunk -->

### criteria for apathy.

<!-- chunk -->

### The patients were assigned a placebo, or 600 mg or 900 mg of Nefiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### per day for 4 weeks. Patients who used 900 mg of Nefiracetam had a

<!-- chunk -->

### significantly greater improvement in Apathy Scale scores compared to the

<!-- chunk -->

## other two groups. Conclusion: Nefiracetam reduces apathy.


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended Nefiracetam dosage is 100 mg to 900 mg per day. Taken in

<!-- chunk -->

### divided doses. One Nefiracetam dose in the morning, and one in the early

<!-- chunk -->

### afternoon.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam is sold in tablet, capsule and powder form. Tablets and

<!-- chunk -->

### capsules are usually 400 - 600 mg each.

<!-- chunk -->

### Since Nefiracetam is a fat-soluble nootropic, you should take it with a

<!-- chunk -->

### meal containing healthy fats. Or with a tablespoon of extra virgin, expeller

<!-- chunk -->

### cold-pressed coconut or olive oil. Or other similar healthy fat to ensure

<!-- chunk -->

### quick absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam also boosts acetylcholine (ACh) activity in your brain. To

<!-- chunk -->

### avoid a “racetam headache” make sure to stack Nefiracetam with a good

<!-- chunk -->

### choline source like CDP-Choline or Alpha GPC.

<!-- chunk -->

## Note that most studies suggest, and many neurohackers report that it will

<!-- chunk -->

### take at least 7 days of daily dosing of Nefiracetam to experience the full

<!-- chunk -->

### benefit of this nootropic.


<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam non-toxic. So is considered well-tolerated and safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects are rare but can include anxiety, fatigue, headaches,

<!-- chunk -->

### nervousness and nausea. Side effects are often a result of unusually high

<!-- chunk -->

### doses of the nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Headaches from using Nefiracetam typically happen when you forget to


<!-- chunk -->

### Nearly all of the toxicity studies on Nefiracetam have been done on

<!-- chunk -->

### animals. And prolonged usage of this nootropic have shown no toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### effects at recommended doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study with male Beagle dogs reported a reduction in testicular

<!-- chunk -->

### testosterone after a single treatment of Nefiracetam.

<!-- chunk -->

### But before you write this nootropic off, note that the dose was a ridiculous

<!-- chunk -->

## 180 or 300 mg/kg dose.609 That’s the equivalent of 16 or 27 grams of

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam for a 200 lb. male human.

<!-- chunk -->

### And dogs happen to metabolize Nefiracetam differently than humans and

<!-- chunk -->

### primates. The metabolite M-18 in dogs seems to be the culprit. And is not

<!-- chunk -->

### found in humans or monkeys.610

<!-- chunk -->

## I’m not going to belabor this point. But to say that Nefiracetam is safe

<!-- chunk -->

## and non-toxic if used at recommended doses. As long as you’re not a

<!-- chunk -->

### Beagle. Just don’t give it to your dog!


<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam is sold in tablet, capsule, and powder form. Tablets and

<!-- chunk -->

### capsules are usually 400 - 600 mg each.


<!-- chunk -->

## Nefiracetam 100 - 900 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Nefiracetam as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does not make Nefiracetam on its own. So to get its benefits


<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam is especially helpful for those suffering from apathy, loss of

<!-- chunk -->

### motivation and memory loss. Studies show it helps stop and reverse the

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms associated with apathy.

<!-- chunk -->

### And this nootropic helps boost the activity of GABA, glutamate and

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine in your brain. All involved in long-term potentiation and

<!-- chunk -->

### formation of long-term memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nefiracetam is also particularly useful to students and executives who

<!-- chunk -->

### want to boost cognition, learning and especially long-term memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers with experience using Nefiracetam show it helps boost

<!-- chunk -->

### study scores, work flow, learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should use Nefiracetam with a good choline supplement like Alpha

<!-- chunk -->

### GPC or CDP-Choline. It helps boost neural acetylcholine, so demands the


<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely boost daily intake of Nefiracetam to 1,200 mg if needed.

<!-- chunk -->

### All daily dosing of Nefiracetam should be in divided doses if above

<!-- chunk -->

### mg per day. One dose in the morning and another early afternoon.


# Nicotine

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine has been shown to improve concentration, focus, mental clarity,

<!-- chunk -->

### motivation, memory, and reduce mood swings and anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

## Nicotine (3-(1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl) pyridine) is an alkaloid found in

<!-- chunk -->

### tobacco leaves. But nicotine is also present in very small amounts in

<!-- chunk -->

### plants from the Solanaceae or nightshade family including potatoes,

<!-- chunk -->

### tomatoes and eggplant.611

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine has been used by humans for its psychoactive (nootropic)

<!-- chunk -->

### properties for thousands of years. But it is only in the last several decades

<!-- chunk -->

### that nicotine’s mechanism of action in the brain has been revealed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine works primarily by upregulating nicotinic acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors (nAChR) in the brain. Stimulating and regulating the release of a

<!-- chunk -->

### host of neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine and

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine. Increasing neural signaling of neurotransmitters and

<!-- chunk -->

### boosting alertness, cognition and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have shown however that this upregulation of nAChR is dose

<!-- chunk -->

### dependent. And too much nicotine desensitizes these receptors.612 So low

<!-- chunk -->

### doses of nicotine are key in using nicotine as a nootropic for cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### benefit.

<!-- chunk -->

### Since we’re investigating nicotine as a nootropic here, it’s important to

<!-- chunk -->

### point out that I am not encouraging smoking. Smoking tobacco has been

<!-- chunk -->

### shown to increase cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the harmful effects of tobacco have been proven extensively.613

<!-- chunk -->

### Including this study that showed life-time smokers have less gray matter

<!-- chunk -->

### in the prefrontal cortex compared to non-smokers. Affecting the brain’s

<!-- chunk -->

### reward, impulse control and decision-making circuits.614

<!-- chunk -->

### New drugs derived from nicotine and research on nicotinic acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors are in clinical trials for Alzheimer’s, ADHD, anger management,

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, Tourette Syndrome and wound

<!-- chunk -->

### healing.615

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, we’re talking about using a nicotine lozenge or gum for

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive enhancement. Again, I’m NOT talking about smoking tobacco.

<!-- chunk -->

### Smoking is the cause of 5 – 6 million deaths per year. Affecting

<!-- chunk -->

### different organs in your body. But it’s not the nicotine in tobacco that kills.

<!-- chunk -->

### The biggest issue with using nicotine as a nootropic is that it can be

<!-- chunk -->

### addictive. But it’s not the nicotine that causes cancer. Nicotine however

<!-- chunk -->

### could be a “tumor promoter” (if you already have tumors in your body).

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine binds specifically to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor

<!-- chunk -->

### (nAChR) in your brain. And it deregulates essential processes like

<!-- chunk -->

### regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis (programmed cell death),

<!-- chunk -->

### migration, invasion, angiogenesis, inflammation and cell-mediated

<!-- chunk -->

### immunity of stem cells, adult tissues and cancer cells.616

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, nicotine works in smalls doses (i.e. 1-2 mg) used

<!-- chunk -->

### occasionally when you need that cognitive boost. If you have cancer or a

<!-- chunk -->

### tendency to tumor growth you should avoid using nicotine as a nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Nicotine work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Nicotine boosts memory. Nicotine binds to presynaptic nicotinic

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine receptors in the brain. And boosts the release of

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine (ACh), dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate.617

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurotransmitters known to be involved in cognitive processes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Problems with cholinergic signaling has been implicated in neurologic

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders including schizophrenia, ADHD and addiction. And much of the

<!-- chunk -->

### study of nicotine’s effects on cognition has been done looking for

<!-- chunk -->

### treatments for these disorders.618

<!-- chunk -->

### The National Institute of Drug Abuse conducted a meta-analysis of

<!-- chunk -->

### double-blind, placebo-controlled studies between 1994 and 2008. The

<!-- chunk -->

### analysis found significant positive effects of nicotine on fine motor

<!-- chunk -->

### performance, alertness, attention and accuracy, response time, short-term

<!-- chunk -->

### and working memory.619

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Nicotine improves attention. Attention deficits are often associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with those dealing with ADHD. The inability to focus can cause all

<!-- chunk -->

### kinds of problems both in relationships, and on the job.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine has been shown to improve attentiveness in smokers. And helps

<!-- chunk -->

### alleviate attention deficits in Alzheimer’s Disease, schizophrenics, and

<!-- chunk -->

### adults with ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### A double-blind study conducted at Duke University Medical Center used

<!-- chunk -->

### nicotine patches to see if it would improve attentiveness in non-smoking

<!-- chunk -->

### adults without attention deficits. Subjects received 7 mg of nicotine per

<!-- chunk -->

### day using a transdermal patch for a 4 ½ hour morning session.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine significantly decreased the number of omission errors during

<!-- chunk -->

### testing. And in this study, decreased the variance in “hit reaction time”

<!-- chunk -->

### which is used a measure of attentiveness.

<!-- chunk -->

## The study showed that nicotine reduced attention deficit, and even

<!-- chunk -->

## improved attentiveness in normal adult non-smokers.620


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, our brain chemistry and energy metabolism changes.621

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Acetylcholine signaling in the brain declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine and serotonin levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Alertness, attention and memory declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Anxiety, depression and stress increases


<!-- chunk -->

## Nicotine benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine boosts levels of dopamine, epinephrine (adrenaline),

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine and serotonin. And stimulates the growth of new blood

<!-- chunk -->

### vessels. Even increasing the number of red blood cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier. Within 20 seconds of

<!-- chunk -->

### putting a nicotine lozenge under your tongue. It has the fastest action of

<!-- chunk -->

### any nootropic we review on Nootropics Expert, and in this book.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha brain waves increase with nicotine which provides a relaxed state

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with super-learning, flow states and joy.622

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine stimulates electrical and neurotransmitter activity throughout

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain. Helping alertness, mood, motivation, selective attention,

<!-- chunk -->

### sustained attention, and decreases distraction.623

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine helps pre-attentional processing which is your ability to detect

<!-- chunk -->

### information. It brings you down when you’re up. And it brings you up

<!-- chunk -->

### when you’re down. And it helps you cope with stress and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### And nicotine improves short-, long-, and working memory processes.624

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Nicotine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report nicotine improves mental clarity and motivation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mood swings are minimized and less anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### Concentration and focus significantly get a boost with nicotine as a

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### All forms of memory get a boost with nicotine. Short and long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### memory. And working memory. Nicotine induces long-term potentiation

<!-- chunk -->

### in the hippocampus which is the basis for the neuroplasticity that helps

<!-- chunk -->

### encode long-term memory.625

<!-- chunk -->

### The key with nicotine is to use low doses. And only use it occasionally.

<!-- chunk -->

### Too much nicotine desensitizes the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### receptor. So tolerance is an issue. But your receptors recover fairly

<!-- chunk -->

### quickly if you give them a break for a day.


<!-- chunk -->

### Much of the research conducted with nicotine was done with cigarette

<!-- chunk -->

### smokers. The studies were to determine the effects of abstinence (quitting

<!-- chunk -->

### smoking) on cognition. Or funded by tobacco companies out to prove

<!-- chunk -->

### smoking was good for you (i.e. improved cognition).

<!-- chunk -->

### So keep an open mind when reviewing these studies. My intent is certainly

<!-- chunk -->

### not to encourage smoking. But to show the effects of nicotine regardless of

<!-- chunk -->

### the delivery system to the human brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nicotine boosts IQ

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in New Zealand conducted a trial with 10 women and 6 men

<!-- chunk -->

### ranging in age from 18 – 32 years. All participants were smokers and were

<!-- chunk -->

### instructed not to smoke during the 2-hour period prior to the experiment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Each subject completed the even and odd numbers of the Raven’s

<!-- chunk -->

### Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) test in two sessions. APM is a test

<!-- chunk -->

### to measure intelligence (IQ).

<!-- chunk -->

### In each of 2 experimental sessions, subjects were given 20 minutes to

<!-- chunk -->

### complete the assigned half of the APM. Before beginning the test, subjects

<!-- chunk -->

### took 6 puffs of a medium (0.8 mg) cigarette every 20 seconds. After

<!-- chunk -->

### minutes, subjects were prompted to take 2 additional puffs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Results of the experiment showed that APM scores were significantly

<!-- chunk -->

### higher in the smoking session compared to the non-smoking session.

<!-- chunk -->

## Suggesting that nicotine acts to enhance intelligence.626

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study at the University of Colorado may explain part of this boost

<!-- chunk -->

### in IQ. Nicotine was found to increase the efficiency of neural

<!-- chunk -->

### communication between areas of the brain involved in cognition. And

<!-- chunk -->

### even the rest of the brain.627

<!-- chunk -->

## Nicotine improves typing speed

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers conducted 5 experiments to study the effects of using 2 mg of

<!-- chunk -->

### nicotine on keyboard typing speed. In study after study nicotine produced

<!-- chunk -->

### a reliably consistent increase in typing speed.628

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine will also improve and increase the speed of your handwriting.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists in Germany noted that nicotine has consistently been shown to

<!-- chunk -->

### improve psychomotor performance. So they recruited 38 smokers and

<!-- chunk -->

### non-smokers to participate in a study.

<!-- chunk -->

### Both groups received gum containing 0, 2 or 4 mg of nicotine. And their

<!-- chunk -->

### handwriting performance was assessed after they chewed the nicotine

<!-- chunk -->

### gum. Subjects were asked to perform a simple writing task. Movement

<!-- chunk -->

### time, velocity and acceleration of handwriting movements were measured.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine reduced movement times, increased writing velocity and more

<!-- chunk -->

### fluid handwriting movements were observed. The results suggested that

<!-- chunk -->

### nicotine can enhance psychomotor performance to a significant degree in a

<!-- chunk -->

### real-lie motor task.629

<!-- chunk -->

## Nicotine boosts memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine has been shown to improve short-term and working memory in

<!-- chunk -->

### several studies. In this study conducted in the UK, researchers recruited

<!-- chunk -->

### smokers and 60 non-smokers in a double-blind procedure.

<!-- chunk -->

### Half of the subjects chewed nicotine gum and the other half chewed a

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo prior to performing a memory task. Results showed that nicotine

<!-- chunk -->

### significantly improves short-term memory.630

<!-- chunk -->

## Nicotine for the treatment of ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### Several studies have shown the benefits of nicotine in treating the

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of ADHD. Focusing and memory break down in those of us

<!-- chunk -->

### with ADHD and ADD. And treatment with Ritalin, Adderall or other

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulants often corrects this inattentiveness and memory impairment. But

<!-- chunk -->

### it does nothing for the accompanying depression and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### And this is the reason why many Adult ADHD sufferers smoke. This study

<!-- chunk -->

### showed that using a nicotine patch not only helped decrease anxiety and

<!-- chunk -->

### depression symptoms of ADHD. It also helped smokers stop using tobacco

<!-- chunk -->

### products while taking care of their ADHD symptoms.631

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, nicotine was compared to the effects Ritalin and or a placebo

<!-- chunk -->

### had in treating ADHD. Nicotine improved performance and reduced

<!-- chunk -->

### errors. It decreased depression, and decreased overall severity of ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms.632

<!-- chunk -->

### Another double-blind, placebo-controlled trial worked with 6 smokers and

<!-- chunk -->

### 11 nonsmokers with Adult ADHD. Nicotine decreased ADHD symptoms,

<!-- chunk -->

### increased vigor, and improved reaction time.633


<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine as a nootropic is dosed at 1 – 2 mg on an as needed basis.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine gum typically comes in 2 – 4 mg. You can cut a 4 mg piece of

<!-- chunk -->

### gum in half for a 2 mg dose. Gum releases the nicotine dose over the

<!-- chunk -->

### course of 20 – 30 minutes.

<!-- chunk -->

### The problem with nicotine gum is aspartame along with other unhealthy

<!-- chunk -->

### sweeteners.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine patches come in varying strengths and usually contain more

<!-- chunk -->

### nicotine than gum or lozenges. Neurohackers (contrary to package

<!-- chunk -->

### warnings) cut the patch to size depending on the dose they want to use.

<!-- chunk -->

### My preferred method is nicotine lozenges. The mini-lozenges are best

<!-- chunk -->

### because they’re not full of toxic chemicals like the larger lozenges. The

<!-- chunk -->

### mg mini-lozenge cut in half provides a nice cognitive boost in 10 -

<!-- chunk -->

### minutes.


<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine is addictive primarily because it boosts levels of dopamine in

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain.634 Not nearly as addictive as smoking tobacco but addictive

<!-- chunk -->

### nonetheless.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine can cause increased heart rate, dizziness, cough, sneezing, sinus

<!-- chunk -->

### problems, upset stomach, constipation, and headaches.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine does not “cause” cancer. But may be a tumor promoter. So if you

<!-- chunk -->

### had or currently have cancer you should avoid nicotine.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are dealing with a gut infection of H pylori bacteria, you should not

<!-- chunk -->

### use nicotine until you get this problem under control.


<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine as a nootropic comes in gum, inhalers, lozenges, and transdermal

<!-- chunk -->

### patches.

<!-- chunk -->

### See “Dosage Notes” for specific dosing instructions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mini-lozenges are the safest and best form for nootropic use.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine spray is a newer option you may want to try. You get a 1 mg dose

<!-- chunk -->

### for each spray under your tongue (sublingually). Great for a quick

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive boost and burst of energy. There’s about 100 sprays in each

<!-- chunk -->

### container.

<!-- chunk -->

### Of course there is also smoking and chewing tobacco for your nicotine

<!-- chunk -->

### dose which I DO NOT recommend.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vaping is another option. But it can come with a host of potential issues if

<!-- chunk -->

### you’re not familiar with vaping. The safest option is rebuildable coils

<!-- chunk -->

### using stainless steel wire and organic cotton with vegetable glycerin as

<!-- chunk -->

### your nicotine base. And keeping the temperature and wattage low.


<!-- chunk -->

## Nicotine 1 - 2 mg per dose

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Nicotine as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make nicotine on its own. So if you are going to

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement with nicotine, you must take it as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine is helpful for those dealing with short-, long- and working

<!-- chunk -->

### memory problems, low energy, depression or anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine is especially helpful for dealing with the symptoms of Adult

<!-- chunk -->

### ADD or ADHD. Nicotine can help relieve most of the symptoms of

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD. And is a good compliment to your existing ADHD meds.

<!-- chunk -->

### While nicotine is a powerful cognitive enhancer, it is also addictive and

<!-- chunk -->

### can lead to tolerance and withdrawal symptoms in some people. So

<!-- chunk -->

### caution is advised. And if you’re prone to addiction please stay away from

<!-- chunk -->

### nicotine.

<!-- chunk -->

### As neurohackers, we have great acetylcholine agonists available to us if

<!-- chunk -->

### you don’t want to experiment with nicotine. Most of the racetams will

<!-- chunk -->

### boost acetylcholine use in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest starting with a dose of ½ - 1 mg of nicotine in mini-lozenge or

<!-- chunk -->

### spray form. Nicotine will compliment nearly everything in your current


<!-- chunk -->

### There is no benefit to dosing more than 2 mg of nicotine for cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### benefit. And too avoid addiction and tolerance I suggest only using

<!-- chunk -->

### nicotine occasionally.


# Noopept

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept is known for boosting cognition, memory, learning, perception,

<!-- chunk -->

### logical thinking and mood

<!-- chunk -->

## Noopept (n-phenylacetyl-l-prolylglycine ethyl ester or GVS-111) is often

<!-- chunk -->

### included in the racetam-family of nootropic compounds. But is not a true

<!-- chunk -->

### “racetam” because it does not have a 2-oxo-pyrrolidine nucleus.

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept was developed in Russia where it is called Ноопепт or GVS-111.

<!-- chunk -->

### Russian-based pharmaceutical company JSC LEKKO Pharmaceuticals

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesized Noopept in 1996 based off the endogenous neuropeptide

<!-- chunk -->

### cycloprolylglycine (CPG).

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Moscow found Noopept similar to piracetam in not only

<!-- chunk -->

### it’s nootropic effect, but also anxiolytic activity.635

<!-- chunk -->

## Noopept is a water-soluble ampakine nootropic. AMPA (α-amino-3-

<!-- chunk -->

### hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic) refers to one of three glutamate

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors in your brain.636

<!-- chunk -->

## Noopept could also be considered a Cholinergic compound because it

<!-- chunk -->

### affects acetylcholine levels in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept does not appear in blood samples when taken as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Instead it elevates concentrations of cycloprolylglycine (CPG) in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### CPG is a dipeptide consisting of proline and glycine which acts as a

<!-- chunk -->

### modulator of acetylcholine transmission and AMPA receptor function.637

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the newer synthetic nootropic compounds, Noopept is known as a

<!-- chunk -->

## cognitive enhancer. And is known for its anxiolytic, or anti-anxiety


<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept is considered to be up to 1000-times more potent than Piracetam.

<!-- chunk -->

### As an ampakine nootropic, it helps increase attention span, alertness and

<!-- chunk -->

### boosts all three levels of memory; memory formation, retention and recall.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ampakines tend to have a stimulant effect. But do not produce the same

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulant side effects as Ritalin or coffee from prolonged use.

<!-- chunk -->

## Noopept vs. Piracetam: What’s the Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

### Russian-based pharmaceutical company JSC LEKKO Pharmaceuticals

<!-- chunk -->

## developed Noopept in the late 1990’s as a peptide analogue of the original

<!-- chunk -->

## nootropic Piracetam.638

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept and Piracetam are both water-soluble. And both Noopept and

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam are cognitive enhancers. Both have neuroprotective and

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) qualities.639 Both racetams are able to improve

<!-- chunk -->

## learning and memory. And both are able to repair brain damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### But Noopept has additional benefits not shared with Piracetam. First, the

<!-- chunk -->

### effective dose of Noopept compared to Piracetam is 1,000-times lower. A

<!-- chunk -->

### typical dose of Noopept is 10 – 30 mg while Piracetam is often dosed up to

<!-- chunk -->

### 3 or 4,000 mg.

<!-- chunk -->

### Second, Piracetam facilitates only the early stages of the memory process.

<!-- chunk -->

### On the other hand, Noopept influences memory consolidation AND

<!-- chunk -->

### retrieval steps as well. So Noopept helps you develop the memory, retain

<!-- chunk -->

### the memory, and then recall what you have stored in memory.640

<!-- chunk -->

## Noopept also has additional selective anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) action.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers believe this is due in part to Noopept’s antioxidant effect,

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-inflammatory action, and the ability to prevent the neurotoxic effect of

<!-- chunk -->

### too much calcium and glutamate.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Noopept work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

### 1.Noopept modulates AMPA and NMDA receptors and acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### (ACh) transmission. Noopept boosts the level of cycloprolylglycine

<!-- chunk -->

### (CPG) in the brain. CPG is a dipeptide consisting of proline and

<!-- chunk -->

### glycine which acts as a modulator of acetylcholine transmission, and

<!-- chunk -->

### AMPA and NMDA receptor function.

<!-- chunk -->

### When brain cells are starved of oxygen, glutamate which is your brain’s

<!-- chunk -->

### primary excitatory neurotransmitter, does not work efficiently with

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroreceptors. The result can be a toxic buildup of glutamate within brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells. Causing neuron damage and ultimately, neuron death.

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept modulates neuroreceptor function keeping glutamate

<!-- chunk -->

### transmission at normal levels. Protecting neurons and other brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### from glutamate damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept has also been shown to modulate acetylcholine flow in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. Restoring the harmony of glutamate and acetylcholine function not

<!-- chunk -->

### only protects your brain from damage. It can boost cognition, memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### learning, recall, mood and relieve anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.Noopept increases Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), Brain-Derived

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and mRNA. NGF and BDNF are

<!-- chunk -->

### directly related to neuroplasticity. This ability to repair and even

<!-- chunk -->

### grow new brain cells can have profound implications. Particularly

<!-- chunk -->

### with someone with neurodegenerative brain damage like Parkinson’s

<!-- chunk -->

### or Alzheimer’s. And even affecting Long-Term Potentiation needed

<!-- chunk -->

### for long-term memory development.

<!-- chunk -->

### mRNA affects the expression of genes and intracellular communication in

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells. This ongoing brain signaling and gene expression within brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells is required for healthy cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study conducted in Moscow showed long-term use of Noopept

<!-- chunk -->

### boosted NGF, BDNF and mRNA. The animal subjects in this study showed

<!-- chunk -->

### no sign of tolerance. And long-term use of Noopept even potentiated the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotrophic effect.641


<!-- chunk -->

### Glutamate is an excitatory relative of GABA. While GABA has a calming

<!-- chunk -->

### effect, glutamate stimulates. Glutamate is the most common

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

### But glutamate can be toxic to neurons. And too much of it in your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### can kill brain cells. Lou Gehrig’s Disease for example, is caused by excess


<!-- chunk -->

### But glutamate is a pivotal neurotransmitter in the brain. It links the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### circuits involved in memory, learning and perception.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Too much glutamate can kill neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Too little glutamate can cause problems with memory, learning and

<!-- chunk -->

### perception


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Nerve Growth Factor declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor declines


<!-- chunk -->

### So Noopept can help for age-related cognitive decline, as well as a student

<!-- chunk -->

### looking to do better in school. By boosting NGF, BDNF and acetylcholine,

<!-- chunk -->

### and controlling glutamate in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Noopept benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept modulates AMPA and NDMA receptors. AMPA receptors are

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with how glutamate and calcium is used in your brain. With

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept, it’s more of a neuroprotective role.

<!-- chunk -->

### Similar to the AMPA receptor, the NMDA receptor is also associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamate and calcium use in your brain. They work together to modulate

<!-- chunk -->

### how neurons use glutamate.

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept modulates levels of glutamate within and between neurons. It

<!-- chunk -->

### prevents glutamate toxicity and influences Long-Term Potentiation (LTP).

<!-- chunk -->

### LTP is associated with neuroplasticity that allows long-term memories to

<!-- chunk -->

### form.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is clinical evidence that Noopept boosts communication and neuron

<!-- chunk -->

## signaling. By boosting Alpha and Beta brain wave activity. You become

<!-- chunk -->

### calmer and more creative. It’s easier to go into a flow state. And you are

<!-- chunk -->

### prone to making innovative and resourceful decisions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept produces an anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effect. It stimulates

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine receptors (D2 and D3) and acetylcholine nicotinic receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

### And Noopept also seems to modulate some serotonin receptors. All

<!-- chunk -->

### contributing to a better mood and less anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept has been shown in the lab to boost Nerve Growth Factor (NGF)

<!-- chunk -->

### and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). NGF and BDNF are both

<!-- chunk -->

### involved in neuroplasticity, and the repair and replacement of damaged

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells. Resulting in overall better brain health, memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition.642

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept is water-soluble and quickly enters your brain after you take it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once in your brain, it boosts signal transmission, and protects neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Noopept feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Nootropics users report:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Noopept as a study aid. On its own, Noopept increases focus and

<!-- chunk -->

### attention for many neurohackers. Mental arithmetic and grasping

<!-- chunk -->

### difficult concepts is easier.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Increased verbal fluidity. Your conversation skills could increase

<!-- chunk -->

### with Noopept. Vocabulary comes easier. Being able to focus

<!-- chunk -->

### contributes to a more balanced dialogue. Neurohackers report being

<!-- chunk -->

### more outgoing, friendly and less self-conscious.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Improved mood. With Noopept you may find yourself better able to

<!-- chunk -->

### deal with stressful situations and work issues that normally get you

<!-- chunk -->

### down. Once you get past the first few weeks of unpleasant memories

<!-- chunk -->

### related to PTSD you may find overwhelming emotions will subside.

<!-- chunk -->

### You could feel detached in a pleasant way from painful memories.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Music appreciation. Many users report increased pleasure when

<!-- chunk -->

### listening to music while using Noopept. For some it takes music to a

<!-- chunk -->

### different plane. Distinguishing between instruments in sound tracks

<!-- chunk -->

### is easier. As a whole, music sounds better.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Long-term memory. Noopept affects NGF and BDNF which affects

<!-- chunk -->

### long-term potentiation. Some neurohackers report memories long

<!-- chunk -->

### forgotten suddenly spring up. Which could be good or bad I suppose

<!-- chunk -->

### depending on the memory. But reports say memories are clear. And

<!-- chunk -->

### if they’re unpleasant there is an emotional detachment shielding

<!-- chunk -->

### from unpleasant feelings.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should be able to experience the effects of Noopept soon after you

<!-- chunk -->

### take it. It’s water-soluble and enters your cells quickly especially if you

<!-- chunk -->

### take it sublingually.

<!-- chunk -->

### A word of caution, however, don’t go over the recommended 10 – 30 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### per day dose! You will not experience any added benefit and could bring

<!-- chunk -->

### on unwanted side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is some debate on the water-solubility of Noopept. It’s not truly fat-

<!-- chunk -->

### soluble but it certainly doesn’t hurt to use a quality “good fat” when taking

<!-- chunk -->

### your Noopept dose.


<!-- chunk -->

## Noopept increases Nerve Growth Factor & BDNF

<!-- chunk -->

### A study published by the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences in

<!-- chunk -->

## Moscow shows that Noopept stimulates Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and

<!-- chunk -->

## Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF).

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, researchers studied the effect of single and long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment (28 days) of Noopept. They found that one-time treatment

<!-- chunk -->

## boosted mRNA in the cerebral cortex of rats. mRNA is a molecule in brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells that carries codes from DNA where they specify the amino acid

<!-- chunk -->

### sequence of proteins.

<!-- chunk -->

## And long-term treatment of Noopept increased Brain-Derived

<!-- chunk -->

## Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). The researchers speculated that this

<!-- chunk -->

### sequence of events in the brain plays a role in the restoration of neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Improving neurotrophin synthesis in the hippocampus boosts cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### function. Particularly consolidation and delayed memory retrieval.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team concluded that Noopept “holds much promise to prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### the development of Alzheimer’s disease in patients with mild cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### impairment”.643

<!-- chunk -->

## Noopept boosts Brain Waves

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Moscow studied the effects of injecting Noopept in rats to

<!-- chunk -->

### see how it would affect brain waves.

<!-- chunk -->

## The team found that Noopept increased Alpha and Beta brain wave

<!-- chunk -->

### activity throughout the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### You experience Alpha waves as you become more relaxed. Alpha waves

<!-- chunk -->

### are associated with super-learning, flow state and joy. Beta waves are

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with concentration, alertness and cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers observed that NMDA receptors were involved with a

<!-- chunk -->

### single injection of Noopept. While AMPA receptors were activated after

<!-- chunk -->

### longer-term use of Noopept.644

<!-- chunk -->

## NMDA receptors are associated with Long-Term Potentiation (long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### memory) and neuroplasticity. AMPA receptors are associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### increased brain signaling activity. Boosting cognition and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## Noopept improves memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept is known within the nootropic community for enhancing memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### And dozens of studies support this claim of better memory when using

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study done at the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences in Moscow

<!-- chunk -->

### experimented with Noopept on rats. The animals were trained in passive

<!-- chunk -->

### avoidance response.

<!-- chunk -->

### The animal’s ability to both form a memory and retain a memory was

<!-- chunk -->

### impaired. But once the rats received a dose of Noopept, they were able to

<!-- chunk -->

### retain a memory and retrieve that memory later.

<!-- chunk -->

### In other words, Noopept normalized learning capacity in animals with

<!-- chunk -->

### damage done to their cerebral cortex. And promoted training ability in rats

<!-- chunk -->

### with a hereditary learning deficit.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers noted that “Noopept improves all three stages of

<!-- chunk -->

### memory”. And was most pronounced in those with impaired memory

<!-- chunk -->

### function.645

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study, again done with rats noted that Noopept stimulated learning

<!-- chunk -->

### after just a single administration. And repeated administration actually

<!-- chunk -->

### increased the number of successful learners among the animals who failed

<!-- chunk -->

### the initial training.646


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended Noopept dosage is 10 - 30 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept is very bioavailable and easily crosses the blood-brain barrier.647

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept is sold in tablet, capsule, and powder form. Tablets and capsules

<!-- chunk -->

### are usually 10 mg each.

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept is primarily water-soluble nootropic but won’t easily dissolve in

<!-- chunk -->

### water or juice. So it may help if you take it with a meal containing healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### fats. Or with a tablespoon of extra virgin, expeller cold-pressed coconut or

<!-- chunk -->

### olive oil. Or other similar healthy fat to ensure quick absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

### For even quicker absorption you can use Noopept sublingually. Let the

<!-- chunk -->

### tablet or powder dissolve under your tongue so it can go straight into your

<!-- chunk -->

### blood-stream, and into your brain. Bypassing your digestive system

<!-- chunk -->

### completely.


<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept is a synthetic nootropic and consider non-toxic. So is considered

<!-- chunk -->

### well-tolerated and safe. As long as you stay within the recommended

<!-- chunk -->

### dosage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects are rare but can include fatigue, headaches, insomnia or

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach upset. Side effects are often a result of unusually high doses of

<!-- chunk -->

### the nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Headaches from using Noopept typically happen when you forget to


<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept is sold in tablet, capsule and powder form. Tablets and capsules

<!-- chunk -->

### are usually 10 mg each.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Russia and some other Eastern European countries, Noopept is a

<!-- chunk -->

### prescription drug.


<!-- chunk -->

## Noopept 10 – 30 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Noopept as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does not make Noopept on its own. So to get its benefits you


<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept is especially helpful for those looking to boost cognition,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and recall. This nootropic helps boost the activity of

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine in your brain. It modulates glutamate receptors which

<!-- chunk -->

### normalizes optimal neurotransmitter function. And increases Nerve

<!-- chunk -->

### Growth Factor (NGF) and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)

<!-- chunk -->

### which helps the neuroplasticity needed for Long-Term Potentiation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept is also particularly useful to students and executives who want to

<!-- chunk -->

### boost cognition, learning and memory. My experience using Noopept

<!-- chunk -->

### shows it helps boost study scores, work flow, learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Noopept also helps improve verbal fluidity and sociability. Words seem to

<!-- chunk -->

### come easily, and vocabulary you didn’t know you had access to come into

<!-- chunk -->

### play.

<!-- chunk -->

### Music sounds richer and fuller, and your listening experience enters a new

<!-- chunk -->

### level of music appreciation.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should use Noopept with a good choline supplement like Alpha GPC

<!-- chunk -->

### or CDP-Choline. It helps boost neural acetylcholine, so demands the


<!-- chunk -->

### You should not exceed doses of more than 30 mg per day. Start with 10 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### and see how you respond.


# Oat Straw

<!-- chunk -->

### Oat Straw has been shown to relieve stress and anxiety, increase energy,

<!-- chunk -->

### boost cognition, and improve libido

<!-- chunk -->

## Oat Straw (avena sativa) is green oat grass. The tops of the oat plant in the

<!-- chunk -->

### milky stage before mature oat plants form a head.

<!-- chunk -->

### Avena sativa, or the common oat plant is a popular cereal grain that has

<!-- chunk -->

### been used by humans as nutrition for at least 3,000 years.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oats are grown in temperate climates world-wide as food for humans and

<!-- chunk -->

### livestock. And as an ingredient used in cosmetics.

<!-- chunk -->

### The oat plant is descended from avena sterilis, a wild oat that originated in

<!-- chunk -->

### the ‘Fertile Crescent’ that spanned from Israel to western Iran to Europe.

<!-- chunk -->

### It was domesticated about 3,000 years ago in Europe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tea brewed from oats has traditionally been used as a sedative. And as an

<!-- chunk -->

### herbal treatment for insomnia and nervous disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 1987, the German Commission E declared oat straw be used as a

<!-- chunk -->

### “nervine herb”. The Commission determined that oat straw extract was an

<!-- chunk -->

### effective herbal remedy for anxiety and stress (i.e. nerves).648

<!-- chunk -->

### The nootropic benefits of Oat Straw were first revealed in the Middle Ages

<!-- chunk -->

### in Europe. In was recommended for boosting mental health, and as a

<!-- chunk -->

### restorative to the nervous system.649

<!-- chunk -->

### Saint Hildegard of Bingen, a nun and herbalist born in 1098 in what is now

<!-- chunk -->

### present-day Germany, considered oats to be a favorite ‘happiness’ herb.650

<!-- chunk -->

### Avenanthramides (bioactive compounds unique in oats) have been shown

<!-- chunk -->

### to enhance nitric oxide (NO) production in human smooth muscle cells.651

<!-- chunk -->

### And have anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and anti-itching activity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Protecting against heart disease, colon cancer and skin irritation.652

<!-- chunk -->

### Oat straw extract inhibits phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4). PDE4 is a

<!-- chunk -->

### component of signaling pathways involved in the mediation of

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant activity.653

<!-- chunk -->

### Oat straw has a reputation in men’s health as a sexual performance

<!-- chunk -->

### enhancer. More recent studies have shown oat straw can improve cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### performance as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### PDE4 inhibitors can prolong the effects of cAMP in the brain which can

<!-- chunk -->

### improve long-term memory, wakefulness, is neuroprotective, works as an

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-inflammatory and antidepressant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oat straw extract inhibits monoamine oxidase B (MOA-B) which increases

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine levels in the brain. Helping brain disorders like ADHD and

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s Disease.654

<!-- chunk -->

### Oat straw extract suppresses inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting nuclear

<!-- chunk -->

### factor κB (NF-κB) activation655 Cytokines are implicated in a number of

<!-- chunk -->

### brain disorders including major depression, schizophrenia and

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s Disease.656

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Oat Straw work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## Oat Straw boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Oat Straw boosts cerebral circulation. Oat straw extract increases

<!-- chunk -->

### blood flow to and within the brain through several mechanisms of

<!-- chunk -->

### action. Oat straw contains the amino acid arginine which synthesizes

<!-- chunk -->

### to create nitric oxide (NO). NO dilates blood vessels allowing more

<!-- chunk -->

### blood to flow.

<!-- chunk -->

### Avenanthramides (bioactive compounds unique in oats) have been shown

<!-- chunk -->

### to enhance nitric oxide (NO) production in human smooth muscle cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### And the suppression of inflammatory cytokines in combination with

<!-- chunk -->

### increased nitric oxide increases blood flow.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study with 37 healthy older adults (60+ years) participated in a 24-week

<!-- chunk -->

### randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants received

<!-- chunk -->

### 1500 mg per day of oat straw extract or a placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study showed that cerebral vascular responsiveness increased by 42%.

<!-- chunk -->

### This indicates that the middle cerebral artery was able to dilate in response

<!-- chunk -->

### to stress.657 And more blood flow to the brain increases oxygen and

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrient delivery to brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Oat Straw increases Alpha Brain Waves. You experience alpha

<!-- chunk -->

### brain wave patterns as you become more relaxed. And is associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with super-learning, flow states and joy.

<!-- chunk -->

### German researchers conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled crossover study using 1,250 or 2,500 mg of oat straw extract

<!-- chunk -->

### compared to placebo. An EEG was used to measure brain wave

<!-- chunk -->

### frequencies in this trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers noted that oat straw extract affected brain wave patterns

<!-- chunk -->

### in an area of the brain associated with cognition. The subjects performed

<!-- chunk -->

### better in arithmetic with fewer errors.658


<!-- chunk -->

### Ever noticed how older people seem more frail? They suffer from

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive dysfunction and an overall decline in well-being. Research show

<!-- chunk -->

### these conditions are associated with a drop in dopamine levels as we

<!-- chunk -->

### age.659

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Dopamine levels decrease

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Monoamine oxidase B (MOA-B) increases

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Mood, cognition and bodily function decline

<!-- chunk -->

### Dopamine levels begin to decline by 13% per decade after age 45.660

<!-- chunk -->

### Cognition, mood and sexual function all suffer as a result. And gradually

<!-- chunk -->

### progress into diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

<!-- chunk -->

## Oat Straw benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers have found that this age-related decrease in dopamine is

<!-- chunk -->

### caused by an enzyme called monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B).

<!-- chunk -->

### In our youth, MAO-B regulates the exact amount of dopamine we need in

<!-- chunk -->

### our brain. But as we age, MAO-B levels get out of hand and increase too

<!-- chunk -->

### much.661 As MOA-B levels rise, dopamine levels fall.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research has shown that inhibition of MOA-B preserves brain function by

<!-- chunk -->

### protecting dopamine. And extends cognition, sexual function and life

<!-- chunk -->

### span.662

<!-- chunk -->

### Oat Straw extract has been found to inhibit MOA-B and enhance dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### that normally declines with age.663

<!-- chunk -->

### Oat straw extract can:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Work as an antidepressant

<!-- chunk -->

### •Help you cope with stress

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reduce anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### •Control inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### •Relieve skin irritation

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increase libido and sexual performance

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Oat Straw feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Most neurohackers report that supplementing with oat straw extract

<!-- chunk -->

### increases energy levels and libido.

<!-- chunk -->

### Others report more mental clarity, less anxiety, and an overall sense of

<!-- chunk -->

### well-being.

<!-- chunk -->

### Men say it increases libido and morning wood.


<!-- chunk -->

## Oat Straw Improves Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### An Australian study was conducted with a group of elderly people. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### showed signs of mild cognitive impairment while others showed no

<!-- chunk -->

### impairment. Researchers wanted to measure cognitive performance after

<!-- chunk -->

### taking oat straw extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of oat straw

<!-- chunk -->

### extract once a week. The study used 0 mg, 1,600 mg or 2,400 mg of oat

<!-- chunk -->

### straw extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### This was a “crossover” trial which means each subject was rotated through

<!-- chunk -->

### all 3 doses. So each participant functioned as a “control” during the trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers used the Stroop Color-Word Test which measures memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### executive function, catching errors, appropriate responses and attention.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, those who did not use oat straw extract had an average of

<!-- chunk -->

### 3.39 errors on the test. Those receiving 1,600 mg made only 1.2 errors (a

<!-- chunk -->

### 65% improvement).

<!-- chunk -->

### The subjects who reported no cognitive impairment did even better with

<!-- chunk -->

### an average of 0.55 errors compared to placebo who averaged 2.13 errors (a

<!-- chunk -->

### 74% improvement). The 2,400 mg subjects performed about as well as

<!-- chunk -->

### those taking a placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### The 2,400 mg dose of oat straw extract is significant because it shows that

<!-- chunk -->

### suppressing MAO-B too much will not improve cognition.664

<!-- chunk -->

## Oat Straw for Improved Cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### A study using oat straw extract (Neuravena®) assessed the effects of a

<!-- chunk -->

### single dose with healthy adults aged 40 – 65 years with self-declared

<!-- chunk -->

### memory decline.

<!-- chunk -->

### Participants received a single dose of 800 or 1,600 mg of oat straw extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cognitive function was assessed measuring attention, spatial-working-

<!-- chunk -->

### episodic memory and executive function before dosing. Testing was done

<!-- chunk -->

### 1, 2.5, 4 and 6 hours after dosing.

<!-- chunk -->

## The results showed that 800 mg of oat straw extract increased speed of

<!-- chunk -->

## performance. Participants experienced improved performance of delayed

<!-- chunk -->

### word recall in terms of errors. And executive function in terms of

<!-- chunk -->

### decreased thinking time and overall completion time.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that acute (one-time) dosage of oat straw

<!-- chunk -->

### extract produced optimal effects on cognition at or below 800 mg. Once

<!-- chunk -->

### again showing that when inhibiting MOA-B, too much inhibiting does

<!-- chunk -->

### more harm than good.665

<!-- chunk -->

### Oat straw extract enhances attention and concentration without the side

<!-- chunk -->

### effects of insomnia, nervousness, or anxiety.


<!-- chunk -->

### Oat straw extract recommended dosage:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Oat straw powder in a capsule is 350 mg up to 3-times daily

<!-- chunk -->

### •Oat straw tincture ½ to 1 teaspoon up to 3-times daily

<!-- chunk -->

### •Oat straw tea up to 3 cups per day

<!-- chunk -->

### Most clinical studies showed the most effective dose to be between 800 –

<!-- chunk -->

### 1,600 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should not exceed the recommended dosage because studies show that

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibiting MOA-B in excess will not provide the benefits normally

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with oat straw supplementation.


<!-- chunk -->

### Oat straw is natural, non-toxic, and considered very safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Exceeding recommended doses however can inhibit MOA-B too much and

<!-- chunk -->

### you will not get the cognitive benefit you’re looking for with oat straw.


<!-- chunk -->

### Oat straw is available as powdered leaves and stems in capsule form, oat

<!-- chunk -->

### straw extract standardized 10:1 or 20:1, and alcohol extract tinctures.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neuravena® (EFLA®955) is a patented oat straw extract made by Frutarom

<!-- chunk -->

### Health and licensed to some supplement manufacturers.


<!-- chunk -->

## Oat Straw extract 800 – 1,600 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Oat Straw as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Oat Straw on its own. So you must take it as a


<!-- chunk -->

### Oat Straw is especially helpful for those dealing with dopamine decline

<!-- chunk -->

### due to aging. As we age and particularly past age 40, MOA-B is produced

<!-- chunk -->

### in excess in our brains which causes dopamine to decline.

<!-- chunk -->

### Declining dopamine levels affect cognition, sexual function, mood and

<!-- chunk -->

### longevity. Oat straw extract is a natural inhibitor of MOA-B and will help

<!-- chunk -->

### restore dopamine to youthful levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oat Straw is also helpful for those suffering from Parkinson’s or

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease. Increased MOA-B, loss of dopamine receptors, and

<!-- chunk -->

### declining dopamine levels all contribute to neurodegenerative disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have found that using oat straw extract early in the diagnosis of

<!-- chunk -->

### disease can help alleviate symptoms of these diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely take up to 1,600 mg of Oat Straw extract daily if needed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Half the dose first thing in the morning. And the other half early

<!-- chunk -->

### afternoon. Oat straw extract acts as a stimulant so avoid taking it too late

<!-- chunk -->

### in the day or it may affect sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do not exceed recommended doses (more than 1,600 mg) of oat straw

<!-- chunk -->

### extract. You’ll suppress MOA-B too much which can mess with dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### levels in your brain.


# Oxiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam has been shown to improve short and long-term memory, boost

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration and focus, improve cognition and increase cognitive energy

<!-- chunk -->

## Oxiracetam (4-Hydroxy-2-oxopyrrolidine-N-acetamide or ISF-2522) is a

<!-- chunk -->

### water-soluble Ampakine nootropic in the racetam-class of compounds.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam is considerably more potent than the original racetam,

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam.666

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam was the 3rd racetam nootropic developed in the 1970’s. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### chemically derived from Piracetam (2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinoacetamide) where

<!-- chunk -->

### the main difference is the addition of a hydroxyl group. Oxiracetam,

<!-- chunk -->

### similar to other racetam nootropics, has a pyrrolidone nucleus at its core.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam modulates AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptors and increases

<!-- chunk -->

## neurotransmitter release.667 AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-

<!-- chunk -->

### isoxazolepropionic) refers to one of three glutamate receptors in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain.668

<!-- chunk -->

### A favorite racetam among the nootropics community. Neurohackers use

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam to boost memory and learning, support brain health and for its

<!-- chunk -->

### mild stimulant properties.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam helps:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Brain Optimization: Oxiracetam significantly improves cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### and memory, sensory perception and reflexes. Focus and

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration get a boost. And recall is easier.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Neurotransmitters: Oxiracetam enhances choline-acetyltransferase

<!-- chunk -->

### (ChAT) in your brain.669 ChAT is the enzyme responsible for

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis. ACh is the neurotransmitter critical

<!-- chunk -->

### for encoding new memories, reasoning, concentration, cognition and

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroplasticity.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Brain Energy: Oxiracetam modulates AMPA-receptors in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. Ampakines provide a stimulant-effect by influencing

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamate receptors. Without any of the side effects associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulants.670 Oxiracetam also seems to boost ATP synthesis in brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells.671

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam is sold as an over-the-counter, unrestricted compound in much

<!-- chunk -->

### of the world including the United States.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam is considered to be more potent than Piracetam. As an

<!-- chunk -->

## ampakine nootropic, it helps increase attention span, alertness and boosts

<!-- chunk -->

## memory. Including the ability to form long-term memories even if taken

<!-- chunk -->

### after the initial memory formation.672

<!-- chunk -->

### Ampakines tend to have a stimulant effect. But do not produce the same

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulant side effects as Ritalin or coffee from prolonged use.

<!-- chunk -->

## Oxiracetam vs. Piracetam: What’s the Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

## Oxiracetam was developed in the 1977 as a derivative of Piracetam.

<!-- chunk -->

## Oxiracetam and Piracetam are both water-soluble. The half-life and

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic benefits are similar.

<!-- chunk -->

### The potency of Oxiracetam seems to be about 5-times that of Piracetam.

<!-- chunk -->

### So it’ll take less to get the same nootropic effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### Both Oxiracetam and Piracetam are cognitive enhancers. And both have

<!-- chunk -->

## neuroprotective qualities. Both racetams are able to improve learning and

<!-- chunk -->

## memory. And both are able to repair brain damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam has additional benefits not shared with Piracetam. Oxiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### provides more of a stimulatory effect than Piracetam. Some even compare

<!-- chunk -->

### it to Modafinil.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many prefer Oxiracetam over Piracetam. But if you’re a first-time user of

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam, start with a lower dose and see how you react to it. And make

<!-- chunk -->

### sure you stack it with a good choline source to avoid the racetam-headache

<!-- chunk -->

### and irritability sometimes associated with racetams.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Oxiracetam Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Oxiracetam boosts memory and cognition. Oxiracetam modulates

<!-- chunk -->

### AMPA receptors in the brain. These receptors work like control

<!-- chunk -->

### channels, overseeing and regulating synaptic transmission.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam also increases the density of binding sites for

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters on AMPA receptors.673

<!-- chunk -->

### The result of these actions is a stimulant-effect without any of the negative

<!-- chunk -->

### side effects associated with stimulants. And there is clinical evidence that

<!-- chunk -->

### this stimulant action has an effect on memory and cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### One double-blind, placebo controlled trial was done with 65 patients

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosed with primary degenerative dementia. Patients were given

<!-- chunk -->

### mg of Oxiracetam twice daily for 12 weeks, or a placebo. Subjects were

<!-- chunk -->

### tested before the trial, and after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found a significant difference in favor of Oxiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### based on a ‘quality of life scale’, and several neurological tests for

<!-- chunk -->

### memory.674

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam also seems to prevent an imbalance of acetylcholine activity

<!-- chunk -->

### when NMDA receptors are malfunctioning.675 AMPA and NMDA receptors

<!-- chunk -->

### work together for the flow of glutamate necessary for learning and

<!-- chunk -->

### memory processes. Including Long-Term Potentiation that is associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with neuroplasticity that allows long-term memories to form.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Oxiracetam boosts the availability of acetylcholine (ACh) in the

<!-- chunk -->

## brain. Leading to improved short-term and long-term memory. And

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminating ‘brain fog’. Oxiracetam does this by boosting the

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitivity of ACh receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam enhances protein kinase C (PKC) which affects M1

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine receptors. Oxiracetam even demonstrates the ability to

<!-- chunk -->

### repair these receptors when damaged.676 More ACh results in better

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and learning.


<!-- chunk -->

### Glutamate is an excitatory relative of GABA. While GABA has a calming

<!-- chunk -->

### effect, glutamate stimulates. Glutamate is the most common

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glutamate is a pivotal neurotransmitter in the brain. It links the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### circuits involved in memory, learning and perception.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Too little glutamate can cause problems with memory, learning and

### ↓ AMPA and NMDA receptors wear out or die


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Cholinergic neurons wear or die out


<!-- chunk -->

### So Oxiracetam can help for age-related cognitive decline, as well as a

<!-- chunk -->

### student looking to do better in school. By boosting acetylcholine and

<!-- chunk -->

### controlling glutamate in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Oxiracetam benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Clinical studies have looked at using Oxiracetam to treat Alzheimer’s,

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD, dementia, concussions and other brain disorders. Many of these

<!-- chunk -->

### trials demonstrated Oxiracetam’s ability to improve learning, spatial

<!-- chunk -->

### learning performance, memory, recall and quality of life scores.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam works similar to other racetams by targeting the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters acetylcholine (ACh) and glutamate. Acetylcholine has a

<!-- chunk -->

### significant impact on memory formation and recall. And glutamate plays a

<!-- chunk -->

### role in memory formation, motivation and attention.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam encourages the use of acetylcholine in your brain. So when

<!-- chunk -->

### using Oxiracetam you must ensure you have adequate choline levels

<!-- chunk -->

### available to make acetylcholine. Most neurohackers stack Oxiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### with a choline supplement like Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam is used to boost short and long-term memory, eliminate brain

<!-- chunk -->

### fog, improve attention and focus, and the ability to learn.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Oxiracetam feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Nootropics users report that Oxiracetam clears brain fog, improves focus

<!-- chunk -->

### and motivation. Especially when learning new material or working

<!-- chunk -->

### through a tedious task.

<!-- chunk -->

### You could see a significant improvement in recall. Reading is easier

<!-- chunk -->

### giving you the ability to get through more pages faster and retain the

<!-- chunk -->

### information for later.

<!-- chunk -->

### And some report an improvement in mood which could be the result of

<!-- chunk -->

### more acetylcholine available for use in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam does have a stimulant-effect so try not to take it too late in the

<!-- chunk -->

### day as it may interfere with a good night’s sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should be able to experience the effects of Oxiracetam soon after you

<!-- chunk -->

### take it. It’s water-soluble so it’s digested and enters your cells quickly.

<!-- chunk -->

### And unlike other stimulants, there is no “crash” once Oxiracetam leaves

<!-- chunk -->

### your system.


<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers worked with 96 patients diagnosed with dementia for

<!-- chunk -->

### months. Patients were treated with 1600 mg per day of Oxiracetam or a

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo. And were assessed at 2, 6 and 12 months of the trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### The patients treated with Oxiracetam showed a significant improvement in

<!-- chunk -->

### reaction time and cognition. The placebo group experienced a worsening

<!-- chunk -->

### of conditions. The study authors concluded that Oxiracetam favorably acts

<!-- chunk -->

### on the symptoms of dementia. And can improve information processing,

<!-- chunk -->

### reaction times and attention.677

<!-- chunk -->

## Oxiracetam helps Traumatic Brain Injury

<!-- chunk -->

### Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health issue affecting 1.7

<!-- chunk -->

## million Americans each year.678 TBI can be caused by sports injuries, work

<!-- chunk -->

### accidents, car and motorcycle accidents, falls, and your wife hitting you

<!-- chunk -->

### over the head with a frying pan.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many survivors end up with long-term or even permanent neurocognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction. Affecting cognition, motor function (movement) and

<!-- chunk -->

### personality. These disabilities are estimated to cost $9.2 billion in lifetime

<!-- chunk -->

### medical costs and $51.2 billion in productivity losses.679

<!-- chunk -->

### In a brain subjected to TBI there is glutamate toxicity, free-radical injury

<!-- chunk -->

### to brain cells, electrolyte imbalances, mitochondrial dysfunction,

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation, apoptosis (cell death) and stroke.680

<!-- chunk -->

### In one study done with 30 Wistar rats, researchers looked at the role

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam could have on TBI. The animals were randomly divided into

<!-- chunk -->

### groups. Rats in the treatment group were given 100 mg/kg of Oxiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### for 21 days. Neurologic impairment scores were measured on days 1, 4, 7,

<!-- chunk -->

### 14 and 21.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found the treatment group has significantly less brain

<!-- chunk -->

### impairment after 7, 14 and 21 days. And concluded that Oxiracetam shows

<!-- chunk -->

### promise in decreasing neural injury caused by TBI. Increasing learning

<!-- chunk -->

### ability, memory and space cognition.681

<!-- chunk -->

## Oxiracetam Improves Cognition and Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers worked with 43 patients to evaluate the effects of Oxiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### on ‘organic brain syndrome’ (OBS). OBS is brain dysfunction that is not

<!-- chunk -->

### attributable to a specific disease like Alzheimer’s or dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### This double-blind, placebo-controlled study had one group of patients

<!-- chunk -->

### taking 800 mg of Oxiracetam twice a day for 8 weeks, and the other group

<!-- chunk -->

### took a placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### In OBS patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment, Oxiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### improved cognition, logic and attention. The placebo group experienced

<!-- chunk -->

### no change in cognitive impairment.682

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study with memory impaired rats showed that Oxiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### restored acetylcholine receptors. Restoring learning and memory as a

<!-- chunk -->

### result.683


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended Oxiracetam dosage is 750 – 1,500 mg per day. Divided in

<!-- chunk -->

### two equal doses. One Oxiracetam dose in the morning, and one in the early

<!-- chunk -->

### afternoon.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam is sold in tablet, capsule, and powder form. Tablets and


<!-- chunk -->

### Since Oxiracetam boosts the efficiency of acetylcholine in your brain, you

<!-- chunk -->

### should stack it with a good choline source like Alpha GPC or CDP

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline.


<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam non-toxic. So is considered well-tolerated and safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects are rare but can include anxiety, fatigue, headaches,

<!-- chunk -->

### nervousness and nausea. Side effects are often a result of unusually high

<!-- chunk -->

### doses of the nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Headaches from using Oxiracetam typically happen when you forget to


<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam is sold in tablet, capsule, and powder form. Tablets and


<!-- chunk -->

## Oxiracetam 750 – 1,500 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Oxiracetam as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does not make Oxiracetam on its own. So to get its benefits you


<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam is especially helpful for those suffering from lack of energy,

<!-- chunk -->

### brain fog and the inability to focus. Oxiracetam influences AMPA and

<!-- chunk -->

### NMDA receptors in your brain. Improving the efficiency of the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter glutamate. This excitatory brain chemical is responsible

<!-- chunk -->

### for sending signals between neuron in the brain. And plays a critical role

<!-- chunk -->

### in learning and forming memories.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam is also particularly useful to students and executives who want

<!-- chunk -->

### to boost cognition, learning and memory. It boosts the efficiency of the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in your brain. ACh is critical for

<!-- chunk -->

### encoding new memories, reasoning, concentration, cognition and growth

<!-- chunk -->

### of new synapses (neuroplasticity).

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxiracetam also helps improve verbal fluidity and sociability. Words seem

<!-- chunk -->

### to come easily, and vocabulary you didn’t know you had access to come

<!-- chunk -->

### into play.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should use Oxiracetam with a good choline supplement like Alpha

<!-- chunk -->

### GPC or CDP-Choline. It helps boost neural acetylcholine, so demands the


<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely boost daily intake of Oxiracetam to 2,800 mg if needed.


# Passionflower

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower is known for improving sleep quality, reducing anxiety, and

<!-- chunk -->

### promoting healthy brain GABA levels.

<!-- chunk -->

## Passionflower (Passiflora incarnata, Passiflora caerulea, Passiflora

<!-- chunk -->

## edulis, Passiflora foetida) is a perennial vining plant native to Central and

<!-- chunk -->

### South America.

<!-- chunk -->

### It produces white with lavender-fringed flowers having 10 white petals,

<!-- chunk -->

### and a central crown of pinkish-purple filaments.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are over 520 different species belonging to the Passifloraceae

<!-- chunk -->

### family. In the southeastern United States, it is often called Maypop, named

<!-- chunk -->

### after the edible fruit, it produces a “pop” when crushed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower was known to Native Americans as an herbal remedy long

<!-- chunk -->

### before the Spanish conquistadors arrived. The name Passionflower came

<!-- chunk -->

### from Roman Catholic priests in the 1500’s. They reported seeing symbols

<!-- chunk -->

### of the Passion of Jesus Christ in the parts of the plant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Used for centuries by Native Americans, Passionflower is known for its

<!-- chunk -->

### ability to reduce anxiety and insomnia. Recent clinical studies confirm the

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroscience showing Passionflower as being effective for these

<!-- chunk -->

### traditional uses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower has sedative properties that help calm you.684 It has been

<!-- chunk -->

### shown to reduce anxiety. Including before surgery.

<!-- chunk -->

### The flavonoids found in Passionflower are partial agonists of GABA


<!-- chunk -->

### receptors and inhibit the uptake of GABA into synapses.685

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower modulates the levels of GABA in your brain. Passionflower

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibits GABA uptake in synapses without affecting GABA release or

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA transaminase activity.686

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower supports healthy sleep.687 It has been shown to improve

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep quality and feeling refreshed the next morning.688

<!-- chunk -->

### The flavonoids in Passionflower include apigenin, luteolin, quercetin, and

<!-- chunk -->

### kaempferol.689

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower is used for anxiety, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD),

<!-- chunk -->

## symptoms of opiate withdrawal, insomnia, nerve pain, convulsions,

<!-- chunk -->

### bronchial spasms, ADHD, palpitations, cardiac rhythm abnormalities,

<!-- chunk -->

### hypertension, sexual dysfunction, and menopause.690

<!-- chunk -->

### New studies are emerging that look at the science behind these uses and

<!-- chunk -->

### other possible benefits of Passionflower. Including helping with panic

<!-- chunk -->

### attacks, seizures, headaches, menstrual pain, and Parkinson’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Passionflower work in the brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## Passionflower boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Passionflower is anti-anxiety. The symptoms of anxiety and

<!-- chunk -->

### depression are often due to an imbalance of excitatory and

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### One mechanism involves the GABA system and a GABA


<!-- chunk -->

### (benzodiazepine)

<!-- chunk -->

### receptor which is the binding site of benzodiazepines, and which regulate

<!-- chunk -->

### chloride flow through ion channels.691

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show the anxiolytic activity of Passionflower is due to Passiflora

<!-- chunk -->

### apigenin and chrysin which are partial agonists of the same GABA


<!-- chunk -->

### receptors.692

<!-- chunk -->

### One randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted with

<!-- chunk -->

### volunteers who were about to undergo an anxiety-inducing tooth

<!-- chunk -->

### extraction. The volunteers were given 260 mg of Passionflower or 15 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### of midazolam 30 minutes before surgery.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that Passionflower showed anxiolytic effects

<!-- chunk -->

### similar to midazolam. And was a safe and effective sedation alternative

<!-- chunk -->

### for adult patients undergoing a tooth extraction.693

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Passionflower for sleep. Passionflower is a traditional herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### sedative, anxiolytic, and popular sleep aid used for the treatment of


<!-- chunk -->

### And several clinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy as a sleep aid

<!-- chunk -->

### in lab animals. But clinical trials in humans were lacking

<!-- chunk -->

### So, researchers at Monash University in Australia decided to investigate

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower herbal tea on human sleep. 41 volunteers aged 18 - 35 were

<!-- chunk -->

### selected to participate in the experiment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Each study participant consumed a cup of Passionflower tea and filled out

<!-- chunk -->

### a sleep diary daily for 7 days. Of the 6 sleep-diary measures analyzed,

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep quality showed a significantly better rating for Passionflower

<!-- chunk -->

### compared to the placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that the consumption of low-dose Passionflower

<!-- chunk -->

### tea resulted in sleep benefits for healthy adults with mild fluctuations in

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep quality.694


<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower modulates how GABA works in your brain. It works as a

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA


<!-- chunk -->

### receptor antagonist.695

<!-- chunk -->

### Dysfunction of the GABA system is implicated in several neuropsychiatric

<!-- chunk -->

### conditions. Which can result in:

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Increased anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Increased symptoms of depression

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Poor sleep quality including insomnia696

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Memory, cognition, and decision-making ability suffers

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Declines in quality of life

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with Passionflower may help relieve anxiety and

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, improve your quality of sleep, and your overall sense of well-

<!-- chunk -->

### being.

<!-- chunk -->

## Passionflower benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Hundreds of peer-reviewed clinical studies have been published on the

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits of Passionflower. Passionflower has been well-established as an

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiolytic and sedative.697

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower has also been shown to:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Reduce general anxiety698,

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reduce anxiety before surgery700,

<!-- chunk -->

## •Treat insomnia702

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improve sleep quality703,

<!-- chunk -->

### •Modulate GABA levels in your brain705,

<!-- chunk -->

### •Work as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant707

<!-- chunk -->

## •Have potential for Parkinson’s disease708

<!-- chunk -->

## •Help in the treatment of opiate withdrawal709

<!-- chunk -->

## •Reduce hot flashes and night sweats associated with menopause710

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Passionflower feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report improved sleep quality with Passionflower. They say

<!-- chunk -->

### it helps them fall asleep and sleep more deeply.

<!-- chunk -->

## Some report Passionflower helped them taper off opiates with fewer

<!-- chunk -->

## withdrawal symptoms including better sleep and less anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### One person who calls herself a “Type A” personality said it “helps shut my

<!-- chunk -->

### brain off and drift into sleep peacefully.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Unlike using sleep meds, neurohackers say when using Passionflower for

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep they don’t feel as “zonked out” as they do when using sleep meds.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sleep is better and it’s easier to get going the next morning.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many Passionflower users say it provides relief from anxiety. It “takes the

<!-- chunk -->

### edge off” and helps them work past their anxiety instead of becoming

<!-- chunk -->

### paralyzed by it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower helps calm you but without the side effects associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-anxiety meds. And you cannot become physically dependent on it like

<!-- chunk -->

### you can with anti-anxiety drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

## Passionflower Clinical Research

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower has been used for millennia to reduce anxiety and for

<!-- chunk -->

### restful sleep. It’s also used for panic attacks, seizures, hypertension,

<!-- chunk -->

### headaches, and menstrual pain.711

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower is often combined with other nootropic herbs such as

<!-- chunk -->

## Valerian or Lemon Balm for insomnia. And with St. John’s Wort for

<!-- chunk -->

## depression.

<!-- chunk -->

## Passionflower compared to an Anti-Anxiety Med

<!-- chunk -->

### A randomized, double-blind, controlled study published in the Journal of

<!-- chunk -->

### Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics examined the effect of Passionflower

<!-- chunk -->

### on Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). It compared the efficacy of

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower to oxazepam, a pharmaceutical sedative.

<!-- chunk -->

### 36 Patients diagnosed with GAD were randomly assigned to receive either

<!-- chunk -->

### 45 drops/day of Passionflower extract, or 30 mg/day oxazepam for

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study found that Passionflower extract was equally effective as

<!-- chunk -->

### oxazepam for treating GAD.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded, “The results suggest that Passiflora extract is

<!-- chunk -->

### an effective drug for the management of generalized anxiety disorder, and

<!-- chunk -->

### the low incidence of impairment of job performance with Passiflora

<!-- chunk -->

### extract compared to oxazepam is an advantage.”712

<!-- chunk -->

## Passionflower for anxiety before surgery

<!-- chunk -->

### Patients who undergo anesthesia before surgery typically experience

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### A research team at Ankara Training and Research Hospital in Turkey

<!-- chunk -->

### conducted a study using Passionflower with 60 patients aged 25-55 years

<!-- chunk -->

### about to get spinal anesthesia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Their intention was to investigate the efficacy of Passionflower on anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### psychomotor function, sedation, and blood pressure when taken as a

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement prior to anesthesia.

<!-- chunk -->

### The patients received Passionflower syrup (700 mg/5 mL aqueous extract)

<!-- chunk -->

### or a placebo 30 minutes before spinal anesthesia.

<!-- chunk -->

### After the surgery was complete the researchers concluded “oral

<!-- chunk -->

### administration of Passionflower suppressed anxiety before spinal

<!-- chunk -->

### anesthesia without changing psychomotor performance or blood pressure

<!-- chunk -->

### and produced no side effects”.713

<!-- chunk -->

## Passionflower for sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical study published in

<!-- chunk -->

### 2020 examined the effect of Passionflower on insomnia.

<!-- chunk -->

### A research team at the Soonchunhyang University College of Medicine in

<!-- chunk -->

### Korea used polysomnographic technology to investigate the effects of

<!-- chunk -->

## Passionflower in subjects suffering from insomnia.

<!-- chunk -->

## Polysomnography, also called a sleep study, is a comprehensive test used

<!-- chunk -->

### to diagnose sleep disorders. Polysomnography records your brain waves,

<!-- chunk -->

### the oxygen level in your blood, heart rate and breathing, as well as eye and

<!-- chunk -->

### leg movements during a study.

<!-- chunk -->

### 110 adult participants with an average age of 40 years old and who were

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosed with insomnia disorder were included in the study.

<!-- chunk -->

### The patients received either Passionflower extract or a placebo for

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks. Patients underwent an overnight polysomnography and completed

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep diaries as well as several other tests used to measure sleep quality

<!-- chunk -->

### and duration.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset (WASO) significantly improved

<!-- chunk -->

### after 2 weeks in the Passionflower group but no change in sleep with the

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo group.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that Passionflower demonstrated a positive

<!-- chunk -->

### effect on sleep and relieving insomnia.714

<!-- chunk -->

## Passionflower Recommended Dosage

<!-- chunk -->

## The recommended nootropic dosage for Passionflower extract for anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### is 250-1,000 mg per day. Larger doses should be divided into 2 or

<!-- chunk -->

### smaller doses during your day.

<!-- chunk -->

## Recommended dosage of Passionflower extract for sleep is 200 – 400 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### before bed.

<!-- chunk -->

## Recommended dosage of Passionflower tincture is 0.5-2 ml 3- times per


<!-- chunk -->

## Recommended dosage of Passionflower tea is 0.25-2 grams of dried

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower per cup of tea, steeped for 10-15 minutes. Taken 2 or 3-

<!-- chunk -->

### times per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Doses of Passionflower extract above 3.5 grams per day may be toxic and

<!-- chunk -->

## unsafe. Remember, more is never better when using nootropics.715

<!-- chunk -->

## Passionflower Side Effects

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower is considered non-toxic and safe when used at the

<!-- chunk -->

### recommended dosage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects are rare but can include drowsiness, confusion, reduced

<!-- chunk -->

### coordination, nausea, headache, or rapid heartrate.

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower has the potential to interact with several drugs and you

<!-- chunk -->

### should not take it if you take sleep aids, tranquilizers, sedatives, MAOIs,

<!-- chunk -->

### anticoagulants or blood pressure medication. Passionflower may slow

<!-- chunk -->

### blood-clotting.716 Passionflower may lower blood pressure.

<!-- chunk -->

## Passionflower should not be used if you are pregnant because human

<!-- chunk -->

## studies show using herb while pregnant can result neonatal death,

<!-- chunk -->

## premature rupture of membranes, newborns taking amniotic fluid into

<!-- chunk -->

## their lungs, or newborn high blood pressure.717

<!-- chunk -->

## Type of Passionflower to Buy

<!-- chunk -->

## Passionflower supplements are made from the flowers, leaves, and stems

<!-- chunk -->

### of the plant. It’s available in capsule, tincture, and dried herb form.

<!-- chunk -->

## Pascoflair® is made by Pascoe which is headquartered in Giessen,

<!-- chunk -->

### Germany. Pascoflair® is a patented Passionflower extract with 425 mg dry

<!-- chunk -->

### extract in tablet form.

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower extract in capsules range from 200 mg to 1100 mg each.

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower tinctures are available as alcohol or water extracts and sold

<!-- chunk -->

### in small dropper bottles. Follow dosage recommendations provided by the

<!-- chunk -->

### manufacturer in the bottle label.

<!-- chunk -->

### Look for Passionflower supplements that are preferably certified organic,

<!-- chunk -->

### non-GMO, produced in a GMP facility, and contains zero fillers or other

<!-- chunk -->

### toxic “other ingredients”.


<!-- chunk -->

## Passionflower extract 250-1,000 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Passionflower as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Passionflower on its own. So, you must take it as

<!-- chunk -->

### a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower is especially helpful for those suffering from anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic stress, and insomnia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower helps reduce anxiety by naturally modulating GABA levels

<!-- chunk -->

### in your brain and working as a GABA receptor antagonist.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with Passionflower before surgery can help reduce the

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety you normally experience in anticipation of the surgical procedure.

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower is also helpful if you have problems with sleep. It improves

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep quality if you are dealing with insomnia without affecting your

<!-- chunk -->

### performance the following day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Women going through menopause find supplementing with Passionflower

<!-- chunk -->

### helps reduce hot flashes and night sweats.

<!-- chunk -->

## Passionflower may help you taper off opiates with fewer withdrawal

<!-- chunk -->

## symptoms including better quality sleep and less anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely take up to 1,000 mg of Passionflower extract if needed. If

<!-- chunk -->

### you are using it for anxiety, try 500 mg in the morning and another 500 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### in the afternoon.

<!-- chunk -->

### Passionflower as a sleep aid seems to be particularly effective when

<!-- chunk -->

### stacked with Valerian or Lemon Balm. And combined with St. John’s wort

<!-- chunk -->

### for severe depression.


# Phenibut

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut has a calming effect on brain and body, helps relieve stress and

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, and boosts Human Growth Hormone

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenibut (β-Phenyl-GABA, β-phenyl-γ-aminobutyric acid, Noofen,

<!-- chunk -->

## Citrocard) is an analogue of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The

<!-- chunk -->

### addition of a phenyl ring allows Phenibut to cross the blood-brain barrier

<!-- chunk -->

### (BBB). Neurohackers prefer Phenibut when the goal is to raise GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### levels in the brain because GABA as a supplement cannot cross the BBB.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clinical studies show that boosting GABA with a supplement like

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut relieves anxiety, stress, and boosts the production of alpha brain

<!-- chunk -->

### waves.718 If GABA is optimized in your brain you’ll feel focused, relaxed

<!-- chunk -->

### and stress-free.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut helps:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Balance mood. Phenibut has an inhibitory effect on overly

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulated neurons because it raises GABA levels in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Low GABA levels lead to anxiety, depression and insomnia. GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### helps restore that balance. Promoting a more positive mood which

<!-- chunk -->

### improves focus and relaxation.719

<!-- chunk -->

## •Boost Human Growth Hormone. Bodybuilders and athletes use

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut before resistance training. Studies show by raising GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### levels, you can boost blood levels of Human Growth Hormone.720

<!-- chunk -->

### Promoting greater recovery support and lean muscle growth.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Neurotransmitters. Phenibut stimulates dopamine receptors and

<!-- chunk -->

### antagonizes beta-phenethylamine (PEA).721 Dopamine aids in

<!-- chunk -->

### memory formation, attention, focus, and cognition. PEA increases

<!-- chunk -->

### the action of dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine and serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s partly behind the overstimulation that causes irritability,

<!-- chunk -->

### restlessness, and agitation that could be caused by too much

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine and norepinephrine. Phenibut can counteract this affect

<!-- chunk -->

### giving you a cognition boost without the negatives.722

<!-- chunk -->

## GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the major inhibitory or relaxing

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter in your brain.723 GABA’s primary role is to keep the

<!-- chunk -->

## major excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in check.

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA is naturally synthesized in your brain from glutamate. It’s

<!-- chunk -->

### estimated that 40% of the synapses in the human brain work with GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### and therefore have GABA receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

## So when using Phenibut to boost GABA, you enhance normal sleep cycles,

<!-- chunk -->

### and improve blood pressure. GABA even stimulates the pituitary gland to

<!-- chunk -->

### secrete Human Growth Hormone. And helps produce endorphins that make

<!-- chunk -->

### you feel good after a workout or sex.

<!-- chunk -->

### Soon after Phenibut was discovered in St. Petersburg, Russia, it was being

<!-- chunk -->

### prescribed by doctors to lower stress and anxiety, treat PTSD and


<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut was included in the medical kit for Russian astronauts on the

<!-- chunk -->

### Soyuz-19 and Salyut-4 missions as a ‘tranquilizer’.724 Phenibut is one of

<!-- chunk -->

### the only tranquilizers that lowers stress levels without negatively affecting

<!-- chunk -->

### performance.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, when you use Phenibut to normalize GABA levels you’ll

<!-- chunk -->

### experience a reduction in anxiety, insomnia, nervousness, restlessness and


<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut can be a more natural, safer alternative to Benzodiazepine drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### like Valium and Xanax. These pharmaceuticals work by increasing GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### receptor sensitivity.725

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Phenibut Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut helps brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Phenibut boosts GABA in the brain. Phenibut is a derivative of

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA. And easily crosses the blood-brain barrier. GABA on its own

<!-- chunk -->

### cannot cross this barrier unless paired with a dedicated carrier.726

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA works by preventing neural signaling associated with anxiety from

<!-- chunk -->

### reaching other neurons. It does this by attaching to the receptors that

<!-- chunk -->

### would otherwise excite those neurons. Over-stimulating neurons in certain

<!-- chunk -->

### areas of your brain is what causes anxiety-related symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### The majority of studies on Phenibut have been conducted in Russia. And

<!-- chunk -->

### most studies have been done with animals. In this study using rabbits,

<!-- chunk -->

### scientists looked at anxiety behaviors and how they were effected by

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut.

<!-- chunk -->

### They exposed the rabbits to emotional stimuli causing anxiety in the

<!-- chunk -->

### animals. Anxiety caused the rabbits to ‘freeze’ and exhibit defensive

<!-- chunk -->

### reactions. Behaviors very similar to what happens in humans when they’re

<!-- chunk -->

### under stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### When the rabbits were administered Phenibut, the anxiety-caused

<!-- chunk -->

### reactions of defensiveness and passive reactions (freezing) decreased to

<!-- chunk -->

### normal behavior.727

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.GABA changes brain waves. Using Phenibut as a nootropic helps

<!-- chunk -->

### increase GABA levels in your brain. And we know that GABA helps

<!-- chunk -->

### decrease Beta brain waves and increase Alpha brain waves.728

<!-- chunk -->

### Beta brain waves are important for attention, alertness, concentration and

<!-- chunk -->

### developing memories. But excess levels of concentration, particularly

<!-- chunk -->

### during stress, can lead to anxiety, depression, insomnia and more stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### When you are in an alert state, both Alpha and Beta brain waves can be

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulated. But the type of alertness will determine which brain wave is

<!-- chunk -->

### produced.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alertness during an Alpha wave state is associated with a relaxed state.

<!-- chunk -->

### And a stressed alert state produces a Beta wave. But an excess of Beta

<!-- chunk -->

### brain waves contributes to a variety of nervous disorders including anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### and stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most of the clinical studies available done with humans use GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation rather than Phenibut. But the outcome of using GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### could be applied to using Phenibut to increase GABA levels in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut crosses the blood-brain barrier more effectively than GABA.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, researchers investigated using GABA on relaxation and

<!-- chunk -->

### immunity during stress in humans. They evaluated the effect on

<!-- chunk -->

### subjects of GABA intake on brain waves.

<!-- chunk -->

### An electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to measure brain waves after

<!-- chunk -->

### subjects took water only, GABA or L-Theanine. 60 minutes after

<!-- chunk -->

### administration, the study showed that GABA significantly increased Alpha

<!-- chunk -->

### waves and decreased Beta waves compared to water or L-Theanine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that raising brain levels of GABA induced

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxation and diminished anxiety.729 And you raise brain levels of GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### effectively when supplementing with Phenibut.


<!-- chunk -->

### Low levels of GABA are associated with a variety of health problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Anxiety730, panic attacks, stress and insomnia

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Muscle spasms, hypertension, convulsion, Tourette’s Syndrome and

<!-- chunk -->

### epilepsy

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Dry skin and wrinkles

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Poor digestion, bloating, flatulence, and constipation

<!-- chunk -->

### When your neurotransmitters, including GABA, are in balance, you feel

<!-- chunk -->

### motivated, productive and energetic. And you feel calm and relaxed during

<!-- chunk -->

### downtime.

<!-- chunk -->

### When GABA levels are low you feel filled with dread, you’re constantly

<!-- chunk -->

### worried, you have racing thoughts, and you’re frequently late and

<!-- chunk -->

### disorganized.731

<!-- chunk -->

### Many people in this GABA-slump resort to high carbohydrate foods, and

<!-- chunk -->

### drugs or alcohol to relax.

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenibut benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut is an analogue of GABA. The addition of a phenyl ring allows

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut to cross the blood-brain barrier much more easily than GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### taken as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### We need adequate GABA levels in our brain because it’s an inhibitory

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter. When we raise GABA levels by supplementing with

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut, we help keep glutamate in check.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glutamate is your body’s most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Which is responsible for attention span, brain energy, learning ability,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, and staying awake.

<!-- chunk -->

### So GABA is calming and glutamate is stimulating. And they must be in

<!-- chunk -->

### balance with each other for optimal cognitive health.

<!-- chunk -->

### An imbalance of these two neurotransmitters can cause fibromyalgia,

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic fatigue syndrome, poor memory and cognition, anxiety and


<!-- chunk -->

### But when these two neurotransmitters work together efficiently, you feel

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxed with no stress or feelings of anxiety. And you get a more restful

<!-- chunk -->

### night’s sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Adding Phenibut to your nootropic stack can help bring GABA and

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamate back into balance.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Phenibut feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### When you balance GABA levels in your brain, you feel relaxed and calm.

<!-- chunk -->

### But many neurohackers who try using GABA as a supplement don’t feel

<!-- chunk -->

### the effects. Because the GABA molecule is too large to cross the blood-

<!-- chunk -->

### brain barrier.732

<!-- chunk -->

### Note: If you do feel the calming effects of supplementing with GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### within a ½ hour of taking it, it may mean you have a “leaky” blood-brain

<!-- chunk -->

### barrier. Not a good thing.733 Because if GABA can get through, all kinds of

<!-- chunk -->

### nasty stuff can get through too. Including toxins, undigested food particles

<!-- chunk -->

### and anything else in your blood stream that shouldn’t be in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### But here were talking about increasing our GABA levels using Phenibut.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report that adding Phenibut to their stack relieves anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### there is less stress and they feel more relaxed.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, some say it’s the best anti-anxiety ‘medication’ they’ve ever used.

<!-- chunk -->

### Including some well know pharmaceuticals (i.e. Clonazepam, Diazepam,

<!-- chunk -->

### Alprazolam) used to treat anxiety. With none of the nasty side effects that

<!-- chunk -->

### come with prescription meds.

<!-- chunk -->

### Social functions could get some help with Phenibut. You could feel less

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibited, speak freely, and feel more confident.

<!-- chunk -->

### Others report that Phenibut boosts sex drive, and for men it helps control

<!-- chunk -->

### ejaculation. And it helps for a better night’s sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Athletes report that Phenibut goes well with a workout. Because Phenibut

<!-- chunk -->

### has been shown to boost Human Growth Hormone. You’ll be able to work

<!-- chunk -->

### out with less fatigue, energy levels will go up, muscles won’t be as sore

<!-- chunk -->

### and recovery could be faster.

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenibut takes 2 – 4 hours before you begin to feel its effects. A strong

<!-- chunk -->

## word of caution: do not increase the dose or take additional Phenibut if

<!-- chunk -->

### you think things are not happening fast enough! Wait at least 24 hours

<!-- chunk -->

### before taking another dose.


<!-- chunk -->

### GABA was identified as a neurotransmitter several decades ago. And there

<!-- chunk -->

### had been a lot of research on GABA published since. But most of it is

<!-- chunk -->

### focused on how GABA works. And the drugs and chemicals which affect

<!-- chunk -->

### its action.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is very little research available on using GABA as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Likely because most scientists believe that GABA taken as a supplement

<!-- chunk -->

### will not cross the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### And there is even less research available on using Phenibut. Particularly in

<!-- chunk -->

### humans. Most of the clinical trials have been done in Russia and were

<!-- chunk -->

### done with animals.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here we talk about how GABA can affect your cognition and overall

<!-- chunk -->

### health. This research supports the idea that using Phenibut to raise GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### levels can have a profound effect on your quality of life.

<!-- chunk -->

## GABA Increases Human Growth Hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### Bodybuilders and athletes use Phenibut or even GABA to help repair and

<!-- chunk -->

### build muscle. And there are several studies supporting the notion that

<!-- chunk -->

## GABA increases Human Growth Hormone.

<!-- chunk -->

### In one study, researchers worked with 19 subjects who were given a single

<!-- chunk -->

### oral dose of 5 grams of GABA. 18 subjects were given a placebo during

<!-- chunk -->

### this trial. 3 hours after the administration of GABA, blood samples were

<!-- chunk -->

### taken. The team reported that “GABA caused a significant elevation of

<!-- chunk -->

### plasma growth hormone levels”.734

<!-- chunk -->

## GABA helps Reduce Insomnia

<!-- chunk -->

### A Los Angeles study conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled trial with 18 patients with sleep disorders. The patients received

<!-- chunk -->

### either a placebo, or Gabadone (a combination of GABA and 5-

<!-- chunk -->

### hydroxytryptophan).

<!-- chunk -->

### The difference between the two groups of sleep-deprived patients was

<!-- chunk -->

### significant. The Gabadone group fell asleep faster, stayed asleep longer,

<!-- chunk -->

### and had a better quality of sleep than the placebo group.735

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers consistently report a similar effect on sleep quality when

<!-- chunk -->

### using Phenibut.


<!-- chunk -->

### The recommended daily starting dosage of Phenibut is 200 - 300 mg for a

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxation or calming effect. Give it 2 – 4 hours before it starts to kick in.

<!-- chunk -->

### More experienced Phenibut users go with 1 – 1 ½ grams per dose. And up

<!-- chunk -->

### to 3-times per week.

<!-- chunk -->

### Since you can quickly build up a tolerance to Phenibut dosing less often is

<!-- chunk -->

### preferred. Many advise keeping Phenibut use to once or twice per week

<!-- chunk -->

### with almost no side effects and no hangover the next day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut can be very addictive for some people and the withdrawal from

<!-- chunk -->

### continuous use is particularly nasty. So if you’re going to try Phenibut

<!-- chunk -->

### make sure you follow dosage recommendations.


<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut is considered safe when taken in normal recommended doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bodybuilders who use much higher doses of Phenibut do report

<!-- chunk -->

### experiencing flushing, tingling, a spike in heart rate and blood pressure,

<!-- chunk -->

### and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can build up tolerance to Phenibut quickly. And if you have an

<!-- chunk -->

### addictive personality you should avoid using Phenibut.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most neurohackers suggest cycling Phenibut. Using recommended doses

<!-- chunk -->

### for 4 or 5 days and taking a few days off. Others suggest only using

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut once per week.

<!-- chunk -->

### You’ll have to find out what works for you if you decide to try Phenibut.

<!-- chunk -->

### And expect to have a rough ride at first. Too much and the withdrawal can

<!-- chunk -->

### be nasty.

<!-- chunk -->

### You are strongly advised not to combine Phenibut with alcohol. And

<!-- chunk -->

### absolutely DO NOT combine Phenibut with benzodiazepines.


<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut as a supplement is available in tablet, capsule, and powder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists have shown that Phenibut easily crosses the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut is an analogue of GABA developed in Russia, and it increases

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of GABA in your brain. While some report that Phenibut causes

<!-- chunk -->

### drowsiness and fatigue, it’s a much safer way to boost GABA than with a

<!-- chunk -->

### pharmaceutical like Valium or Xanax.


<!-- chunk -->

## Phenibut 200 – 300 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Phenibut (with caution) as a nootropic supplement if

<!-- chunk -->

### you’re feeling anxiety or stress. And to calm or keep in check the

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulatory effects of some nootropics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does make GABA on its own from glutamate in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most healthy people have an adequate supply of GABA. But if you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### dealing with anxiety or stress and need some extra help in calming things

<!-- chunk -->

### down, Phenibut can help.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut is particularly helpful if you’re dealing with Post Traumatic

<!-- chunk -->

### Stress Disorder (PTSD). I’ve seen reports by combat veterans who say that

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut worked far better than any prescription anti-anxiety med.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest trying a Phenibut supplement first at a dose of 200 - 300 mg.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut can be a powerful method of boosting GABA levels in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. But it also has addictive potential especially if you’re prone to

<!-- chunk -->

### addiction.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut takes 2 – 4 hours to take effect in your body. Do not yield to

<!-- chunk -->

### temptation and take more just because you’re not feeling anything.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes the beneficial effects of Phenibut are not felt until the next day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cycle your use of Phenibut to avoid tolerance and side effects. Your sweet

<!-- chunk -->

### spot could be every 2nd or 3rd day. Or even just once a week. Find out what

<!-- chunk -->

### works best for you.

<!-- chunk -->

### The ‘hangover’ from abusing Phenibut is particularly nasty. You should be

<!-- chunk -->

### able to avoid these side effects by keeping doses low. And limiting the

<!-- chunk -->

### days you use Phenibut.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely work your way up to 1,500 mg of Phenibut per day on the

<!-- chunk -->

### day that you dose. Some athletes go as high as 3,000 mg. But for nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### use, a higher dose is not necessary or recommended.


# Phenylalanine

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine enhances working memory, executive function, creative flow

<!-- chunk -->

### states, stress reduction, better mood, anti-anxiety and lessens symptoms of

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenylalanine is a highly bio-available essential amino acid. Your body

<!-- chunk -->

### naturally converts L-Phenylalanine into the amino acid L-Tyrosine which

<!-- chunk -->

### is then converted into L-DOPA. Decarboxylation of L-DOPA results in

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine.736

<!-- chunk -->

### Once converted into dopamine, the enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase

<!-- chunk -->

### converts dopamine into the neurotransmitters norepinephrine

<!-- chunk -->

### (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline). This triad of

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters are collectively referred to as “catecholamines”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine is naturally found in protein-rich foods like soybeans,

<!-- chunk -->

### cheese, nuts, seeds, beef, lamb, chicken, pork, fish, eggs, dairy, beans, and

<!-- chunk -->

### whole grains. The artificial sweetener aspartame also contains

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic supplement, you may find several different forms of

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenylalanine available. L-Phenylalanine is the natural form found in

<!-- chunk -->

## proteins. D-Phenylalanine is a mirror image of L-Phenylalanine that is

<!-- chunk -->

## made in the lab. And DL-Phenylalanine is a combination of the two

<!-- chunk -->

### forms.737

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Phenylalanine can be a highly effective nootropic for boosting cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### function because it boosts norepinephrine and dopamine production.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resulting in increased attention, motivation and working memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### D-Phenylalanine (but not L-Phenylalanine) has been used to treat chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### pain although the clinical research in this area is sparse.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Phenylalanine also stimulates the production of thyroid hormones T


<!-- chunk -->

### (triiodothyronine) and T


<!-- chunk -->

### (thyroxine) which are crucial in maintaining both

<!-- chunk -->

### overall physical and cognitive health.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid that you get from food or a

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement. The enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase converts

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine in your liver into the amino acid L-Tyrosine.738

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers prefer L-Phenylalanine over other catecholamine

<!-- chunk -->

### precursors because it supports neurotransmitter production without

<!-- chunk -->

### directly increasing neurotransmitter levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### This last part is key because indiscriminately increasing neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### across the board can lead to imbalances and tolerance. Which can defeat

<!-- chunk -->

### the purpose of taking the nootropic in the first place.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, not enough epinephrine can decrease cognition. And too

<!-- chunk -->

### much norepinephrine can decrease attention, processing speed and

<!-- chunk -->

### executive function.739

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Phenylalanine vs. D-Phenylalanine: What’s the Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid which means you must get it

<!-- chunk -->

### from food. Or as a supplement. Your body cannot synthesize

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine on its own.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Phenylalanine (LPA) is converted into the amino acid L-Tyrosine in your

<!-- chunk -->

### liver. Once L-Tyrosine crosses the blood-brain barrier, it is converted into

<!-- chunk -->

### L-DOPA. Which is further converted into the neurotransmitters dopamine,


<!-- chunk -->

### D-Phenylalanine (DPA) is a synthetic version of, and mirror image of L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine created in the lab. DPA has a different mechanism of action

<!-- chunk -->

### in the body than LPA.

<!-- chunk -->

### D-Phenylalanine (DPA) slows the action of the enzymes carboxypeptidase

<!-- chunk -->

### A or endorphinase and enkephalinase. These enzymes degrade endorphins.

<!-- chunk -->

### Slowing down these enzymes that reduce endorphins can help reduce

<!-- chunk -->

### pain.740

<!-- chunk -->

### DL-Phenylalanine is a 50/50 combination of L-Phenylalanine and D-

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine. By combining the two in theory you get the best of both an

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant and pain reducer.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does L-Phenylalanine work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Phenylalanine boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.L- Phenylalanine decreases depression. L-Phenylalanine is

<!-- chunk -->

### converted into L-Tyrosine which in turn is converted into L-DOPA

<!-- chunk -->

### in the brain. L-DOPA is then used to make the feel good

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter dopamine. So depression could be the result of not

<!-- chunk -->

### getting enough of the first amino acid (L-Phenylalanine) in the chain

<!-- chunk -->

### of events needed to produce dopamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### In one study done in Germany, 20 depressed patients received from 75-200

<!-- chunk -->

### mg per day of DL-Phenylalanine for 20 days. At the end of the trial 12 of

<!-- chunk -->

### the depressed patients could be discharged without any further treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

### of the patients had a moderate decrease in depressive symptoms. And

<!-- chunk -->

### patients showed no response.741

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.L-Phenylalanine boosts neurotransmitters. L-Phenylalanine turns

<!-- chunk -->

### into L-Tyrosine once taken as a supplement. It then converts into the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is used to control movement

<!-- chunk -->

### in your body, is fundamental to memory, attention and problem

<!-- chunk -->

### solving.

<!-- chunk -->

### The unused dopamine can then convert into the neurotransmitters


<!-- chunk -->

### Norepinephrine is important for attentiveness, emotions, sleeping,

<!-- chunk -->

### dreaming, and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

### Epinephrine drives your ‘flight-or-flight’ response. It’s what prompts your

<!-- chunk -->

### reaction to dangerous circumstances, emergency situations, or in stressful

<!-- chunk -->

### situations or environments.

<!-- chunk -->

### This balance in neurotransmitters is critical to the fully optimized, healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. And why some neurohackers choose L-Phenylalanine to allow the

<!-- chunk -->

### body to make the neurotransmitters it needs. Instead of causing an

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalance by boosting one neurotransmitter over another.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study in Venezuela investigated ADHD and autism, and the implications

<!-- chunk -->

### of amino acids on these neuropsychiatric disorders. 40 subjects affected by

<!-- chunk -->

### autism and 11 with ADHD along with 41 healthy subjects were included in

<!-- chunk -->

### this study.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found that those with ADHD had decreasing

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine and increasing glycine which disrupted their inhibitory

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmission system. Not enough phenylalanine and increasing

<!-- chunk -->

### lysine was present in those with autism.742

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study at Ohio State University looked at amino acids in 28 ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### patients. And found all subjects with ADHD had significantly lower levels

<!-- chunk -->

## of the amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, histidine, and

<!-- chunk -->

### isoleucine. The researchers concluded each subject had a general deficit in

<!-- chunk -->

### amino acid transport, absorption, or both.743


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, our brain and body chemistry and energy metabolism


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Dopaminergic neurons are damaged or die


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Thyroid hormones decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Stress levels increase

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Working memory and mood decline

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes are often attributed to aging. But could be a result of

<!-- chunk -->

### dietary and lifestyle choices. Unchecked, they could lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s, a drop in quality of life and


<!-- chunk -->

## L-Phenylalanine benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Phenylalanine can boost levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine,

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine and epinephrine. And can help a sluggish thyroid produce

<!-- chunk -->

### more T


<!-- chunk -->

### L-Phenylalanine can help boost cognition especially in stressful situations.

<!-- chunk -->

### It helps improve decision making, ‘flow state’ and creativity, cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### flexibility, and working memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Phenylalanine converts into L-Tyrosine which then converts into L-

<!-- chunk -->

### DOPA to produce dopamine. L-DOPA is also used to make melanin in your

<!-- chunk -->

### body. This conversion process helps in the removal of neurotoxic

<!-- chunk -->

### quinones. And chelates heavy metals like mercury and lead which can

<!-- chunk -->

### accumulate in and damage neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### The dopamine that is not used by your brain is available to produce

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine (noradrenaline) which is important for attentiveness,

<!-- chunk -->

### emotions, sleeping, dreaming and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Phenylalanine may be an effective nootropic when stacked with

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD/ADD meds like Ritalin or Adderall. It helps supply extracellular

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine needed to improve the effectiveness of stimulants used to boost

<!-- chunk -->

### the uptake of dopamine in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does L-Phenylalanine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Keep in mind that L-Phenylalanine is a precursor to catecholamines. So if

<!-- chunk -->

### you’re not ‘low’ on dopamine, norepinephrine or epinephrine - you may

<!-- chunk -->

### not ‘feel’ anything.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers report a lift in mood, better focus, concentration,

<!-- chunk -->

### increased energy, and an overall sense of well-being. L-Phenylalanine can

<!-- chunk -->

### help readjust your motivation levels. It can help lower anxiety levels,

<!-- chunk -->

### especially social anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with L-Phenylalanine can help bring your blood pressure

<!-- chunk -->

### down if its elevated from a stressful situation or environment. Take it

<!-- chunk -->

### before the stressful event if you can.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Phenylalanine helps buffer the effects of stimulants like caffeine or

<!-- chunk -->

### amphetamines. It helps potentiate and prolong the effects of Ritalin or

<!-- chunk -->

### Adderall, and reduces the crash.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re into athletics or do manual work, you’ll find that supplementing

<!-- chunk -->

### with L-Phenylalanine before a workout or construction job can leave you

<!-- chunk -->

### feeling great afterwards. It may help mitigate many of the effects of acute

<!-- chunk -->

### stress caused by short-term stressors.

<!-- chunk -->

### And L-Phenylalanine helps your body produce L-Tyrosine which helps to

<!-- chunk -->

### produce melanin, so you may find it easier to get a tan while at the beach.


<!-- chunk -->

## Phenylalanine as an Antidepressant

<!-- chunk -->

### Several studies have investigated using Phenylalanine for the treatment of

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. One study published in the journal Arzneimittel-Forschung

<!-- chunk -->

### looked at using DL-Phenylalanine in a small group of patients who failed

<!-- chunk -->

### to respond to popular antidepressants like MAOIs.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, researchers worked with 23 patients diagnosed with

<!-- chunk -->

### depression and who had not responded to standard antidepressants. They

<!-- chunk -->

### were given 50 or 100 mg of Phenylalanine daily for 15 days. The

<!-- chunk -->

## researchers found that Phenylalanine completely improved mood in 17 of

<!-- chunk -->

### the patients. Within 13 days of the 15-day trial.744

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study in the Journal of Neural Transmission studied DL-

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine use with 20 depressed patients. The subjects were given

<!-- chunk -->

### – 200 mg/day of DL-phenylalanine for 20 days.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study found that 8 patients completely recovered from depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### And another 4 experienced a significant improvement in mood. Another

<!-- chunk -->

### patients saw mild to moderate improvements, and another 4 did not

<!-- chunk -->

### respond to treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

## This study shows that Phenylalanine has considerable antidepressant

<!-- chunk -->

## properties. And is effective for the majority of people suffering from

<!-- chunk -->

### depression.745

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenylalanine for ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine for ADHD seems at first glance as a natural solution for

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD symptoms. It’s a precursor to the neurotransmitter dopamine which

<!-- chunk -->

### is targeted with stimulants like Ritalin and Adderall. But the very limited

<!-- chunk -->

### clinical evidence tell a different story for practical use.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this double-blind crossover study, 19 patients with ADD were given DL-

<!-- chunk -->

### phenylalanine or a placebo for 2 weeks. 13 of the ADD patients

<!-- chunk -->

### experienced a significant improvement in ADD symptoms compared to

<!-- chunk -->

### the placebo. And patients saw an improvement in mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the patients who did respond to DL-Phenylalanine lost all positive

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits within 3 months. And it’s interesting that a later study with

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD patients using L-phenylalanine (not DL-Phenylalanine) produced

<!-- chunk -->

### no clinical benefit.746

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study from 1987 treated 11 hyperactive boys for 2 weeks with D-

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine. There was no significant improvement or deterioration in

<!-- chunk -->

### behavior.747

<!-- chunk -->

### There is a modern school of thought that there are several different types

<!-- chunk -->

### of ADD and ADHD. And the symptoms are caused by malfunctions in

<!-- chunk -->

### different parts of the brain depending on the ‘type’ of ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom line is some dealing with ADHD may benefit from

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with Phenylalanine. And that DL-Phenylalanine may be the

<!-- chunk -->

### best option. Try it and see if it works for you.


<!-- chunk -->

### L-Phenylalanine suggested dosage for cognitive benefit is 500 mg up to 3-

<!-- chunk -->

### times per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### You may find your body responds to smaller doses. Or even more if your

<!-- chunk -->

### stacking it with stimulants like ADHD meds. Listen to your body and see

<!-- chunk -->

### how you react.

<!-- chunk -->

### Since L-Phenylalanine is an amino acid, for best absorption and so it’s not

<!-- chunk -->

### competing with other amino acids, take it at least an hour before food. L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine works best on an empty stomach.

<!-- chunk -->

### And take L-Phenylalanine with Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### and Vitamin C to further

<!-- chunk -->

### maximize absorption. And give your body what it needs to produce the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Phenylalanine is also needed along with L-Tyrosine to synthesize the

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 needed to create fuel within your brain’s mitochondria.


<!-- chunk -->

### L-Phenylalanine quickly turns into the non-essential amino acid L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine once you take it. So is considered non-toxic and very safe. Most

<!-- chunk -->

### neurohackers don’t have any negative side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

## Important Caution: People with phenylketonuria (PKU), and women who

<!-- chunk -->

### are breastfeeding or pregnant, should not take phenylalanine supplements.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aspartame, found in artificial sweeteners such as NutraSweet, is a source

<!-- chunk -->

## of phenylalanine. People with PKU should not use aspartame. If you are

<!-- chunk -->

### pregnant, ask your doctor about using this artificial sweetener.748

<!-- chunk -->

### At higher doses there are reports of stomach issues and migraines. Experts

<!-- chunk -->

### say that L-Phenylalanine is toxic in doses above 5000 mg. And higher

<!-- chunk -->

### doses will not give you any added benefit.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you try recommended doses of L-Phenylalanine and do not feel any

<!-- chunk -->

### benefit, then this nootropic may not be right for you. You could try L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine or NALT instead.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Phenylalanine can increase your thyroid hormones. So if you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperthyroid you shouldn’t use L-Phenylalanine.

<!-- chunk -->

### And if you’re taking MAO inhibitors (MAOI’s) like selegiline, Azilect,

<!-- chunk -->

### Marplan or Nardil you should not use L-Phenylalanine. MAOI’s work in

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain and affect neurotransmitters. So using L-Phenylalanine in

<!-- chunk -->

### combination with MAOI’s could throw off the delicate balance of

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters needed for optimal brain health and cognition. And

<!-- chunk -->

### taking L-Phenylalanine with MAOI’s could cause a severe drop in blood

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure which could lead to a heart attack or stroke.


<!-- chunk -->

### L-Phenylalanine is available in powder, capsule, and tablet form. Capsules

<!-- chunk -->

### and tablets are usually 500 mg.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine is also available as D-Phenylalanine and the 50/50

<!-- chunk -->

### combined form of DL-Phenylalanine. You may find one form works better

<!-- chunk -->

### for you than another.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ensure you read labels carefully and stick with manufacturers who follow

<!-- chunk -->

### Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). And are GMP-Certified.


<!-- chunk -->

## L-Phenylalanine 500 mg up to 3-times per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using L-Phenylalanine as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does synthesize some L-Tyrosine from phenylalanine which

<!-- chunk -->

### comes from high-protein foods like chicken, fish, almonds, avocados, and

<!-- chunk -->

### bananas.

<!-- chunk -->

### But most of us don’t get enough L-Phenylalanine from our diet. So

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation will help. And L-Phenylalanine is a highly bioavailable,

<!-- chunk -->

### natural form of this amino acid. So you should feel its effects faster.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Phenylalanine is helpful for most neurohackers to combat stress and

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep deprivation. It’ll boost dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine


<!-- chunk -->

### It’s particularly helpful if you take L-Phenylalanine prior to a stressful

<!-- chunk -->

### situation, workout, or physically demanding job.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Phenylalanine could be helpful to those dealing with ADHD/ADD. It’s a

<!-- chunk -->

### great compliment to stack with stimulant meds like Ritalin or Adderall. L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine will provide the dopamine your brain needs. It will help

<!-- chunk -->

### smooth out and prolong the effects of stimulant meds. And help prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### the associated crash when they wear off.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely use up to 1,500 mg per day when stacking with ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### meds. But dosed throughout your day.


# Phenylethylamine (PEA)

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylethylamine enhances working memory, executive function, creative

<!-- chunk -->

### flow states, stress reduction, better mood, anti-anxiety and lessens

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenylethylamine (PEA, 2-phenylethylamine, β-phenylethylamine,

<!-- chunk -->

## phenethylamine) is a trace amino acid. Your brain naturally converts L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine into Phenylethylamine (PEA).

<!-- chunk -->

### PEA is not at the top of most nootropic stack choices because its effects

<!-- chunk -->

### are so short-lived. But some neurohackers love PEA for its stimulant and

<!-- chunk -->

### mood enhancing qualities.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most famous promoter of phenylethylamine was Dr. Alexander

<!-- chunk -->

## Shulgin and his wife Anna. Dr. Shulgin published ‘PiHKAL: A Chemical

<!-- chunk -->

## Love Story’ in 1991. PiHKAL is short for “Phenethylamines I Have Known

<!-- chunk -->

### and Loved”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylethylamines are a group of phenethylamine derivatives which

<!-- chunk -->

### contain PEA as a backbone. These derivative compounds are formed by

<!-- chunk -->

### replacing one or more hydrogen atoms in the core structure.

<!-- chunk -->

### This class of PEA compounds include amphetamines, empathogens,

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulants, psychedelics, appetite suppressants, bronchodilators, nasal

<!-- chunk -->

### decongestants, and antidepressants.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the more famous PEA derivatives is

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or Ecstasy or Molly).

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Shulgin developed, tested, and published the formulas for 179 different

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds largely based around the structure of PEA in his book PiHKAL.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylethylamine (PEA) is a trace amine naturally synthesized from L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylalanine in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase converts phenylalanine to

<!-- chunk -->

### phenylethylamine. This is the same enzyme that converts phenylalanine

<!-- chunk -->

### into dopamine. And it converts it at a rate comparable to the synthesis of

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### But PEA is not retained in neuronal vesicles like dopamine is stored.

<!-- chunk -->

### Instead, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) quickly degrades PEA.749

<!-- chunk -->

### Despite its short half-life, PEA as a nootropic seems to be effective for

<!-- chunk -->

### increasing catecholamine activity by boosting dopamine and

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine.750

<!-- chunk -->

### PEA can be found naturally in many cacao, algae, fungi, and bacteria as

<!-- chunk -->

### well as clover, beans, peas, and some food products such as Natto and

<!-- chunk -->

### eggs.

<!-- chunk -->

### PEA is also found in chocolate where it is produced during cocao’s

<!-- chunk -->

### fermentation and roasting process.751

<!-- chunk -->

### PEA binds to C-protein-coupled receptors TAAR1 and TAAR2, receptors

<!-- chunk -->

### reserved specifically for trace amine use.752 These receptors are not used

<!-- chunk -->

### by other major neurotransmitters like they are dopamine or

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The half-life of PEA taken as a nootropic supplement is only 5 –

<!-- chunk -->

### minutes.753 Because it’s quickly degraded by monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-

<!-- chunk -->

### B).

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers prologue the effects of PEA by using it with a

<!-- chunk -->

### monoamine oxidase-B inhibitor (MAOI) like selegiline (L-deprenyl),

<!-- chunk -->

### hordenine, or Oat Straw.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Phenylethylamine work in the brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylethylamine boosts brain health and function in several ways. But


<!-- chunk -->

### 1.Phenylethylamine decreases depression. PEA naturally boosts the

<!-- chunk -->

### ‘feel-good’ neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have shown that depressed patients when tested have lower

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of PEA.754

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, some suggest that a PEA deficit may be the cause of depression in

<!-- chunk -->

### the first place. One study had 14 patients with major depression take up to

<!-- chunk -->

### 60 mg per day of Phenylethylamine (PEA) along with 10 mg of selegiline

<!-- chunk -->

### (L-Deprenyl) for up to 50 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers found that “PEA produces sustained relief of depression in a

<!-- chunk -->

### significant number of patients, including some unresponsive to the

<!-- chunk -->

### standard treatments. PEA improves mood as rapidly as amphetamine but

<!-- chunk -->

### does not produce tolerance.”755

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Phenylethylamine is a mesencephalic enhancer. PEA is

<!-- chunk -->

### considered a mesencephalic enhancer which is defined as

<!-- chunk -->

### “enhancer-sensitive neurons in the brain capable of working in a

<!-- chunk -->

### split-second on a high activity level due to endogenous enhancer

<!-- chunk -->

### substances”.756

<!-- chunk -->

### This means that PEA stimulates the release of dopamine, norepinephrine,

<!-- chunk -->

### and serotonin in the brain. But unlike stimulant drugs like amphetamine,

<!-- chunk -->

### which release a flood of these neurotransmitters in an uncontrolled

<!-- chunk -->

### manner.

<!-- chunk -->

### PEA instead only increase the amount of neurotransmitters that get

<!-- chunk -->

### released when a neuron is stimulated by receiving an impulse from a

<!-- chunk -->

### neighboring neuron.

<!-- chunk -->

### In other words, the pattern of the neurotransmitter release in not changed.

<!-- chunk -->

### But when the neuron would normally release a neurotransmitter, a larger

<!-- chunk -->

### than normal amount is released.757

<!-- chunk -->

### The result is nearly instantaneous improvements in cognitive performance,

<!-- chunk -->

### attention, awareness, pleasure, libido, and a sense of well-being.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylethylamine is an endogenous (natural or ‘built-in’) amphetamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### This mechanism of action of how prescription ADHD stimulants like

<!-- chunk -->

### Adderall work. And the basis for many Schedule 1 drugs like MDMA758,

<!-- chunk -->

### LSD, mescaline, and (crystal) methylamphetamine.759


<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylethylamine (PEA) is naturally metabolized by monoamine oxidase-

<!-- chunk -->

### B (MAO-B). But as we get older, MAO-B levels rise and suppress healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of PEA.

<!-- chunk -->

### Low PEA levels have been linked to several neurological diseases. And

<!-- chunk -->

### may result in:

<!-- chunk -->

## ↓ Increased chance of ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

## ↓ Increased chance of addiction

<!-- chunk -->

## ↓ Energy levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

## ↓ Working memory and mood decline

<!-- chunk -->

## ↓ Contributing to Parkinson’s Disease

<!-- chunk -->

### On the other hand, excess levels of PEA have been linked to migraines and

<!-- chunk -->

### paranoid schizophrenia.

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenylethylamine benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylethylamine (PEA) quickly crosses the blood-brain barrier once you

<!-- chunk -->

### take it. And you feel its effects right away.

<!-- chunk -->

### Activation of TAAR1 receptors inhibit the uptake and induces the release

<!-- chunk -->

### of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. It’s like turning up the

<!-- chunk -->

### volume of neuron activity.

<!-- chunk -->

### A higher concentration of all of these neurotransmitters increases feelings

<!-- chunk -->

### of pleasure, boosts motivation, improves memory and cognition, and

<!-- chunk -->

### reinforces impulse control.

<!-- chunk -->

### PEA naturally maintains and regulates neuronal activity. Preventing over-

<!-- chunk -->

### or under-stimulation. When working as designed, PEA and other trace

<!-- chunk -->

### amines prevent metabolic dysfunction and neurological disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a neurotransmitter, PEA acts like, and looks similar to amphetamines.

<!-- chunk -->

### And produces effects normally associated with taking a stimulant. But

<!-- chunk -->

### unlike amphetamines, and because PEA is endogenous to the brain, side

<!-- chunk -->

### effects and tolerance are avoided.

<!-- chunk -->

### PEA works in an area of the brain associated with emotions. Resulting in

<!-- chunk -->

### feelings of pleasure, more drive and impulse control, heightened

<!-- chunk -->

### creativity, and better sensory perception.

<!-- chunk -->

### PEA improves libido, social behavior, a sense of wellbeing, and better

<!-- chunk -->

### overall performance.

<!-- chunk -->

### PEA is currently being studied and used for the treatment of ADHD,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, bipolar disorder, cognitive dysfunction like brain fog and poor

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration. And PEA looks promising for treating addiction and eating

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Phenylethylamine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### PEA is rapidly broken down by monoamine oxidase-B (MAO) so unless

<!-- chunk -->

### you stack PEA with a MAO-B inhibitor, don’t expect its effects to last.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most experience a peak within 15 minutes and sustained energy for

<!-- chunk -->

### min. to an hour.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re ADHD or ADD, you should see an improvement in mood,

<!-- chunk -->

### attention span, focus and mental clarity. Not quite the same effect you’d

<!-- chunk -->

### get from something like Adderall but with a side benefit of more

<!-- chunk -->

### sociability.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report taking an MAOI (inhibitor) supplement 15 minutes

<!-- chunk -->

### before a PEA dose and the effects should last about 2 hours. And there’s no

<!-- chunk -->

### crash like you’d normally experience with a stimulant. Just a general

<!-- chunk -->

### feeling of well-being once it wears off.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some have reported PEA helped kick the habit of Phenibut or caffeine

<!-- chunk -->

### without going through withdrawal.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a pre-workout supplement, PEA provides a more intense and focused

<!-- chunk -->

### workout.

<!-- chunk -->

### Older neurohackers seem to feel even more benefit when using PEA.

<!-- chunk -->

### Likely because monoamine oxidase levels over-power dopamine the older

<!-- chunk -->

### you get. And using PEA, especially with a MAOI helps restore dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### and other neurotransmitters that are typically depressed with age.

<!-- chunk -->

### PEA is a great nootropic for study because you should feel less anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### fewer panic attacks and less stress. And more motivation, a better mood,

<!-- chunk -->

### easier to maintain focus, and more energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some report food cravings subside and it’s easier to lose weight.

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenylethylamine Clinical Research

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenylethylamine as an Antidepressant

<!-- chunk -->

### Depression is the 2nd leading cause of disability among ages 15 – 44. By

<!-- chunk -->

### 2030, the World Health Organization predicts depression will be the

<!-- chunk -->

### leading cause of disability worldwide.760

<!-- chunk -->

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are the most popular

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant prescribed worldwide. SSRIs work by blocking the

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin transporter and inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin. Resulting in

<!-- chunk -->

### an increase of serotonin in synapses.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the problem is SSRIs are slow to act. And come with a host of side

<!-- chunk -->

### effects. Phenylethylamine (PEA) may be an alternative to SSRIs.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study done in 2008 showed that PEA alters serotonin transporters by

<!-- chunk -->

### interacting with TAAR receptors. Increasing serotonin levels by preventing

<!-- chunk -->

### their reuptake just like prescription SSRIs.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study suggested that PEA may be a safer treatment for depression than

<!-- chunk -->

### SSRIs.761

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenylethylamine for ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### The diagnosis of ADHD has traditionally been done by analysis of

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms. But measuring PEA levels instead has recently been described

<!-- chunk -->

### as a possible biomarker for diagnosing ADHD.762

<!-- chunk -->

### This discovery of a relationship between PEA levels and ADHD has

<!-- chunk -->

### excited researchers. Because it will hopefully improve levels of confidence

<!-- chunk -->

### during ADHD diagnosis. And reduce misdiagnosis and over-medication.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study of ADHD children medicated with methylphenidate (Ritalin)

<!-- chunk -->

### had significantly higher PEA levels when using methylphenidate.763

<!-- chunk -->

### PEA binds to the TAAR1 receptor which alters monoamine transporter

<!-- chunk -->

### function. And leads to the inhibition of the reuptake of dopamine,

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin, and norepinephrine. Which then increases the concentration of

<!-- chunk -->

### these neurotransmitters in neuron synapses.764

<!-- chunk -->

### This increase in synaptic concentrations of dopamine can be accomplished

<!-- chunk -->

### by directly blocking the dopamine transporter. Which is how drugs like

<!-- chunk -->

### methylphenidate work to boost dopamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### So if you are ADHD and crave chocolate, it’s likely because cocao

<!-- chunk -->

### supplies PEA.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some naturopaths are beginning to prescribe PEA instead of stimulants

<!-- chunk -->

### like amphetamines or methylphenidate to treat ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenylethylamine Recommended Dosage

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylethylamine (PEA) suggested dosage for cognitive benefit is 500 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### up to 3-times per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### PEA has a half-life of 5 – 10 minutes.765 But the effects of PEA can be

<!-- chunk -->

### extended by using it with a MAO-B inhibitor.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you do use a potent MAOI like selegiline (l-deprenyl) make sure you

<!-- chunk -->

### keep the dose low (i.e. 2.5 mg) or you’re in danger of inhibiting MAO-A as

<!-- chunk -->

### well. More on the “cheese effect” next.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dosing more than recommended is NOT a good idea because you’ll likely

<!-- chunk -->

### feel jittery, irritable, get a headache, feel nausea, and very possibly force

<!-- chunk -->

### your heart rate to dangerous levels.

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenylethylamine Side Effects

<!-- chunk -->

## “Cheese effect”: Phenylethylamine (PEA) is metabolized by the enzyme

<!-- chunk -->

### MAO-B. And when monoamine oxidase (MAO) is inhibited by eating

<!-- chunk -->

### cheese, or any other prescription or natural MAO inhibitor (MAOI), the

<!-- chunk -->

### combination can result in a potentially dangerous increase in blood

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure.766

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show that selective MAO-B inhibition does NOT produce this

<!-- chunk -->

### cheese effect.767

<!-- chunk -->

### Examples of MAO-B selective inhibitors include low-dose selegiline (L-

<!-- chunk -->

### deprenyl), hordenine, Oat Straw, Glycyrrhiza uralensis (Chinese licorice

<!-- chunk -->

### root extract), Phellondendron amurense (Amur cork tree bark), Ferula

<!-- chunk -->

### assafoetida extract (resin), and Psoralea corylifolia (Bu Gu Zhi).

<!-- chunk -->

### Do not use Phenylethylamine (PEA) if you are using a prescription MAOI

<!-- chunk -->

### like Marplan, Nardil, Azilect or Parnate, or have used one in the last

<!-- chunk -->

### days.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do not use PEA if you have phenylketonuria (PKU).

<!-- chunk -->

### Too much PEA can cause irritability, nausea, amplified heart rate,

<!-- chunk -->

### jitteriness, and could be extremely dangerous.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember, Phenylethylamine (PEA) is an endogenous (natural)

<!-- chunk -->

### amphetamine. And used irresponsibly could produce the same dangerous

<!-- chunk -->

### side effects as anything else in the amphetamine-class of compounds.

<!-- chunk -->

## Where to buy Phenylethylamine

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylethylamine (PEA) is available in capsules, tablets, and as a bulk

<!-- chunk -->

### powder.

<!-- chunk -->

### DO NOT make the mistake of buying Phenylalanine instead of

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylethylamine (PEA). Because it’s NOT the same thing. And is easily

<!-- chunk -->

### overlooked when searching for this nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you buy PEA in powder-form, you should invest in a capsule machine

<!-- chunk -->

### and make capsules. Because PEA is a particularly nasty tasting nootropic


<!-- chunk -->

## Phenylethylamine 500 mg up to 3-times per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Phenylethylamine (PEA) as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does synthesize some Phenylethylamine from phenylalanine

<!-- chunk -->

### which comes from foods like beans, cacao, peas, Natto and eggs.

<!-- chunk -->

### But most of us don’t get enough Phenylethylamine from our diet. So

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation could help. Phenylethylamine is highly bioavailable, and

<!-- chunk -->

### quickly crosses the blood-brain barrier. So you should feel its effects soon

<!-- chunk -->

### after you take it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylethylamine is helpful for most neurohackers to combat anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### stress, and sleep deprivation. It’ll boost dopamine, norepinephrine, and

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s particularly helpful if you take Phenylethylamine prior to a stressful

<!-- chunk -->

### situation, workout, or physically demanding job. And it’s a great nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### for studying.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylethylamine could be helpful to those dealing with ADHD/ADD. It’s

<!-- chunk -->

### a possible substitute to stimulant meds like Ritalin or Adderall for some

<!-- chunk -->

### people.

<!-- chunk -->

### PEA will provide the dopamine your brain needs. And doesn’t produce the

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulant crash when it wears off.

<!-- chunk -->

### PEA works well when stacked with L-Tyrosine (for dopamine), and ALCAR

<!-- chunk -->

### and CDP-Choline (for acetylcholine).

<!-- chunk -->

### PEA is quickly degraded by monoamine oxidase-B. So to prologue its

<!-- chunk -->

### effects, stack it with a low-dose MAOI-B.


# Phenylpiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam has been shown to boost alertness, cognition, clarity,

<!-- chunk -->

### focus, learning and memory, provides a stimulant-effect, and reduces

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of depression and anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenylpiracetam ((R,S)-2-(2-oxo-4-phenylpyrrolidin-1-yl) acetamide,

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenotropil, Fenotropil, Carphedon, Fonturacetam) is a water-soluble

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic in the racetam-class of compounds.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam was created by adding a phenyl group to the original

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic Piracetam.

<!-- chunk -->

### Russian chemists synthesized Phenylpiracetam in 1983 to boost the

<!-- chunk -->

### physical and mental performance of astronauts during space flight. It’s

<!-- chunk -->

### currently used by Russian cosmonauts on the International Space

<!-- chunk -->

### Station.768

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam combats physical and mental fatigue. It enhances

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, mood and focus. It facilitates learning and retention, reduces

<!-- chunk -->

### brain fog, increases alertness and boosts physical stamina and tolerance to

<!-- chunk -->

### cold.

<!-- chunk -->

### It turns out that Phenylpiracetam is very effective in boosting athletic

<!-- chunk -->

### performance. It provides significant stimulatory effects and helps you

<!-- chunk -->

### resist cold. Leading to a ban by the World Anti-Doping Agency from use by

<!-- chunk -->

### athletes in the Olympics and other professional sports.769

<!-- chunk -->

### Russian cyclist Anton Reshetnikov was suspended in 2007 for 2 years

<!-- chunk -->

### from the International Cycling Union for using Carphedon.770 One year

<!-- chunk -->

### earlier (2006), Russian Olympic athlete Olga Pyleleva lost her silver metal

<!-- chunk -->

### for using Carphedon.771

<!-- chunk -->

### Carphedon is a brand name for Phenylpiracetam. Adding a phenyl group

<!-- chunk -->

### to Piracetam boosts the bioavailability of Phenylpiracetam. It easily

<!-- chunk -->

### crosses the blood-brain barrier and is considered 20 to 60-times more

<!-- chunk -->

### potent than Piracetam.772

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report that Phenylpiracetam enhances alertness, focus,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, and learning. It reduces brain fog. And it provides physical

<!-- chunk -->

### stamina and cold tolerance while combating physical and mental fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam helps:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Prevent Anxiety & Fear: Phenylpiracetam helps reduce symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### of anxiety and fear. Unlike popular prescription anti-anxiety and

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-depressant drugs, Phenylpiracetam has no sedative action or

<!-- chunk -->

### other adverse side effects associated with these medications.773

<!-- chunk -->

## •Neuroreceptors: Phenylpiracetam increases the density of

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine (ACh), NMDA, GABA and dopamine receptors in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain.774, 775More receptors mean more binding sites for

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters that affect memory formation, cognition, sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Cerebral Circulation: Phenylpiracetam increases blood flow in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. As a derivative of Piracetam, this nootropic has the same

<!-- chunk -->

### mechanism of action when it comes to blood flow. It suppresses the

<!-- chunk -->

### constriction of blood vessels allowing the freer flow of blood. More

<!-- chunk -->

### oxygen and nutrients get to brain cells boosting alertness, cognition,

<!-- chunk -->

### focus and mood.776

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam is also an effective treatment for epilepsy. This

<!-- chunk -->

### debilitating condition is caused by sudden surges of electrical activity in

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain. This temporary disturbance in messaging systems between brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells can cause a seizure. Normal brain function gets halted or mixed up.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is where Phenylpiracetam comes in.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam has been shown in clinical studies to affect Alpha and

<!-- chunk -->

### Beta brain waves.777 Scientists haven’t quite figured out why it works, but

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam has an ‘anti-convulsive’ action in the brain. They did

<!-- chunk -->

### conclude after one clinical trial, “Phenotropil reduced the frequency of

<!-- chunk -->

### seizures and improved cognitive function in the absence of epileptiform

<!-- chunk -->

### EEG abnormalities.”778

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam is sold as a prescription drug in Russia and several

<!-- chunk -->

### Eastern European countries. In the United States, Phenylpiracetam is sold

<!-- chunk -->

### as an unregulated OTC research compound.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Phenylpiracetam work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Phenylpiracetam as a stimulant. Phenylpiracetam increases the

<!-- chunk -->

### density of neuroreceptors. Studies have shown it increases the

<!-- chunk -->

### density of acetylcholine (ACh), dopamine, GABA, and NMDA

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors. This translates into more receptors for each of these

<!-- chunk -->

### important neurotransmitters to bind with and boost their

<!-- chunk -->

### effectiveness.

<!-- chunk -->

### The increase in density of neuroreceptors likely accounts for

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam’s stimulant-like properties. Similar to Ritalin or

<!-- chunk -->

### Adderall, this nootropic increases the effectiveness of dopamine in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. Increasing alertness, decision-making capability, and cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### But unlike stimulants like Ritalin and Adderall, Phenylpiracetam does not

<!-- chunk -->

### come with any stimulant-like side effects. You should not experience any

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue, rapid heartbeat, decreased appetite or irritability. Rather you’ll

<!-- chunk -->

### feel increased stamina, have more physical endurance and get smarter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Just don’t try using Phenylpiracetam if you’re planning on being an

<!-- chunk -->

### Olympic athlete. It was banned several years ago because it’s too effective

<!-- chunk -->

### to be used in professional sports. We don’t want an unfair advantage now,

<!-- chunk -->

### do we? J

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Phenylpiracetam decreases anxiety and depression. For similar

<!-- chunk -->

### reasons to how Phenylpiracetam works as a stimulant, it can also

<!-- chunk -->

### tame symptoms of anxiety and depression. It increases the density

<!-- chunk -->

### of receptors for acetylcholine (ACh), GABA and NMDA receptors.779

<!-- chunk -->

### This increase in receptor sites for GABA, choline and glutamate affects

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of the calming neurotransmitters GABA and serotonin in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam floods your brain with the neurochemicals you need to

<!-- chunk -->

### chill out.780


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, our brain chemistry and metabolism changes. And it

<!-- chunk -->

### seems these changes are affecting younger and younger people.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Recall, reaction time and learning capacity declines


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Density of ACh, dopamine, GABA and NMDA receptors decline


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Cerebral blood flow declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Stamina and endurance decline

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes are contributing factors to age-related cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### decline. Early signs of these effects can be seen in poor decision-making,

<!-- chunk -->

### difficulty learning, and even recalling simple things like an important

<!-- chunk -->

### appointment.

<!-- chunk -->

### But even if you’re not concerned with the signs of aging, Phenylpiracetam


<!-- chunk -->

## Phenylpiracetam benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam is highly bioavailable when used as a nootropic. Once

<!-- chunk -->

### digested it quickly gets absorbed and crosses the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam modulates neuroreceptors. It’s been shown to increase

<!-- chunk -->

### the density of receptors for GABA, NMDA, dopamine and acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### More neuroreceptors result in more of each neurotransmitter being able to

<!-- chunk -->

### bind to neurons. And affect alertness, cognition, memory, recall and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam has a positive effect on physical performance by

<!-- chunk -->

### increasing endurance and reducing physical and mental fatigue. In fact,

<!-- chunk -->

### these effects are so potent that Phenylpiracetam has been banned from

<!-- chunk -->

### professional sports by the World Anti-Doping Agency.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam has been shown to act as a stimulant. But unlike

<!-- chunk -->

### pharmaceutical drugs, it does not affect your cardiovascular or respiratory

<!-- chunk -->

### system. And does not have the side effects of jitteriness, restlessness or

<!-- chunk -->

### irritability like regular stimulants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam is also noted for increasing your threshold to tolerance

<!-- chunk -->

### for cold.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Phenylpiracetam feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers say Phenylpiracetam is the strongest nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### they’ve ever experienced. It’s highly bioavailable and you experience the

<!-- chunk -->

### effects within 30 minutes of taking it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam increases concentration, motivation, memory, physical

<!-- chunk -->

### endurance, and tolerance to cold. Learning is quicker and stress is reduced.

<!-- chunk -->

### Learning and processing information becomes easier with

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam. You’re not re-reading sentences and paragraphs trying to

<!-- chunk -->

### understand them.

<!-- chunk -->

### Short and long-term memory improves. Motor skills improve so you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### typing faster and more accurately.

<!-- chunk -->

### Those dealing with depression report a decrease in depressive symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### More confidence helps in social situations and conversations are easier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Productivity rises and you assume a “get it done’ mentality.

<!-- chunk -->

### Procrastination is a thing of the past.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam is a popular pre-workout supplement. It increases your

<!-- chunk -->

### endurance and reduces both physical and mental fatigue. And if you’re one

<!-- chunk -->

### of the unfortunate ones who live in a cold climate, you’ll find that your

<!-- chunk -->

### tolerance for cold is better.


<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam was developed in Russia in 1983. And the majority of

<!-- chunk -->

### research done with this nootropic has been conducted in Russia. Published

<!-- chunk -->

### in Russian medical journals in Russian.

<!-- chunk -->

### So we have limited clinical trial data to draw on. And like many

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics we rely on nootropic user reviews. The following is two

<!-- chunk -->

### samples of clinical trials I was able to find that have been translated into

<!-- chunk -->

### English. And published in Western medical databases.

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenylpiracetam Improves Cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### A study done by Russian researchers investigated the effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam on cognition. 99 adults aged 40 – 60 suffering from

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition deficits due to surgery or brain trauma were enrolled in this

<!-- chunk -->

### study.

<!-- chunk -->

### Volunteers were given 200 mg of Phenylpiracetam daily for 30 days. The

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers found that those using the nootropic showed a significant

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement in motor coordination, higher brain function, memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### attention and counting. And a reduction in both anxiety and depression.781

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenylpiracetam Boosts Cerebral Circulation

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Moscow recruited 400 patients suffering from ischemic

<!-- chunk -->

### stroke. This is the most common type of stroke where blood vessels

<!-- chunk -->

### carrying blood to the brain are blocked by a blood clot.

<!-- chunk -->

### Half of the group received 400 mg of Phenylpiracetam daily for a year.

<!-- chunk -->

### The control group got a placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team found that the group who received Phenylpiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### experienced a significant restoration in cognitive function and resumed

<!-- chunk -->

### daily activities. Far better than the control group who took a placebo.782


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended Phenylpiracetam dosage is 100 mg twice per day. One

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam dose in the morning, and one in the early afternoon.

<!-- chunk -->

### Don’t use Phenylpiracetam later in the day because its stimulant effect can

<!-- chunk -->

### cause insomnia.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can develop a tolerance to Phenylpiracetam, so consider taking it only

<!-- chunk -->

### on days when you need the extra focus. Or try cycling it one week on and

<!-- chunk -->

### one week off.


<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam is non-toxic. So is considered well-tolerated and safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### As with many of the racetams, Phenylpiracetam can cause headaches

<!-- chunk -->

### because it boosts the use of acetylcholine in your brain. Choline

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements like Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline can help you avoid this side

<!-- chunk -->

### effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tolerance is a problem with Phenylpiracetam and builds rather quickly.

<!-- chunk -->

### Used to often, it will soon lose its effects. So try using Phenylpiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### only when you need extra cognitive power, or before a workout. Or try

<!-- chunk -->

### cycling it one week on and one week off to avoid tolerance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers find that stacking Phenylpiracetam with a choline

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement boosts the effect even more with improved memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition. And this is supported in several research studies.


<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam is sold in tablet, capsule, and powder form. Tablets and

<!-- chunk -->

### capsules are usually 100 mg each.


<!-- chunk -->

## Phenylpiracetam 100 mg 2-times per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Phenylpiracetam as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does not make Phenylpiracetam on its own. So to get its

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits you must take it as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam is especially helpful for those suffering from ADHD or

<!-- chunk -->

### brain fog. This nootropic has a stimulant-like effect similar to that of

<!-- chunk -->

### pharmaceutical stimulants. But without the side effects of increased heart

<!-- chunk -->

### rate, irritability and restlessness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam can boost athletic performance. It has been shown to

<!-- chunk -->

### improve physical performance, increase stamina and endurance. And even

<!-- chunk -->

### provides cold-weather resistance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenylpiracetam is also particularly useful to students and executives who

<!-- chunk -->

### want to boost alertness, cognition, clarity, focus, learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### This nootropic also has anti-depressant and anti-anxiety benefits.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have shown that Phenylpiracetam can be effective in relieving the

<!-- chunk -->

### frequency of epileptic seizures in those dealing with epilepsy. It even

<!-- chunk -->

### compliments some epilepsy medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should use Phenylpiracetam with a good choline supplement like

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline. It helps boost the effectiveness of neural

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine, so demands the presence of more choline in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely boost daily intake of Phenylpiracetam to 400 mg. But be

<!-- chunk -->

### aware that tolerance to the effects of this nootropic build quickly. So I

<!-- chunk -->

### recommend using Phenylpiracetam only on days when you need the extra

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive power. Or cycle the use of this nootropic one week on, and one

<!-- chunk -->

### week off.


# Phosphatidylcholine (PC)

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is known to repair brain cells and neural

<!-- chunk -->

### connections, boost acetylcholine, and improve alertness, cognition, focus,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and mood

<!-- chunk -->

## Phosphatidylcholine (PC, or Ptd-Cho) is one of two fatty acids that make

<!-- chunk -->

### up the outer layer of the membrane covering each of the 70 trillion cells in

<!-- chunk -->

### your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylcholine is also converted in your body through a process

<!-- chunk -->

### called hydrolysis to make up the fatty acids AA, oleic, linoleic, linolenic,

<!-- chunk -->

### and DHA. These fatty acids contribute to the signaling within and between

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells for long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP is behind the formation

<!-- chunk -->

### of long-term memories.

<!-- chunk -->

### The synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) is largely

<!-- chunk -->

### dependent on the choline provided by Phosphatidylcholine. ACh is critical

<!-- chunk -->

### for cognition, learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain cells are each encased in a membrane. This bi-lipid layer of

<!-- chunk -->

### two fatty acid tails face each other. The outer layer of each cell contains

<!-- chunk -->

### mostly the phospholipids phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin,

<!-- chunk -->

### while the inner layer contains predominantly phosphatidylserine,

<!-- chunk -->

### phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylethanolamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The outer layer of each cell membrane is highly permeable. But the inner

<!-- chunk -->

### layer is much less permeable. These two fatty acid tails are in a constant

<!-- chunk -->

### state of movement, vibrating at millions of times a second. This continual

<!-- chunk -->

### vibration could be considered the ‘backbone of life’. And is the basis of

<!-- chunk -->

### everything that happens in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The amount and type of long-chain fatty acids in your diet affects the

<!-- chunk -->

### composition of these cell membranes. The structure and function of your

<!-- chunk -->

### cells depend on the ideal balance of fats including cholesterol, oleic,

<!-- chunk -->

### palmitic, and stearic fatty acids. And essential fatty acids like Omega 3.

<!-- chunk -->

### Without this proper balance, cell membrane function is compromised.

<!-- chunk -->

### When you don’t have enough phosphatidylcholine, brain cell membranes

<!-- chunk -->

### lose integrity and eventually die.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some phosphatidylcholine is naturally synthesized in your body. We also

<!-- chunk -->

### get PC from some of our food including beef, oysters, eggs, and some

<!-- chunk -->

### vegetables. As a nootropic supplement, Phosphatidylcholine is derived

<!-- chunk -->

### from lecithin found in soybeans and sunflower seeds.

<!-- chunk -->

### Note that lecithin and phosphatidylcholine are NOT the same thing. Plain

<!-- chunk -->

### lecithin is not an efficient source of phosphatidylcholine or choline. As a

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic, look for as pure of a source of phosphatidylcholine (PC) as you

<!-- chunk -->

### can afford.

<!-- chunk -->

### And you can be sure that our modern diet does not provide the ideal

<!-- chunk -->

### balance of fatty acids (phospholipids) to maintain brain cell integrity. It’s

<!-- chunk -->

### why we experience brain fog, memory loss, slow thinking and poor

<!-- chunk -->

### decision making.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some progressive health care researchers and practitioners have found that

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with phosphatidylcholine (PC) can lessen the symptoms of

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases like MS, diabetes, immune system problems, asthma, and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Phosphatidylcholine Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylcholine boosts brain health and function in several ways. But


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Phosphatidylcholine is needed for long-term memory. The

<!-- chunk -->

### hydrolysis of Phosphatidylcholine (by a process called

<!-- chunk -->

### phospholipase A2-catalyzed hydrolysis) is used to make the free

<!-- chunk -->

### fatty acids AA, oleic, linoleic, linolenic and DHA.

<!-- chunk -->

### These free fatty acids facilitate synaptic transmission by targeting

<!-- chunk -->

### nicotinic ACh receptors using protein kinase C (PKC). This messenger

<!-- chunk -->

### system is needed for long-term potentiation (LTP). Researchers have

<!-- chunk -->

### determined that these fatty acids are critical for learning and memory.783

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Phosphatidylcholine helps repair neurons. Cholinergic neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### are unique among cells because they serve two functions. PC is a

<!-- chunk -->

### major component of brain cell membranes. And serves as a storage

<!-- chunk -->

### pool for the choline needed as a precursor for acetylcholine (ACh)

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers demonstrated how this works. They incubated human

<!-- chunk -->

### cholinergic cells in the lab. And followed the metabolic link between

<!-- chunk -->

### membrane composition and turnover, and ACh synthesis. And proved that

<!-- chunk -->

### ACh is synthesized from choline derived from the degradation of

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### If there is not enough choline available to maintain brain cell membrane

<!-- chunk -->

### integrity, and to synthesize the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, brain cell

<!-- chunk -->

### function breaks down. You experience brain fog, poor memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### decision making. And ultimately leading to neurodegenerative diseases

<!-- chunk -->

### like Alzheimer’s, and other motor neuron disorders.784


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, our brain chemistry and energy metabolism changes. This

<!-- chunk -->

### can happen at any age once we enter our adult years.


<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes can happen at any age. Our bodies are influenced by

<!-- chunk -->

### the food we eat, what we drink, lifestyle habits, the air we breathe and

<!-- chunk -->

### more.

<!-- chunk -->

### So Phosphatidylcholine can help for age-related cognitive decline, as well

<!-- chunk -->

### as a student looking to do better in school.

<!-- chunk -->

## Phosphatidylcholine benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylcholine (PC) has been around as long as humans have walked

<!-- chunk -->

### this planet. PC is a critical component of the top layer of the membrane

<!-- chunk -->

### surrounding each one of the cells in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### And yet some are talking about Phosphatidylcholine as the “New Wonder

<!-- chunk -->

### Drug”. How could this be? Turns out that PC is a fatty acid. As are many

<!-- chunk -->

### of the fats we consume in our modern diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### Long-chain fatty acids affect the composition of our cell membranes.

<!-- chunk -->

### When we eat bad fats our cell membrane fluidity is affected, ion channels

<!-- chunk -->

### disrupted, hormones, regulation of neuroreceptors, signaling and other

<!-- chunk -->

### signaling chemicals are affected.

<!-- chunk -->

### Incorrect amounts or types of long chain fatty acids can lead to a cascade

<!-- chunk -->

### of serious health and cognition problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### The easiest and simplest way to correct many of these cognition problems

<!-- chunk -->

### is to supplement with Phosphatidylcholine as a nootropic. You’ll feel

<!-- chunk -->

### better as cells are repaired. Digestion issues could be eliminated or

<!-- chunk -->

### minimized. And brain fog, cognition and memory problems could become

<!-- chunk -->

### a non-issue.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Phosphatidylcholine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### If you eat a perfectly healthy diet and are in optimal physical and mental

<!-- chunk -->

### health, using Phosphatidylcholine may not do anything for you.

<!-- chunk -->

### But if you’re like most in the Western world relying on fast food,

<!-- chunk -->

### processed food and other unhealthy lifestyle habits, then PC may help.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report that supplementing with Phosphatidylcholine lifts

<!-- chunk -->

### brain fog, improves working memory and boosts alertness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Others say it helps them prevent anxiety and panic attacks. Mental clarity

<!-- chunk -->

### is improved, and energy levels rise.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ray Kurzweil, the famous inventor, and futurist, gets phosphatidylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### intravenously once a week at his health clinic. His theory is that this will

<!-- chunk -->

### rejuvenate all his body’s tissues.785


<!-- chunk -->

### A double-blind study in California with 80 college students investigated

<!-- chunk -->

### the effect of Phosphatidylcholine on memory. The students received a

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo or either 10 or 25 grams of Phosphatidylcholine (PC). 25 grams of

<!-- chunk -->

### PC was estimated to supply about 3.75 grams of choline.

<!-- chunk -->

### Memory was tested at 60 and 90 minutes after taking PC. The researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### recorded a significant improvement in memory after 90 minutes, and only a

<!-- chunk -->

### slight improvement after 60 minutes.

<!-- chunk -->

### This 1993 study was the first to test the relationship between a single dose

<!-- chunk -->

### of Phosphatidylcholine on memory in healthy human subjects.786

<!-- chunk -->

## Phosphatidylcholine Prevents Brain Cell Death

<!-- chunk -->

### Streptococcus pneumonia is the most common cause of bacterial

<!-- chunk -->

### meningitis. And is the most common cause of death from pneumonia. If it

<!-- chunk -->

### doesn’t kill you, it can cause paralysis, mental retardation and learning

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### In humans, it’s your hippocampus neurons that are the first to die as a

<!-- chunk -->

### result of meningitis. Cell death is officially called “apoptosis”. But I’m

<!-- chunk -->

### using cell death to drive a point home.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is an essential component of your cell

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes. And a deficiency of PC, either from chemicals or bad

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrition leads to cell death. And the first to go are your hippocampal

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons. The same neurons used for learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Tennessee found that a variety of brain cells die after you

<!-- chunk -->

### get pneumonia. Because it interferes with Phosphatidylcholine synthesis.

<!-- chunk -->

### And apoptosis inhibitors can’t even stop this cell death from happening.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team determined that the only way to prevent cell death from

<!-- chunk -->

### pneumonia infection was supplementing with Phosphatidylcholine. Even

<!-- chunk -->

### after the infection set in.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that supplementing with Phosphatidylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### was the best way to prevent what they called an “apoptotic cascade”. And

<!-- chunk -->

### the best therapeutic intervention.787

<!-- chunk -->

## Phosphatidylcholine Improves Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies on the effect of Phosphatidylcholine on memory are limited. So

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers in Japan decided to remedy this lack of data by testing PC in

<!-- chunk -->

### mice with dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### They administered PC to mice with dementia and to normal mice. And

<!-- chunk -->

### compared differences in memory, choline and acetylcholine concentration,

<!-- chunk -->

### and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity. ChAT is the enzyme

<!-- chunk -->

### responsible for the synthesis of acetylcholine in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found that giving phosphatidylcholine for 45 days to mice

<!-- chunk -->

### with dementia improved memory. And generally increased brain choline

<!-- chunk -->

### and acetylcholine concentrations to or above the levels of the normal

<!-- chunk -->

### control mice.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team concluded that phosphatidylcholine increases brain

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine concentration and improves memory.788


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended Phosphatidylcholine dosage is 1,200 mg to 5 grams per

<!-- chunk -->

### day. And divide your total daily dose into 2 or 3 equal doses and dosed

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout the day.

<!-- chunk -->

### To enhance bioavailability and boost absorption, take PC 30 minutes

<!-- chunk -->

### before a meal.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do not take Phosphatidylcholine with acetylcholinesterase (AChE)

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibitors since this combination may excessively increase acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### (ACh) levels and potentially cause cholinergic side effects. AChE

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibitors include donepezil (Aricept), tacrine (Cognex), rivastigmine

<!-- chunk -->

### (Exelon) and Huperzine-A.


<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylcholine is naturally produced in your body and is considered

<!-- chunk -->

### well tolerated and safe. PC is not toxic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some may experience sweating, stomach upset and diarrhea. Particularly

<!-- chunk -->

### if you’re already high in choline.


<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylcholine is sold in tablet, capsule, liquid and powder form.

<!-- chunk -->

### Capsules can run from 420 – 1,300 mg each. 500 mg of

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylcholine in powder form is equivalent to 2-level 1/8 tsp

<!-- chunk -->

### scoops.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylcholine is sometimes used interchangeably with “lecithin,”

<!-- chunk -->

### although the two are different. Choline is a component of

<!-- chunk -->

### phosphatidylcholine, and is also a component of lecithin. Although closely

<!-- chunk -->

### related, these terms are not the same.


<!-- chunk -->

## Phosphatidylcholine 1,200 mg to 5 grams per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Phosphatidylcholine as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylcholine helps build and repair cell membranes. And is found

<!-- chunk -->

### in every one of the 70 trillion cells in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can get Phosphatidylcholine from some of the food you eat. But

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylcholine is only found in foods like beef, eggs, oysters, and

<!-- chunk -->

### some vegetables. PC levels decline as you age, and you are unlikely to get

<!-- chunk -->

### nearly enough through diet. So to get its benefits you must take it as a

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylcholine is vital to maintaining optimal brain health. And has

<!-- chunk -->

### been shown to increase cognitive energy, boost brain function, enhance

<!-- chunk -->

### communication between neurons, and protect neural membranes from free

<!-- chunk -->

### radical damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest starting with a dose of at least 1,200 mg daily. And

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylcholine is a great compliment to a stack including any

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic from the racetam-family. Anything that causes an increase in

<!-- chunk -->

### uptake of acetylcholine in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### You need to provide your brain with the choline it is demanding. Or it

<!-- chunk -->

### starts cannibalizing your own brain cells to make more acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Signs that you’re lacking adequate choline are headaches.

<!-- chunk -->

### Use Phosphatidylcholine at a ratio of 1:4. For example, 250 mg of

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylcholine to 1,000 mg of Aniracetam.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have liver damage like cirrhosis, you may want to increase the dose

<!-- chunk -->

### up to 4.6 grams per day for liver repair.


# Phosphatidylserine (PS)

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine (PS) is known to improve alertness, attention,

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition, memory, recall and mood, lower anxiety, and help you lose

<!-- chunk -->

### weight

<!-- chunk -->

## Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a phospholipid component of brain cell

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes. The membrane is the outer casing surrounding each cell. PS

<!-- chunk -->

### plays a vital role in cell-to-cell signaling in the brain. And is needed to

<!-- chunk -->

### maintain the fluidity of all cell membranes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the most abundant phospholipid in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Followed by a slightly lesser amount of Phosphatidylserine (PS).

<!-- chunk -->

### PC is in the outer layer of brain cell membranes, and PS is part of the

<!-- chunk -->

### inner layer. Both are critical to maintaining optimal cognitive health. PS is

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesized from PC in the brain by exchanging the base head group with

<!-- chunk -->

### a serine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine (PS) supports the formation and sending of neural

<!-- chunk -->

### signaling within neurons. And across synaptic junctions that link one

<!-- chunk -->

### neuron with another. This cellular communication contributes to how we

<!-- chunk -->

### form memories.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine (PS) also helps produce nerve growth factor (NGF)

<!-- chunk -->

### that ensures healthy neurogenesis. And PS even assists in building

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria which are the energy source in every one of your brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### When your brain cell membranes are healthy, they are malleable, fluid and

<!-- chunk -->

### flexible. But by the time we reach our 20’s, phospholipids including

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine (PS) start declining. This outer casing starts to harden.

<!-- chunk -->

### And attention, concentration, memory, mood and learning begin to

<!-- chunk -->

### suffer.789

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is you can prevent this cellular damage from happening.

<!-- chunk -->

### The amount and type of long-chain fatty acids in your diet affects the

<!-- chunk -->

### composition of these cell membranes.

<!-- chunk -->

### The structure and function of your cells depend on the ideal balance of fats

<!-- chunk -->

### including cholesterol, oleic, palmitic, and stearic fatty acids. And essential

<!-- chunk -->

### fatty acids like Omega 3. Without this proper balance, cell membrane

<!-- chunk -->

### function is compromised.

<!-- chunk -->

### But our typical modern diet does not provide the ideal balance of fatty

<!-- chunk -->

### acids (phospholipids) to maintain brain cell health. It’s why we experience

<!-- chunk -->

### brain fog, memory loss, slow thinking and poor decision making.

<!-- chunk -->

### You naturally get Phosphatidylserine (PS) from foods like cow brains, pig

<!-- chunk -->

### spleen and chicken hearts. So there must be some merit to the saying, “Eat

<!-- chunk -->

### brains and get smarter”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, not many of us include organ meat as part of our daily meal

<!-- chunk -->

### plan. So the best way to maintain healthy levels of Phosphatidylserine

<!-- chunk -->

### (PS) in your brain is taking PS as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### PS was originally made from bovine (cow) brains. But with the mad cow

<!-- chunk -->

### disease scare, PS supplements are now made from extracts of soy or

<!-- chunk -->

### sunflower lecithin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine (PS) is arguably one of the most effective and

<!-- chunk -->

### important nootropics we have available today. PS keeps our brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy. And has a reputation for improving alertness, attention, cognition,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, recall and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Phosphatidylserine work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine boosts brain health and function in several ways. But


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Phosphatidylserine is needed for memory. PS stimulates the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### chemicals that boost neural signaling for quick, clear thinking. In

<!-- chunk -->

### fact, Phosphatidylserine is one of the most effective memory

<!-- chunk -->

### boosters known.

<!-- chunk -->

### PS has been shown that it can slow, halt and even reverse the progression

<!-- chunk -->

### of age-related cognitive decline. One study with 149 patients meeting the

<!-- chunk -->

### criteria for age-associated memory impairment were given 100 mg of

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine or a placebo for 12 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The patients who received PS showed improved performance on tests

<!-- chunk -->

### related to learning and the memory tasks of daily life. The study

<!-- chunk -->

### concluded that PS was a promising candidate for treating memory loss

<!-- chunk -->

### later in life.790

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Phosphatidylserine helps repair neurons. PS works in concert with

<!-- chunk -->

### DHA (Omega-3) to protect brain cells from damage. And boost

<!-- chunk -->

### neuronal survival.

<!-- chunk -->

### You brain is made up largely of DHA fat. The kind of fat you get from

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with Omega-3’s. And a decrease in DHA content in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain results in cognitive impairment. Studies show that Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### Disease is associated with lower Omega-3 fatty acid intake.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Canada looked at samples provided by the Memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### Aging Project. And found a significant difference in plasma fatty acid

<!-- chunk -->

### profiles of those with Alzheimer’s, mild cognitive impairment and those

<!-- chunk -->

### with perfectly healthy brains.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team found that DHA in Phosphatidylserine in both disease categories

<!-- chunk -->

### was 12-14% lower than those of healthy brains. They concluded that

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s Disease is associated with lower DHA and

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine.791

<!-- chunk -->

### Trials and clinical studies like these provide plenty of motivation to

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement with Phosphatidylserine and DHA. It will help you ward off

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative disease. DHA and PS for an optimized brain.


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, our brain chemistry and energy metabolism changes. This

<!-- chunk -->

### can happen at any age once we enter our adult years.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Brain cell membranes lose fluidity

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neurotransmitter signaling declines


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Memory declines

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes can happen at any age. And starts as early as our 20’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our cell membranes are influenced by the food we eat, what we drink,

<!-- chunk -->

### lifestyle habits, the air we breathe and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### So Phosphatidylserine (PS) can help for age-related cognitive decline, as

<!-- chunk -->

### well as a student looking to do better in school.

<!-- chunk -->

## Phosphatidylserine benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine (PS) makes up about 15% of the total phospholipid

<!-- chunk -->

### pool in your brain. PS is located mainly in the internal layer of your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cell membranes.

<!-- chunk -->

### PS is involved in governing membrane fluidity, and the regulation of all

<!-- chunk -->

### activity going on in that brain cell. PS interacts with cellular proteins,

<!-- chunk -->

### modulates the activity of neuroreceptors, enzymes, ion channels and

<!-- chunk -->

### signaling molecules.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with Phosphatidylserine improves brain function that tends

<!-- chunk -->

### to decline with age. Healthy brain cell membranes support neuroplasticity

<!-- chunk -->

### so neurons can form the connections needed to convert new experiences

<!-- chunk -->

### into memories.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine helps lower cortisol and ACTH levels during intense

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise.792 PS is even effective in relieving stress. And putting you in a

<!-- chunk -->

### better mood during exams.793

<!-- chunk -->

### Many clinical trials with PS have shown improvements in working- and

<!-- chunk -->

### long-term memory, recall, logic and even speech. Attention span increases

<!-- chunk -->

### while using PS. And motivation, socialization and initiative all increased

<!-- chunk -->

### when using Phosphatidylserine as a nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Phosphatidylserine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report that using Phosphatidylserine (PS) as a nootropic:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boosts energy levels

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improves alertness

<!-- chunk -->

### •Less brain fog

<!-- chunk -->

### •Better memory

<!-- chunk -->

### •Logical thinking improves

<!-- chunk -->

### •Concentration is better

<!-- chunk -->

### •Clarity of thought

<!-- chunk -->

### •Weight loss

<!-- chunk -->

### •Easier to remember names, phone numbers, tasks, etc.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Mood improves

<!-- chunk -->

### •Anti-anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### •Lowers cortisol

<!-- chunk -->

### •Relieves insomnia

<!-- chunk -->

### •Vivid dreams

<!-- chunk -->

### There are reports that PS helps with Tourette’s Syndrome.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine (PS) a great compliment to ADHD meds. PS helps

<!-- chunk -->

### tame the symptoms of ADHD. And doesn’t interfere with popular

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulants like Ritalin and Adderall. You may even be able to cut back on

<!-- chunk -->

### the ADHD meds once Phosphatidylserine builds up in your system.


<!-- chunk -->

## Phosphatidylserine Reduces Beta Brain Waves

<!-- chunk -->

### Beta brain waves have the most rapid pattern of all the brain waves

<!-- chunk -->

### produced in your brain. Beta waves are associated with concentration,

<!-- chunk -->

### arousal, alertness and cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### But it would be unpleasant to be in a constant state of arousal. This study

<!-- chunk -->

### in Germany gave 16 healthy subjects Phosphatidylserine (PS) for 42 days.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team tested brain wave patterns before supplementation. And again in

<!-- chunk -->

### 42 days.

<!-- chunk -->

### The main finding in this study was that chronic Phosphatidylserine

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation significantly decreases Beta brain waves. And the results

<!-- chunk -->

### showed that the PS group were connected to a more relaxed state

<!-- chunk -->

### compared to the controls.794

<!-- chunk -->

## Phosphatidylserine Reduces Stress

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have shown that Phosphatidylserine blunts the release of cortisol

<!-- chunk -->

### in response to exercise stress. And PS improves mood. In this study,

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers at the University of Wales Swansea gave young adults 300 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### of Phosphatidylserine each day for a month.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study resulted in these young adults feeling less stressed after doing a

<!-- chunk -->

### stressful arithmetic task. And they were in a better mood. The researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### concluded that PS supplementation improves mood and reduces stress even

<!-- chunk -->

### in healthy, young people.795

<!-- chunk -->

## Phosphatidylserine Improves Cognition in Athletes

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine is found in the cell membranes of most animals and

<!-- chunk -->

### plants. PS has been shown to reduce stress and increase performance in

<!-- chunk -->

### runners, cyclists and golfers.

<!-- chunk -->

### This double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to study the

<!-- chunk -->

### effects of PS on cognitive function, mood and endocrine response before

<!-- chunk -->

### and after intense exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

### 18 lower body, resistance-trained male college athletes took

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine for 14 days, or a placebo. Following 14 days of

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation, participants performed an acute bout of lower body

<!-- chunk -->

### resistance training.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mood and cognitive function were measured before, 5 minutes after and

<!-- chunk -->

### 60 minutes after exercise. And blood samples were drawn prior to, 5, 15,

<!-- chunk -->

### 25, 40 and 60 minutes after exercise. Blood was tested for cortisol and

<!-- chunk -->

### testosterone.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found that PS significantly increased cognitive function

<!-- chunk -->

### prior to exercise. And PS prevented both mood and hormones from being

<!-- chunk -->

### negatively affected prior to and following resistance exercise.796

<!-- chunk -->

## Phosphatidylserine Reduces Symptoms of ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Japan conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled trial with 36 children aged 4 – 14 years. The kids were

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosed with ADHD but had not received any conventional ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment prior to the trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### The children received 200 mg of PS or a placebo daily for 2 months. The

<!-- chunk -->

### team recorded the children’s ADHD symptoms, short-term and working

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, and mental performance.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team found that Phosphatidylserine significantly improved ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms and short-term memory. ADHD symptoms that were reduced

<!-- chunk -->

### included inattention, short-term memory, and impulsivity. The placebo

<!-- chunk -->

### group saw no improvement during the trial.797

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study with 200 ADHD children looked at the effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine combined with Omega 3’s for 30-weeks. The key

<!-- chunk -->

### finding of this trial was a significant reduction in the

<!-- chunk -->

### restlessness/impulsive scale and an improvement in emotions.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that Phosphatidylserine with Omega 3 may

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce ADHD symptoms in children with ADHD. And it was especially

<!-- chunk -->

### effective in a subgroup of hyperactive-impulsive, emotionally, and

<!-- chunk -->

### behaviorally dysregulated ADHD children.798

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom line is that if you have Adult ADD like I do, or you have

<!-- chunk -->

### children with ADHD or ADD, consider 200 mg of Phosphatidylserine for a

<!-- chunk -->

### couple of months before going with Adderall or Ritalin. And add in some

<!-- chunk -->

### Omega 3’s for good measure.

<!-- chunk -->

## Phosphatidylserine Improves Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Several studies have shown that using Phosphatidylserine as a nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### to boost memory works well both for age-related cognitive decline as well

<!-- chunk -->

### as more serious diseases like Alzheimer’s and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Tel Aviv worked with

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy elderly volunteers with age related cognitive decline. The

<!-- chunk -->

### volunteers took 100 mg of Phosphatidylserine 3-times per day for

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks. They were evaluated at the start of the trial, at 6 weeks of treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### and at the end of the trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### All but two of the volunteers showed significant improvement in memory

<!-- chunk -->

### from using Phosphatidylserine (PS). Memory and cognition improved in

<!-- chunk -->

### the first 6 weeks of PS use. And continued to get better until the end of the

<!-- chunk -->

### 12-week trial.799

<!-- chunk -->

### Another trial with 51 Alzheimer’s patients using 100 mg of

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine for 12 weeks showed that PS may be a promising

<!-- chunk -->

### candidate for the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease.800


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended Phosphatidylserine (PS) dosage is 100 mg 3-times per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re concerned about Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) like I

<!-- chunk -->

### am, make sure you find Phosphatidylserine (PS) that is non-GMO.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because most PS is derived from the lecithin of soybeans.

<!-- chunk -->

### And oddly enough a manufacturer may use both GMO and non-GMO. And

<!-- chunk -->

### not have it marked on the packaging.

<!-- chunk -->

### I’m aware of at least one supplement maker who offers non-GMO PS in

<!-- chunk -->

### their 120-count bottles. But their 60-count bottles are made with GMO

<!-- chunk -->

### soybean lecithin. Do your research.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even better is find Phosphatidylserine (PS) that is made from non-GMO

<!-- chunk -->

### sunflower lecithin. Especially if you’re allergic or react to soy.


<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine (PS) is naturally produced in your body and is

<!-- chunk -->

### considered well tolerated and safe. PS is non-toxic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some may experience insomnia or stomach upset at higher than

<!-- chunk -->

### recommended doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Medications for Alzheimer’s may interact with Phosphatidylserine

<!-- chunk -->

### because these drugs are often Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. An

<!-- chunk -->

### AChE inhibitor will increase the amount of acetylcholine (ACh) in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. And since PS increases ACh, you may end up with too much

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine.


<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine is sold in tablet or capsule form. Capsules can run

<!-- chunk -->

### from 100 to 300 mg each.

<!-- chunk -->

### Plain PS was originally sourced from cow brains. But since the mad cow

<!-- chunk -->

### disease scare, most PS supplements are now made from soybean lecithin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Enzymotec makes a unique form of Phosphatidylserine called Sharp PS®.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is made from vegetable sources that are not soy-based and is non-GMO.

<!-- chunk -->

### Several supplement makers offer this branded form of PS which they

<!-- chunk -->

### license from Enzymotec.


<!-- chunk -->

## Phosphatidylserine 100 mg 3-times per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Phosphatidylserine (PS) as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine (PS) is arguably one of the most effective and

<!-- chunk -->

### important nootropics we have available today. PS keeps our brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy. And has a reputation for improving alertness, attention, cognition,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, recall and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### PS helps lower cortisol which can help with insomnia. And provide you

<!-- chunk -->

### with a stress-free workout in the gym or on the court.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phosphatidylserine (PS) clears brain fog, boosts energy levels, helps

<!-- chunk -->

### alertness, and provides clarity to your thought process.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can get Phosphatidylserine from food. But the highest concentrations

<!-- chunk -->

### of PS are found in organ meats like cow brains and pig spleen.

<!-- chunk -->

### PS levels decline as you age starting in your 20’s. And you are unlikely to

<!-- chunk -->

### get nearly enough through diet. So to get its benefits you should take it as

<!-- chunk -->

### a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest starting with a dose of PS at 100 mg 3-times per day. Dosing

<!-- chunk -->

### should not exceed 500 mg per day. And there is little benefit to overdoing

<!-- chunk -->

### it with Phosphatidylserine (PS).


# Picamilon

<!-- chunk -->

### Picamilon is known for having a strong anti-anxiety effect while boosting

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration, focus, memory and motivation, and lowering blood pressure

<!-- chunk -->

## Picamilon (nicotinyl-y-aminobutyric acid, or N-nicotinoyl-GABA) is a

<!-- chunk -->

## derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and nicotinic acid

<!-- chunk -->

### (niacin or Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### ).

<!-- chunk -->

### Russian scientists conducted a lot of research into GABA and cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### health in the 1960’s and 70’s. The nootropics community has benefited

<!-- chunk -->

### from this research. It was the Belgians who started the development of the

<!-- chunk -->

### racetam-family of nootropics. And not too long afterwards, Russian

<!-- chunk -->

### scientists continued the research on GABA-derived compounds and gave

<!-- chunk -->

### us Phenibut and Picamilon.

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA’s role is to keep glutamate, the primary excitatory transmitter, from

<!-- chunk -->

## overwhelming your brain. Too much glutamate can cause a seizure, and

<!-- chunk -->

## too little GABA can put you in a coma. A healthy brain maintains a critical

<!-- chunk -->

### balance of GABA and glutamate.

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA acts like a “brake” on neuron circuits during stress. Low GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### levels can result in anxiety, insomnia, poor mood and restlessness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clinical studies show that boosting GABA with a supplement like

<!-- chunk -->

### Picamilon relieves anxiety, stress, and boosts the production of alpha brain

<!-- chunk -->

### waves.801 If GABA is optimized in your brain you’ll feel focused, relaxed

<!-- chunk -->

### and stress-free.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the big challenge for cognitive health is trying to boost GABA levels

<!-- chunk -->

### in the brain. GABA cannot cross the blood-brain barrier on its own. It

<!-- chunk -->

### needs help to carry it across this barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Including Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (niacin) in the Picamilon formula helps GABA to

<!-- chunk -->

### cross the blood-brain barrier. And the reason why some neurohackers

<!-- chunk -->

### prefer Picamilon when the goal is to raise GABA levels in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Picamilon is unique among GABA boosters because it can boost cerebral

<!-- chunk -->

### circulation as well.802 It increases cerebrovascular activity better than

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam and Vinpocetine. It’s even better at boosting blood flow than

<!-- chunk -->

### prescription vasodilating agents like cinnarizine, papaverine, and

<!-- chunk -->

### xanthinol niacinate.

<!-- chunk -->

## So when using Picamilon to boost GABA, you enhance cerebral

<!-- chunk -->

### circulation, and lower blood pressure. GABA even stimulates the pituitary

<!-- chunk -->

### gland to secrete Human Growth Hormone. And helps produce endorphins

<!-- chunk -->

### that make you feel good after a workout or sex.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, when you use Picamilon to normalize GABA levels you’ll

<!-- chunk -->

### improve blood flow to and within your brain. And you’ll experience a

<!-- chunk -->

### reduction in anxiety, insomnia, nervousness, restlessness and stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Picamilon exhibits the properties of a tranquilizer with a stimulating

<!-- chunk -->

### component. But unlike tranquilizer drugs, Picamilon does not induce

<!-- chunk -->

### muscle relaxation, drowsiness, or lethargy.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Phenibut Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Phenibut helps brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Picamilon boosts cognition. Picamilon is a derivative of GABA and

<!-- chunk -->

### niacin. And easily crosses the blood-brain barrier. GABA on its own

<!-- chunk -->

### cannot cross this barrier unless paired with a dedicated carrier.803

<!-- chunk -->

### When niacin is bonded to GABA the molecule easily enters the


<!-- chunk -->

### Once in the brain, Picamilon separates back into niacin and GABA. GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### works by preventing neural signaling associated with anxiety from

<!-- chunk -->

### reaching other neurons. It does this by attaching to the receptors that

<!-- chunk -->

### would otherwise excite those neurons. Over-stimulating neurons in certain

<!-- chunk -->

### areas of your brain is what causes anxiety-related symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have shown this unique combination of niacin and GABA affect

<!-- chunk -->

### the regulation of neurotransmitters in the brain. Picamilon was shown in

<!-- chunk -->

### one study on Parkinson’s disease to normalize serotonin and dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### content, and dopamine uptake in the brain.804

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Picamilon improves cerebral blood flow. Picamilon is more

<!-- chunk -->

### effective than Piracetam and Vinpocetine in improving blood flow to

<!-- chunk -->

### cerebral vessels in the brain. It easily crosses the blood-brain barrier

<!-- chunk -->

### to protect neurons against the effects of diminished oxygen flow.

<!-- chunk -->

### Improving cognitive function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Picamilon separates into niacin and GABA once it crosses the blood-brain

<!-- chunk -->

### barrier. Niacin acts as a vasodilator relaxing blood vessels and allowing

<!-- chunk -->

### the freer flow of blood in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Picamilon is often prescribed in Russia for treatment of migraine

<!-- chunk -->

### headaches. A study published in Nutrition Journal reviewed clinical trials

<!-- chunk -->

### from 1990 – 2004 looking at studies using niacin to treat migraines, and

<!-- chunk -->

### other tension-type headaches.

<!-- chunk -->

### The conclusion from this review showed niacin’s effectiveness for its

<!-- chunk -->

### vasodilatory properties in increasing cerebral blood flow. And its ability to

<!-- chunk -->

### improve mitochondrial energy metabolism.805 The result is fewer

<!-- chunk -->

### migraines and less headaches when using a nootropic containing niacin.


<!-- chunk -->

### Low levels of GABA and poor cerebral circulation are associated with a

<!-- chunk -->

### variety of health problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Anxiety806, panic attacks, stress and insomnia

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Muscle spasms, hypertension, convulsion, Tourette’s Syndrome, and

<!-- chunk -->

### epilepsy

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neurotransmitters decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ ATP energy levels decline starving mitochondria in brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### When your neurotransmitters, including GABA, are in balance, you feel

<!-- chunk -->

### motivated, productive, and energetic. And you feel calm and relaxed

<!-- chunk -->

### during downtime.

<!-- chunk -->

### When GABA levels are low you feel filled with dread, you’re constantly

<!-- chunk -->

### worried, you have racing thoughts, and you’re frequently late and

<!-- chunk -->

### disorganized.807

<!-- chunk -->

### Many people in this GABA-slump resort to high carbohydrate foods, and

<!-- chunk -->

### drugs or alcohol to relax.

<!-- chunk -->

## Picamilon benefits

<!-- chunk -->

## Picamilon is an analogue of GABA and nicotinic acid (Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### or

<!-- chunk -->

### niacin). The addition of niacin allows GABA to cross the blood-brain

<!-- chunk -->

### barrier (BBB).

<!-- chunk -->

### We need adequate GABA levels in our brain because it’s an inhibitory

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter. When we raise GABA levels by supplementing with

<!-- chunk -->

### Picamilon, we help keep glutamate in check.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glutamate is your body’s most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Which is responsible for attention span, brain energy, learning ability,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, and staying awake.

<!-- chunk -->

### So GABA is calming and glutamate is stimulating. And they must be in

<!-- chunk -->

### balance with each other for optimal cognitive health.

<!-- chunk -->

### An imbalance of these two neurotransmitters can cause fibromyalgia,

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic fatigue syndrome, poor memory and cognition, anxiety and


<!-- chunk -->

### But when these two neurotransmitters work together efficiently, you feel

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxed with no stress or feelings of anxiety. And you get a more restful

<!-- chunk -->

### night’s sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### The addition of nicotinic acid in the Picamilon formula helps improve

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition even more. One study with 96 healthy volunteers was done to

<!-- chunk -->

### determine the effects on memory with nicotinic acid.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study found that nicotinic acid (niacin) enhanced cell metabolism and

<!-- chunk -->

### oxygen supply in the brain. Resulting in an improvement in short-term and

<!-- chunk -->

### long-term memory.808

<!-- chunk -->

### Adding Picamilon to your nootropic stack can help bring GABA and

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamate back into balance.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Picamilon feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### When you balance GABA levels in your brain, you feel relaxed and calm.

<!-- chunk -->

### But many neurohackers who try using GABA as a supplement don’t feel

<!-- chunk -->

### the effects. Because the GABA molecule is too large to cross the blood-

<!-- chunk -->

### brain barrier.809

<!-- chunk -->

### Note: If you do feel the calming effects of supplementing with GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### within a ½ hour of taking it, it may mean you have a “leaky” blood-brain

<!-- chunk -->

### barrier. Not a good thing.810 Because if GABA can get through, all kinds of

<!-- chunk -->

### nasty stuff can get through too. Including toxins, undigested food particles

<!-- chunk -->

### and anything else in your blood stream that shouldn’t be in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### But here were talking about increasing our GABA levels using Picamilon.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report that adding Picamilon to their stack relieves anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### “better than Xanax”. There is less stress and they feel more relaxed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Picamilon also offers a stimulant effect providing mental clarity, dreams

<!-- chunk -->

### can be vivid, and it’s not sedating like Phenibut.

<!-- chunk -->

### Social functions could get some help with Picamilon. You could feel less

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibited, speak freely and feel more confident. Picamilon generates a

<!-- chunk -->

### calm focus without making you drowsy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some neurohackers maintain that the ‘magic’ with Picamilon is in the

<!-- chunk -->

### nicotinic acid. And I’d have to agree with this observation. It’s what

<!-- chunk -->

### provides the stimulant-effect and gives you an energized type of calmness.

<!-- chunk -->

### The cognitive benefits of niacin are considerably understated in the

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics community. Just check out the research and studies in my

<!-- chunk -->

### NADH chapter for more on the magic of niacin.


<!-- chunk -->

### Nearly all the research with Picamilon has taken place in Russia. It’s

<!-- chunk -->

### published in Russian journals in Russian. Most of these trials are not

<!-- chunk -->

### indexed in international or US medical databases.

<!-- chunk -->

### I won’t get into the politics of this type of behavior here in this book on

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics and brain optimization. I’m here to educate and collate

<!-- chunk -->

### information for you on nootropics to help cognitive health.

<!-- chunk -->

### The sources I have been able to find shows Picamilon extensively studied

<!-- chunk -->

### in animals and humans. And has been shown to act like a tranquilizer

<!-- chunk -->

### without the sedative effects of muscle relaxation, drowsiness, or lethargy.

<!-- chunk -->

### The studies show Picamilon decreases anxiety, fear, irritability and

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of emotional stress. It inhibits aggression and restores physical

<!-- chunk -->

### working capacity after stressful work.

<!-- chunk -->

### Picamilon has been proven to prevent forgetfulness, enhance memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### recall and improve mood. It decreases headaches, dizziness and tinnitus. It

<!-- chunk -->

### increases mental and motor activity in patients with anxiety and


<!-- chunk -->

### Picamilon has been shown to prevent or suppress diabetic neuropathy811,

<!-- chunk -->

### and alleviate the effects of alcohol withdrawal. It helps glaucoma, retinal

<!-- chunk -->

### and optic nerve damage812. And helps those with neurologically-based

<!-- chunk -->

### urinary problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here we talk about how Picamilon, nicotinic acid and GABA can affect

<!-- chunk -->

### your cognition and overall health. This research supports the idea of using

<!-- chunk -->

### Picamilon to raise GABA and niacin levels. And the cognitive benefits can

<!-- chunk -->

### have a profound effect on your quality of life.

<!-- chunk -->

## Picamilon increases dopamine uptake

<!-- chunk -->

### Reports by neurohackers repeatedly show that Picamilon provides a ‘calm

<!-- chunk -->

### focus’ without making you drowsy. And this study, done in the Ukraine

<!-- chunk -->

### gives us a clue on how this works.

<!-- chunk -->

### This study was done with Parkinson’s patients. It’s well know that

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin and dopamine content and dopamine uptake by neurons in

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s Disease is decreased.

<!-- chunk -->

### This research found that Picamilon normalized dopamine uptake in

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinsonism. And that Picamilon is “involved in the regulation of brain

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmission under experimental parkinsonism and can be useful in

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment of Parkinson’s disease”.813

<!-- chunk -->

## Picamilon boosts brain cell mitochondria function

<!-- chunk -->

### We know from our research on Nootropics Expert that NADH boosts ATP

<!-- chunk -->

### energy production within brain cell mitochondria. And this “energizing”

<!-- chunk -->

### effect that’s often spoken of when using Picamilon comes at least in part

<!-- chunk -->

### from its niacin component.

<!-- chunk -->

### This study done on one-month old rats looked at trauma of the brain. The

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers studied oxidative damage done on brain mitochondria 1, 4,

<!-- chunk -->

### days and 4 weeks after the trauma.

<!-- chunk -->

### The young rats were given several different nootropics to see the effect on

<!-- chunk -->

### the rat’s mitochondria. And they concluded that Picamilon had a

<!-- chunk -->

### protective effect on the function of brain mitochondria during the

<!-- chunk -->

### trauma.814

<!-- chunk -->

### Picamilon increases blood supply, oxygen saturation and blood circulation

<!-- chunk -->

### in the brain.815 This boost in blood flow816 brings the nutrients and oxygen

<!-- chunk -->

### need to create ATP within brain cell mitochondria.


<!-- chunk -->

### The recommended daily starting dosage of Picamilon for anxiety is 50 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### 2 or 3 times per day. If you’re looking for a stimulatory effect, you can

<!-- chunk -->

### safely increase your dose to 100 mg 2 or 3 times daily.


<!-- chunk -->

### Picamilon is considered safe when taken in normal recommended doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Picamilon has not been shown in clinical trials to produce any allergic or

<!-- chunk -->

### toxic effects. The only side effects noted were headache, dizziness, and

<!-- chunk -->

### nausea. And nearly always when taken above recommended doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### At higher doses Picamilon can lower blood pressure. So if you are already

<!-- chunk -->

### on blood lowering medication, or have an issue with low blood pressure,

<!-- chunk -->

### you should not use Picamilon.


<!-- chunk -->

### Picamilon as a nootropic supplement is available in powder, tablet, and

<!-- chunk -->

### capsule form. But very few major supplement retailers sell the tablet or

<!-- chunk -->

### capsule form of Picamilon. If you choose the buy bulk Picamilon powder

<!-- chunk -->

### from a vendor, make sure you ask for a genuine Certificate of Analysis to

<!-- chunk -->

### verify its authenticity.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nootropics Expert Recommendation

<!-- chunk -->

## Picamilon 50 – 100 mg 2 or 3 times per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Picamilon as a nootropic supplement if you’re feeling

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety or stress. And to calm or keep in check the stimulatory effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### some nootropics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does make GABA on its own from glutamate in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most healthy people have an adequate supply of GABA. But if you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### dealing with anxiety or stress and need some extra help in calming things

<!-- chunk -->

### down, Picamilon can help.

<!-- chunk -->

### Picamilon is particularly helpful if you’re dealing with anxiety. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### neurohackers report that Picamilon is as effective in dealing with anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### as many prescription anti-anxiety meds.

<!-- chunk -->

### Picamilon exhibits the properties of a tranquilizer with a stimulating

<!-- chunk -->

### component. But unlike tranquilizer drugs, Picamilon does not induce

<!-- chunk -->

### muscle relaxation, drowsiness or lethargy.

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to its calming effects, Picamilon may help improve your

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, recall and concentration.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is no reported added benefit to doses higher than those

<!-- chunk -->

### recommended. In fact, the reverse appears to be true. Lower recommended

<!-- chunk -->

### doses have more of a calming and cognitive effect for most people.


# Pine Bark Extract

<!-- chunk -->

### Pine Bark Extract has been shown to improve ADHD, decision-making,

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration, focus, memory, and mood

<!-- chunk -->

## Pine Bark Extract is a standardized extract of French maritime pine bark.

<!-- chunk -->

### This pine tree (Pinus pinaster) is native to the Mediterranean region.

<!-- chunk -->

### The extract of maritime pine bark called Pycnogenol contains 65 – 75%

<!-- chunk -->

### proanthocyanidins (procyanidins).817

<!-- chunk -->

### Oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) are also found in high

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrations in wide variety of plants. Including apple, pear, grapes,

<!-- chunk -->

### chocolate, wine, and tea.

<!-- chunk -->

### Professor Jacques Masquelier of the University of Bordeaux, France was

<!-- chunk -->

### the first to study oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs). The professor got

<!-- chunk -->

### his inspiration from reading about Jacques Cartier’s 1534 expedition up

<!-- chunk -->

### the St. Lawrence River.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cartier’s crew were trapped in the ice and dying of scurvy. The crew

<!-- chunk -->

### survived after native Iroquoians gave them a tea brewed from the bark and

<!-- chunk -->

### needles of pines growing by the river.

<!-- chunk -->

### Prof. Masquelier speculated pine extracts in the tea contained vitamin C

<!-- chunk -->

### and flavonoids that helped the crew’s recovery.818 In 1948, the professor

<!-- chunk -->

### isolated the first OPCs from peanut skins. And patented his extraction

<!-- chunk -->

### method of isolating OPCs from pine bark in 1951.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 1965, research was begun by Charles Haimoff, the founder of Horphag

<!-- chunk -->

### Research in Berlin. He developed a water-soluble extract of the same

<!-- chunk -->

## French maritime pine tree. Calling his extract Pycnogenol®.

<!-- chunk -->

### Throughout this chapter I may refer to Pine Bark Extract or Pycnogenol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Assume I’m talking about the same extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, Pine Bark Extract is used primarily to increase cerebral

<!-- chunk -->

### blood flow.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other uses include using Pine Bark Extract for the prevention of

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s, ADHD, high

<!-- chunk -->

### blood pressure, osteoarthritis, chronic pain, and erectile dysfunction (ED).

<!-- chunk -->

### On a molecular level, Pine Bark Extract helps with oxidative stress,

<!-- chunk -->

### membrane damage, DNA damage, inflammation, and glycation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here we’ll investigate Pine Bark Extract’s value as a nootropic to

<!-- chunk -->

### optimize cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pine Bark Extract helps:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Neurotransmitters. Pine Bark Extract helps prevent decreases in

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine and norepinephrine. And the glutathione (GSH) and GSH-

<!-- chunk -->

### disulphide reductase (GSSG-R) ratio. Neurotransmitter problems

<!-- chunk -->

### which contribute to hyperactivity in ADHD.819

<!-- chunk -->

## •Cerebral Circulation. Pine Bark Extract helps boost blood flow to

<!-- chunk -->

### and within your brain. By increasing nitric oxide which helps dilate

<!-- chunk -->

### blood vessels. And helping repair and maintain the health of the

<!-- chunk -->

### lining of blood vessels.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Neurodegenerative Disease. Pine Bark Extract prevents

<!-- chunk -->

### accumulation of oxidatively damaged proteins. And may reduce the

<!-- chunk -->

### risk of diseases like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Huntington’s.820

<!-- chunk -->

## •DNA damage – Pine Bark Extract helps reduce DNA damage

<!-- chunk -->

### caused by oxidation821

<!-- chunk -->

## •Inflammation – Pine Bark Extract inhibits proinflammatory gene

<!-- chunk -->

### expression.822 The type of inflammation implicated in diseases like


<!-- chunk -->

## •Glycation – Glycation is caused when sugar molecules bond to

<!-- chunk -->

### protein and fat molecules. Triggering oxidation and inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pine Bark Extract prevents glycation by lowering blood sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### levels.823

<!-- chunk -->

## •Membrane damage – Damage to neuron membranes disrupt

<!-- chunk -->

### neuronal communication and structure. Pine Bark Extract protects

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cell membranes from free radical damage, chelating heavy

<!-- chunk -->

### metals, restores membranes, and prevents their rupture and leakage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Helping to prevent stroke.824

<!-- chunk -->

## •Oxidative stress – Free radicals damage DNA and brain cell

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes by causing inflammation. This inflammation is

<!-- chunk -->

### implicated in neurocognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s and

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s. Pine Bark Extract reduces free radical production,

<!-- chunk -->

### boosts neuron’s natural antioxidant defense systems, and is a potent

<!-- chunk -->

### free radical scavenger.

<!-- chunk -->

### The active polyphenols called proanthocyanidins in Pine Bark Extract

<!-- chunk -->

### easily cross the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Pine Bark Extract Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## Pine Bark Extract boosts brain health and function in several ways. But


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Pine Bark Extract boosts cerebral blood flow. Pine Bark Extract’s

<!-- chunk -->

### main active component are water-soluble polyphenols. Including

<!-- chunk -->

### bioflavonoids catechin and taxifolin as well as phenol carbonic

<!-- chunk -->

### acids.

<!-- chunk -->

### Antioxidants like bioflavonoids enhance blood vessel nitric oxide (NO)

<!-- chunk -->

### synthase expression. Which then releases NO from endothelial cells

<!-- chunk -->

### (blood vessels linings).

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s a little difficult to measure blood flow in the brain. So researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study using

<!-- chunk -->

### Pycnogenol to study forearm blood flow responses to acetylcholine (ACh).

<!-- chunk -->

### The study was with healthy young men before and after 2 weeks of 180 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### per day of Pycnogenol, or a placebo. The group of men using Pycnogenol

<!-- chunk -->

### experienced a significant increase blood flow.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers then introduced an NO synthase inhibitor which

<!-- chunk -->

### completely abolished Pycnogenol-induced increases in blood flow. And

<!-- chunk -->

### concluded that it was definitely Pycnogenol that increased blood flow by

<!-- chunk -->

### boosting nitric oxide production in blood vessels.825

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Pine Bark Extract boosts cognition. Neurohackers report that

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with Pine Bark Extract has a significant effect on

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, focus, decision-making and mood. And researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### verified this in a clinical setting.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, 60 participants aged 35-55 volunteered to work with

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers. Diet, alcohol, and lifestyle patterns, including exercise, were

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled. Half the group received 50mg of Pycnogenol 3-times per day

<!-- chunk -->

### for 12 weeks. The other half simply followed a healthy lifestyle.

<!-- chunk -->

### After 12 weeks of Pycnogenol supplementation, results showed a 16%

<!-- chunk -->

### increase in mood, an 8.9% increase in mental performance, 13.4%

<!-- chunk -->

### increase in sustained attention, and a 30% decrease in oxidative stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### A 13% increase in attention span may not seem like a big deal. But the

<!-- chunk -->

### National Center for Biotechnology Information reported that the average

<!-- chunk -->

### American’s attention span has reduced from 12 seconds to 8 seconds.826

<!-- chunk -->

### This decrease in attention span can have a profound effect on productivity

<!-- chunk -->

### and quality of work produced. So supplementing with Pine Bark Extract

<!-- chunk -->

### could be the simplest way to dramatically increase your productivity and

<!-- chunk -->

### income. And get that next promotion.


<!-- chunk -->

### Poor cerebral blood flow, inflammation, and free radicals (oxidative

<!-- chunk -->

### stress) can damage your brain. And one of the ways this manifests is

<!-- chunk -->

### memory loss. Left unchecked, it can develop into serious

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓Cognitive function declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓Heavy metals kill brain cells from the inside

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓Free radicals destroy neurons and synapses

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑Anxiety, depression and moodiness increase

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓Attention, concentration, and memory declines

<!-- chunk -->

### Poor cerebral circulation causes a domino effect in the brain affecting

<!-- chunk -->

### many critical processes. Memory, cognition, and decision-making all suffer

<!-- chunk -->

### as a result.

<!-- chunk -->

## Pine Bark Extract benefits

<!-- chunk -->

## Pine Bark Extract and Pycnogenol are Oligomeric proanthocyanidins

<!-- chunk -->

### (OPCs). And OPCs have been extensively researched since the 1040’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Professor Jacques Masquelier published his doctoral thesis in 1948 on

<!-- chunk -->

### OPCs, phytochemistry and human health. Masquelier discovered that

<!-- chunk -->

### OPCs could neutralize free radicals which were identified in a number of

<!-- chunk -->

### degenerative conditions and age-associated changes in the body. He found

<!-- chunk -->

### that OPCs were potent antioxidants.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 1965, Horphag Research of Germany began research on their patented

<!-- chunk -->

### water-soluble Pine Bark Extract called Pycnogenol. More than 370 clinical

<!-- chunk -->

### studies have since been conducted. Showing Pine Bark Extract benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### for:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Cognitive functions including memory, mood, and ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### •Antioxidant & anti-inflammatory properties

<!-- chunk -->

### •Cardiovascular benefits preventing heart disease and stroke

<!-- chunk -->

### •Diabetes by controlling blood glucose levels

<!-- chunk -->

### •Eye health by improving blood flow to tiny capillaries in the eye

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improved sperm quality and erectile dysfunction

<!-- chunk -->

### •Menstrual disorders including PMS symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### •Joint health including osteoarthritis, mobility, flexibility, and

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic pain

<!-- chunk -->

### •Oral health including gum bleeding and plaque formation

<!-- chunk -->

### •Respiratory functions like taming asthma and hay fever

<!-- chunk -->

### •Sports nutrition for energy, recovery, cramps, and better blood flow

<!-- chunk -->

### •Overall blood vessel health827

<!-- chunk -->

### Pine Bark Extract and the patented Pycnogenol are powerful, multi-modal

<!-- chunk -->

### defenses against aging, diseases, and overall brain health.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Pine Bark Extract feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Pycnogenol and Pine Bark Extract are one of the most potent antioxidants

<!-- chunk -->

### ever discovered. Many neurohackers report having more energy. And an

<!-- chunk -->

### improved attitude while using this supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### The effects of Pine Bark Extract are often not felt immediately. But seem

<!-- chunk -->

### to build over time. For some, you’ll feel a boost in energy about 6 hours

<!-- chunk -->

### after taking it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Adding Pine Bark Extract to your stack should have you thinking faster

<!-- chunk -->

### and clearer. You may get more done. And stay focused on things longer

<!-- chunk -->

### until you’re able to finish them.

<!-- chunk -->

### But chances are you may not ‘feel’ anything at all. Until later you realize

<!-- chunk -->

### that you feel ‘normal’. And find you’re able to recall words and names

<!-- chunk -->

### much more easily. Over the long-haul you may realize you have more

<!-- chunk -->

### stamina and energy. It simply makes you feel good.

<!-- chunk -->

### Older neurohackers report Pine Bark Extract:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reduces age spots, varicose veins, and spider veins

<!-- chunk -->

### •Hair, skin, and nails look smoother and take on a healthy glow

<!-- chunk -->

### •You don’t bruise as easily

<!-- chunk -->

### •Allergies and sinus issues clear up

<!-- chunk -->

### •Blood sugar levels return to normal after 2-3 months

<!-- chunk -->

### •No more hemorrhoids

<!-- chunk -->

### •Leg, joint and knee pain are reduced

<!-- chunk -->

### •Runners can go longer without feeling exhausted

<!-- chunk -->

### •You don’t feel completely burnt out after a workout

<!-- chunk -->

### •You may be able to lift more weight and not get as sore

<!-- chunk -->

### Male neurohackers nearly always report more frequent and harder

<!-- chunk -->

### erections. Especially when stacking with L-Arginine. And a higher sperm

<!-- chunk -->

### count. Which is backed by science.828

<!-- chunk -->

### Long term users say they consistently feel calmer, can think quicker, and

<!-- chunk -->

### have better memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## Pine Bark Extract Clinical Research

<!-- chunk -->

## Pine Bark Extract boosts Working Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Australian researchers worked with 101 patients (aged 60 – 85 years) in a

<!-- chunk -->

### double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants received 150 mg of

<!-- chunk -->

### Pycnogenol daily for 3 months.

<!-- chunk -->

### The cognitive tasks measured in the study included attention, working

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, episodic memory, and psychomotor performance. The study

<!-- chunk -->

### found statistical evidence that the Pycnogenol-group developed better

<!-- chunk -->

### working memory as a result of using Pycnogenol.829

<!-- chunk -->

## Pine Bark Extract for Improved Cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### This 12-weeks study was conducted in Italy with 60 professionals aged 35-

<!-- chunk -->

### 55 years. Half the group received 150 mg per day of Pycnogenol. And the

<!-- chunk -->

### other half took a placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### At 12 weeks the improvement in the Pycnogenol-group was more

<!-- chunk -->

### significant than the controls. Free radicals were reduced by 30.4%. The

<!-- chunk -->

### group showed improvement in spatial memory retention. Alertness,

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, and contentedness all improved.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that Pycnogenol improved cognitive function,

<!-- chunk -->

### and mental performance.830

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study in Italy was done with university students. The objective of

<!-- chunk -->

### the study was to test supplementation with Pycnogenol on cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### function, attention, and mental performance.

<!-- chunk -->

### 53 students (18-27 years) were given Pycnogenol for 8 weeks. Another

<!-- chunk -->

### group of students took a placebo. The study found that the students who

<!-- chunk -->

### used the nootropic experienced better sustained attention, memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### executive function, and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study concluded that Pycnogenol improves cognitive function in

<!-- chunk -->

### normal students.831

<!-- chunk -->

## Pine Bark Extract for ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### Several studies have been conducted with Pine Bark Extract and its effects

<!-- chunk -->

### on those with ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study in the Slovak Republic gave ADHD children either a placebo or

<!-- chunk -->

### Pycnogenol for one month.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research has shown that concentrations of catecholamines (dopamine and

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine (NA)) were higher in urine of ADHD patients compared to

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy children.

<!-- chunk -->

### Higher concentrations of NA correlated with degree of hyperactivity. And

<!-- chunk -->

### both adrenaline and NA concentrations correlated with higher blood levels

<!-- chunk -->

### of oxidized glutathione (GSSH).

<!-- chunk -->

### Treatment of Pycnogenol with ADHD children decreased dopamine and

<!-- chunk -->

### NA urine concentrations. And increased the GSH/GSSG ratio. Leading to

<!-- chunk -->

### less hyperactivity. And reduced oxidative stress.832

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study in Slovakia was conducted with 61 ADHD children. The

<!-- chunk -->

### kids were given 1mg/kg/day of Pycnogenol for 4 weeks in this

<!-- chunk -->

### randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The children were examined at the

<!-- chunk -->

### beginning of the trail. And tested again one month later.

<!-- chunk -->

### Results of the study showed those who used Pycnogenol had a significant

<!-- chunk -->

### reduction in hyperactivity, improved attention and visual/motor skills, and

<!-- chunk -->

### better concentration.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study concluded that Pycnogenol could be used as a natural

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement to relieve ADHD symptoms in children.833

<!-- chunk -->

## Pine Bark Extract Recommended Dosage

<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dosage of Pine Bark Extract containing 95%

<!-- chunk -->

### proanthocyanidins is up to 100 mg 3-times per day. Or 1.4 mg per pound

<!-- chunk -->

### of body weight. So if you’re 200 pounds, your daily dose would be

<!-- chunk -->

### mg.

<!-- chunk -->

### Higher dosing should be divided equally with your first dose in the

<!-- chunk -->

### morning, next dose at noon and a dose mid-afternoon.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pine Bark Extract is water-soluble so can be taken with water or mixed in

<!-- chunk -->

### a smoothie.

<!-- chunk -->

## Pine Bark Extract Side Effects

<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects for Pine Bark Extract and Pycnogenol are rare when taken in

<!-- chunk -->

### doses from 50 – 450 mg daily. Very rarely will you experience dizziness,

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach problems, headache, or mouth ulcers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pycnogenol can boost your immune system. So if you’re on medication for

<!-- chunk -->

### auto-immune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus, rheumatoid

<!-- chunk -->

### arthritis, and others. Or taking an immune suppressant for an organ

<!-- chunk -->

### transplant. You should avoid using Pine Bark Extract or Pycnogenol.

<!-- chunk -->

### High doses of Pycnogenol may increase bleeding if you are dealing with a

<!-- chunk -->

### bleeding condition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Very high doses of Pycnogenol may decrease blood sugar too much if

<!-- chunk -->

### you’re dealing with diabetes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pycnogenol may slow blood clotting. So stop using this nootropic if you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### planning on having surgery or dental work.

<!-- chunk -->

## Type of Pine Bark Extract to Buy

<!-- chunk -->

### The bioactive component of Pine Bark Extract are proanthocyanidins.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pycnogenol is standardized to 65-75% proanthocyanidins. Regular Pine

<!-- chunk -->

### Bark Extract is often standardized to 95% proanthocyanidins.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pine Bark Extract supplements are available as a powder, capsules, and

<!-- chunk -->

### tablets. Check the label for the concentration of proanthocyanidins.


<!-- chunk -->

## Pine Bark Extract (Pycnogenol) 300 - 400 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Pine Bark Extract or Pycnogenol® as a nootropic


<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Pine Bark Extract on its own. So you must take

<!-- chunk -->

### it as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pine Bark Extract easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and is available

<!-- chunk -->

### within an hour of taking it. Effects are more typically felt within 6 hours

<!-- chunk -->

### of taking it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pine Bark Extract is especially helpful for those suffering from brain fog

<!-- chunk -->

### or memory loss. It helps increase cerebral blood flow and bringing more

<!-- chunk -->

### oxygen and nutrients to brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pine Bark Extract is helpful for those dealing with ADHD. Research

<!-- chunk -->

### shows the extract helps modulate dopamine and norepinephrine in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. Which is a common problem with those dealing with ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taken for ADHD symptoms, Pine Bark Extract helps reduce hyperactivity,

<!-- chunk -->

### improves focus and attention, improves memory, and puts you in a better

<!-- chunk -->

### mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pine Bark Extract is also helpful for those suffering from Alzheimer’s. It

<!-- chunk -->

### has been shown to boost blood flow to areas of the brain affected by

<!-- chunk -->

### amyloid-β protein aggregation. And even may prevent the proteins from

<!-- chunk -->

### forming.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pine Bark Extract helps tame inflammation associated with diseases like

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s. And studies are now underway to determine if Pine Bark

<!-- chunk -->

### Extract can help prevent Alzheimer’s from taking hold in the first place.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely take up to 450 mg of Pine Bark Extract (95%

<!-- chunk -->

### proanthocyanidins) daily if needed. Half the dose first thing in the

<!-- chunk -->

### morning. And the other half at noon. And your final dose mid-afternoon.

<!-- chunk -->

### And for memory, Pine Bark Extract is great to stack with most of the

<!-- chunk -->

### racetams. Neurohackers also report good success stacking the extract with

<!-- chunk -->

### Bacopa Monnieri, Lion’s Mane, and Rhodiola Rosea.


# Piperine

<!-- chunk -->

### Piperine has been shown to amplify the effects of nootropics, decrease

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, improve mood and boost memory

<!-- chunk -->

## Piperine is an alkaloid extracted from Black Pepper (Piper Nigrum). And

<!-- chunk -->

### used to increase the bioavailability and metabolism of nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements and drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Black Pepper (Piper Nigrum) is a flowering vine native to south India. Its

<!-- chunk -->

### dried fruit is used world-wide as a spice and seasoning.

<!-- chunk -->

### Piperine was discovered in 1819 by Hans Christian Ørsted who isolated it

<!-- chunk -->

### from Piper Nigrum. This is the same Danish chemist who figured out that

<!-- chunk -->

### electric currents create magnetic fields.834

<!-- chunk -->

### Piperine’s effects are similar to grapefruit juice and St. John’s wort.

<!-- chunk -->

### Piperine makes nootropics and pharmaceuticals more bioavailable by

<!-- chunk -->

## inhibiting the drug transporter P-glycoprotein and inhibiting the major

<!-- chunk -->

## drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4 primarily in your liver.835

<!-- chunk -->

### This action amplifies the effect of nootropics by preventing elimination in

<!-- chunk -->

### your liver and urine. And allowing increased absorption for use by your

<!-- chunk -->

### body and brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### But Piperine does more than just boost the action of your nootropic stack.

<!-- chunk -->

### It acts as a nootropic as well. In this chapter we investigate how Piperine

<!-- chunk -->

### can help optimize your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research has found Piperine can protect against oxidative damage by

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibiting free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Piperine protects

<!-- chunk -->

### against oxidative stress. And has been found to have anti-mutagenic and

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-tumor capabilities.836

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Piperine work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Piperine boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Piperine is an anti-depressant. Piperine is a monoamine oxidase

<!-- chunk -->

## (MAO) inhibitor (MAOI). Piperine inhibits both MAO-A and MAO-

<!-- chunk -->

### B. Research has found that Piperine is as effective as the popular

<!-- chunk -->

### pharmaceutical antidepressant Prozac® (fluoxetine).837

<!-- chunk -->

### Piperine has a profound effect on serotonin in the brain. Piperine has been

<!-- chunk -->

### shown in the lab to provide a substantial increase in serotonin (5-HT) in

<!-- chunk -->

### both the hippocampus and frontal cortex.838

<!-- chunk -->

### And this is where it gets very interesting. Scientists found that combining

<!-- chunk -->

### Piperine with Resveratrol provided significant antidepressant action. But

<!-- chunk -->

### this stack also offered relief from oxidative stress, inflammation and

<!-- chunk -->

### provided neuroprotection.839

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol on its own is a good antidepressant. And Piperine also

<!-- chunk -->

### provides antidepressant action as a MAO Inhibitor and serotonin booster.

<!-- chunk -->

### When combined, Piperine also boosts the bioavailability of Resveratrol.

<!-- chunk -->

### This combination is a potent natural antidepressant. Without the side

<!-- chunk -->

### effects that come with prescription MAOI’s and SSRI’s.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Piperine boosts bioavailability. Piperine inhibits the drug

<!-- chunk -->

## transporter P-glycoprotein, and the major drug-metabolizing

<!-- chunk -->

## enzyme CYP3A4. This can have profound implications on how well

<!-- chunk -->

### and how much of each nootropic in your stack actually gets to your


<!-- chunk -->

### Your liver protects you by attaching a glucuronide molecule to nootropics

<!-- chunk -->

### (and drugs) which sends a signal for them to be excreted in your urine.

<!-- chunk -->

### This process prevents excessive levels of nootropic supplements (and

<!-- chunk -->

### drugs) in your body. But it can also work against your brain optimization

<!-- chunk -->

### goals.

<!-- chunk -->

### A great example is curcumin, the bioactive compound found in turmeric.

<!-- chunk -->

### You will not experience the medicinal properties of curcumin when taken

<!-- chunk -->

### on its own. Curcumin has very poor bioavailability when taken as a

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement because of its rapid metabolism in your liver and intestinal

<!-- chunk -->

### wall.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in India gave mice 2 grams/kilogram of curcumin and tested

<!-- chunk -->

### blood levels over 4 hours. Very small amounts of curcumin were detected

<!-- chunk -->

### in blood in the first 2 hours.

<!-- chunk -->

### The scientists then administered the same amount of curcumin combined

<!-- chunk -->

### with 20 mg/k of Piperine. Blood levels of curcumin were detected sooner

<!-- chunk -->

### with Piperine added. And stayed in the blood longer. Bioavailability of

<!-- chunk -->

### curcumin in mice increased by 154% when combined with Piperine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers then tried the experiment with humans. A 2-gram dose of

<!-- chunk -->

### curcumin on its own was not detectable in blood samples. But curcumin

<!-- chunk -->

### combined with Piperine in humans made a profound difference.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2-grams of curcumin combined with 20 mg of Piperine in humans showed

<!-- chunk -->

## up in blood samples within 15 minutes. And Piperine increased the

<!-- chunk -->

## bioavailability of curcumin by 2000%.840


<!-- chunk -->

### The job of our liver is to clear our body of unwanted compounds and

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins. And excrete them as waste through our urine. But some of the

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics and especially prescription drugs are seen as “foreign matter”

<!-- chunk -->

### by our liver. The nootropics are eliminated as ‘waste’ even if our intention

<!-- chunk -->

### was to benefit our body and brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### To make matters even worse, add aging to the mix. And then our brain

<!-- chunk -->

### chemistry and energy metabolism changes.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine levels decline


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Toxins, oxidation and free radicals damage neurons


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Bioavailability of nootropics and supplements decline

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes can happen at any age. And some are contributing

<!-- chunk -->

### factors to the neurodegenerative diseases of aging, including Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is where Piperine can help.

<!-- chunk -->

## Piperine benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Research from hundreds of studies have shown that Piperine will:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boost the bioavailability of nootropics

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increase the effectiveness of nootropics

<!-- chunk -->

### •Work as an antidepressant

<!-- chunk -->

### •Relieve oxidative stress

<!-- chunk -->

### •Prevent inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### •Provide neuroprotection

<!-- chunk -->

### •Protect against tumors and cancers

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Piperine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Piperine on its own has antidepressant capabilities. So you may feel your

<!-- chunk -->

### mood improve.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are using curcumin or turmeric for its anti-inflammatory benefit,

<!-- chunk -->

### you’ll likely find that these supplements will be much more effective in

<!-- chunk -->

### relieving pain by adding Piperine.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should notice a substantial benefit in the effectiveness of most

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics and prescriptions meds when stacked with Piperine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some neurohackers report a reduction in anxiety (that can be caused by

<!-- chunk -->

### some supplements) by taking it with Piperine.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are dealing with arthritis, you may find pain levels will decrease by

<!-- chunk -->

### using Piperine. This nootropic is a potent anti-inflammatory even on its

<!-- chunk -->

### own.

<!-- chunk -->

### You may be able to reduce the amount of some nootropics and medications

<!-- chunk -->

### by stacking them with Piperine. Because the effectiveness of most of these

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements and meds will get a boost by combining them with Piperine.


<!-- chunk -->

## Piperine Potentiates the Effects of Curcumin

<!-- chunk -->

### Stress in everyday life puts every one of us in danger of developing some

<!-- chunk -->

### type of cognitive disorder. And curcumin is a proven therapy to help

<!-- chunk -->

### protect us from this assault on our cognition and brain health.

<!-- chunk -->

### To help illustrate what happens in our brain when under stress, scientists

<!-- chunk -->

### subjected male Laca mice to stress-induced cognitive impairment for

<!-- chunk -->

### days.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic stress impaired memory, locomotor activity, elevated toxins like

<!-- chunk -->

### nitrate, decreased the master antioxidant glutathione, damaged

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria enzyme function, reduced acetylcholine levels, and

<!-- chunk -->

### increased stress cortisol levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers then treated the mice with either 200 or 400 mg/k per day of

<!-- chunk -->

### curcumin. All of the damage caused by stress was reversed to a certain

<!-- chunk -->

### extent.

<!-- chunk -->

### Then the team added 20 mg/k of Piperine to a reduced daily curcumin (100

<!-- chunk -->

### or 200 mg/k) supplement. The results clearly demonstrated that Piperine

<!-- chunk -->

### enhanced the bioavailability of the curcumin. And greatly potentiated the

<!-- chunk -->

### effects against stress-induced cognitive impairment.841

<!-- chunk -->

## Piperine as an Antidepressant

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers injected mice with 60 mg/k of Piperine. An hour after the

<!-- chunk -->

### injection, the team measured serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine

<!-- chunk -->

### levels. Serotonin levels were significantly higher in the cerebral cortex of

<!-- chunk -->

### the mice. Dopamine levels were markedly higher in the hippocampus,

<!-- chunk -->

### midbrain and cerebellum. And norepinephrine levels were lower in every

<!-- chunk -->

### part of the brain.842

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists in Korea analyzed Piperine (ethanol extract) for its monoamine

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidase (MAO) inhibitor capabilities. Piperine showed an inhibitory effect

<!-- chunk -->

### against MAO-A and MAO-B.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team found that Piperine exhibited the same type of antidepressant

<!-- chunk -->

### effect in the brain as the popular prescription drug Prozac® (fluoxetine).

<!-- chunk -->

## The researchers concluded that Piperine possesses potent anti-depressant

<!-- chunk -->

## properties. And Piperine is a promising pharmacotherapeutic candidate as

<!-- chunk -->

### an antidepressant agent.843

<!-- chunk -->

## Piperine Protects Against Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### A study conducted in Thailand looked at Piperine’s effect on memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegeneration in an animal model of Alzheimer’s Disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Adult male Wistar rats were given Piperine at doses ranging from 5,

<!-- chunk -->

### and 20 mg/k of body weight for 2 weeks before and 1 week after

<!-- chunk -->

### artificially induced Alzheimer’s-like conditions in the rat’s brain.

### The results showed that Piperine at all dosage ranges significantly

<!-- chunk -->

### improved memory impairment and neurodegeneration in the hippocampus.

<!-- chunk -->

### The scientists speculated the mechanism of action for Piperine to produce

<!-- chunk -->

### these effects could be a decrease in lipid peroxidation and the

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholinesterase enzyme. (This enzyme degrades acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### the hippocampus.844


<!-- chunk -->

### The recommended dosage of Piperine to enhance bioavailability of

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic supplements is 5 - 20 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many nootropic stacks and some supplement formulas (i.e. curcumin,

<!-- chunk -->

### turmeric and resveratrol) come pre-stacked with the appropriate dose of

<!-- chunk -->

### Piperine.


<!-- chunk -->

### Piperine is an extract of Black Pepper and considered non-toxic and safe to

### use at recommended doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Piperine potentiates the effect of nearly all nootropic supplements and

### prescription medications. So be very aware that boosting the effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### certain supplements or drugs could produce unwanted consequences.

<!-- chunk -->

### Be cautious of using Piperine in addition to Piperine that may already be

### You can also get Piperine by grinding black peppercorns on your food. The

<!-- chunk -->

### problem is there is no way to measure how much Piperine you’re actually

# Piracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam has been shown to increase cerebral circulation, improve

<!-- chunk -->

### creativity and verbal fluency, boost memory, learning and recall and

<!-- chunk -->

### improve mood

<!-- chunk -->

## Piracetam (2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine-acetamide, Nootropil) was the first in the

<!-- chunk -->

## racetam-family of nootropic compounds. It is a water-soluble ampakine

<!-- chunk -->

## nootropic. AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic)

<!-- chunk -->

### refers to one of three glutamate receptors in your brain.845

<!-- chunk -->

## Developed by a fellow of famous Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov, Dr.

<!-- chunk -->

## Corneliu Giurgea first synthesized Piracetam at Belgian-based

<!-- chunk -->

### pharmaceutical company UCB Pharma in the 1964. Piracetam is

<!-- chunk -->

### considered the first true nootropic ever developed.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a cyclic derivative of GABA, Piracetam was first intended to be a

<!-- chunk -->

### calming type of drug for motion sickness. But in spite of its connection

<!-- chunk -->

### with GABA, Piracetam didn’t show the behavior usually associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### this calming neurotransmitter. And cannot directly affect GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors.846

<!-- chunk -->

### Instead, Dr. Giurgea discovered that Piracetam was able to boost cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### even in healthy people. The company launched this new ‘drug’ as

<!-- chunk -->

### ‘Nootropil’ in Europe in the early 1970’s. The success of Nootropil soon

<!-- chunk -->

### allowed UCB Pharma to expand its operations which led to many new

<!-- chunk -->

### pharmaceutical drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Giurgea coined the term “nootropic” to describe this class of

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition-optimizing compounds.847 Nootropic was derived from the

<!-- chunk -->

### Greek words for “mind” (noos) and “towards” (trepein).

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam is sold as a prescription drug (Nootropil and Lucetam) in

<!-- chunk -->

### Europe. In South America, Piracetam is sold under the names Noostan

<!-- chunk -->

### (Argentina), Breinox (Venezuela and Ecuador), and Nootropil (Mexico).

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam is also branded as Lucetam, Oikamid, Smart, Geratam,

<!-- chunk -->

### Biotropil, Neurobasal, Stimulan and Nocetan in countries around the

<!-- chunk -->

### world.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the United States, Piracetam is sold as an OTC supplement as

<!-- chunk -->

## Piracetam and Nootropil.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dozens of racetam derivatives have since been developed based on the

<!-- chunk -->

### original Piracetam. All synthetic compounds, racetams share a pyrrolidone

<!-- chunk -->

### nucleus.

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam is a cyclic derivative of GABA. But oddly enough, it doesn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### affect GABA receptors in the brain. Instead, Piracetam was found to

<!-- chunk -->

### modulate AMPA and NMDA receptors and improve the function of the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh).

<!-- chunk -->

### AMPA and NMDA receptors along with acetylcholine are associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### learning and memory.848 And when Piracetam is stacked with a choline

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement its effects are even more pronounced. Researchers have shown

<!-- chunk -->

### in hundreds of clinical studies that Piracetam significantly improves

<!-- chunk -->

### learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam also increases cerebral blood flow. Blood delivers oxygen and

<!-- chunk -->

### glucose needed for cellular metabolism and helps carry away cellular

<!-- chunk -->

### waste. Critical for the highly optimized brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re going to start experimenting with racetams, my recommendation

<!-- chunk -->

### is to start with Piracetam. Because it works, it’s safe and it’s cheaper than

<!-- chunk -->

### all the other nootropics in the racetam-family.

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam helps:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Inflammation: Piracetam is a potent analgesic (anti-pain). This

<!-- chunk -->

### analgesic effect is related to inhibition of inflammatory markers

<!-- chunk -->

### including IL-1β. And the prevention of reduced glutathione, ferric

<!-- chunk -->

### reducing ability and free radical scavenging ability.849

<!-- chunk -->

## •Neurotransmitters: Piracetam potentiates the flow of and increases

<!-- chunk -->

### the effect of acetylcholine (ACh) in the brain.850 And studies have

<!-- chunk -->

### shown it significantly improves learning and memory.851

<!-- chunk -->

## •Cerebral Blood Flow: Piracetam increases blood flow in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain.852 Better blood flow delivers more oxygen and nutrients to

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons improving cognition, memory and focus.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Piracetam work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Piracetam modulates AMPA and NMDA receptors in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### And improves the flow of acetylcholine (ACh) and sensitivity and

<!-- chunk -->

### density of ACh receptors.853

<!-- chunk -->

### This German study conducted with lab mice showed Piracetam elevated

<!-- chunk -->

### NMDA receptor density. And normalized the way those receptors worked

<!-- chunk -->

### with L-Glutamate similar to that of a healthy brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Deficits at the level of NMDA receptors could be one of the mechanisms

<!-- chunk -->

### of action underlying age-related cognitive decline. And the researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### concluded that Piracetam showed cognition-enhancing properties.854

<!-- chunk -->

### This effect on NMDA receptor sites is directly related to our interest in

<!-- chunk -->

### using Piracetam for Long-Term Potentiation and the support of long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### memory formation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neuroplasticity is dependent on activation of NMDA receptors.855 And this

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroplasticity is at the heart of memory formation. Reviews of Piracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### used by neurohackers frequently report the return of long-lost memories.

<!-- chunk -->

### Further proof of the efficacy in using Piracetam to support learning and


<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Piracetam increases cerebral blood flow. Several studies have

<!-- chunk -->

### shown how Piracetam positively influences brain blood flow.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cerebral blood flow is critical for the highly optimized brain. Blood

<!-- chunk -->

### delivers oxygen and glucose needed for cellular metabolism and

<!-- chunk -->

### helps carry away cellular waste.856

<!-- chunk -->

### Strokes can be caused by an interruption in cerebral blood flow. Starving

<!-- chunk -->

### parts of the brain of oxygen and glucose. This double-blind, placebo-

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled study was done with 24 stroke patients. One group received

<!-- chunk -->

### 2,400 mg of Piracetam twice daily, and the other a placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### Before treatment, both groups were comparable in performance during

<!-- chunk -->

### language tasks. The study found that Piracetam improved recovery of

<!-- chunk -->

### various language functions. And this effect was attributed to increased

<!-- chunk -->

### blood circulation to areas of the brain related to language. The placebo

<!-- chunk -->

### group showed very little improvement in areas of language.857


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, our brain chemistry and metabolism changes. And it

<!-- chunk -->

### seems these changes are affecting younger and younger people.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Recall, reaction time and learning capacity declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ ATP energy levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Density of AMPA and NMDA receptors decline


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Cerebral blood flow declines

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes are contributing factors to age-related cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### decline. Early signs of these effects can be seen in poor decision-making,

<!-- chunk -->

### difficulty learning, and even recalling simple things like an important

<!-- chunk -->

### appointment.

<!-- chunk -->

### But even if you’re not concerned with the signs of aging, Piracetam can

<!-- chunk -->

### help.

<!-- chunk -->

## Piracetam benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam helps increase blood flow in the brain, improves oxygen levels,

<!-- chunk -->

### enhances glucose use in brain cells, maintains brain cell mitochondria and

<!-- chunk -->

### ATP synthesis.

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam is also a potent modulator of AMPA-sensitive glutamate

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors in neurons. It increases the density of specific binding sites for

<!-- chunk -->

### AMPA in neuronal synapses.858

<!-- chunk -->

### Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in your brain. This

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamate activity by Piracetam affects alertness, focus, attention, memory

<!-- chunk -->

### and learning. And one of the reasons why neurohackers consistently report

<!-- chunk -->

### that Piracetam improves mental performance and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam increases high-affinity choline uptake (HACU) which is the

<!-- chunk -->

### process that occurs in cholinergic nerve endings and facilitates

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine (ACh) formation. Boosting ACh with Piracetam produces a

<!-- chunk -->

### powerful effect on learning and memory.859

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam also boosts choline receptor density in the frontal cortex. The

<!-- chunk -->

### area of your brain used for working memory and decision-making.860

<!-- chunk -->

### ATP energy is critical to your brain’s survival. Brain cells must produce all

<!-- chunk -->

### of their own ATP from glucose and oxygen. This brain energy

<!-- chunk -->

### carbohydrate metabolism depends on cerebral blood flow, oxygen uptake

<!-- chunk -->

### and glucose. Piracetam enhances this glucose utilization and increases

<!-- chunk -->

### ATP synthesis within brain cell mitochondria.861

<!-- chunk -->

### And Piracetam has analgesic (anti-pain) benefits. This anti-pain action is

<!-- chunk -->

### linked to Piracetam’s anti-inflammatory properties.862 Inflammation can

<!-- chunk -->

### cause pain, and studies have shown Piracetam can have profound effect on

<!-- chunk -->

### pain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam boosts acetylcholine so you should add a good choline source.

<!-- chunk -->

### Try Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline with Piracetam. And give your brain the

<!-- chunk -->

### choline it needs.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Piracetam feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Most neurohackers report a noticeable benefit from Piracetam after about

<!-- chunk -->

### 2 weeks. Consider that Piracetam is modulating your brain’s chemistry.

<!-- chunk -->

### And this change is unlikely to occur immediately.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain needs some time to adjust to the new change in acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### (ACh) levels and how it uses it. Increased cerebral blood flow takes a

<!-- chunk -->

### while to bring up levels of oxygen and nutrients. And for your neuronal

<!-- chunk -->

### cells to respond. Your mileage may vary depending on your own neuro-

<!-- chunk -->

### chemical makeup.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many suggest starting with an ‘attack dose’ for the first 3-days. A 3,000

<!-- chunk -->

### mg ‘attack dose’ of Piracetam for example to start with theoretically gets

<!-- chunk -->

### more of the supplement into your system right away. So it takes less time

<!-- chunk -->

### to build up before you start feeling the effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### From there, step down to a maintenance dose and vary the quantity until

<!-- chunk -->

### you find your own sweet spot.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once you begin to notice the effects of Piracetam you’re likely to feel a

<!-- chunk -->

### mood boost, less social anxiety, heightened creativity, improved verbal

<!-- chunk -->

### fluency and better memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam does boost your brain’s use of acetylcholine. So you will likely

<!-- chunk -->

### find that adding a good choline source (Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline) to

<!-- chunk -->

### your Piracetam stack helps improve the effectiveness of this nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### And help avoid a ‘racetam-headache’.


<!-- chunk -->

## We have plenty of evidence that Piracetam improves memory in animals

<!-- chunk -->

### and people who are suffering from many types of cognitive impairment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Keep in mind that most of the scientific research available for nootropics

<!-- chunk -->

### is done for sick people trying to get well.

<!-- chunk -->

### The return on investment for research at institutions and universities

<!-- chunk -->

### comes from treating diseases. And not from helping ordinary biohackers

<!-- chunk -->

### like us trying to get a competitive advantage at work or in school.

<!-- chunk -->

### We can however extrapolate the findings from these studies and learn if

<!-- chunk -->

### and how something like Piracetam can help our memory and cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once-in-awhile someone does take the time to conduct such a study on

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy people. Like this one done with normal, healthy volunteers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers gave this healthy group of participants four 400 mg capsules

<!-- chunk -->

### of Piracetam 3-times per day (4,800 mg total) for 14 days. No effects on

<!-- chunk -->

### memory were observed after 7 days during this experiment. But after

<!-- chunk -->

### days verbal learning had significantly increased.863

<!-- chunk -->

## Piracetam Improves Cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Belgium (where Piracetam originated) conducted an

<!-- chunk -->

### analysis of 19 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies done with patients

<!-- chunk -->

### suffering dementia or cognitive impairment and who took Piracetam.

<!-- chunk -->

### The results of this meta-analysis demonstrated the difference between

<!-- chunk -->

### people who used Piracetam or used a placebo. The end result of this

<!-- chunk -->

### analysis provided compelling evidence for the usefulness of Piracetam in a

<!-- chunk -->

### diverse group of people with cognitive impairment.864

<!-- chunk -->

### Several studies and user reviews have shown that Piracetam dosage makes

<!-- chunk -->

### a difference. And unlike some other nootropics where you start at a lower

<!-- chunk -->

### dose and work your way up, with Piracetam I recommend you start at a

<!-- chunk -->

### higher dose.

<!-- chunk -->

### This study in Germany with 78 elderly patients showed that there was a

<!-- chunk -->

### significant difference in cognition improvement while dosing Piracetam at

<!-- chunk -->

### 1,600 mg 3-times per day (4,800 mg total). There was no difference in

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition with patients who received 800 mg 3-times per day.865

<!-- chunk -->

## Piracetam Enhances ATP Production

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam is used around the world to treat cognitive impairment in aging,

<!-- chunk -->

### brain injuries, dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease. Several studies show

<!-- chunk -->

### that Piracetam enhances ATP production, mitochondrial membranes, and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurite outgrowth in neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, scientists investigated the effects of Piracetam on

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function. Human brain cells were treated with Piracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### under normal conditions and under conditions imitating aging and damage

<!-- chunk -->

### by ROS (reactive oxygen species). And with cells representing early-stage


<!-- chunk -->

### The cells representing Alzheimer’s conditions showed impaired

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function under baseline conditions. Piracetam was able to

<!-- chunk -->

### restore this impairment in cells and shift mitochondrial function back to

<!-- chunk -->

### normal.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers showed that Piracetam is able to repair mitochondria in

<!-- chunk -->

### those with mild Alzheimer’s and return cell function back to normal.866


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended Piracetam dosage is 1,600 mg 3-times per day. One

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam dose in the morning, and one in the early afternoon, and one

<!-- chunk -->

### later in the afternoon.

<!-- chunk -->

### You will likely want to start with an ‘attack dose’ when you’re first

<!-- chunk -->

## starting out with Piracetam. Refer to the “How does Piracetam feel?”

<!-- chunk -->

### section of this chapter for more on ‘attack doses’.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dosing Piracetam varies widely between neurohackers. Experimenting and

<!-- chunk -->

### finding the dose where you experience the most benefit is key. You may

<!-- chunk -->

### find a lower dose works well for you. Or you may find you need to

<!-- chunk -->

### increase your dose even more. Dosing Piracetam is directly related to your

<!-- chunk -->

### own unique neurochemistry.


<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam is non-toxic. So is considered well-tolerated and safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### As with many of the racetams, Piracetam can cause headaches because it

<!-- chunk -->

### boosts the use of acetylcholine in your brain. Choline supplements like

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline can help you avoid this side effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers find that stacking Piracetam with a choline

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement boosts the effect with improved memory and cognition. And

<!-- chunk -->

### this is supported in several research studies.867


<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam is sold in tablet, capsule and powder form. Tablets and capsules

<!-- chunk -->

### are usually 800 mg each.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Europe, Asia, South America, and some other countries around the

<!-- chunk -->

### world, Piracetam is a prescription drug. And sold under many different

<!-- chunk -->

### brand names (including Nootropil). Refer to the Introduction of this

<!-- chunk -->

### chapter for some of these brand names.


<!-- chunk -->

## Piracetam 1,600 mg 3-times per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Piracetam as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does not make Piracetam on its own. So to get its benefits you


<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re going to start experimenting with racetams, my recommendation

<!-- chunk -->

### is to start with Piracetam. Because it works, it’s safe and it’s cheaper than

<!-- chunk -->

### all the other nootropics in the racetam-family.

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam is especially helpful for those suffering from most types of age-

<!-- chunk -->

### related cognitive decline.

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam is also particularly useful to students and executives who want

<!-- chunk -->

### to boost cognition, learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should use Piracetam with a good choline supplement like Alpha GPC

<!-- chunk -->

### or CDP-Choline. It helps boost neural acetylcholine, so demands the


<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely boost daily intake of Piracetam to 9,600 mg if needed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have shown that Piracetam is completely non-toxic even at high

<!-- chunk -->

### doses. You may find however that a lower dose than my recommended

<!-- chunk -->

### amount works better for you.

### flavonoids.868

<!-- chunk -->

## In Chinese, it is called “Yuan Zhi” and has traditionally been used for

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and to prevent Alzheimer’s and dementia. In Korean traditional

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine, it is used as an anti-psychotic because it is a serotonin and

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine receptor antagonist869

<!-- chunk -->

### Polygala Tenuifolia is officially listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia

<!-- chunk -->

### Commission, 2015.

<!-- chunk -->

### The rhizome of Polygala Tenuifolia is used in making cough medicine and

### inflammation, learning and memory, dementia, anxiety, energy, and

<!-- chunk -->

## cancer.871

<!-- chunk -->

### In 2014, a study conducted at the Peking Union Medical College in Beijing

<!-- chunk -->

### found Polygala Tenuifolia extract worked as an acetylcholinesterase

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibitor (AChE) which increases acetylcholine activity in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers also found Polygala Tenuifolia extract acted as a

<!-- chunk -->

### monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) which increases dopamine and

### weeks. The study found those supplementing with BT-11 showed

<!-- chunk -->

### significant increases in working memory but not the placebo group.874

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Polygala Tenuifolia for depression. In animal studies, the

<!-- chunk -->

## compound 3,6′-disinapoyl sucrose (DISS) found in Polygala

<!-- chunk -->

### Tenuifolia has been shown to inhibit both MAO-A and MAO-B,

<!-- chunk -->

### reduces cortisol release, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity

<!-- chunk -->

### (which causes oxidative stress).

<!-- chunk -->

### The reduction of cortisol, oxidative stress, and increased dopamine and

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine release acts has consistently been shown to act as an anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### depressant.875


<!-- chunk -->

### Neurotransmitter dysfunction, oxidative stress, increased cortisol, and

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation often results in:

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Increased depression

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Memory loss

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Insomnia

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Obesity

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Anxiety

### and norepinephrine in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### This ancient Chinese herb helps reduce cortisol, inhibits inflammation,

<!-- chunk -->

### and regulates glutamate AMPA receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

### Polygala Tenuifolia extract has been shown to reduce the proinflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

### cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6,

<!-- chunk -->

### and IL-8 levels in the hippocampus. Which has been shown in animal

<!-- chunk -->

### studies to have a significant effects on learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Polygala Tenuifolia boosts the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic

<!-- chunk -->

### factor (BDNF) and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), increase synaptic

<!-- chunk -->

### plasticity, and decrease the accumulation of amyloid β-protein implicated

<!-- chunk -->

### in Alzheimer’s Disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### It has also been found to increase dopamine neurons and improve motor

<!-- chunk -->

### impairment in Parkinson’s Disease.877

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers consistently report Polygala Tenuifolia is a potent anxiolytic

<!-- chunk -->

### and reduces anxiety quickly especially when used sublingually.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Polygala Tenuifolia feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report feeling calmer and more focused the first day they

<!-- chunk -->

### used Polygala Tenuifolia. For some it can take a week or two to feel the

<!-- chunk -->

### full benefit of this supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some say it provides a nice but small mood boost and they prefer it over

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort.

<!-- chunk -->

### Polygala Tenuifolia seems to be effective for Seasonal Affective Mood

<!-- chunk -->

### Disorder (SAD).

<!-- chunk -->

### The calming benefit of Polygala Tenuifolia is more pronounced and

### giving a f**k feeling”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Used sublingually, some say using Polygala Tenuifolia was more effective

<!-- chunk -->

### for sleep than any other nootropic they’ve tried.

<!-- chunk -->

### Polygala Tenuifolia is a game-changer for some because it gives them the

<!-- chunk -->

### mental space to become the observer and be more mindful. Making it

<!-- chunk -->

### easier to recognize and mitigate negative thought patterns.

<!-- chunk -->

### Like any nootropic supplement, Polygala Tenuifolia will not work for

# PQQ

<!-- chunk -->

### PQQ helps create new mitochondria in brain cells, is a very potent

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant, stimulates Nerve Growth Factor, and boosts energy, cognition,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and learning

<!-- chunk -->

## PQQ (pyrroloquinoline quinone or methoxatin) is a very potent

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant and plays a significant role in cognition and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### PQQ is the first nutrient discovered that promotes the growth of new

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria (mitochondriogenesis) in your cells. Brain cells have a

<!-- chunk -->

### higher concentration of these little cellular power plants than most other

<!-- chunk -->

### cells in your body.883

<!-- chunk -->

### You can have anywhere from two to several thousand mitochondria in each

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cell. They even have their own DNA. When you increase the number

<!-- chunk -->

### of mitochondria, you have more cellular energy to power through your


<!-- chunk -->

### PQQ was only discovered recently. But it’s been around for a very long

<!-- chunk -->

### time. So don’t roll your eyes when some New Ager claims that we’re made

<!-- chunk -->

### of stardust. PQQ was discovered aboard NASA’s spaceship “STARDUST”

<!-- chunk -->

### in interstellar dust particles.884

<!-- chunk -->

### PQQ was first recognized as an enzyme cofactor in bacteria by Norwegian

<!-- chunk -->

### biochemist Jens Hauge in 1964.885 It wasn’t until 2003 that Japanese brain

<!-- chunk -->

### researcher Tadafumi Kato found that PQQ also occurs in rodents and other

<!-- chunk -->

### mammals, including humans.

<!-- chunk -->

### As an enzyme cofactor, PQQ is critical to the life of your brain cells. And

<!-- chunk -->

### some would say it’s even critical to life itself. “Cofactors” are molecules

<!-- chunk -->

### that act as a helper for enzymes that need assistance to work properly.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recent studies verify the unique ability of PQQ to stimulate the creation

<!-- chunk -->

### of new mitochondria.886 And to improve the function of your existing

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. But why would you want to hack your mitochondria?

<!-- chunk -->

### It is an understatement to overstate the dramatic impact this has not only

<!-- chunk -->

### in your brain. But in your entire body. Mitochondria’s role is to convert the

<!-- chunk -->

### food we eat into energy that powers cells to perform at peak function.

<!-- chunk -->

### This process of mitochondriogenesis stops and reverses brain cell death,

<!-- chunk -->

### and brain degeneration. PQQ is the only nutrient that can do this. And

<!-- chunk -->

### more energy in your brain cells means quicker thinking, better memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### amped-up alertness, less mental fatigue and more.

<!-- chunk -->

## PQQ stimulates the growth of new neurons through the promotion of nerve

<!-- chunk -->

## growth factor (NGF) in brain cells. Resulting in improved memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition and learning.887

<!-- chunk -->

### PQQ is also a potent antioxidant mopping up free radicals that would

<!-- chunk -->

### otherwise damage brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### PQQ is used in every cell in your body. And is particularly useful in brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells. It’s about a close you can get to a vitamin without ‘officially’ being

<!-- chunk -->

### declared a vitamin.

<!-- chunk -->

### You get PQQ from some of the food you eat including beans, celery, cocoa,

<!-- chunk -->

### fermented foods (i.e. tempeh, natto), kiwi, papaya, parsley, potatoes,

<!-- chunk -->

### spinach and wine. Babies get it from breast milk.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does PQQ work in the brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## PQQ boosts brain health in several ways. But two in particular stand out.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1.PQQ promotes the growth of new mitochondria. This is the only

<!-- chunk -->

### known nutrient that can perform this function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are the source of life and death for neurons. They generate

<!-- chunk -->

### your neuron’s energy and control its death. But mitochondria tend to

<!-- chunk -->

### develop defects as we age.

<!-- chunk -->

### As these defects accumulate, mitochondria start to malfunction. This

<!-- chunk -->

### results in a reduction in cellular energy production. And cells die.

<!-- chunk -->

### The result of this dysfunction can be brain fog, cognition problems, poor

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and recall. And ultimately neurodegenerative diseases like

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, stroke, and others.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show that PQQ protects against this cellular damage by repairing

<!-- chunk -->

### and helping to create new mitochondria. Studies with mice and rats and

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminating PQQ from their diet have shown reduced mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### To demonstrate how this process works, scientists added PQQ to mouse

<!-- chunk -->

### cells in the lab. And they showed that PQQ activated the cAMP response

<!-- chunk -->

### element-binding protein (CREB), and peroxisome proliferator-activated

<!-- chunk -->

### receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha). This pathway is

<!-- chunk -->

### known to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis.888

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.PQQ helps grow new neurons. This unique nutrient promotes the

<!-- chunk -->

### production of nerve growth factor (NGF). Assisting in brain cell

<!-- chunk -->

### repair, maintenance, and regeneration. Including many of the cells

<!-- chunk -->

### that are crucial for cognition, memory and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

### NGF is especially important for maintaining neuroplasticity. This process

<!-- chunk -->

### is how brain cells form connections to communicate with each other. And

<!-- chunk -->

### is how we learn new stuff and then record it to memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### By stimulating the production of NGF, PQQ has been found to protect

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and cognition in both animals and humans.

<!-- chunk -->

### In one study, scientists demonstrated PQQ’s ability to promote the healing

<!-- chunk -->

### of injured nerves. The team used 90 healthy White Wistar rats and divided

<!-- chunk -->

### them into 3 groups. The rats had injured (purposely) sciatic nerves. And

<!-- chunk -->

### were treated with Vitamin E, PQQ or combination of both.

<!-- chunk -->

### The scientists found that 12 weeks after surgery and the introduction of

<!-- chunk -->

### PQQ to the wound, the nerves grew back! They concluded that the

<!-- chunk -->

### combination of Vitamin E with PQQ promoted nerve regeneration.889

<!-- chunk -->

### Another way that PQQ influences new neuron development is by

<!-- chunk -->

### protecting neuron stem and progenitor cells from glutamate toxicity

<!-- chunk -->

### (oxidative damage). This allows neurons to survive and potentially form

<!-- chunk -->

### new brain cells.890


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, the chemistry in our brain cells and energy metabolism


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neurons degenerate

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Recall, reaction time, memory, and mood diminish


<!-- chunk -->

### But even if things haven’t degenerated to such a debilitating level, PQQ


<!-- chunk -->

## PQQ benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Research from hundreds of studies have shown that PQQ will:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boost energy levels and stamina

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reduce fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improve sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reduce the possibility of age-related diseases

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improve cognition, memory, learning and recall

<!-- chunk -->

### •Repair damage caused by strokes

<!-- chunk -->

### •Protects against Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s

<!-- chunk -->

### •Lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol891

<!-- chunk -->

### PQQ is an extremely powerful antioxidant. For example, PQQ is able to

<!-- chunk -->

### carry out 20,000 catalytic conversions, compared only 4 for Vitamin C.892

<!-- chunk -->

### The studies in Parkinson’s Disease prevention and PQQ are particularly

<!-- chunk -->

### interesting. And applicable to neurohackers of any age.

<!-- chunk -->

### We are exposed to pesticides in most of the fruit and vegetables we pick

<!-- chunk -->

### up at the supermarket. And who knows what kind of brain damage we

<!-- chunk -->

### subject ourselves to every day just from the food we eat.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the lab, animals (rats and mice) have a pesticide injected directly into

<!-- chunk -->

### their brain to induce Parkinson’s-like symptoms. In one study, PQQ not

<!-- chunk -->

### only showed a protective effect against pesticide caused brain damage. It

<!-- chunk -->

### actually preserved brain mitochondria near control levels.893

<!-- chunk -->

### The message here is buy organic food, or supplement with PQQ. And you

<!-- chunk -->

### may be able to avoid getting Parkinson’s Disease later in life. (I do both

<!-- chunk -->

### just to be on the safe side ).

<!-- chunk -->

## How does PQQ feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria biogenesis means that your body is creating new

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. PQQ increases the number of mitochondria in your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells. And throughout your body where energy demands are high.

<!-- chunk -->

### Increasing your body’s mitochondria is one of the anti-aging ‘holy grails’.

<!-- chunk -->

### Boosting these tiny cellular energy power plants can prevent further

<!-- chunk -->

### damage. It can add overall energy to daily life. And maybe even slow

<!-- chunk -->

### down the aging process.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report dramatic improvements in mental and physical

<!-- chunk -->

### energy when adding PQQ to their nootropic stack. And I recommend

<!-- chunk -->

### adding CoQ10 for the synergistic effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### PQQ has a cumulative effect and benefits should continue to improve over

<!-- chunk -->

### continued usage. For some the effects are immediate. For others it could

<!-- chunk -->

### take 2 or 3 months of dosing PQQ every day or every 2nd day.

<!-- chunk -->

### PQQ is particularly effective if you’ve suffered mitochondrial damage

<!-- chunk -->

### from using statins.

<!-- chunk -->

### Memory improves and you’ll be able to think things through more easily.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alertness gets a boost. And better vision and less eyestrain if you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### working on a computer or staring at a screen all day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Blood pressure readings could normalize. And you’ll feel refreshed and

<!-- chunk -->

### well-rested when waking up.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are dealing with Fibromyalgia, you may get some benefit from PQQ

<!-- chunk -->

### with alleviating your chronic pain.


<!-- chunk -->

## PQQ Improves Mood

<!-- chunk -->

### This study in Japan investigate the effectiveness of supplemental PQQ on

<!-- chunk -->

### stress, fatigue, quality of life and sleep. 17 adult male and female subjects

<!-- chunk -->

### took 20 mg of PQQ daily for 8 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### Changes in stress, fatigue, quality of life measures and sleep were

<!-- chunk -->

### evaluated. The study showed that vigor, fatigue, tension-anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, anger-hostility and confusion improved following

<!-- chunk -->

### administration of PQQ.

<!-- chunk -->

### Measures for quality of life, appetite, sleep, obsession and pain also

<!-- chunk -->

### improved significantly. The volunteers also showed significant

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement in sleepiness at awakening, sleep onset and maintenance,

<!-- chunk -->

### and sleep duration.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that supplementing with PQQ improved sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### quality and duration, mood improved due to less fatigue, and appetite,

<!-- chunk -->

### pain and obsession all showed improvement. And that PQQ is a “useful

<!-- chunk -->

### dietary supplement”.894

<!-- chunk -->

## PQQ Improves Cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### PQQ is effective on its own in improving brain function. But when it is

<!-- chunk -->

### combined with CoQ10 the results are even more astounding. This synergy

<!-- chunk -->

### was first observed in animal studies. And was further demonstrated in a

<!-- chunk -->

### double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Japan.

<!-- chunk -->

### 71 middle-aged and elderly volunteers ages 40 – 70 were supplemented

<!-- chunk -->

### with 20 mg per day of PQQ. The result was an improvement on tests of

<!-- chunk -->

### higher cognitive function compared to placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### Then the research team gave the volunteers 20 mg of PQQ along with

<!-- chunk -->

### mg of CoQ10. And the results in improved cognitive function were even

<!-- chunk -->

### more dramatic. PQQ and CoQ10 are both involved in mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### function. So these results did not come as a big surprise.895

<!-- chunk -->

## PQQ Boosts Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Many older adults experience problems with memory and other cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### functions. And these issues seem to be happening to younger and younger

<!-- chunk -->

### people. As neurohackers, we always ask the question, “Are these declines

<!-- chunk -->

### inevitable?” And to that we say a profound, “No”!

<!-- chunk -->

### In this Japanese double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 65 adults aged 50 –

<!-- chunk -->

### 70 years with forgetfulness were recruited. The volunteers were given

<!-- chunk -->

### mg of PQQ and 100 mg of CoQ10 per day for 24 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team found that PQQ taken either alone, or in combination

<!-- chunk -->

### with CoQ10 has the potential to prevent, or even reverse, the decline in

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive function caused by aging and oxidative stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team concluded “PQQ was found to improve not only immediate

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, but also other higher brain functions such as spatial awareness.

<!-- chunk -->

### The effects of PQQ were enhanced when the substance was used with

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10.”896


<!-- chunk -->

### You get PQQ from some of the food you eat including beans, celery, cocoa,

<!-- chunk -->

### fermented foods (i.e. tempeh, natto), kiwi, papaya, parsley, potatoes,

<!-- chunk -->

### spinach and wine. Babies get it from breast milk.

<!-- chunk -->

### Estimated daily intake of PQQ is 100 – 400 mcg. But it’s unlikely you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### getting enough PQQ from diet alone. And supplementation of this

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria generator could help.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clinical studies with humans and animals tell us that 20 mg of PQQ daily

<!-- chunk -->

### is needed to experience cognitive benefit.


<!-- chunk -->

### The primary “side effect” of using PQQ in your nootropic stack is - you’ll

<!-- chunk -->

### feel better. You should have more energy and thinking should be clearer

<!-- chunk -->

### and faster.

<!-- chunk -->

### PQQ is non-toxic and supplementation is well-tolerated by most people.


<!-- chunk -->

### PQQ comes in table or capsule form 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg.

<!-- chunk -->

### But you need to be aware of different forms of PQQ on the marketplace.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is only 1 form available that is produced naturally. And that is

<!-- chunk -->

### BioPQQ® by Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company of Japan. This company

<!-- chunk -->

### makes PQQ through bacterial fermentation. BioPQQ is licensed to several

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement makers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other forms are produced through a chemical synthesis, involving the use

<!-- chunk -->

### of fairly toxic compounds, and have unresolved safety issues.


<!-- chunk -->

## PQQ 10 - 20 mg per pay

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using PQQ as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make PQQ on its own. You can get some PQQ from

<!-- chunk -->

### the food you eat. But studies have shown we may not get an adequate

<!-- chunk -->

### supply of PQQ from food sources in our diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### PQQ helps create mitochondria in your brain cells. When cellular energy

<!-- chunk -->

### gets a boost, you can experience better and faster thinking, learning is

<!-- chunk -->

### easier, recall is faster, and you’ll be more resistant to fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

### PQQ is especially helpful for those suffering from age-related cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### decline. Studies show it helps stop or reverse brain degeneration with

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease. Especially in the early stages of the


<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest starting with a dose of 10 - 20 mg daily. And PQQ is a great

<!-- chunk -->

### compliment to a stack including any nootropic. It works particularly well

<!-- chunk -->

### when combined with CoQ10.

<!-- chunk -->

### You need to provide your brain cells with fresh mitochondria and supply

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons with the fuel it is demanding. Or neurons start to break down from

<!-- chunk -->

### the inside. Signs that your lacking adequate PQQ is brain fog, slow

<!-- chunk -->

### thinking, headaches and muscle aches.

<!-- chunk -->

### Age-related cognitive disorders that include muscle control problems may

<!-- chunk -->

### want to up the dose to 30 mg per day. But for a limited time until PQQ

<!-- chunk -->

### blood levels are stabilized. Work with your doctor.


# Pramiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam has been shown to boost overall cognition, focus, working-

<!-- chunk -->

### and long-term memory, and learning

<!-- chunk -->

## Pramiracetam (N-[2-[di(propan-2-yl) amino] ethyl]-2-(2-oxopyrrolidin-

<!-- chunk -->

## 1-yl) acetamide, CI-879, Pramistar, Neupramir, Remen) is a fat-soluble

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic in the racetam-class of compounds.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam was first synthesized by scientists at Parke-Davis in the late

<!-- chunk -->

### 1970’s. It was first tested with Alzheimer’s patients. Seeing mixed results,

<!-- chunk -->

### the company tried it with major depressive disorder. And licensed

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam as an orphan drug to Menarini who continued research on

<!-- chunk -->

### using it for dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 1991, the company licensed Pramiracetam to Cambridge Neuroscience

<!-- chunk -->

### Inc. (CNI).897 The nootropic was then tested for restoring cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### function after stroke or traumatic brain injury.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers found that Pramiracetam was up to 30-times more potent than

<!-- chunk -->

### the original Piracetam. In Europe this nootropic is prescribed for the

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment of dyslexia, ADHD, dementia and other memory problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Brand names for prescription Pramiracetam include Pramistar, Neupramir

<!-- chunk -->

### and Remen.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam has gained a reputation in the nootropics community for

<!-- chunk -->

### optimizing cognition. It’s a favorite with students and executives for

<!-- chunk -->

### boosting cognition, focus, memory, and recall.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam helps:

<!-- chunk -->

## •High Affinity Choline Uptake (HACU): Pramiracetam has been

<!-- chunk -->

### shown to significantly increase HACU in the hippocampus. This

<!-- chunk -->

### action boosts acetylcholine (ACh) use which accounts at least in part

<!-- chunk -->

### for Pramiracetam’s ability to enhance cognition and memory.898

<!-- chunk -->

## •Neurotransmitters: Pramiracetam has a profound effect on the

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh).899 ACh is

<!-- chunk -->

### critical for encoding new memories, concentration, cognition and

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroplasticity.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Cerebral Blood Flow: Pramiracetam increases nitric oxide (NO)

<!-- chunk -->

### activity in your brain.900 NO acts as a vascular dilator which means

<!-- chunk -->

### it relaxes blood vessels allowing for the freer flow of blood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Increased blood flow delivers more oxygen and nutrients to brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells promoting better learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam was developed by Parke-Davis in the late 1970’s from

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam by substituting the amide group with a dipropan-2-ylaminoethyl

<!-- chunk -->

### group. Parke-Davis was once America’s largest and oldest drug maker. It

<!-- chunk -->

### has since been acquired by Pfizer as part of their acquisition of Warner-

<!-- chunk -->

### Lambert in 2000.

<!-- chunk -->

### Parke-Davis has an interesting history and were pioneers in many areas

<!-- chunk -->

### including drugs that affect cognition. Even conducting some research with

<!-- chunk -->

### peyote in the early 1900’s.901

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam as a nootropic is legal and sold in many parts of the world

<!-- chunk -->

### as the prescription drug Pramistar, Neupramir, or Remen. In the United

<!-- chunk -->

### States, Pramiracetam is sold as an OTC ‘research compound’, and readily

<!-- chunk -->

### available to the nootropics community.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam shares a unique quality with Coluracetam in the racetam-

<!-- chunk -->

## class of nootropics. Its primary method of action is boosting high affinity

<!-- chunk -->

## choline uptake (HACU) in the hippocampus. It helps increase

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine synthesis and function which helps overall cognition,

<!-- chunk -->

### improved memory and recall, learning, and focus.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam has been shown in the lab to not directly influence GABA,

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin in the brain.902 So don’t look to

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam to correct mood and anxiety issues.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam does increase nitric oxide activity in your brain. Helping to

<!-- chunk -->

### increase cerebral circulation which improves the efficiency of brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### needed for motor function, learning and visual function.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Pramiracetam work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Pramiracetam improves memory. Several animal and human

<!-- chunk -->

### studies show that Pramiracetam has a significant impact on memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this animal study researchers administered Pramiracetam to rats in a

<!-- chunk -->

### one-trial test. This is significant because it proves that Pramiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### works right out of the gate. It doesn’t take multiple doses, or a couple of

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks to build up in your system. It works on the first day you use it.

<!-- chunk -->

### The scientists found that rats had a significant improvement in retention

<!-- chunk -->

### by using Pramiracetam. And the effect lasted for 24 hours.903

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Pramiracetam increases high-affinity choline uptake (HACU).

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have shown that Pramiracetam boosts HACU in the

<!-- chunk -->

### hippocampus. The increase in acetylcholine (ACh) makes more of

<!-- chunk -->

### this neurotransmitter available to neurons for cognitive processing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Increasing attention, mental clarity, memory and verbal skills.904

<!-- chunk -->

### High affinity choline uptake (HACU) is the uptake of choline in synapses

<!-- chunk -->

### needed for acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis. This is a critical link in the

<!-- chunk -->

### chain of events needed for your brain to make ACh.905 Studies with

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam and other racetam nootropics like Coluracetam show that

<!-- chunk -->

### boosting HACU increases memory. And even restores memory function in

<!-- chunk -->

### parts of the brain that have been damaged.906


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, our brain chemistry and metabolism changes. And it

<!-- chunk -->

### seems these changes are affecting younger and younger people.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Recall, reaction time and learning capacity declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Acetylcholine receptors decline


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Cerebral blood flow declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Nitric Oxide levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes are contributing factors to age-related cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### decline. Early signs of these effects can be seen in poor decision-making,

<!-- chunk -->

### difficulty learning, and even recalling simple things like an important

<!-- chunk -->

### appointment.

<!-- chunk -->

### But even if you’re not concerned with the signs of aging, Pramiracetam


<!-- chunk -->

## Pramiracetam benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam helps boost acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis and use in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain and increases cerebral circulation.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, Pramiracetam easily crosses the blood-brain barrier.907

<!-- chunk -->

### And since it is fat-soluble, it must be taken with a healthy fat to ensure

<!-- chunk -->

### absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam increases the amount and efficiency of acetylcholine by

<!-- chunk -->

### influencing the high affinity choline uptake (HACU) system in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### This increase in ACh can have a profound effect on overall cognition and


<!-- chunk -->

### With Pramiracetam, you’ll find it easier to focus and learning ability will

<!-- chunk -->

### improve. This increase in ACh in your hippocampus helps with logic and

<!-- chunk -->

### understanding complex mathematical and technical subjects if that’s your

<!-- chunk -->

### thing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Increased neuroplasticity from more acetylcholine and improved cerebral

<!-- chunk -->

### circulation affects long-term potentiation.908 So you may find it easier to

<!-- chunk -->

### recall long-forgotten memories.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Pramiracetam feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers report that taking Pramiracetam quickly gets your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain firing on all cylinders. There is an intense increase in focus and

<!-- chunk -->

### possibly even a boost in confidence.

<!-- chunk -->

### But once you get accustomed to this laser-like focus, the novelty wears off

<!-- chunk -->

### and you become used to being able to focus at will.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam is reported to be great for intense, long study sessions. Or

<!-- chunk -->

### when you face logical, attention-based tasks where you need sharp focus.

<!-- chunk -->

### Like when you’re doing a presentation before the Board, or a group of

<!-- chunk -->

### VC’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### This nootropic makes burning through tedious, arduous tasks that require a

<!-- chunk -->

### level of sustained focus easier, and that would otherwise seem difficult.

<!-- chunk -->

### Others report improved recall ability, fluidity of thought, and ease of

<!-- chunk -->

### verbal communication and numerical calculations.


<!-- chunk -->

## Pramiracetam Normalizes Brain Waves

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers working with old Fisher-344 rats found that the aged rats had

<!-- chunk -->

### a consistently different EEG profile from young rats. They found slow

<!-- chunk -->

### brain waves were present in both the frontal cerebral cortex and

<!-- chunk -->

### hippocampus. Theta brain wave activity was missing altogether but was

<!-- chunk -->

### dominant in the brains of young rats.

<!-- chunk -->

### Theta brain waves are associated with creativity, integrative experiences

<!-- chunk -->

### and relief from trauma. Theta waves are commonly experienced by

<!-- chunk -->

### meditators. An “ah-ha moment” is a burst of Theta waves in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### This research team found that Pramiracetam normalized brain wave

<!-- chunk -->

### activity in the old rats. And even more interesting was that its older sibling

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam did not produce this effect on brain waves. And that tolerance to

<!-- chunk -->

### Piracetam was a problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### While it hasn’t been proven in the lab, this study shows that Pramiracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### would be of benefit to the older generation looking to improve cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### function.909

<!-- chunk -->

## Pramiracetam Improves Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Italy investigated Pramiracetam effects on memory, and

<!-- chunk -->

### memory training by a therapist. Types of memory measured were objective

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and metamemory performance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Metamemory is both the inner-knowledge of one’s own memories

<!-- chunk -->

### combined with the processes for formulating new memories with no inner-

<!-- chunk -->

### knowledge.

<!-- chunk -->

### 35 healthy volunteers were chosen with an average age of 64.8 years.

<!-- chunk -->

### subjects received memory training only, 8 received Pramiracetam,

<!-- chunk -->

### received both memory training and Pramiracetam, and the control group

<!-- chunk -->

### received nothing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Results of the study showed that those receiving both memory training and

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam experienced a significant improvement in memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Followed by the Pramiracetam group. The memory training-only group

<!-- chunk -->

### and control group scored the lowest.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team concluded that Pramiracetam significantly improves

<!-- chunk -->

### memory. And the addition of memory training to Pramiracetam has an

<!-- chunk -->

### even more profound effect of both types of memory measured.910

<!-- chunk -->

## Pramiracetam Enhances Cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### This double-blind placebo-controlled study worked with young males who

<!-- chunk -->

### suffered cognition problems due to brain injuries. The men had problems

<!-- chunk -->

### with memory and recall.

<!-- chunk -->

### One group received 400 mg of Pramiracetam daily for 18 months. And the

<!-- chunk -->

### other group a placebo. Memory was measured during the trial and for 1-

<!-- chunk -->

### month after Pramiracetam was discontinued.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found that Pramiracetam produced a significant

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement in cognition, memory and recall.911


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended Pramiracetam dosage is 250 - 400 mg up to 3-times per

<!-- chunk -->

### day. One Pramiracetam dose in the morning, and one in the early

<!-- chunk -->

### afternoon, and if you’re doing a 3rd dose do it later in the afternoon.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam is fat-soluble so for best results take it with a quality fat

<!-- chunk -->

### like extra virgin, cold-pressed unrefined coconut oil, MCT oil or olive oil.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you don’t take Pramiracetam with supplemental fat, don’t expect much of

<!-- chunk -->

### an improvement in cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam is one of two racetams (the other is Coluracetam) that have

<!-- chunk -->

### a profound effect on high affinity choline uptake (HACU). This means it

<!-- chunk -->

### will help your brain make more acetylcholine (ACh) and boost the use of

<!-- chunk -->

### ACh.

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetylcholine is synthesized from the available choline in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Which means for best results you should stack Pramiracetam with

<!-- chunk -->

### supplemental choline. We recommend a good quality choline source like

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam tastes particularly nasty. So you may want to get capsules or

<!-- chunk -->

### tablets rather than powder (unless you’re making your own capsules).

<!-- chunk -->

### DO NOT try to take Pramiracetam sublingually because it will literally

<!-- chunk -->

### burn the lining of your mouth.


<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam is non-toxic. So is considered well-tolerated and safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### As with many of the racetams, Pramiracetam can cause headaches because

<!-- chunk -->

### it boosts the use of acetylcholine in your brain. Choline supplements like

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline can help you avoid this side effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers also find that stacking Pramiracetam with a choline

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement boosts the effect with improved memory and cognition. And

<!-- chunk -->

### this is supported in several research studies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some users report that Pramiracetam blunts their emotions. Decisions

<!-- chunk -->

### when it comes to life and work issues are logic-based rather than

<!-- chunk -->

### emotional. This can be good or bad depending on the situation of course.

<!-- chunk -->

### You could call it “emotional objectivity”.


<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam is sold in tablet, capsule, and powder form. Tablets and

<!-- chunk -->

### capsules are usually 250 or 300 mg each.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Europe, Pramiracetam is a prescription drug under brand names

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramistar, Neupramir, or Remen.


<!-- chunk -->

## Pramiracetam 250 - 400 mg up to 3-times per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Pramiracetam as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does not make Pramiracetam on its own. So to get its benefits


<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam is especially helpful for those suffering from age-related

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive decline. Its boosts high affinity choline uptake (HACU) which

<!-- chunk -->

### means more acetylcholine (ACh) is available in your brain. Providing a

<!-- chunk -->

### significant improvement in cognition and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam is also particularly useful to students and executives who

<!-- chunk -->

### want to boost cognition, focus, learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pramiracetam is fat-soluble so stack it with a good quality fat like coconut

<!-- chunk -->

### oil, olive oil or MCT oil.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should use Pramiracetam with a choline supplement like Alpha GPC

<!-- chunk -->

### or CDP-Choline. It helps boost neural acetylcholine, so demands the


<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely boost daily intake of Pramiracetam to 1500 mg if needed.

<!-- chunk -->

### But most find that lower doses are more effective.


# Pterostilbene

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene is a very potent antioxidant, stimulates Brain-Derived

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurotrophic Factor, promotes neuroplasticity, is anti-anxiety, boosts

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine, and helps cognition, learning and memory

<!-- chunk -->

## Pterostilbene (trans-3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxystilbene, PTE) is a

<!-- chunk -->

### naturally derived polyphenol antioxidant found in blueberries, grapes, and

<!-- chunk -->

### in the bark of the Indian Kino Tree.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene, a naturally occurring dimethylether analog of resveratrol, is

<!-- chunk -->

### a phytoalexin that, like resveratrol, is made by plants to fight infection,

<!-- chunk -->

### insect infestation, heat and ultraviolet exposure.912

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene and resveratrol are both ‘stilbene’ polyphenols. But

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene is much more bioavailable than resveratrol. It rapidly

<!-- chunk -->

### crosses the blood-brain barrier, and stays in your body much longer than

<!-- chunk -->

### resveratrol (half-life of 105 mins. vs. 12 mins.).913

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene shows 80% bioavailability while resveratrol only has 20%

<!-- chunk -->

### bioavailability.914

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene is gaining a reputation in the nootropics community for

<!-- chunk -->

### controlling brain inflammation, boosting dopamine, helping reverse

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive decline and fighting brain cell aging.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene helps:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Neuroplasticity. Pterostilbene increases hippocampus neurogenesis,

<!-- chunk -->

### boosts insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and modulates the

<!-- chunk -->

### receptor kinase pathway that is central in the learning and memory

<!-- chunk -->

### process. Increasing neuroplasticity in the hippocampus improves

<!-- chunk -->

### learning and memory functions.915

<!-- chunk -->

## •Neuroprotectant. Pterostilbene is a potent antioxidant and anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory. It reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and

<!-- chunk -->

### increases the antioxidant glutathione and superoxide dismutase

<!-- chunk -->

### (SOD).916 Crucial to overall brain health, maintaining signaling

<!-- chunk -->

### pathways and leading to improved learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). Pterostilbene has

<!-- chunk -->

### been shown in clinical trials to elevate BDNF in the hippocampus.

<!-- chunk -->

### Improving learning and memory.917

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene and resveratrol are both ‘stilbene’ polyphenols. And both

<!-- chunk -->

### boost cognition, learning and memory. But Pterostilbene works differently

<!-- chunk -->

### than Resveratrol. And is not a replacement for Resveratrol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here’s why…

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol has been getting a lot of press lately because of its ability to

<!-- chunk -->

### boost learning, memory and cognitive power. But Pterostilbene is much

<!-- chunk -->

### more bioavailable than resveratrol. And may be the preferred polyphenol

<!-- chunk -->

### to add to your nootropic stack.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene stands out because of its structural differences from

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol. Pterostilbene has two methoxy groups and one hydroxyl

<!-- chunk -->

### group. Resveratrol has three hydroxyl groups.

<!-- chunk -->

### This combination in Pterostilbene improves lipophilicity which means it

<!-- chunk -->

### can dissolve in fats, oil and lipids. Lipids are what makes up the shell or

<!-- chunk -->

### membrane encasing each one of your cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### So Pterostilbene can more easily cross through your cell walls. In fact,

<!-- chunk -->

### several published studies refer to Pterostilbene as having much better bio-

<!-- chunk -->

### activity than Resveratrol.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can easily add Pterostilbene to your diet. It’s found in blueberries,

<!-- chunk -->

### cranberries, sparkleberries, lingonberries, grapes, and in the bark of the

<!-- chunk -->

### Indian Kino Tree.

<!-- chunk -->

### But to get the therapeutic benefits of Pterostilbene, a preferred way of

<!-- chunk -->

### getting this potent antioxidant is to take it as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene has been shown to prevent the loss of the neurotransmitter

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine from memory centers in your brain. Supplementing with PTE

<!-- chunk -->

### raises its levels in your hippocampus which is where memory is processed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene also has the effect of caloric restriction on cells which

<!-- chunk -->

### profoundly effects gene expression. This tricks your body into improving

<!-- chunk -->

### memory because it’s thinking there is food scarcity. And it provides an

<!-- chunk -->

### adaptive response.

<!-- chunk -->

### The polyphenol Pterostilbene increases neuroreceptor sensitivity which

<!-- chunk -->

### improves neuronal signaling. And PTE promotes the formation of new

<!-- chunk -->

### synaptic connections which boosts neuroplasticity. Improving long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### potentiation resulting in formation of long-term memories.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Pterostilbene work in the brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## Pterostilbene boosts brain health in several ways. But two in particular

<!-- chunk -->

### stand out.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Pterostilbene mimics caloric restriction. Restricting calories by

<!-- chunk -->

### fasting has been implicated in increased synaptic plasticity resulting

<!-- chunk -->

### in improved learning. Scientists determined that this enhancement

<!-- chunk -->

### in synaptic plasticity was caused by increased brain cell signaling.

<!-- chunk -->

## The signaling increase is mediated by CREB (cAMP response

<!-- chunk -->

## element binding protein).918

<!-- chunk -->

### CREB has a proven role in neuronal plasticity and long-term memory

<!-- chunk -->

### formation in the brain. And has been shown to be critical in the formation

<!-- chunk -->

### of spatial memory.919

<!-- chunk -->

## In several studies, Pterostilbene has been shown to modulate gene

<!-- chunk -->

## expression. PTE up-regulates those genes that stimulate apoptosis

<!-- chunk -->

### (programmed cell death). And down-regulate those genes that allow

<!-- chunk -->

### cancer cells for example, to invade and metastasize.920

<!-- chunk -->

### And this gene modulation is linked to increases in CREB and Brain-

<!-- chunk -->

### Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). An increase in BDNF helps long-

<!-- chunk -->

### term potentiation needed for the development of long-term memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, researchers supplemented aging animals with blueberry

<!-- chunk -->

### extract for 12 weeks. This extract contained PTE. Spatial working memory

<!-- chunk -->

### tasks emerged within 3 weeks of supplementation. And persisted for the

<!-- chunk -->

### remainder of the testing period.

<!-- chunk -->

### This memory enhancement correlated with the activation of CREB. And

<!-- chunk -->

## increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the

<!-- chunk -->

### hippocampus. In fact, PTE was implicated in the entire chain of the ERK-

<!-- chunk -->

## CREB-BDNF signaling pathway that boosts memory.921

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Pterostilbene boosts dopamine. But it increases dopamine in kind

<!-- chunk -->

### of a ‘back door’ approach. We have plenty of research showing that

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegeneration is caused by oxidative stress. And that anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidants can stop and even reverse damage to neurons. Potentially

<!-- chunk -->

### leading to an increase in the release of important neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### like dopamine. PTE is a potent antioxidant.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study done a Tufts University in Boston investigated stilbene

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds like PTE and their effect on reversing the effects of aging. The

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers used 344 Fisher rats and gave them either a low (0.004%) or a

<!-- chunk -->

### high (0.016%) concentration of Pterostilbene.

<!-- chunk -->

### Results from this study showed that PTE was effective in reversing

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive deficits. And Pterostilbene increased dopamine release. A boost

<!-- chunk -->

### in working memory correlated with Pterostilbene levels in the

<!-- chunk -->

### hippocampus.922


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, the chemistry in our brain cells and energy metabolism


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neurons and synapses degenerate

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Recall, reaction time, memory, and mood diminish

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Anxiety levels increase


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Oxidation damages brain cells


<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases of aging including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s

<!-- chunk -->

### and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### But even if things haven’t degenerated to such a debilitating level, PTE


<!-- chunk -->

## Pterostilbene benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene helps improve memory and provides neuroprotection through

<!-- chunk -->

### different mechanisms of action than most other nootropics in a typical

<!-- chunk -->

### stack.

<!-- chunk -->

### PTE works primarily through gene expression. Easily passing through cell

<!-- chunk -->

### walls, PTE modulates genes that influence other proteins, mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### and even cell DNA.

<!-- chunk -->

### We talk a lot about apoptosis (programmed cell death) as a negative event

<!-- chunk -->

### in nootropic circles. But the reality is that apoptosis is an integral part of a

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene stimulates apoptosis to make way for healthy new cells to be

<!-- chunk -->

### born (neurogenesis). And helps down-regulate invaders like cancer cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Preventing them from invading healthy brain tissue and metastasizing.923

<!-- chunk -->

### Some supplement makers are mistakenly marketing their Pterostilbene as

<!-- chunk -->

### an “upgraded-version” of Resveratrol. But the research shows

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene and Resveratrol work together to boost cognitive health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol works at the beginning of the cascade of neurochemical events

<!-- chunk -->

### that activates genes leading to cognitive benefits. And Pterostilbene

<!-- chunk -->

### provides its gene expression effects in the downstream portion of this

<!-- chunk -->

### molecular cascade.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene has a kind of ‘reverse effect’ on boosting dopamine. Rather

<!-- chunk -->

### than directly increasing dopamine levels like some nootropics, PTE

<!-- chunk -->

### prevents the loss of dopamine in brain memory centers.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is not nearly as strange as it sounds. Because this mechanism of

<!-- chunk -->

### action is similar to how Ritalin works as a stimulant. By preventing the

<!-- chunk -->

### uptake of dopamine by neuroreceptors, Ritalin keeps more dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### available for increased alertness, cognition and memory formation.

<!-- chunk -->

### PTE prevents brain injury from lack of blood flow and could have

<!-- chunk -->

### profound applications in the recovery from stroke. This effect could be

<!-- chunk -->

### beneficial even in healthy brains who suffer from brain fog due to poor

<!-- chunk -->

### cerebral circulation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene provides well-documented antioxidant activity.924 Affecting

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroreceptor sensitivity for improved neural signaling. PTE even

<!-- chunk -->

### promotes new synaptic connections between neurons. Improving

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroplasticity leading to better learning and memory.925

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Pterostilbene feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report that supplementing with Pterostilbene boosts energy

<!-- chunk -->

### levels, provides clearer thinking and improved mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taken before an anxiety-producing event, PTE takes the edge off with no

<!-- chunk -->

### sedation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aging baby boomers report feeling younger after using Pterostilbene.

<!-- chunk -->

### They feel more alert, less joint and lower back pain, more energy, less

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, and better focus.


<!-- chunk -->

### We have hundreds of studies talking about the benefits of Resveratrol. But

<!-- chunk -->

### mostly animal studies for Pterostilbene. So just bear in mind that life is

<!-- chunk -->

### not a clinical study.

<!-- chunk -->

### Take what you can from this article on PTE and read user reviews on some

<!-- chunk -->

### of the major sites. Then add Pterostilbene to your stack and see if it makes

<!-- chunk -->

### a difference in your life.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you notice a difference, please bookmark this chapter, and tell your

<!-- chunk -->

### friends about it. And help a brother (or sister) out.

<!-- chunk -->

## Pterostilbene Reduces Anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### A study at the University of Mississippi investigated using Pterostilbene

<!-- chunk -->

### for anxiety disorders. Using mice, the team administered PTE in 1 –

<!-- chunk -->

### mg/kg doses. Measuring the effects of each dose for its anxiolytic effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### To measure this mood effect, the team evaluated decreases in extracellular

<!-- chunk -->

### regulated kinase 1 and extracellular regulated kinase 2 in the mice. These

<!-- chunk -->

### signaling pathways are involved in mood modulation in both animals and

<!-- chunk -->

### humans.926

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team found that no anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) activity was

<!-- chunk -->

### found at higher doses of Pterostilbene. But at lower doses of PTE (1 and

<!-- chunk -->

### mg/kg), there was significant anti-anxiety activity in the brain. And unlike

<!-- chunk -->

### standard anti-anxiety drugs, there was no impairment of motor movement.

<!-- chunk -->

### In other words, there were no negative physical effects of using PTE for

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety issues.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team concluded that, “These results suggest that Pterostilbene has the

<!-- chunk -->

### potential for therapeutic drug development for anxiety disorders.”927

<!-- chunk -->

## Pterostilbene Improves Cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### Recent studies have shown that Pterostilbene and Resveratrol protect

<!-- chunk -->

### against age-related diseases like Alzheimer’s. So this study looked at

<!-- chunk -->

### comparing the two ‘stilbenes’ to find out which was more effective in

<!-- chunk -->

### improving cognitive deficits, and Alzheimer’s pathology.

<!-- chunk -->

### The pathology of Alzheimer’s can be broken down into; cellular stress,

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation and other pathology markers known to be altered in the


<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio

<!-- chunk -->

### looked at the mechanism of action behind each of these pathology

<!-- chunk -->

### markers. They used SAMP8 mice which are bred to model age-related


<!-- chunk -->

### Two months of a Pterostilbene diet (but not Resveratrol) improved radial

<!-- chunk -->

### arm water maze function in these mice compared to controls who were fed

<!-- chunk -->

### a standard mouse diet.

<!-- chunk -->

## This is where it gets good. Markers of cellular stress, inflammation, and

<!-- chunk -->

## Alzheimer’s pathology were all positively modulated by Pterostilbene.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team concluded that “diet-achievable doses of Pterostilbene is a

<!-- chunk -->

### potent modulator of cognition and cellular stress”. Much better than

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team said that this success in improving cognition with

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene was due to its ability to increase peroxisome proliferator-

<!-- chunk -->

### activated receptor alpha (NR1C1) expression.

<!-- chunk -->

### This particular receptor is encoded by the pPARA gene. And as you may

<!-- chunk -->

### recall from earlier in this chapter, Pterostilbene’s big claim to fame is

<!-- chunk -->

### ‘gene expression’ and modulation.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team also noted that PTE works better than Resveratrol because of its

<!-- chunk -->

### increased ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. And superior

<!-- chunk -->

### bioavailability.928

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene is one of the only nootropics that improves cognition directly

<!-- chunk -->

### by modifying genes (gene expression).

<!-- chunk -->

## Pterostilbene Protects Neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### Blueberries have been reported to provide long-term neuroprotective

<!-- chunk -->

### effects. But researchers in China wanted to dig deeper to determine what

<!-- chunk -->

### in blueberries provided this benefit. Was it Pterostilbene?

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team dosed mice with 2.5 – 80 mg/kg of PTE for 3 days.

<!-- chunk -->

### Then induced a middle cerebral artery occlusion for 90 minutes. In other

<!-- chunk -->

### words, they gave the mice a stroke.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team gave the mice another dose of PTE immediately after the stroke,

<!-- chunk -->

### at 1 hour and at 3 hours. The team found the most therapeutic window for

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroprotection was 1 hour after the stroke dosed at 10 mg/kg.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene improved motor function, eliminated blood flow disruption,

<!-- chunk -->

### increased neuron survival, and reduced cell apoptosis (cell death). The

<!-- chunk -->

### team concluded that you could protect the brain from stroke using

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene.

<!-- chunk -->

### And this neuroprotective effect of Pterostilbene was associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### preventing oxidative stress and neuron death.929


<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene is found in small quantities in some plant foods. A cup of

<!-- chunk -->

### blueberries for example, contains only about 20 mcg of Pterostilbene.

<!-- chunk -->

### But even in small amounts, Pterostilbene is believed to provide some of

<!-- chunk -->

### the benefits talked about in this chapter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Based on all of the published animal studies, the recommended daily dose

<!-- chunk -->

### of Pterostilbene is 50 mg for cognitive benefit.


<!-- chunk -->

### The primary “side effect” of using Pterostilbene in your nootropic stack is

<!-- chunk -->

### - you’ll feel better. You should have more energy and thinking should be

<!-- chunk -->

### clearer and faster. And Pterostilbene provides an anti-anxiety effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene is non-toxic and supplementation is well-tolerated by most

<!-- chunk -->

### people.

<!-- chunk -->

### One randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted at the

<!-- chunk -->

### University of Mississippi School of Pharmacy did an analysis of safety in

<!-- chunk -->

### humans.

<!-- chunk -->

### 80 subjects were divided into four equal groups. Each group received

<!-- chunk -->

### either; 125 mg of Pterostilbene twice daily, the 2nd group 50 mg twice

<!-- chunk -->

### daily, the 3rd group 50 mg plus 100 mg of grape extract twice daily, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### 4th group a matching placebo twice daily. The trial ran for 6-8 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that “Pterostilbene is generally safe for use in

<!-- chunk -->

### humans up to 250 mg per day”.930

<!-- chunk -->

### But the benefits from Pterostilbene follow a bell-curve. With little or no

<!-- chunk -->

### benefit at lower doses, optimal benefits around 50 mg per day, and no

<!-- chunk -->

### benefit again at much higher doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Like other nootropics, more of Pterostilbene is not necessarily better.


<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene comes in tablet or capsule form and is available by several

<!-- chunk -->

### well-known supplement makers. Some pre-made nootropic stacks include

<!-- chunk -->

### PTE in their formula.

<!-- chunk -->

### pTeroPure® is a branded form of Pterostilbene derived from blueberries.

<!-- chunk -->

### And marketed as yielding 99.9% purity.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can also get Pterostilbene from blueberries. But you’d have to eat a

<!-- chunk -->

### lot of berries to get your quota of 50 mg per day. Blueberry extract

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements contain Pterostilbene. But do not typically indicate exactly

<!-- chunk -->

### how much is in the extract.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nootropics Expert Recommendation

<!-- chunk -->

## Pterostilbene 50 mg per pay

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Pterostilbene as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Pterostilbene on its own. You can get some

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene from blueberries and a few other fruits. But studies have

<!-- chunk -->

### shown we may not get an adequate supply of Pterostilbene from food

<!-- chunk -->

### sources in our diet. Especially if you don’t eat a lot of fruit every day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years

<!-- chunk -->

### as a “blood tonic”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene helps protect neurons and boosts other antioxidants that

<!-- chunk -->

### shield your brain cells from oxidative stress. Protecting brain cells in

<!-- chunk -->

### memory centers of the brain help boost dopamine. Resulting in better

<!-- chunk -->

### alertness, learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### The boost in memory and learning also comes from Pterostilbene’s ability

<!-- chunk -->

### to promote neuroplasticity. And PTE helps maintain cerebral circulation

<!-- chunk -->

### by protecting brain blood vessels from lack of oxygen, and oxidative


<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene is especially helpful for those dealing with anxiety. PTE

<!-- chunk -->

### provides an anxiolytic effect without the sedation you’d normally get from

<!-- chunk -->

### using anti-anxiety drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest starting with a dose of at least 10 mg daily. And Pterostilbene is

<!-- chunk -->

### a great compliment to a stack including any nootropic. It works

<!-- chunk -->

### particularly well when combined with Resveratrol.


# Quercetin

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin is used for allergies, arthritis pain, athletic muscle soreness,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, a leaky gut, and reducing the symptoms of COVID-19

<!-- chunk -->

## Quercetin (3,3′,4′,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) is one of the most abundant

<!-- chunk -->

### flavonoids present in over twenty plant and fruit categories.

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin is known for its anti-inflammatory properties. It’s used to lower

<!-- chunk -->

### blood pressure, control obesity, lower cholesterol, and protect against

### heart attacks and stroke.931,

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin is commonly found in foods such as capers, buckwheat, radish

<!-- chunk -->

### leaves, dill, cilantro, onions, radicchio, watercress, kale, blueberries,

<!-- chunk -->

### cranberries, plums, red wine, and black tea.

<!-- chunk -->

### And is found in some herbal nootropic supplements including Ginkgo

<!-- chunk -->

### Biloba and St. John’s wort.

<!-- chunk -->

### As one of the most abundantly consumed flavonoids in your diet, it is

<!-- chunk -->

### estimated that an average person consumes only 0 – 30 mg of Quercetin

<!-- chunk -->

### every day.

<!-- chunk -->

### The name Quercetin comes from a Latin word “Quercetum”, which means

### Oak Forest.933

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin is yellow in color and is poorly soluble in hot or cold water, but

<!-- chunk -->

### easily soluble in alcohol and fats.

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin cannot be produced in your body and must be obtained from

### infections, inflammation, neurodegeneration, and even certain types of

<!-- chunk -->

### cancers.935

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin has also recently been found to be beneficial in reducing the

<!-- chunk -->

## symptoms of COVID-19.

<!-- chunk -->

### A Chinese study showed that Quercetin bound with the spike protein in the

<!-- chunk -->

### coronavirus, reducing its ability to infect cells.936

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Quercetin Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Neuroprotection – Several in-vitro studies show that Quercetin is a

<!-- chunk -->

### potent antioxidant. And is capable of scavenging free radicals and

<!-- chunk -->

### protecting the brain from damage caused by oxidative stress.937

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin’s antioxidant property is mainly due to its effect on glutathione

<!-- chunk -->

### (GSH), enzymatic activity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by

<!-- chunk -->

### environmental factors and other toxins.938

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Improve memory – Due to its ability to scavenge free radicals,

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin has the potential to reverse cognitive deficits and may

<!-- chunk -->

### improve memory.939

<!-- chunk -->

### One animal study using mice showed increased learning and memory in

<!-- chunk -->

### the mice who were administered Quercetin with no improvement in the

<!-- chunk -->

### control animals.940


<!-- chunk -->

### Natural brain aging often results in neurodegenerative diseases such as

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s Disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### But even if you don’t experience neurodegenerative disease as you get

<!-- chunk -->

### older, human aging naturally results in:

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Chronic inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Poor memory

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ High cholesterol and triglycerides

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Increased belly fat

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Insulin resistance

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Mitochondrial insufficiency and dysfunction

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neurodegeneration

<!-- chunk -->

### Adding Quercetin to your nootropic stack may help prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative disease and the symptoms typically associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### aging.

<!-- chunk -->

## Quercetin benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin has the unique ability to increase claudin-4 which seals Tight

<!-- chunk -->

### Junctions and healing a leaky gut or leaky blood-brain barrier.941

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin is a potent antioxidant and may protect your brain from

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidative stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 2014, scientists administered Quercetin to rats within 48 hours of the

<!-- chunk -->

### animals suffering a brain edema.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study showed a high dose of Quercetin administered 48 hrs. after the

<!-- chunk -->

### stroke helped reverse neurobehavioral deficits that were the result of a

<!-- chunk -->

### brain edema (swelling due to fluid build-up). Including a significant

<!-- chunk -->

### reduction in oxidative stress, and a reduction in cellular apoptosis.942

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin protects the brain against toxins by activating the brain’s natural

<!-- chunk -->

### immune system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study in 2013 was conducted to deduce the effect of Quercetin on

<!-- chunk -->

### lead-toxicity. And it showed that Quercetin significantly prevented lead

<!-- chunk -->

### induced neurotoxicity, and oxidative stress.943

<!-- chunk -->

### And studies with animals also demonstrated Quercetin’s ability to help

<!-- chunk -->

### preserve brain activity in degenerative diseases like Parkinson’s and


<!-- chunk -->

### These studies show that Quercetin has therapeutic potential because it can

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibit Aβ aggregation, and tau phosphorylation. And inhibits

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholinesterase which in turn increases acetylcholine levels.944

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin may also boost testosterone levels. UGT2B17 is an enzyme that

<!-- chunk -->

### converts testosterone into testosterone glucuronide – which is then

<!-- chunk -->

### excreted out of your body through urine.945

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin has been shown to inhibit UGT2B17 activity by as much as 72%

<!-- chunk -->

### according to lab studies. Which means supplementing with Quercetin as a

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic may slow down it’s excretion. And boost levels of testosterone

<!-- chunk -->

### in your blood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin also inhibits aromatase which is the enzyme that converts

<!-- chunk -->

### testosterone into estrogen.946

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Quercetin feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Some of the most recent comments by Quercetin users report a significant

<!-- chunk -->

### reduction in COVID-19 symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Those infected with the virus reported using Quercetin with Vitamin C,

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D, and zinc. Their breathing was easier, and this combo helped

<!-- chunk -->

### them recover faster. And this is beginning to be backed by clinical studies

<!-- chunk -->

### as well.947

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers using Quercetin report a dramatic improvement in

<!-- chunk -->

### seasonal allergy symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Others claim Quercetin helps reduce muscle soreness after a workout. And

<!-- chunk -->

### arthritis pain is reduced.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many people said using Quercetin consistently reduced their cold

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms faster.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some suffering from allergies say Quercetin is a great alternative to

<!-- chunk -->

### antihistamines without the drowsy side effects caused by these drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Overall, Quercetin users said they were able to breathe easier, experienced

<!-- chunk -->

### less pain, and had more power and stamina.

<!-- chunk -->

## Quercetin Clinical Research

<!-- chunk -->

## Quercetin improves athletic performance

<!-- chunk -->

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 2013 in

<!-- chunk -->

### Iran with 26 badminton players. One group was given Quercetin 1000 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### per day for eight weeks. And the control group given a placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### The aim of the study was to determine how Quercetin supplementation

<!-- chunk -->

### affects performance, muscle damage and body muscle in badminton

<!-- chunk -->

### players.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lactate concentration, body fat percentage and VO2 max did not show any

<!-- chunk -->

### significant difference after 8 weeks in either group.

<!-- chunk -->

### But there was a significant difference in time to exhaustion in the

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin group. But not in the placebo group.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded “that intake of Quercetin may improve

<!-- chunk -->

### endurance exercise performance but may not reduce the body fat

<!-- chunk -->

### percentage”.948

<!-- chunk -->

## Quercetin reduces oxidative stress

<!-- chunk -->

### Several animal studies have been conducted to evaluate Quercetin’s effect

<!-- chunk -->

### on oxidative stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### In one study, oral Quercetin (0.5 -50 mg/kg) was shown to protect rodents

<!-- chunk -->

### from oxidative stress and disorders associated with it.949

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin also protects against the neurotoxicity of several heavy metals.

<!-- chunk -->

### Three animal studies were conducted on the impact of Quercetin on

<!-- chunk -->

### toxicity induced by lead, methylmercury, and Tungsten.

<!-- chunk -->

### The results indicated that Quercetin functioned as an effective protector

<!-- chunk -->

### against metal-induced neurotoxins. And could be considered a potent

<!-- chunk -->

### therapeutic intervention to cure cognitive deficits induced by these

<!-- chunk -->

### metals.950, 951,

<!-- chunk -->

## Quercetin reduces inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### High fat diets cause oxidative stress which may lead to neurodegenerative


<!-- chunk -->

### In one study, a test group of mice were fed high fat diets and given

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin. The scientists found that Quercetin reduced the cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### impairment induced by the high fat diet.953

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin has been shown to improve neuronal functional recovery in rats

<!-- chunk -->

### affected with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) by inhibiting inflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

### response and apoptosis and promoting nerve function restoration.954

<!-- chunk -->

### Recent studies show that Quercetin reduces the symptoms of Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease and other age-related cognitive disorders.955

<!-- chunk -->

## Quercetin for COVID-19

<!-- chunk -->

### Although the research is limited, the few studies that are present on

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin’s ability to reduce the symptoms of the novel Coronavirus

<!-- chunk -->

### indicate it has a significant capability to interfere with the replication of

<!-- chunk -->

### the virus.956

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin exhibits a wide range of antiviral properties which can intervene

<!-- chunk -->

### in every step from virus entry to replication, to protein assembly.

<!-- chunk -->

### The impact of Quercetin can be further enhanced through the co-

<!-- chunk -->

### administration of vitamin C and zinc.957

<!-- chunk -->

## Quercetin Recommended Dosage

<!-- chunk -->

### The recommended nootropic dosage for Quercetin is 500 mg up to twice


<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin dosages of 1,000 mg, and on the advice of your doctor, up to

<!-- chunk -->

### 3,000 mg per day to reduce COVID-19 symptoms. Note that this is short-

<!-- chunk -->

### term use only at such elevated dosages.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your daily intake of Quercetin from food in a typical Western diet is

<!-- chunk -->

### estimated to range between 0 – 30 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin as a supplement has low bioavailability because it does not

<!-- chunk -->

### easily cross the intestinal wall.958

<!-- chunk -->

### Poor bioavailability is why many Quercetin supplements include other

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds like Vitamin C, bromelain, or other digestive enzymes to help

<!-- chunk -->

### boost absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

### A more recent development shows increased absorption of Quercetin when

<!-- chunk -->

### attached to a phospholipid complex made from lecithin called

<!-- chunk -->

### Phytosome®.

<!-- chunk -->

## Quercetin Phytosome® has been shown to be 20-times more bioavailable

<!-- chunk -->

### than Quercetin on its own.959

<!-- chunk -->

### Research also shows Quercetin has a synergistic effect when combined

<!-- chunk -->

### with other flavonoid supplements, such as resveratrol, genistein, and

<!-- chunk -->

### catechins.960

<!-- chunk -->

## Quercetin Side Effects

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin is non-toxic and is considered well-tolerated and safe when used

<!-- chunk -->

### at recommended dosages.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with more than 1000 mg of Quercetin per day may lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms like stomach aches, headaches, and tingling sensations.

<!-- chunk -->

### Talk to your doctor before taking the supplement if you are pregnant or

<!-- chunk -->

### breastfeeding.

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin inhibits aromatase so if you’re being treated for breast cancer –

<!-- chunk -->

### talk to your doctor before supplementing with Quercetin.

<!-- chunk -->

### And animal studies show that high doses of Quercetin can have a negative

<!-- chunk -->

### effective on sperm quality and sperm count in males. But only when

<!-- chunk -->

### coupled with elevated oxidative stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### This hasn’t been proven in humans but it’s worth keeping in mind if you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### having fertility problems.961

<!-- chunk -->

## Type of Quercetin to Buy

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin as a nootropic is available in capsules and bags of powder.

<!-- chunk -->

### You’ll see several brands offering Quercetin + Bromelain because adding

<!-- chunk -->

### a digestive enzyme helps its bioavailability.

<!-- chunk -->

### And the latest is Quercetin Phytosome® which is Quercetin combined with

<!-- chunk -->

### lecithin-derived phospholipids from sunflower to cross the gut barrier

<!-- chunk -->

### more easily.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nootropic Expert® Recommendation

<!-- chunk -->

## Quercetin 500 mg up to twice per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend supplementing with Quercetin as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Quercetin on its own. So, to get its benefits you

<!-- chunk -->

### must take it as a supplement. Or rely on the small amount you get from

<!-- chunk -->

### food.

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin is especially helpful for those suffering from allergies, arthritis

<!-- chunk -->

### pain, muscle soreness after a workout, or a cold.

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin seems to be effective according to new clinical studies and

<!-- chunk -->

### several user reviews for reducing the severity of symptoms associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with COVID-19.

<!-- chunk -->

## NOTE: anecdotal evidence of using Quercetin to reduce COVID-19

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms requires dosages of 1,000 mg and up to 3,000 mg per day until

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms are gone.

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin is non-toxic and is considered well-tolerated and safe when used

<!-- chunk -->

## at recommended dosages. See the “Side Effects” section for more

<!-- chunk -->

### precautions before supplementing with Quercetin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Since Quercetin in its pure form is not easily absorbed by your digestive

<!-- chunk -->

### system, choose a Quercetin supplement combined with Bromelain, Vitamin

<!-- chunk -->

### C, or Quercetin Phytosome®.

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercetin as a nootropic seems to be effective starting at 500 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dosages above 1,000 mg per day is not recommended for long-term use.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unless specified by your doctor.


# Resveratrol

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol is a potent antioxidant, boosts BDNF, increases cerebral

<!-- chunk -->

### circulation, improves energy and memory, and potentially promotes

<!-- chunk -->

### longevity

<!-- chunk -->

## Resveratrol (3,4’,5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a polyphenol stilbenoid

<!-- chunk -->

### and phytoalexin that certain plants produce in response to stress, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### injury or fungal infection.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol is a naturally occurring compound found most famously in red

<!-- chunk -->

### wine. Some speculate that the Resveratrol found in red wine accounts for

<!-- chunk -->

### the “French Paradox”. And how the French can dine on baguettes, cheese,

<!-- chunk -->

### paté and pastries. While avoiding putting on weight and living longer.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recent research may soon lead the nootropics community to classifying

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol as an Ampakine nootropic. With some rather profound

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroprotective effects in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol is gaining a reputation among neurohackers for controlling

<!-- chunk -->

### brain inflammation, boosting dopamine, helping reverse cognitive decline

<!-- chunk -->

### and fighting brain cell aging.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol helps Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). Higher

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of BDNF are associated with increased intelligence, mood,

<!-- chunk -->

### productivity and memory. And decreased risks of neurodegenerative

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Resveratrol increases BDNF in

<!-- chunk -->

### your hippocampus.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol is a neuroprotectant. Resveratrol protects your brain by

<!-- chunk -->

### boosting the production of the enzyme heme oxygenase which protects

<!-- chunk -->

### against oxidative stress.962 Resveratrol shields mitochondria from injury

<!-- chunk -->

### during interruptions in blood flow such as a stroke.963 And Resveratrol

<!-- chunk -->

### prevents the release of toxic glutamate during a stroke.964 It even protected

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain when administered 6 hours after a stroke.965

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol improves cerebral circulation. Resveratrol increases blood

<!-- chunk -->

### flow in your brain. Improving your brain’s blood flow increases oxygen

<!-- chunk -->

### and nutrient levels. Providing your brain with the fuel it needs for

<!-- chunk -->

### optimized cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Initial research on Resveratrol led researchers to believe that the

<!-- chunk -->

### compound works by mimicking calorie restriction and decreasing chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### As soon as word got out about the first clinical studies at Harvard Medical

<!-- chunk -->

### School, red wine and Resveratrol were soon christened the new “Fountain

<!-- chunk -->

### of Youth”.

<!-- chunk -->

### But Dr. David Sinclair who led the Harvard study says, “You would need

<!-- chunk -->

### to drink a hundred to a thousand glasses of red wine to equal the doses that

<!-- chunk -->

### improve health in mice.”966

<!-- chunk -->

### However, more research has revealed some rather profound benefits to

<!-- chunk -->

### adding Resveratrol to your nootropic stack.

<!-- chunk -->

### Several human studies show that Resveratrol can increase cerebral

<!-- chunk -->

### circulation, protect against heart disease, and increase insulin sensitivity

<!-- chunk -->

### in diabetics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even more studies in animals have shown that Resveratrol can reduce

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, treat addictions, protect against memory loss, is anti-anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### reduces plaques in Alzheimer’s disease, improves learning, memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### mood, protects the brain from stroke and shields from hearing loss.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol is found in red wine, blueberries, cranberries, raspberries,

<!-- chunk -->

### bilberries, grapes, peanuts, pistachios, cocoa, and dark chocolate.967

<!-- chunk -->

### Here we’re going to dig into how Resveratrol helps your brain. Some of

<!-- chunk -->

### this is going to get a little geeky, so stay with me here…

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Resveratrol work in the brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## Resveratrol boosts brain health in several ways. But two in particular

<!-- chunk -->

### stand out.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Resveratrol improves memory. Resveratrol is an inhibitor of

<!-- chunk -->

### enzyme PDE4 (Phosphodiesterase-4). PDE4 inhibitors have been

<!-- chunk -->

## shown to be memory enhancers.968 Studies demonstrate that when

<!-- chunk -->

### you inhibit PDE4, you raise levels of cAMP in the brain.969 cAMP-

<!-- chunk -->

### dependent pathways in the brain activate AMPK (AMP-activated

<!-- chunk -->

### protein kinase).970

<!-- chunk -->

### This effect of activating AMPK has a number of implications. First, this

<!-- chunk -->

## would make Resveratrol an Ampakine nootropic similar to some of the

<!-- chunk -->

### racetams.

<!-- chunk -->

### Second, studies show that AMPK is activated by increases in the cellular

<!-- chunk -->

### AMP/ATP ratio. This helps preserve cellular energy. And would account

<!-- chunk -->

### for at least some of Resveratrol’s neuroprotective properties.971

<!-- chunk -->

### This same study at the Washington University School of Medicine in St.

<!-- chunk -->

### Louis, Missouri demonstrated that Resveratrol combined with the

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic ALCAR increased neurite growth which would have a profound

<!-- chunk -->

### effect on boosting memory. And Resveratrol also stimulated mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### biogenesis.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded, “These findings suggest that neuronal

<!-- chunk -->

### activation of AMPK by Resveratrol could affect neuronal energy

<!-- chunk -->

### homeostasis and contribute to the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol.”

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Resveratrol boosts BDNF. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor

<!-- chunk -->

### (BDNF) has been called “Miracle-Gro for the brain” by Harvard

<!-- chunk -->

### Neuropsychiatrist John Ratey. When BDNF is released, nerve cells

<!-- chunk -->

### connect to other cells or their synapses. As brain cells “fire

<!-- chunk -->

### together”, they “wire together”. And this is how new neural

<!-- chunk -->

### networks are formed and consolidated to create memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Iran administered Resveratrol to rats for 30-days. The team

<!-- chunk -->

### was looking at the effects of Resveratrol on the abundance of mRNA

<!-- chunk -->

### encoding Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in the hippocampus.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team measured levels of BDNF in the rat brains and found that

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol elevated the level of BDNF in the hippocampus of these rats.

<!-- chunk -->

### And concluded that the neuroprotective effects of Resveratrol are due to

<!-- chunk -->

### its ability to boost BDNF mRNA.972


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, the chemistry in our brain cells and energy metabolism


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neurons and synapses degenerate

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Recall, reaction time, memory, and mood diminish

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Cerebral circulation decreases


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Oxidation damages brain cells


<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases of aging including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s

<!-- chunk -->

### and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### But even if things haven’t degenerated to such a debilitating level,

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol can help.

<!-- chunk -->

## Resveratrol benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol is an antioxidant polyphenol which are present in foods like

<!-- chunk -->

### red wine, green tea, apples, berries, pomegranates, and dark chocolate.

<!-- chunk -->

### Polyphenols are among the most effective natural ways to combat aging.

<!-- chunk -->

### And to prevent the health issues that often lead to cardiovascular and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol helps prevent free radical damage to brain cells. Oxidative

<!-- chunk -->

### damage to brain cell membranes causes deterioration. And eventually

<!-- chunk -->

### leads to premature cell death (apoptosis).

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol has the unique ability to modulate cell apoptosis. And

<!-- chunk -->

### promotes cell death only in instances where your brain would be healthier

<!-- chunk -->

### with fresh, new cells. Resveratrol promotes neurogenesis.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol inhibits the PDE4 enzyme that raises levels of cAMP in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. Much like Luteolin (Artichoke Extract) in the CILTEP stack. cAMP-

<!-- chunk -->

### dependent pathways in the brain activate AMPK which in turn energize

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells, and boost memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol helps boost cerebral circulation, and Brain-Derived

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). BDNF helps new neural networks to form

<!-- chunk -->

### which is the basis for memory formation.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Resveratrol feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows that Resveratrol can:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improve memory by inhibiting PDE4 in the brain (which boosts

<!-- chunk -->

### cAMP activity)

<!-- chunk -->

### •Tame inflammation in the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boost cerebral blood flow for more oxygen and nutrients to fuel

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increase BDNF helping new neural networks to form for memory

<!-- chunk -->

### consolidation

<!-- chunk -->

### •Neuroprotective qualities that prevent damage to brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

## Resveratrol quickly enters your brain after you take it. Once in your brain,

<!-- chunk -->

### it inhibits PDE4 which boosts cAMP activity. cAMP is involved in the

<!-- chunk -->

### Long-Term Potentiation process of preserving memories.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inhibiting PDE4 and boosting cAMP also makes the effect of normal

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine production more effective. Boosting processes in this stream of

<!-- chunk -->

### chemical reactions in the brain increases learning and memory. Without

<!-- chunk -->

### the side effects of stimulating dopamine production through the use of

<!-- chunk -->

### drugs like Adderall or Ritalin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report the effects of Resveratrol can be subtle. But you don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### want to take it later in the afternoon or it could affect your sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### You may experience improved mood and motivation, increased ability to

<!-- chunk -->

### study, increased ability to retain information and improved long-term


<!-- chunk -->

### As a young neurohacker, you may not be concerned about the horrors of a

<!-- chunk -->

### disease like Alzheimer’s. Yet several clinical studies make the case for

<!-- chunk -->

### using Resveratrol to boost your memory. And to avoid ever having to be

<!-- chunk -->

### concerned about this debilitating disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### 84,767 Americans die every year from Alzheimer’s disease. And more

<!-- chunk -->

### than 230,000 suffer from dementia severe enough to require nursing home

<!-- chunk -->

### care.973

<!-- chunk -->

### The Alzheimer’s Association estimates that more than 5 million

<!-- chunk -->

### Americans are living with this disease. And you have a 1 in 3 chance of

<!-- chunk -->

### developing Alzheimer’s or another dementia in your lifetime.974

<!-- chunk -->

### Now that I have your attention, let’s look at some clinical studies on using

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol to prevent Alzheimer’s and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

## Resveratrol Protects Against Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### Some of Resveratrol’s neuroprotective ability comes from its ability to

<!-- chunk -->

### interfere with the cascade of events arising from an accumulation of

<!-- chunk -->

### abnormal proteins called amyloid-beta.

<!-- chunk -->

### Amyloid-beta causes oxidative stress and inflammation that damages

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells. Especially in memory centers in the brain. Hence the reason

<!-- chunk -->

### why Alzheimer’s causes such profound memory loss.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study conducted at the Litwin-Zucker Research Center for the Study of

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s Disease in New York looked at the cascade of events leading

<!-- chunk -->

### up to Amyloid-beta accumulation that causes much of the problem with


<!-- chunk -->

### The research team demonstrated how Resveratrol activates several

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic sensors, including AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase).

<!-- chunk -->

### AMPK signaling controls Amyloid-beta metabolism. So Resveratrol

<!-- chunk -->

### activates AMPK which reduces levels of Amyloid-beta deposits in the

<!-- chunk -->

### cerebral cortex.975

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study in Italy showed how Resveratrol prevents β-amyloid

<!-- chunk -->

### aggregation by scavenging oxygen free radicals and inducing protective

<!-- chunk -->

### enzymes such as heme oxygenase. Again preventing the build-up of

<!-- chunk -->

### deposits causing Alzheimer’s.976

<!-- chunk -->

### More recent studies show that Resveratrol can prevent Amyloid-beta

<!-- chunk -->

### proteins from clumping together into small collections of individual

<!-- chunk -->

### molecules called oligomers. This action alone has a profound effect on

<!-- chunk -->

### preventing Amyloid-beta damage and preventing Alzheimer’s.977

<!-- chunk -->

### And one more study, again about Resveratrol’s ability to activate AMPK

<!-- chunk -->

### and reduce Amyloid-beta build-up, shows that Resveratrol crosses the

<!-- chunk -->

### blood-brain barrier. And stays in the brain to do its magic. Verifying that

<!-- chunk -->

### using Resveratrol as a nootropic is an effective cognitive enhancer.978

<!-- chunk -->

## Resveratrol Improves Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and

<!-- chunk -->

### Brain Sciences investigated the effect of Resveratrol on brain function and

<!-- chunk -->

### memory in healthy overweight older adults.

<!-- chunk -->

### 23 people aged 50 – 75, took 200 mg of Resveratrol daily for 26 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The control group of 23 subjects took a placebo. Memory tasks,

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroimaging, microstructure, and functional connectivity of the

<!-- chunk -->

### hippocampus were measured before and after the trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study found that Resveratrol had a significant impact on subject’s

<!-- chunk -->

### ability to remember words. Subjects had a significant increase in

<!-- chunk -->

### functional connectivity in the hippocampus. And there was a decline in

<!-- chunk -->

### glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), which indicates improved blood sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### control.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that Resveratrol can enhance memory along

<!-- chunk -->

### better hippocampus function.979

<!-- chunk -->

## Resveratrol Improves Cerebral Circulation

<!-- chunk -->

### A study conducted at Northumbria University at Newcastle upon Tyne in

<!-- chunk -->

### the UK assessed the effects of Resveratrol on cognition and cerebral blood

<!-- chunk -->

### flow in healthy adults.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 22 healthy adults received a

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo and 2 doses (250 and 500 mg) of trans-Resveratrol in

<!-- chunk -->

### counterbalanced order on separate days.

<!-- chunk -->

### The subjects performed a selection of cognitive tasks that activate the

<!-- chunk -->

### frontal cortex 45-minutes after taking Resveratrol. Near-infrared

<!-- chunk -->

### spectroscopy assessed frontal cortex changes in oxygenated and

<!-- chunk -->

### deoxygenated hemoglobin in order to evaluate blood flow and

<!-- chunk -->

### hemodynamics during the 36 minutes of task performance.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team found that Resveratrol increased cerebral circulation.

<!-- chunk -->

### And this effect was entirely dependent on the size of the dose of

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol. Blood flow was determined by measuring total hemoglobin

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrations.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that Resveratrol can increase cerebral blood

<!-- chunk -->

### flow even with a single dose of the supplement.980


<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol is found in small quantities in red wine, and some plant foods.

<!-- chunk -->

### Red wine contains about 1.5 – 3 mg of Resveratrol per liter of wine. So if

<!-- chunk -->

### you do the math, comparable amounts of Resveratrol from red wine for a

<!-- chunk -->

### 150 lb. person means 750 – 1,500 bottles of red wine a day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol has a considerably shorter half-life than its cousin

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene. And is easily absorbed but has poor bioavailability once

<!-- chunk -->

### digested.981 It’s half-life is 1 – 3 hours, and 2 – 5 hours following repeated

<!-- chunk -->

### dosing.982

<!-- chunk -->

### Micronized Resveratrol, which has a much smaller particulate size, has

<!-- chunk -->

### been shown to have a 3.6-fold increase in bioavailability compared to

<!-- chunk -->

### standard Resveratrol.983

<!-- chunk -->

### And many of the clinical studies done in animals suggest a human

<!-- chunk -->

### equivalent of 1 -2 grams for a 150 – 200 lb. person. Many supplement

<!-- chunk -->

### makers offer much smaller quantities in capsules or tablets. (I do not

<!-- chunk -->

### advise taking such high doses of Resveratrol).

### But even in small amounts, Resveratrol is believed to provide some of the

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits talked about in this chapter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Based on all of the published studies, the recommended daily dose of

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol is 20 mg for heart health, insulin sensitivity and longevity. For

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive benefit, and increasing cerebral blood flow, recommended dose

<!-- chunk -->

### is 250 – 500 mg of Resveratrol.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s better to dose on the lower end of recommended doses of Resveratrol.

<!-- chunk -->

### And see how your body reacts.


<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol is non-toxic and supplementation is well-tolerated by most

<!-- chunk -->

### people. We do not have many human studies on Resveratrol and must rely

<!-- chunk -->

### on user reviews.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol has mild estrogenic activity in the body. So if you’re estrogen

<!-- chunk -->

### is low you should avoid supplementing with Resveratrol. This is a

<!-- chunk -->

### potentially serious side effect. And short of getting your labs done, it may

<!-- chunk -->

### show up as joint pain or arthritis-like symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some neurohackers report having trouble sleeping or staying asleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Particularly if taken in the afternoon or evening.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are dealing with a blood disorder which causes bleeding, you should

<!-- chunk -->

### avoid Resveratrol. If you are taking aspirin, warfarin or clopidogrel you

<!-- chunk -->

### should not use Resveratrol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Long term side effects reported by some neurohackers include diarrhea,

<!-- chunk -->

### discolored urine, dizziness, insomnia, jitters, joint pain, stomach pain and

<!-- chunk -->

### tendinitis.


<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol comes in tablet, capsule or powder form and is available by

<!-- chunk -->

### several well-known supplement makers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most Resveratrol supplements are made from Japanese Knotweed. And

<!-- chunk -->

### some from grape skin extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### The bioactive form used in clinical studies and found in supplements is

<!-- chunk -->

### ‘Trans-Resveratrol’. ‘Cis-Resveratrol’ is a cis isomer and still bioactive

<!-- chunk -->

### but has a very different chemical structure.

<!-- chunk -->

## Purity of Resveratrol is extremely important. Most Resveratrol is made

<!-- chunk -->

### from Japanese Knotweed. A poor-quality extract can contain high amounts

<!-- chunk -->

### of Emodin which can act as a laxative and cause stomach cramps.

<!-- chunk -->

### High purity Resveratrol extract (99%+) from Japanese Knotweed contains

<!-- chunk -->

### insignificant amounts of Emodin. And should cause far fewer side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your safest bet when choosing a Resveratrol supplement is an extract from

<!-- chunk -->

### grapes or red wine which contain no impurities.


<!-- chunk -->

## Resveratrol 20 - 250 mg per pay

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Resveratrol as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Resveratrol on its own. You can get some

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol from red wine and a few other fruits. But studies have shown

<!-- chunk -->

### we may not get an adequate supply of Resveratrol from food sources in

<!-- chunk -->

### our diet. Especially if you don’t eat a lot of fruit containing Resveratrol

<!-- chunk -->

### every day. Or don’t drink red wine.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend choosing a Resveratrol supplement that is 99% pure from

<!-- chunk -->

### Japanese Knotweed. Or a pure extract from grapes or red wine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol is unique among antioxidants because it easily crosses the

<!-- chunk -->

### blood-brain barrier. And helps protect your brain from free radical

<!-- chunk -->

### damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol helps improve memory by influencing the cAMP-dependent

<!-- chunk -->

### pathways in your brain that activate AMPK.

<!-- chunk -->

### And Resveratrol boosts cerebral blood flow which increases the amount of

<!-- chunk -->

### oxygen and nutrients your brain cells need for optimized cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol is especially helpful for those concerned about developing

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s or dementia. Because it helps prevent the accumulation of

<!-- chunk -->

### abnormal proteins like amyloid-beta.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest starting with a dose of at least 20 mg daily. And Resveratrol is a

<!-- chunk -->

### great compliment to a stack including any nootropic. One study showed

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol worked synergistically with ALCAR to boost memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### And Resveratrol works particularly well when combined with

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene.


# Rhodiola Rosea

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea is known for improving alertness, energy, memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### mood, is anti-anxiety and anti-depressant, reduces fatigue, and boosts

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition and concentration

<!-- chunk -->

## Rhodiola Rosea L. (Golden Root, Roseroot) has been used for several

<!-- chunk -->

### thousand years in traditional medicine. It grows in primarily dry sandy

<!-- chunk -->

### ground at high altitudes in the arctic areas of Europe and Asia.

<!-- chunk -->

### The plant is 12 – 30 high and produces yellow blossoms. The Greek

<!-- chunk -->

### physician, Dioscorides, first recorded the medicinal applications of ‘rodia

<!-- chunk -->

### riza’ in 77 C.E. in De Materia Medica.984

<!-- chunk -->

### In Russia, Rhodiola Rosea is widely used as a remedy for fatigue, poor

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration, and decreased memory. It’s also believed to make workers

<!-- chunk -->

### more productive.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Journal of the American Botanical Council reported on 180 studies

<!-- chunk -->

### done on Rhodiola Rosea since 1960. The bulk of the research shows how

<!-- chunk -->

### this herb works in treating physical endurance, fatigue, depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### impotence, infections, fertility, cold and flu, tuberculosis, cancer, and

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety.985

<!-- chunk -->

### German researchers describe the benefits of Rhodiola Rosea for pain,

<!-- chunk -->

### headache, scurvy, hemorrhoids, as a stimulant, and as an anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory.986

<!-- chunk -->

### This ancient remedy has remarkable stress-relieving and anti-anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### properties. And stands shoulder to shoulder with some of the most potent

<!-- chunk -->

### drugs used to treat depression and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

## This ancient herbal adaptogen has remarkable anti-depressant and anti-

<!-- chunk -->

## anxiety qualities. And has been shown to be as good as many prescription

<!-- chunk -->

## pharmaceuticals in treating depression and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### In total, Rhodiola Rosea contains 140 compounds in the roots and

<!-- chunk -->

### rhizome. The critical components include rosavin, rosarian, and rosin,

<!-- chunk -->

## collectively known as rosavins.

<!-- chunk -->

### Certain chemicals must be present for Rhodiola Rosea to work. And these

<!-- chunk -->

### include rosavin, rosarin, rosin, salidroside, and tyrosol. The first 3 of these

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds are found only in Rhodiola Rosea. It takes a synergistic

<!-- chunk -->

### combination of these chemicals for this herb to be effective.

<!-- chunk -->

### To ensure the supplement you choose works and contains pure Rhodiola

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosea, it needs to be standardized to contain at least 3% rosavins and 1%

<!-- chunk -->

### salidroside. This is the ratio found in the natural root. (See more about

<!-- chunk -->

### selecting the right Rhodiola Rosea supplement in “Available Forms” later

<!-- chunk -->

### in this chapter).

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies on organs, tissues, cells, and enzymes show that Rhodiola Rosea

<!-- chunk -->

### extracts exhibit adaptogenic effects that are neuroprotective, cardio

<!-- chunk -->

### protective, anti-fatigue, anti-depressive, anxiolytic, nootropic, and has

<!-- chunk -->

### life-extension qualities.987

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea is known as an adaptogen. Which means it helps your

<!-- chunk -->

### body adapt to stress, both mental and physical.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Rhodiola Rosea work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Rhodiola Rosea enhances mood. Reports from the nootropics

<!-- chunk -->

### community, and data from clinical trials show that Rhodiola Rosea

<!-- chunk -->

### encourages a balanced mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### One double-blind, placebo-controlled trial worked with male and female

<!-- chunk -->

### subjects aged 18 – 70 years. All were diagnosed with mild to moderate


<!-- chunk -->

### One group received two 340 mg tablets of Rhodiola Rosea extract (SHR-5)

<!-- chunk -->

### daily. A second group received double the dose of the first group per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### And the third group received a placebo daily.

<!-- chunk -->

### The efficacy of SHR-5 extract for depression complaints was assessed on

<!-- chunk -->

### the first day. And again on day 42 of the trial. The research team reported

<!-- chunk -->

### that Groups A and B saw significant improvements in depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### insomnia, emotions and overall quality of life.

<!-- chunk -->

## The team concluded that Rhodiola Rosea extract has potent anti-

<!-- chunk -->

## depressant qualities in those with mild to moderate depression. When

<!-- chunk -->

### administered in doses of either 340 or 680 mg per day over 6-weeks.988

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Rhodiola Rosea improves mental performance under stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mental fatigue can cause brain fog, and make it hard to focus. It can

<!-- chunk -->

### affect your performance at school, and on the job.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea stimulates your nervous system to fight fatigue that stifles

<!-- chunk -->

### mental clarity. And studies show it even saves injured neurons. And

<!-- chunk -->

### encourages the growth and development of brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### One animal study in China explored the effects of Rhodiola Rosea on the

<!-- chunk -->

### number of neurons in the hippocampus of rats with depression induced by

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### This study has a direct correlation on how Rhodiola Rosea works in the

<!-- chunk -->

### human brain. And its value as a nootropic. In this study, 50 rats were

<!-- chunk -->

### divided into 5 groups: normal control, untreated, negative control, positive

<!-- chunk -->

### control and Rhodiola Rosea-treated groups.

<!-- chunk -->

## The research team found that the number of neurons in the hippocampus

<!-- chunk -->

## in the Rhodiola Rosea-treated group were increased and recovered to

<!-- chunk -->

### normal level.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study concluded that Rhodiola Rosea promotes the proliferation and

<!-- chunk -->

### differentiation of neural stem cells in the hippocampus. And may play a

<!-- chunk -->

### role in saving injured neurons of the hippocampus.989


<!-- chunk -->

## Chronic stress and cortisol can damage your brain. Neuroscientists at the

<!-- chunk -->

## University of California, Berkeley, found that chronic stress triggers long-

<!-- chunk -->

## term changes in brain structure and function.990

<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic stress changes neural networks. Cortisol creates a domino effect

<!-- chunk -->

### that hard-wires pathways between the hippocampus and amygdala. (The

<!-- chunk -->

### amygdala (lizard brain) is the area responsible for your fight-or-flight

<!-- chunk -->

### response).

<!-- chunk -->

### This hard wiring caused by stress is not the way the brain was designed.

<!-- chunk -->

### But chronic, ongoing stress tricks the brain into rebuilding circuits and

<!-- chunk -->

### hunkering down for the long haul.

<!-- chunk -->

### This re-wiring appears to be permanent. Unless you intervene with

<!-- chunk -->

### something like Rhodiola Rosea.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic stress seems to ‘flip a switch’ in stem cells in the brain. And turns

<!-- chunk -->

### them into a type of cell that prevents connections to the prefrontal cortex.

<!-- chunk -->

### Preventing improved learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## And laying down the scaffolding linked to anxiety, depression and PTSD

<!-- chunk -->

### (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).

<!-- chunk -->

## ↓ Chronic stress reduces levels of serotonin and norepinephrine

<!-- chunk -->

## ↓ Chronic stress reduces the number of neurons

<!-- chunk -->

## ↑ Anxiety and depression increases

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Chronic stress induces brain fog and memory loss

<!-- chunk -->

### Under conditions of chronic stress and excess cortisol you experience

<!-- chunk -->

### mental and physical fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

## Rhodiola Rosea benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea undoes damage to your brain caused by chronic stress. It

<!-- chunk -->

### helps keep it healthy. And even improves your body and brain’s response

<!-- chunk -->

### to stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea relieves stress by balancing your body’s stress-response

<!-- chunk -->

### system. And helps your body return to a relaxed state by influencing key

<!-- chunk -->

### brain chemicals like serotonin, norepinephrine and beta-endorphins

<!-- chunk -->

### (opioid neuropeptides).991

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea can also help prevent and repair damage caused by C-

<!-- chunk -->

### reactive protein and free radicals.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea even provides protection and regeneration of neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### during periods of stress. It helps in the synthesis and re-synthesis of ATP.

<!-- chunk -->

### The main fuel source for the mitochondria in your cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Any kind of fatigue you experience – regardless of source – Rhodiola

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosea is like your “magic bullet”. Mood, energy, stamina and

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration can all increase with a dose of this herb.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers even report improved libido and sexual performance

<!-- chunk -->

### when using Rhodiola Rosea.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you get an effective dose of real standardized Rhodiola Rosea extract,

<!-- chunk -->

### you should experience an effect.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Rhodiola Rosea feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### The time required to begin feeling the effects of Rhodiola Rosea depends

<!-- chunk -->

### on your genetics, mental and physical condition, environment, behavior

<!-- chunk -->

### and lifestyle.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some neurohackers report feeling its effects in just a few days. While

<!-- chunk -->

### others require as much as 3 weeks. Clinical studies show that most people

<!-- chunk -->

### experience the full benefits of Rhodiola Rosea in 30 – 40 days.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you don’t notice a change within 40 days, Rhodiola Rosea may not be

<!-- chunk -->

### effective for you.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many report that Rhodiola Rosea provides a pronounced anti-anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### effect. Depression lifts and overall quality of life improves.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea should give you an energy lift. It could improve your

<!-- chunk -->

### mood, focus, level of concentration and alertness.


<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea has a reputation in the nootropic community for its

<!-- chunk -->

### energizing and anti-fatigue qualities.

<!-- chunk -->

### One double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was carried out with 161 cadets

<!-- chunk -->

### aged from 19 – 21 years. The intent was to measure the effect of a single

<!-- chunk -->

### dose of Rhodiola Rosea extract (SHR-5) on capacity for mental work

<!-- chunk -->

### against a background of fatigue and stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### An additional objective was to try two different doses of the extract. The

<!-- chunk -->

### other dose being 50% higher. So the cadets were given either 2 or

<!-- chunk -->

### capsules of Rhodiola Rosea extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study showed a “pronounced anti-fatigue effect” in the cadets. With

<!-- chunk -->

### no significant differences between the two dosage groups. But there was a

<!-- chunk -->

### “possible trend in favor of the lower dose” in the cognitive tests.992

<!-- chunk -->

## Rhodiola Rosea as a nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of repeated low-dose

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment of Rhodiola Rosea extract (SHR-5) on mental performance with

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigued physicians.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers recruited a group of 56 healthy, young physicians working

<!-- chunk -->

### night duty at the Armenian State Medical University. Tests involved

<!-- chunk -->

### overall level of mental fatigue, associative thinking, short-term memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### calculation, ability of concentration, and speed of audio-visual perception.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tests were done before and after night duty during 3 periods of 2 weeks

<!-- chunk -->

### each. The young doctors received Rhodiola Rosea extract tablets or a

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo for the first 2 weeks. Followed by a 2 week ‘washout’ period. And

<!-- chunk -->

### finishing with another 2 weeks of Rhodiola Rosea extract tablets or a

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team found a statistically significant improvement in

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive tests during the first 2 weeks. No side effects were reported. And

<!-- chunk -->

### the young doctors had a reduction in general fatigue under stressful

<!-- chunk -->

### conditions.993

<!-- chunk -->

## Rhodiola Rosea as an anti-depressant

<!-- chunk -->

### One study published in Phytomedicine was run as a “proof of concept”

<!-- chunk -->

### trial to evaluate the efficacy of using Rhodiola Rosea compared to the

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-depressant ‘sertraline’ for major depressive disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sertraline (Zoloft®) is a pharmaceutical SSRI used to treat depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, panic attacks, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). And it

<!-- chunk -->

### comes with a host of side effects including fatigue, diarrhea, anorexia,

<!-- chunk -->

### convulsions, confusion, decreased libido, and ejaculation failure.

<!-- chunk -->

### This trial recruited 57 people diagnosed with depression. They were given

<!-- chunk -->

### standardized Rhodiola Rosea extract, sertraline, or a placebo for 12 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### 3 different depression scoring tests were used during the trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that Rhodiola Rosea produced less

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant effect than sertraline, but it also resulted in “significantly

<!-- chunk -->

### fewer adverse events and was better tolerated.”

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team concluded that even though Rhodiola offered slightly

<!-- chunk -->

### less anti-depressant benefits, it possessed “a more favorable risk to benefit

<!-- chunk -->

### ratio for those with mild to moderate depression”.994


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dose of Rhodiola Rosea is 150 – 200 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Look for an extract that is standardized to contain rosavins and

<!-- chunk -->

### salidrosides in a 3:1 ratio. This mimics the ratio of these compounds that

<!-- chunk -->

### naturally occur in Rhodiola Rosea root.

<!-- chunk -->

### No additional benefit seems to come from taking more than 1,000 mg per


<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea is a natural adaptogen and herb that has been used

<!-- chunk -->

### successfully for thousands of years. It’s considered non-toxic and safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### And very few side effects have been reported.

<!-- chunk -->

### Considerably higher than recommended doses could result in dry mouth,

<!-- chunk -->

### nausea, upset stomach, headache, insomnia and weight loss.

<!-- chunk -->

### Since Rhodiola Rosea acts as a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI),

<!-- chunk -->

### you should not use it if you’re taking MAOI meds. MAOI’s are a type of

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-depressant drug used to treat bipolar disorder, panic disorder, social

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety disorder and PTSD.

<!-- chunk -->

### MAOI meds influence serotonin levels in the brain. So taking MAOI’s in

<!-- chunk -->

### combination with Rhodiola Rosea has the potential to cause serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### syndrome.


<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea is available as a powder, capsules, tablets, and tea.

<!-- chunk -->

### Active ingredients of Rhodiola Rosea include rosavins and salidrosides.

<!-- chunk -->

### Make sure you look for the percentage of active ingredients listed on the

<!-- chunk -->

### bottle or package.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ideally, you’re looking for a 3:1 ratio of rosavins and salidrosides. This

<!-- chunk -->

### mimics the ratio of these compounds naturally occurring in the Rhodiola

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosea root.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now this is where it gets tricky. And probably the reason why some forum

<!-- chunk -->

### threads and user reviews report no effect from using Rhodiola Rosea.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the late 1980’s, demand for Rhodiola Rosea-based phytomedicines

<!-- chunk -->

### dramatically increased. The wild-grown, raw material was over-harvested,

<!-- chunk -->

### resulting in a steady decline in the quality and effectiveness of Rhodiola

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosea.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies revealed that other species of genus Rhodiola were being

<!-- chunk -->

### substituted for Rhodiola Rosea. While some of these mixed batches were

<!-- chunk -->

### highly variable in quality, others had no pharmacological or nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### effect.995

<!-- chunk -->

### So do your best to find out where the supplement maker gets their raw

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea. Hostile environments like Siberia seem to produce higher

<!-- chunk -->

### quality Rhodiola Rosea.

<!-- chunk -->

### The active ingredients for most nootropic benefit include Rosavin,

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosaridin, Rosarin, Rosin, Salidroside, and Tyrosol. The first 3 are

<!-- chunk -->

### collectively referred to as “rosavins”. And the other big one is

<!-- chunk -->

### “salidroside” which has several iterations.

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid supplements that list “other ingredients” on the label. And look for

<!-- chunk -->

## Certified Organic to ensure the root used to make your Rhodiola Rosea

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement is free of heavy metals, pesticides and herbicides.


<!-- chunk -->

## Rhodiola Rosea Extract 150 – 200 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Rhodiola Rosea as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Rhodiola Rosea on its own. So to get its benefits


<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea is especially helpful for those suffering from anxiety and

<!-- chunk -->

### stress. Studies show it helps stop and reverse the devastating effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### stress in your brain, and body. This nootropic helps repair the damage to

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons caused by chronic stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea is a powerful adaptogen. Which means it helps increase

<!-- chunk -->

### the effect of certain hormones when activity is low. And will block excess

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulation when activity is too high.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea as an adaptogen helps balance norepinephrine in the body

<!-- chunk -->

### caused by chronic stress. It also boosts serotonin and the feel-good opioid

<!-- chunk -->

### chemical beta-endorphins.

<!-- chunk -->

### Using Rhodiola Rosea can help eliminate brain fog, increase concentration

<!-- chunk -->

### during brutal periods like exams or business presentations, boost energy

<!-- chunk -->

### by increasing the ATP fueling your mitochondria, and protect your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells from free radical damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea helps alleviate mental and physical fatigue, improves

<!-- chunk -->

### stress response, and provides better quality of sleep. It can even help out

<!-- chunk -->

### your sex life.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Rosea is especially helpful for those suffering from anxiety and

<!-- chunk -->

### panic disorders. Studies have shown the calming effect of this herb was

<!-- chunk -->

### equal to some popular antidepressant and anti-anxiety drugs. Without the

<!-- chunk -->

### side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely take up to 600 mg of Rhodiola Rosea extract daily if

<!-- chunk -->

### needed. Most get all the benefit they need with 150 - 200 mg. Half of the

<!-- chunk -->

### dose in the morning, and another early afternoon.

<!-- chunk -->

### And make sure your getting genuine Rhodiola Rosea extract with a 3:1

<!-- chunk -->

### ratio of rosavins and salidrosides. Read the user reviews and labels.


# Rosemary

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary is known for boosting alertness, memory, mood, reducing

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, reducing inflammation, and may be effective for reducing the

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

## Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) is an evergreen herb belonging to the

<!-- chunk -->

### mint family Lamiaceae which is native to northern Asia and the

<!-- chunk -->

### Mediterranean. And is used world-wide as a culinary spice and medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary’s medicinal use dates back to the ancient Greeks and Romans in

<!-- chunk -->

### 500 B.C. Greek students wore garlands of Rosemary on their head to help

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulate memory during exams.

<!-- chunk -->

### Its genus name, Rosmarinus, is derived from the Latin word for ‘dew’

<!-- chunk -->

### (ros), and ‘belonging in the sea’ (marinus).

<!-- chunk -->

### Legend says the Virgin Mary took shelter next to a Rosemary bush as she

<!-- chunk -->

### fled from Egypt. She threw her blue cape on a Rosemary bush, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### white flowers turned blue. This is how Rosemary or ‘rose of Mary’ got its

<!-- chunk -->

### name.996

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary with its pleasant flavor and aroma, and bitter taste is used in

<!-- chunk -->

### many traditional dishes. Rosemary can be used in the form of fresh leaves,

<!-- chunk -->

### powder, or as an essential oil.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary has also been used traditionally to relieve pain, improve

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, increase immunity, and promote hair growth.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary is an excellent source of calcium, iron, and Vitamin A, Vitamin

<!-- chunk -->

### B6, and Vitamin C. And provides potent antifungal and antibacterial

<!-- chunk -->

### properties.997

<!-- chunk -->

### Compounds found in Rosemary oil have been shown to increase memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## The compound 1,8-cineole acts as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor which

<!-- chunk -->

### boosts acetylcholine levels in your brain. In the same way as drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### prescribed to treat dementia.998

<!-- chunk -->

### A study conducted at Mahidol University in Thailand in 2013 tested

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary essential oil and its effects on the human central nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### system.

<!-- chunk -->

### 20 healthy subjects ages 18 – 28 years were asked to inhale the aroma of

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary essential oil. An EEG found that alpha brain waves decreased,

<!-- chunk -->

### and beta brain waves increased after inhalation of the oil.

<!-- chunk -->

### This change in brain wave activity boosted alertness and improved

<!-- chunk -->

### thinking performance. The study confirmed the stimulant effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### inhaling the aroma of Rosemary essential oil.999

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary essential oil is also a proven stress-reliever. It acts by lowering

<!-- chunk -->

### cortisol levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows that Rosemary has stimulatory effects on brain wave

<!-- chunk -->

### activity, autonomic nervous system activity, and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Rosemary work in the brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Rosemary improves memory – Rosemary has traditionally been

<!-- chunk -->

### used to improve cognitive performance and mood. And these reports

<!-- chunk -->

### have been verified in recent clinical studies.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study conducted at the University of Northumbria in the UK worked

<!-- chunk -->

### with 144 volunteers. In this study, the group who inhaled Rosemary

<!-- chunk -->

### essential oil demonstrated an overall improvement in memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### mood.1000

<!-- chunk -->

### In 2013, Jemma McCready and Dr Mark Moss from the University of

<!-- chunk -->

### Northumbria conducted a study with 66 adults. The focus of this trial was

<!-- chunk -->

### on prospective memory, which involved remembering things that were

<!-- chunk -->

### bound to happen in the future, or simply remembering things that were

<!-- chunk -->

### critical for everyday functioning.

<!-- chunk -->

### The test group were put into a room infused with Rosemary essential oil,

<!-- chunk -->

### and the control group in a room with no scent.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study found that the group in the Rosemary scented room performed

<!-- chunk -->

### 60-75% better on the prospective memory tasks than the control group.1001

<!-- chunk -->

### In 2017, the same researchers presented their findings to the British

<!-- chunk -->

### Psychological Society Annual Conference in Brighton.

<!-- chunk -->

### In a follow-up study, they recruited 40 children age 10 – 11 to find out if

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary produced a similar benefit in the young.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once again, the test group were put into a Rosemary oil infused room, and

<!-- chunk -->

### the control group in a room with no scent.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found that children in the Rosemary scented room

<!-- chunk -->

### performed 5 to 7% better in working memory scores than the kids in the

<!-- chunk -->

### control group.1002

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Rosemary is neuroprotective – Rosemary’s bioactive compounds

<!-- chunk -->

### including phenolic diterpenes and triterpene acids are known to be

<!-- chunk -->

### potent neuroprotectors.

<!-- chunk -->

### Animal research demonstrates the phenolic compounds in Rosemary

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce oxidative stress. Animals pre-treated with Rosemary experienced

<!-- chunk -->

### far less brain damage during an ischemic stroke. And recovered with

<!-- chunk -->

### higher neurological scores because of an intact blood-brain barrier.1003

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary extract has been used traditionally and in modern times to

<!-- chunk -->

### relieve pain. Studies show that terpenoids, and to a lesser extent

<!-- chunk -->

### rosmarinic acid significantly reduce pain sensitivity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary protects nerve fibers and prevents reduction in both myelin

<!-- chunk -->

### thickness and axon diameter. And helps maintain the plasticity of glial

<!-- chunk -->

### cells and astrocytes involved in pain maintenance. In turn preventing

<!-- chunk -->

### feelings of pain and alterations of the nervous system induced by nerve

<!-- chunk -->

### injury.1004

<!-- chunk -->

### Its anti-neuropathic properties can be attributed to rosemary binding to

<!-- chunk -->

### nicotinic acetylcholine receptors which are polypeptides that respond to

<!-- chunk -->

### the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. When rosemary binds to these

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors it reduces neuropathic hypersensitivity and protects nerve

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue.1005


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Concentration, attention, and mental agility decline


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Free radicals and oxidative stress damage brain cells


<!-- chunk -->

### But even if you’re not concerned with the effects of aging, Rosemary can

<!-- chunk -->

### help.

<!-- chunk -->

## Rosemary benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary has been used for millennia to protect and support brain


<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary is a potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary can boost concentration and memory. Simply smelling

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary can help you remember things better.

<!-- chunk -->

### 20 healthy volunteers performed subtraction and visual processing tasks in

<!-- chunk -->

### a cubicle diffused with the aroma of Rosemary. Mood was assessed before

<!-- chunk -->

### and after the test. And blood samples were taken during the study.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study showed improved performance and concentration related to how

<!-- chunk -->

### much 1,8-cineole was absorbed following exposure to Rosemary aroma.

<!-- chunk -->

### Speed and accuracy improved and there was a significant reduction in

<!-- chunk -->

### feelings of contentment as blood levels of 1,8-cineole declined.1006

<!-- chunk -->

### Reductions in acetylcholine is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases

<!-- chunk -->

### such as Alzheimer’s and dementia. Rosemary inhibits acetylcholinesterase

<!-- chunk -->

### activity which increases acetylcholine levels in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Amyloid-β proteins clump to form amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary

<!-- chunk -->

### tangles (NFT) causing memory loss in Alzheimer’s and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### The carnosic acid in Rosemary has been shown to suppress the formation

<!-- chunk -->

### of amyloid-β plaques.1007

<!-- chunk -->

### Additional nootropic benefits from consuming or inhaling Rosemary,

<!-- chunk -->

### include enhanced cognitive performance, elevated alertness, and less

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety.1008

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Rosemary feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Many users of Rosemary report more energy and better clarity when

<!-- chunk -->

### thinking after taking the supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### When used as a nootropic, Rosemary works as a cognitive stimulant and

<!-- chunk -->

### helps improve memory, alertness, and focus.

<!-- chunk -->

### People who use Rosemary essential oil report improved mood, lower stress

<!-- chunk -->

### levels, and fewer episodes of cortisol imbalance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some report better immunity and blood circulation after supplementing

<!-- chunk -->

### with Rosemary. Likely due to its rich antioxidant and anti-inflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

### properties.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some neurohackers also like to include Rosemary in their diets as an

<!-- chunk -->

### herbal tea, or as a seasoning agent in food. It has a lovely flavour and

<!-- chunk -->

### aroma that can energize you instantly.

<!-- chunk -->

## Rosemary Clinical Research

<!-- chunk -->

## Rosemary boosts cognitive performance

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne wanted to

<!-- chunk -->

### find out how the aroma of essential oils affected human behavior.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, 20 healthy volunteers performed serial subtraction and visual

<!-- chunk -->

### information processing tasks in a cubicle infused with 4 drops of

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary essential oil.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mood was assessed pre- and post-testing, and blood samples were drawn

<!-- chunk -->

### at the end of the session.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study authors discovered that performance on cognitive tasks were

<!-- chunk -->

### related to the concentration of 1,8-cineole from Rosemary absorbed in

<!-- chunk -->

### blood from simple exposure to Rosemary aroma.

<!-- chunk -->

### Performance improved as concentrations of 1,8-cineole increased. This

<!-- chunk -->

### performance boost was reflected in speed and accuracy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mood changes were not as significant. But the researchers did notice that

<!-- chunk -->

### feelings of contentment declined as 1,8-cineole levels in blood decreased.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that compounds absorbed from Rosemary

<!-- chunk -->

### aroma had a positive effect on cognition and mood.1009

<!-- chunk -->

## Rosemary increases alertness

<!-- chunk -->

### A study at the University of Miami School of Medicine recruited 40 adults

<!-- chunk -->

### to observe the effects of aromatherapy on alertness and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Participants were exposed to the aromas of Lavender (considered a

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxing odor) or Rosemary (considered a stimulatory odor) for 3 minutes

<!-- chunk -->

### each.

<!-- chunk -->

### Participants were also given simple math computations before and after

<!-- chunk -->

### the therapy.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study at the University of Miami School of Medicine recruited 40 adults

<!-- chunk -->

### Participants were also given simple math computations before and after

<!-- chunk -->

### the therapy.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Lavender group showed increased beta power suggesting increased

<!-- chunk -->

### drowsiness, and less depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### The adults in this group also reported feeling more relaxed and performed

<!-- chunk -->

### the math computations faster and more accurately following

<!-- chunk -->

### aromatherapy.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Rosemary group on the other hand showed decreased frontal alpha

<!-- chunk -->

### and beta power suggesting increased alertness.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Rosemary group on the other hand showed decreased frontal alpha

<!-- chunk -->

### and beta power suggesting increased alertness.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Rosemary adults also had lower anxiety scores. They reported feeling

<!-- chunk -->

### more relaxed and alert. They were faster doing math computations but

<!-- chunk -->

### unlike the Lavender group were not more accurate.1010

<!-- chunk -->

## Rosemary Recommended Dosage

<!-- chunk -->

### The recommended dosage of Rosemary leaf for nootropic benefit is

<!-- chunk -->

### mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary extract (standardized to 20% rosmarinic acid, 20% diterpenes,

<!-- chunk -->

### and 9% carnosic acid) is 275 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary essential oil in a diffuser 1 mL (10 – 40 drops) as needed.

<!-- chunk -->

## Rosemary Side Effects

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary as a nootropic is considered non-toxic and safe when used as

<!-- chunk -->

### recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary as been used by humanity for millennia as a food condiment. So

<!-- chunk -->

### as a nootropic should be well tolerated by most people.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary has been shown in animal models to reduce sperm count in male

<!-- chunk -->

### rats, and abort fetuses in female rats.

<!-- chunk -->

### But keep in mind that the dosage size of Rosemary in rats was 250 and

<!-- chunk -->

### mg/kg of body weight. Much higher doses than we would use as a

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic. Authors of this study attributed these side effects to reductions

<!-- chunk -->

### in testosterone caused by high-dose Rosemary.1011

<!-- chunk -->

### Do no use Rosemary if you are using blood-thinning medication. Or ACE

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibitors used to treat high blood pressure.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do NOT take Rosemary essential oil internally because it could cause

<!-- chunk -->

### vomiting, uterine bleeding, kidney irritation, increased sun sensitivity,

<!-- chunk -->

### skin redness, and allergic reactions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do not use Rosemary as a nootropic supplement if you are pregnant

<!-- chunk -->

### because it may cause a miscarriage. And if you’re breastfeeding you

<!-- chunk -->

### should use Rosemary in moderation.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are diabetic, pre-diabetic or suffer from insulin resistance you

<!-- chunk -->

### should avoid using Rosemary as a nootropic.1012

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid using Rosemary if you are undergoing chemotherapy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Type of Rosemary to Buy

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary is available as a nootropic supplement in capsules, tablets, and

<!-- chunk -->

### as bags of powder.

<!-- chunk -->

### As an extract, look for Rosemary standardized to 20% rosmarinic acid,

<!-- chunk -->

### 20% diterpenes, and 10% carnosic acid.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary essential oil can be used in aromatherapy or for topical

<!-- chunk -->

### application on your skin.


<!-- chunk -->

## Rosemary extract up to 750 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Rosemary extract as a nootropic supplement. Either in

<!-- chunk -->

### capsule form or as aromatherapy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Rosemary on its own. So, to get its benefits you

<!-- chunk -->

### must take it as a supplement or use it in aromatherapy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary as a nootropic can be taken as a supplement in capsules or

<!-- chunk -->

### powder or steeped as Rosemary tea 2 or 3-times a day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary seems to be especially helpful for those dealing with

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. Rosemary increases

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine, inhibits Amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles, reduces

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation and eliminates heavy metals.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary has been shown to help reduce anxiety and improve mood. And

<!-- chunk -->

### works quickly when used as an essential oil in aromatherapy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Simply the scent of Rosemary has been proven to boost alertness and


<!-- chunk -->

### Purity and dosing are important when selecting a Rosemary extract

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement or essential oil. Choose a product where the manufacturer can

<!-- chunk -->

### verify their production and testing methods.

<!-- chunk -->

### And user reviews can be very helpful for choosing the best vendor and

<!-- chunk -->

### brand of Rosemary.


# Saffron

<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron is used for depression, PMS symptoms, post-partum depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, appetite suppression, energy & stamina in athletes, and

<!-- chunk -->

### preventing neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

## Saffron (Crocus sativus) as a nootropic is the dried crimson stigma of the

<!-- chunk -->

### C. sativus flower cultivated primarily in Iran. And is the world’s most

<!-- chunk -->

### expensive culinary spice largely due to the way it must be grown and

<!-- chunk -->

### harvested (by hand).

<!-- chunk -->

### The earliest reference to Saffron goes back to around 2,300 BC from

<!-- chunk -->

### Sargon, founder of the Akkadian empire. Sargon was born in a village on

<!-- chunk -->

### the shores of the Euphrates called Azupiranu (city of Saffron).1013

<!-- chunk -->

### Since then, documentation of Saffron use over the last 4,000 years for at

<!-- chunk -->

### least 90 illnesses has been uncovered.

<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron takes a long time to germinate from seed and 3 years for the plant

<!-- chunk -->

### to flower. Once it blooms in mid-Autumn, the flowers must be picked

<!-- chunk -->

### carefully by hand within 1 – 2 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### Each Crocus sativus plant produces 3 – 4 flowers per season. Each flower

<!-- chunk -->

### produces a 3-pronged style, each prong terminating in a vivid crimson

<!-- chunk -->

### stigma. Saffron is the dried stigma of Crocus sativus.

<!-- chunk -->

### This labor-intensive production method makes Saffron the most expensive

<!-- chunk -->

### culinary spice in the world.

<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron contains the metabolites crocin, picrocrocin, safranal, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidants lycopene and zeaxanthin as well as Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### all which

<!-- chunk -->

### provide its medicinal value.1014

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, Saffron may be used for depression, PMS symptoms, post-

<!-- chunk -->

### partum depression, memory, appetite suppression, and preventing

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Saffron work in the brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Saffron boosts mood. Recent studies suggest that brain-derived

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Nerve Growth Factor, and cAMP

<!-- chunk -->

### Response Binding Protein (CREB) all play a role in anxiety and


<!-- chunk -->

### Further research shows that Saffron has a significant effect on BDNF, NFG

<!-- chunk -->

### and cAMP levels in the brain.1015 Which likely explains why Saffron is so

<!-- chunk -->

### effective in treating teenage anxiety and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study in 2018 had 80 participants aged 12 – 16 years with anxiety and

<!-- chunk -->

### depression try Saffron extract (Affron®) 14 mg or a placebo for 8 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study concluded that Saffron extract was effective in relieving the

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of separation anxiety, social phobia and depression compared to

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo.1016

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in the psychology department at Murdoch University in Perth

<!-- chunk -->

### conducted a systematic analysis of every clinical trial they could find for

<!-- chunk -->

### high-quality, randomized, double-blind studies using Saffron, a placebo

<!-- chunk -->

### and antidepressant meds as controls in humans (not animals).

<!-- chunk -->

### The team concluded that clinical trials support the use of Saffron for the

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment of mild to moderate depression.1017

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Saffron for preventing Alzheimer’s. One of the most common

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms in Alzheimer’s patients is depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### And doctors commonly prescribe antidepressants for treatment. Including

<!-- chunk -->

### drugs like sertraline (Zoloft®).1018 Despite the fact that these meds don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### work for Alzheimer’s disease and come with a host of side effects.1019

<!-- chunk -->

### An alternative treatment is obviously needed. So researchers set up a

<!-- chunk -->

### double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 46 Alzheimer’s patients. The

<!-- chunk -->

### patients were given 15 mg of Saffron twice daily or placebo for 16 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The results of this trial showed Saffron produced a significantly better

<!-- chunk -->

### reduction in behavioral and psychological symptoms than placebo. And

<!-- chunk -->

### concluded, “Saffron is both safe and effective in mild to moderate

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s”.1020

<!-- chunk -->

### The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil (Aricept®) is also prescribed

<!-- chunk -->

### to Alzheimer’s patients. For increasing acetylcholine which has been

<!-- chunk -->

### found to be low in these patients.

<!-- chunk -->

### A 22-week, randomized, double-blind trial with 54 Alzheimer’s patients

<!-- chunk -->

### was conducted to compare donepezil with Saffron. Patients received either

<!-- chunk -->

### 15 mg of Saffron twice per day or 5 mg of donepezil twice per day for the

<!-- chunk -->

### extent of the trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### This phase II study found Saffron extract was as effective as donepezil in

<!-- chunk -->

### the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s. But Saffron did not produce

<!-- chunk -->

### the side effect of vomiting.1021


<!-- chunk -->

### Depression is a growing health problem. With over 10% of Americans

<!-- chunk -->

### taking prescription antidepressants. Of whom 90% experience at least one

<!-- chunk -->

### adverse effect. Ranging from sexual dysfunction to convulsion to bleeding

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Antidepressant use can result in:

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Abnormal bleeding

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Agitation, aggression, anxiety, and delirium

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Confusion, convulsions and even death

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Decreasing memory, delusional thinking

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Hallucinations, headaches, and heart attacks

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Insomnia, lethargy, nightmares, and panic attacks

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Sedation, impaired driving, slow speech

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Sexual dysfunction, priapism

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Panic attacks, paranoia, suicidal thoughts, violent behavior

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Serotonin Syndrome, withdrawal symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### A growing database of studies and user reviews show that Saffron helps

<!-- chunk -->

### treat depression without the risky side effects of prescription

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron has also been shown to be effective with other conditions for

<!-- chunk -->

### which antidepressants are prescribed. Including anxiety, Alzheimer’s, and

<!-- chunk -->

### obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

<!-- chunk -->

### We even have reports of Saffron reversing the sexual dysfunction caused

<!-- chunk -->

### by using prescription antidepressants.

<!-- chunk -->

## Saffron benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### To experience Saffron’s nootropic value you’ll need to use more than a

<!-- chunk -->

### sprinkling of the spice from your local supermarket.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show Saffron could be an alternative to some popular

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant meds.1022 And for anxiety.1023

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study with 18 – 45-year-old women suffering from post-partum

<!-- chunk -->

### depression showed Saffron effective in reducing depression.1024

<!-- chunk -->

### And a group of women aged 18 – 45 dealing with Premenstrual Syndrome

<!-- chunk -->

### (PMS) found that Saffron was effective in relieving depression during two

<!-- chunk -->

### menstrual cycles (cycles 3 and 4).1025

<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron is a smooth muscle relaxant and helps lower blood pressure. Likely

<!-- chunk -->

### because of its inhibitory effect on histamine H


<!-- chunk -->

### receptors, stimulatory

<!-- chunk -->

### effect on ß2-adrenoceptors, and antagonist effect on muscarinic

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors.1026

<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron inhibits acetylcholinesterase which increases acetylcholine in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. Improving brain signaling and helping learning and memory.1027

<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron inhibits the deposition of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) fibrils which has

<!-- chunk -->

### been implicated in Alzheimer’s.1028

<!-- chunk -->

### Several human studies show Saffron as effective as some popular

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants in treating mild to moderate anxiety and depression.1029

<!-- chunk -->

### Some of the symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease originate from under-

<!-- chunk -->

### utilization of dopamine in the substantia nigra area of the brain. Studies

<!-- chunk -->

### show Saffron helps protect the substantia nigra dopamine neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with Parkinson’s.1030

<!-- chunk -->

### Newly published studies show Saffron helps protect your eyes from

<!-- chunk -->

### ultraviolet blue light radiation (UV-B). And flicker sensitivity from

<!-- chunk -->

### glaring monitors and headlights.1031

<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron improves the oxygen and nutrient supply required for healthy eyes.

<!-- chunk -->

### By boosting blood flow in the retina and choroid of your eyes.1032

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Saffron feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers report supplementing with Saffron has helped them

<!-- chunk -->

### stop eating junk food, avoid nighttime snacking, and they’re no longer

<!-- chunk -->

### obsessed with thinking about food all the time.

<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron has been proven to help with Age-Related Macular Degeneration

<!-- chunk -->

### (AMD). Vision may be sharper. And you can see a line or two further down

<!-- chunk -->

### the Snellen chart at your next eye appointment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glare from headlights during nighttime driving and flicker from monitors

<!-- chunk -->

### is no longer a problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### You may experience an improvement in mood when supplementing with

<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron. No longer over-reacting, and work-related stress now feels like

<!-- chunk -->

### you are again in control.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers report an increase in energy and better libido with

<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron.

<!-- chunk -->

### Feeling tired and emotional is a thing of the past. You’re back to your

<!-- chunk -->

### bright, positive, happy self!

<!-- chunk -->

## Saffron Clinical Research

<!-- chunk -->

### Clinical research into the efficacy of Saffron is encouraging. But trial

<!-- chunk -->

### lengths have typically been limited to 4 – 6 weeks. And sample sizes are

<!-- chunk -->

### relatively small (30 – 40 people).

<!-- chunk -->

### And keep in mind of the potential for bias because most clinical trials with

<!-- chunk -->

### humans have been conducted in Iran. Which produces nearly 90% of

<!-- chunk -->

### saffron for the world market. But these are still high-quality studies.

<!-- chunk -->

## Saffron as good as Prozac

<!-- chunk -->

### A double-blind, randomized trial with 40 adult outpatients suffering from

<!-- chunk -->

### major depression was conducted at the University of Tehran. The study

<!-- chunk -->

### compared Saffron petals with fluoxetine (Prozac®) for the treatment of


<!-- chunk -->

### Patients were given 15 mg of Saffron petals in the morning and evening, or

<!-- chunk -->

### 10 mg fluoxetine morning and evening for 8 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study concluded that Saffron petals were as effective as fluoxetine in

<!-- chunk -->

### the treatment of mild to moderate depression. The remission rate was 25%

<!-- chunk -->

### in both groups with no significant differences in side effects.1033

<!-- chunk -->

## Saffron for Alzheimer’s Disease

<!-- chunk -->

### There is increasing evidence to suggest that Saffron could be used in the

<!-- chunk -->

### management of Alzheimer’s Disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### In one Iranian study, 54 adults aged 55 year or older with Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### participated in a 22-week, double-blind trial. Patients were randomly

<!-- chunk -->

### assigned 30 mg per day of Saffron (15 mg twice per day) or 10 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### of donepezil (Aricept®) (5 mg twice per day).

<!-- chunk -->

### The study found that Saffron was as effective as the drug donepezil in the

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s after 22 weeks.1034

<!-- chunk -->

### Other research shows that Saffron may inhibit the aggregation of amyloid-

<!-- chunk -->

### β in the human brain and may therefore be useful in Alzheimer’s.1035

<!-- chunk -->

### 46 patients with Alzheimer’s volunteered for a 16-week, double-blind

<!-- chunk -->

### trial. Patients were randomly assigned 15 mg of Saffron twice per day or a

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo for the 16-week study.

<!-- chunk -->

### After 16 weeks, Saffron produced a significantly better outcome on

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive function than placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study concluded, “This double-blind, placebo-controlled study

<!-- chunk -->

### suggests that at least in the short-term, Saffron is both safe and effective in

<!-- chunk -->

### mild to moderate Alzheimer’s.”1036

<!-- chunk -->

## Saffron for ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### A randomized double-blind study was conducted with 54 children 6-17

<!-- chunk -->

### years old who were diagnosed with ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### The children received 20 – 30 mg methylphenidate or 20 – 30 mg Saffron

<!-- chunk -->

### per day for 6 weeks. Symptoms were assessed using the Teacher and

<!-- chunk -->

### Parent Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-

<!-- chunk -->

### RS-IV) at baseline and weeks 3 and 6.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found no significant difference in reduction of ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms between the two groups.

<!-- chunk -->

### And concluded, “Short-term therapy with saffron capsule showed the same

<!-- chunk -->

### efficacy compared with methylphenidate.”1037

<!-- chunk -->

## Saffron Recommended Dosage

<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dose of Saffron is 25 – 30 mg twice per day for mild to

<!-- chunk -->

### moderate depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clinical studies have evaluated doses ranging from 20 – 400 mg per day of

<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dosages up to 1.5 g per day of Saffron are thought to be safe.1038 With toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### effects reported for 5 g doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### As with many nootropics, more is NOT better when using Saffron. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### research shows that dosages above 1.5 g of Saffron can be extremely toxic.

<!-- chunk -->

## Saffron Side Effects

<!-- chunk -->

### Genuine Saffron is non-toxic and well-tolerated by most people when used

<!-- chunk -->

### at the recommended dosage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some reported side effects of Saffron include headaches, nausea,

<!-- chunk -->

### dizziness, vomiting, and mania (esp. if you are bipolar). Saffron can

<!-- chunk -->

### aggravate asthma symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### 5 g of Saffron are associated with toxic effects. And very high doses of

<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron (10 – 20 g) can be deadly.

<!-- chunk -->

### No drug interactions have been reported. But interactions with anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### aggregating drugs are theoretically possible.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do NOT use Saffron if you have a bleeding disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

## Type of Saffron to buy

<!-- chunk -->

## Saffron as a nootropic is typically sold in capsules.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most individual Saffron supplements on the market are standardized (for

<!-- chunk -->

### 0.3% safranal) usually with 88.5 mg ‘Saffron extract’.

<!-- chunk -->

### For nootropic use, look for supplements guaranteed to contain a patented

<!-- chunk -->

### version of Saffron extract. Otherwise, you’ll not likely experience the

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive benefits of this nootropic for reasons I’ll go into in a minute.

<!-- chunk -->

## Affron®: Manufactured by PharmActive Biotech Products in Madrid,

<!-- chunk -->

### Spain and not easily found in Saffron products sold in the USA.

<!-- chunk -->

## Satiereal®: Made by PLT Health Solutions in Morristown, NJ and included

<!-- chunk -->

### in select Saffron products.

<!-- chunk -->

## Safranal®: Manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich and included in some Saffron


<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron is also included in much smaller amounts in some vison/eye

<!-- chunk -->

### formulas. While extremely effective for vision health, it’s not enough for

<!-- chunk -->

### much cognitive benefit.

<!-- chunk -->

### Keep in mind that Saffron is the most valuable medicinal food plant on the

<!-- chunk -->

### planet. Which makes it a primary target by unscrupulous marketers for

<!-- chunk -->

### adulteration.

<!-- chunk -->

### Common adulterants include mixing Saffron with things like beet,

<!-- chunk -->

### pomegranate fibers, and red-dyed silk fibers to decrease the cost of

<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes the flowers of other plants, including safflower, marigold,

<!-- chunk -->

### arnica and tinted grasses are fraudulently mixed with genuine Saffron

<!-- chunk -->

### stigmas.

<!-- chunk -->

### The common mislabeling of turmeric (curcuma longa) as “Indian saffron”,

<!-- chunk -->

### “American saffron”, or “Mexican saffron” can easily be mistaken as

<!-- chunk -->

### genuine Saffron.

<!-- chunk -->

### When Saffron is used for therapeutic purposes such as a nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement, adulteration will make it completely useless or even

<!-- chunk -->

### harmful.1039

<!-- chunk -->

### Before you buy your Saffron supplement make sure you check that it’s a

<!-- chunk -->

### reputable supplement manufacturer who tests all their raw ingredients and

<!-- chunk -->

### encapsulated product.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is a classic case of discounted or cheap Saffron is not a bargain. But

<!-- chunk -->

### something else entirely. Buyer beware!


<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron 25 – 30 mg twice a day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Saffron as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Saffron on its own. So to get its benefits you


<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron is especially helpful for suffering from anxiety and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show Saffron to be as effective as some popular antidepressants

<!-- chunk -->

### but without the side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are currently using antidepressants, Saffron may help alleviate the

<!-- chunk -->

### sexual dysfunction caused by these drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron seems to be an effective way to control appetite. No snacking

<!-- chunk -->

### between meals and you’re no longer obsessed about food.

<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron has the added benefit of more energy and stamina to help you

<!-- chunk -->

### through your day.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely take up to 200 mg of Saffron daily if needed. But dosed

<!-- chunk -->

### mg at a time. Be familiar with the associated side effects of higher doses

<!-- chunk -->

### of Saffron.

<!-- chunk -->

### For nootropic use, choose a patented form of Saffron supplement such as

<!-- chunk -->

### the ones I’ve described above under “Type of Saffron to Buy”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Saffron is also a very effective vision supplement. Driving at night is

<!-- chunk -->

### easier on your eyes. And the flicker caused by screens and monitors won’t

<!-- chunk -->

### leave you with eye fatigue later in the day.

<!-- chunk -->

### For nootropic benefit look for genuine, verified pure Saffron or Saffron

<!-- chunk -->

### extract (standardized to 0.3 or 0.1% safranal).


# SAM-e

### dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine and melatonin in your brain. SAM-e

<!-- chunk -->

### maintains cell membranes and plays a role in a healthy immune system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show that SAM-e is very effective in treating depression without

<!-- chunk -->

### the side effects of prescription antidepressants. And while pharmaceutical

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants can take from 6 to 8 weeks to begin working, SAM-e can

<!-- chunk -->

### work much faster.

<!-- chunk -->

### The latest research shows that SAM-e can be anti-anxiety, reduces pain

<!-- chunk -->

### including in fibromyalgia, and can improve learning, memory and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e is made from methionine and ATP (adenosine triphosphate) during

<!-- chunk -->

### a cycle that recycles the amino acid homocysteine. This cycle requires


<!-- chunk -->

### and folate (B


<!-- chunk -->

### ) to work properly.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e is a precursor to the crucial antioxidant glutathione which is used

<!-- chunk -->

### in your brain and liver. When glutathione levels drop in your body, liver

<!-- chunk -->

### damage from oxidative stress begins within seconds of exposure to alcohol

<!-- chunk -->

### or toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e is a methyl donor that contributes to several essential processes in

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain. As a methyl donor, SAM-e is involved in the production and

<!-- chunk -->

### recycling of hormones, cytokines, and the neurotransmitters acetylcholine,

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### This methyl donor process is call ‘methylation’ and contributes to gene

<!-- chunk -->

### expression. Affecting how your cells work and communicate including

<!-- chunk -->

### your cell DNA.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e modifies important molecules in cell membranes that control

<!-- chunk -->

### communications within and between brain cells. SAM-e boosts the

<!-- chunk -->

### number of muscarinic receptors in certain parts of your brain which are

<!-- chunk -->

### critical to this cellular communications network.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e is used to treat depression, anxiety, osteoarthritis pain,

<!-- chunk -->

### fibromyalgia, and liver disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e is sold as an OTC supplement in the United States and Canada.

<!-- chunk -->

### And as a prescription drug in several European Union countries, and

<!-- chunk -->

### Russia. SAM-e is marketed under the brand names Adomet, Gumbaral,

<!-- chunk -->

### Samyr, Heptral, Agotan, Donamet, Isimet and Admethionine.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does SAM-e Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.SAM-e helps alleviate depression. SAME-e is one of the main

<!-- chunk -->

### building blocks your brain needs to produce the neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine and melatonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### By raising the levels of dopamine in your brain, SAM-e helps

<!-- chunk -->

### enhance memory, motivation and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center studied the

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant effect of oral SAM-e in a randomized, double-blind,

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo-controlled trial for 15 patients with major depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found that SAM-e is a safe, effective antidepressant with

<!-- chunk -->

### few side effects and a rapid onset of action. And may be useful for those

<!-- chunk -->

### who cannot tolerate prescription tricyclic antidepressants.1040

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.SAM-e directly influences neuronal signaling. SAM-e increases

<!-- chunk -->

### the number of muscarinic receptors in the hippocampus. We have

<!-- chunk -->

### two kinds of acetylcholine (ACh) receptors in our brain. 1) Nicotinic

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors and 2) Muscarinic receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most of the nootropics we investigate here in Head First influence

<!-- chunk -->

## nicotinic receptors and ACh. Muscarinic receptors have a very different

<!-- chunk -->

## mechanism of action. They are part of a large family of G-protein-coupled

<!-- chunk -->

## receptors (GPCRs) which are used as an intracellular secondary

<!-- chunk -->

### messenger system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain has a very complex system of control to regulate different

<!-- chunk -->

### processes going on in different cells at different times. For this to work,

<!-- chunk -->

### there must be a sophisticated means of communication between cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### GPCRs and their G proteins provide this intercellular communication. And

<!-- chunk -->

### form one of the most important signaling systems in your brain. They are

<!-- chunk -->

### involved in nearly every aspect of your physiology and behavior.

<!-- chunk -->

### G proteins work by binding neurotransmitters, hormones, growth factors,

<!-- chunk -->

### cytokines, odorants and photons at the cell surface to the GPCR, and

<!-- chunk -->

### activate that receptor. Everything you see, hear, smell, or taste goes

<!-- chunk -->

### through this signaling process.

<!-- chunk -->

### And SAM-e increases the number of these muscarinic receptors in parts of

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain, including your hippocampus. In one study, aged rats were

<!-- chunk -->

### given SAM-e for 30 days. Supplementation with SAM-e restored the

<!-- chunk -->

### number of muscarinic receptors to levels found in the same areas in young

<!-- chunk -->

### animals.1041

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with SAM-e to increase muscarinic receptors in your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### can boost neuroplasticity and increase learning, memory, mood and even

<!-- chunk -->

### smell and vision.


<!-- chunk -->

### You have healthy levels of SAM-e throughout your body when you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### young. But as you age, your body makes less of it. This is why young

<!-- chunk -->

### people bounce back from difficult experiences more easily. They’ve got

<!-- chunk -->

### higher levels of dopamine and a higher pain threshold than adults.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e is a major methyl donor in your body. It is involved in the

<!-- chunk -->

### biosynthesis of hormones, neurotransmitters, proteins and

<!-- chunk -->

### phospholipids.1042

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e participates in a sequence of events involving folic acid (folate)

<!-- chunk -->

### and Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### . Folate converts to 5-MTHF (5-methyltetrahydrofolate)

<!-- chunk -->

### which converts freely circulating homocysteine back into the amino acid

<!-- chunk -->

### Methionine (using Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### ). L-Methionine then binds to an Adenosine

<!-- chunk -->

### group from ATP to create SAM-e.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e is then able to donate methyl groups (called methylation) to a

<!-- chunk -->

### variety of reactions including the production and breakdown of the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine and melatonin in


<!-- chunk -->

### This methylation process degrades SAM-e into S-Adenosylhomocysteine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Which is then fed back into this cycle from the beginning. This process is

<!-- chunk -->

### referred to as a ‘one-carbon cycle’.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you don’t have enough folate or Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### available, this SAM-e

<!-- chunk -->

### methylation process breaks down. And the result can be depression, brain

<!-- chunk -->

### fog, poor recall and memory, and pain.

<!-- chunk -->

### This lack of folate and Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### can affect you regardless of age. This

<!-- chunk -->

### is a big enough problem that the Canadian government mandated folate

<!-- chunk -->

### fortification of all flour, and some corn and rice products to address this

<!-- chunk -->

### issue in 1998.1043

<!-- chunk -->

### Low levels of SAM-e, folic acid, Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### can lead to all kinds

<!-- chunk -->

### of problems. And genetic defects that don’t allow the use of these

<!-- chunk -->

### important vitamins can result in the same symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Cognition, memory, recall, and mood diminish

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Folic acid, Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### & B


<!-- chunk -->

### absorption declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Homocysteine levels rise

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Pain levels rise

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Mental health, language and fine motor skills decline

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes in brain energy metabolism are contributing factors to

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, ALS,

<!-- chunk -->

### epilepsy, and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### But even if you’re not concerned with genetic defects, a lack of B-

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamins, or the effects of aging, SAM-e can help.

<!-- chunk -->

## SAM-e benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Stress-related disorders like anxiety, major depression and PTSD are some

<!-- chunk -->

### of the most debilitating illnesses known to man. And if you’re reading

<!-- chunk -->

### this, and dealing with any of these, supplementing with SAM-e may help.

<!-- chunk -->

## To cope with stress requires changes in the expression of “immediate-

<!-- chunk -->

## early genes” in your hippocampus. The same area of your brain you use

<!-- chunk -->

### for learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Stressful events result in epigenetic (gene) modifications within

<!-- chunk -->

### ‘immediate-early genes’ in your hippocampus neurons. DNA methylation

<!-- chunk -->

### acts to suppress the expression of these genes.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is where SAM-e comes in…

<!-- chunk -->

## SAM-e is a methyl donor for the enzyme that methylates your DNA. When

<!-- chunk -->

## SAM-e levels are high enough, a stressful event will not result in DNA

<!-- chunk -->

### de-methylation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Instead, a stressful event enhances DNA methylation of ‘immediate-early

<!-- chunk -->

## genes’. Which suppress their expression and allows you to adapt in a

<!-- chunk -->

## healthy way to this stressful situation.1044

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e is a powerful antidepressant. In 2005, researchers combed through

<!-- chunk -->

### the databases of Medline, Psychinfo, AMED, and Cochrane Controlled

<!-- chunk -->

### Trials Register. And collated the findings of randomized, controlled trials

<!-- chunk -->

### studying SAM-e for depression through to September 2001.

<!-- chunk -->

## The team concluded after analyzing all the clinical evidence that SAM-e

<!-- chunk -->

## was effective in treating major depression in adults.1045

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e is also a potent pain-killer. A recent study looked at 56 people with

<!-- chunk -->

### arthritis in their knees. One group took the COX-2 inhibitor Celebrex

<!-- chunk -->

### while the other took SAM-e for 16 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

## Researchers found that SAM-e was as effective as Celebrex at eliminating

<!-- chunk -->

## pain. And without the potential side effects of heart attack or stroke that

<!-- chunk -->

### can be caused by using Celebrex.1046

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study on the effect of SAM-e with 17 fibromyalgia patients

<!-- chunk -->

### confirmed a close relationship between primary fibromyalgia and

<!-- chunk -->

### psychologic problems including depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e treatment improved the depressive state of these patients. And

<!-- chunk -->

## SAM-e was found to be an effective and safe therapy in the management

<!-- chunk -->

## of fibromyalgia.1047

<!-- chunk -->

## How does SAM-e feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### For some, supplementing with SAM-e can be life-changing.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e can have a profound effect on emotions, depression, and feelings

<!-- chunk -->

### of anxiety. You may experience improved concentration, energy, alertness,

<!-- chunk -->

### and feelings of well-being. Even vision can become clearer.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once you start supplementing with SAM-e, you should experience at the

<!-- chunk -->

### very least, a general sense of well-being.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e works particularly well for those who deal with depression or

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety. Neurohackers report that they no longer have panic attacks. And

<!-- chunk -->

### the feeling of doom is gone.

<!-- chunk -->

### Adding SAM-e to your nootropic stack can improve sociability, and not

<!-- chunk -->

### feeling overwhelmed by life. Brain fog lifts and thinking is clearer and

<!-- chunk -->

### faster.

<!-- chunk -->

### Others say that the “dark cloud has lifted”, and all the negativity and stress

<!-- chunk -->

### is gone. Things that normally would irritate are just brushed off, and you

<!-- chunk -->

### move on.

<!-- chunk -->

### One big word of caution: SAM-e needs Vitamins B


<!-- chunk -->

### & B


<!-- chunk -->

### and folate to

<!-- chunk -->

### work. Or SAM-e will elevate your homocysteine levels. High

<!-- chunk -->

### homocysteine can cause heart attacks.

<!-- chunk -->

### You’ll notice reference to B-Vitamins several times in this chapter on

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e. It is that important. Use Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### & B


<!-- chunk -->

### and folate every day

<!-- chunk -->

### that you supplement with SAM-e. Or use a B-Complex formula that

<!-- chunk -->

### contains folate (B


<!-- chunk -->

### ).


<!-- chunk -->

## SAM-e Lifts Mood

<!-- chunk -->

### We have made significant progress in the last 100 years in diagnosing and

<!-- chunk -->

### treating depression. And yet, 10’s of millions still suffer from depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 2014, an estimated 15.7 million adults in the United States had at least

<!-- chunk -->

### one major depressive episode in the previous year.1048

<!-- chunk -->

### In the United States, one in ten Americans are using antidepressants.1049 I

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t have statistics from other countries but I suspect many have similar

<!-- chunk -->

### problems. Unfortunately, antidepressants only work 30 – 50% of the time.

<!-- chunk -->

### And come with a host of side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### One reason that many people continue to suffer from depression is that

<!-- chunk -->

### most doctors are not aware of the link between homocysteine and


<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re dealing with depression and have had little success with

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants, you may have something as simple (and as serious) as a

<!-- chunk -->

### folate deficiency. Or low levels of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### . Studies show a link

<!-- chunk -->

### between folate deficiency and impaired metabolism of serotonin,

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine, and norepinephrine.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study looked at 46 patients with severe depression. 24 of these

<!-- chunk -->

### patients had raised levels of homocysteine. And significantly lower levels

<!-- chunk -->

### of folate, SAM-e, and other metabolites.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that looking at total homocysteine levels could

<!-- chunk -->

### be a measure of depression. Caused by folate deficiency, impaired

<!-- chunk -->

### methylation (SAM-e), and neurotransmitter metabolism (SAM-e). And a

<!-- chunk -->

### potential benefit to simply using vitamin replacement to treat severe

<!-- chunk -->

### depression.1050

<!-- chunk -->

### Or supplementing with SAM-e to treat depressive symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

## SAM-e to Treat Adult ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### Ritalin and Adderall are thought to be the most effective treatment in

<!-- chunk -->

### children and adults with ADHD. These stimulants work by potentiating

<!-- chunk -->

### both dopamine and norepinephrine at the synaptic cleft. But stimulant

<!-- chunk -->

### meds for ADHD come with side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e acts as a methyl donor and is involved in many metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### pathways. It has both adrenergic and dopamine receptor agonist activity.

<!-- chunk -->

### A research team at the University of California used SAM-e with subjects

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosed with Adult ADHD in a 9-week double-blind, placebo-controlled

<!-- chunk -->

### trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team found that 75% of the patients had a significant

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement in ADHD symptoms while using SAM-e. And the 25% who

<!-- chunk -->

### did not respond to SAM-e, did not respond to Ritalin either.1051

<!-- chunk -->

## SAM-e Treats Depression

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists at the US Department of Health and Human Services conducted

<!-- chunk -->

### an analysis of 102 individual studies in 25 databases on SAM-e and

<!-- chunk -->

### depression in 2002. The report distilled data gleaned from published

<!-- chunk -->

### studies conducted around the world up to 2002.

<!-- chunk -->

### This comprehensive report is called, ““S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine for

<!-- chunk -->

### Treatment of Depression, Osteoarthritis, and Liver Disease.” The

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers found that SAM-e is just as effective as standard

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant drugs at treating depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### The agency concluded, “Treatment with SAM-e was equivalent to standard

<!-- chunk -->

### therapy for depression”.1052


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dosage of SAM-e for nootropic benefit is 400 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e for depression: 400 – 1600 mg daily in divided doses

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e for bone and joint health: 200 – 1200 mg daily in divided doses

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e for liver problems: 1600 mg daily in divided doses

<!-- chunk -->

### Some research and many user reports suggest that once positive effects are

<!-- chunk -->

### achieved, SAM-e doses can be reduced. Some report benefit with as little

<!-- chunk -->

### as 100 mg of SAM-e daily.

<!-- chunk -->

## Studies show that SAM-e should be consumed with B-Vitamins. When

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e donates its methyl group, it breaks down into homocysteine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Elevated homocysteine levels are associated with increased heart disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### birth defects and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### In order to prevent homocysteine accumulating, sufficient levels of B-

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamins must be present to convert homocysteine into the potent

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant glutathione.

<!-- chunk -->

### Take SAM-e on an empty stomach and an hour before eating any food.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e is best digested in your intestines and not your stomach. Not

<!-- chunk -->

### letting SAM-e settle into your digestive tract could cause stomach upset.


<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e is produced naturally in your body. So is considered well-tolerated

<!-- chunk -->

### and safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have bipolar disorder, you could develop mania when

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with SAM-e. So check with your doctor before using SAM-

<!-- chunk -->

### e.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re on antidepressant medication, you should check with your doctor

<!-- chunk -->

### before supplementing with SAM-e.

<!-- chunk -->

### High doses of SAM-e can cause gas, upset stomach, diarrhea, constipation,

<!-- chunk -->

### dry mouth, headache, dizziness, anxiety or skin rashes. SAM-e may also

<!-- chunk -->

### trigger an allergic reaction in some people.


<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e is available in 200 and 400 mg tablets.

<!-- chunk -->

### For optimal effects with SAM-e, stable, enteric-coated tablets are

<!-- chunk -->

### recommended. SAM-e should be taken on an empty stomach, either one

<!-- chunk -->

### hour before or two hours after meals.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e is highly unstable so check expiration dates. And you should get

<!-- chunk -->

### tablets that are packed in sealed, gel-packs for freshness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid SAM-e in powder form as you’ll likely be unsatisfied with the

<!-- chunk -->

### results.


<!-- chunk -->

## SAM-e 400 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using SAM-e as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does make some SAM-e on its own. But SAM-e levels decrease

<!-- chunk -->

### as we age. And you cannot get SAM-e from food.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e is critical for the methylation process needed for making important

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters including acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin,

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine and melatonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e is also involved in the cycle which produces the critical

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant glutathione. And it’s involved in maintaining brain cell

<!-- chunk -->

### membrane integrity and fluidity.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e increases muscarinic receptors in your hippocampus which boosts

<!-- chunk -->

### the activity of acetylcholine and other critical neurotransmitters in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. Leading to improved learning, memory and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e is especially helpful if you’re dealing with depression. Or having

<!-- chunk -->

### difficulty coping with any kind of stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest a dose of 400 mg daily. It may take a while for SAM-e to build

<!-- chunk -->

### up in your system. So be patient. Once you’re achieving the affects you

<!-- chunk -->

### want from SAM-e, you can eventually try scaling back your dose to 100 or

<!-- chunk -->

### 200 mg.


# St. John’s wort

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort has been shown to relieve depression as well as some

<!-- chunk -->

### prescription antidepressants

<!-- chunk -->

## St. John’s wort (hypericum perforatum) is regarded as a wildflower, herb

<!-- chunk -->

### and weed. As a nootropic, St. John’s wort is considered a powerful

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant.

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort is native to Europe. But can be found growing wild

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout Asia, Africa, North and South America and Australia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Greek physicians Galen and Dioscorides prescribed St. John’s wort as a

<!-- chunk -->

### diuretic, for healing wounds and treating menstrual disorders. In the

<!-- chunk -->

### Middle Ages, it was used as a talisman for warding off evil spirits.

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort is best harvested on St. John’s Day (June 24) when the herb

<!-- chunk -->

### is in peak bloom. Legend has it that if you placed a sprig of the herb under

<!-- chunk -->

### your pillow on St. John’s Eve, St. John himself may appear in a dream, and

<!-- chunk -->

### bless you for another year. (Not sure if this applies when you put a bottle

<!-- chunk -->

### of St. John’s wort extract under your pillow, but worth a try).

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort first crossed the radar of modern herbalists and naturopaths

<!-- chunk -->

### in 1997. A study published in the British Medical Journal entitled, “St

<!-- chunk -->

### John’s wort for depression--an overview and meta-analysis of randomized

<!-- chunk -->

### clinical trials” pushed it to superstar herbal antidepressant status.

<!-- chunk -->

### This meta-analysis of 23 previously published studies on St. John’s wort

<!-- chunk -->

### was drawn from foreign medical journals. The analysis showed that

<!-- chunk -->

### overall, St. John’s wort was significantly superior to placebo. And was as

<!-- chunk -->

### effective as pharmaceutical antidepressants.1053

<!-- chunk -->

### The British Medical Journal published another study in 2005 showing that

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort was equally effective in treating depression and better

<!-- chunk -->

### tolerated than the widely prescribed antidepressant paroxetine (Paxil).1054

<!-- chunk -->

## The two major active constituents of St. John’s wort are hypericin (a

<!-- chunk -->

## naphthodianthrone) and hyperforin (a phloroglucinol). The plant contains

<!-- chunk -->

### a total of seven groups of medicinally active compounds.1055

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers have extensively documented St. John’s wort as having

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-cancer, and antibacterial

<!-- chunk -->

### effects.1056

<!-- chunk -->

## The most recent clinical studies show that hyperforin is the constituent in

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort that has the most antidepressant action.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’ve had limited success using St. John’s wort for depression and

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, your choice of supplement may be the problem. Go to “Dosage

<!-- chunk -->

### Notes” in this chapter to learn what extracts work best.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does St. John’s wort Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## St. John’s wort boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.St. John’s wort reduces depression. Hyperforin is the major

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressive constituent of St. John’s wort. Hyperforin inhibits the

<!-- chunk -->

### uptake of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain.1057

<!-- chunk -->

### By making more of each of these neurotransmitters available in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain, mood is elevated and depressive symptoms decline.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clinical trials also demonstrate that the level of antidepressant effect of St.

<!-- chunk -->

### John’s wort extract is entirely dependent on the concentration of

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperforin.1058

<!-- chunk -->

### A study in Berlin compared the efficacy of using St. John’s wort extract

<!-- chunk -->

### (WS 5570) to paroxetine (Paxil) in treating moderate to severe depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind study, 130 patients who

<!-- chunk -->

### received 900 mg or 1800 mg per day of St. John’s wort, or 40 mg of

<!-- chunk -->

### paroxetine were included.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study showed that St. John’s wort and paroxetine were equally

<!-- chunk -->

### effective in preventing relapse in continuation of treatment after recovery

<!-- chunk -->

### from moderate to severe depression. And that St. John’s wort was an

<!-- chunk -->

### important alternative treatment option for long-term prevention of

<!-- chunk -->

### depression.1059

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.St. John’s wort reduces stress. St. John’s wort is licensed in

<!-- chunk -->

### Germany to treat anxiety, depression and sleep disorders. But

<!-- chunk -->

### scientists and researchers are still working on what in this plant

<!-- chunk -->

### provides the anxiolytic effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### The anti-anxiety effects of St. John’s wort have been attributed to the

<!-- chunk -->

### binding affinity of at least 10 different extracts of the herb. Including

<!-- chunk -->

### naphthodianthrones like hypericin, flavonoids, xanthones, and

<!-- chunk -->

### bioflavonoids for adenosine triphosphate (ATP). GABA


<!-- chunk -->

### , GABA

B


<!-- chunk -->

### glutamine receptors, as well as the inhibition of monoamine Oxidase-A

<!-- chunk -->

### and -B activity. And synaptic uptake of serotonin, dopamine and

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine.1060

<!-- chunk -->

### All we know for sure at this point is that St. John’s wort works to help

<!-- chunk -->

### alleviate some forms of anxiety. One German study ran a multicenter,

<!-- chunk -->

### randomized, placebo controlled, 6-week trial comparing the efficacy of St.

<!-- chunk -->

### John’s wort extract LI 160 (600 mg/day), and placebo in 151 out-patients

<!-- chunk -->

### suffering from anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### The data from the trial shows that St. John’s wort extract (LI 160) has

<!-- chunk -->

### superior effectiveness in controlling anxiety symptoms. And tolerability of

<!-- chunk -->

### the extract was excellent.1061


<!-- chunk -->

### Depression can be experienced at any age. Imbalances in

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine can

<!-- chunk -->

### affect everything from cognition to mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Memory, recall, reaction time and mood diminish

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neuroreceptors decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neurotransmitters levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Anxiety, panic attacks, stress and insomnia rise

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neuroplasticity declines degrading long-term potentiation

<!-- chunk -->

### Under conditions of depression and chronic stress your brain loses the

<!-- chunk -->

### capacity to transmit signals between neurons efficiently. Memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition, and decision-making all suffer as a result.

<!-- chunk -->

## St. John’s wort benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort inhibits synaptic uptake in your brain of serotonin,

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine, and norepinephrine with approximately equal affinity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows that St. John’s wort also has an affinity for adenosine

<!-- chunk -->

### (ATP), GABA and glutamate receptors. And in the lab, scientists

<!-- chunk -->

### discovered it downregulates beta-adrenergic receptors and upregulates

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin receptors.1062

<!-- chunk -->

## Adrenergic receptors are a class of G protein receptors that are targets of

<!-- chunk -->

### the catecholamines like norepinephrine and epinephrine (adrenaline). This

<!-- chunk -->

### upregulation and downregulation of neurotransmitter concentrations are in

<!-- chunk -->

### areas of the brain implicated in depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### And finally, neuroendocrine studies show that St. John’s wort is involved

<!-- chunk -->

### in the regulation of genes that control HPA-axis function. Also

<!-- chunk -->

### contributing to the antidepressant action of this herb.1063

<!-- chunk -->

### Much of the therapeutic activity is attributable to St. John’s wort active

<!-- chunk -->

## phytochemical ingredients hypericin, hyperforin and several

<!-- chunk -->

## flavonoids.1064

<!-- chunk -->

### This novel mechanism of action is unlike any other single pharmaceutical

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant or nootropic. And underlies St. John’s wort’s profound

<!-- chunk -->

### effect on depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort also has strong antibacterial1065 and antiviral1066 properties.

<!-- chunk -->

### And St. John’s wort inhibits tumor cell growth.1067

<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows that St. John’s wort extracts decrease oxidative stress and

<!-- chunk -->

### prevent neurotoxicity, and inflammation. And may be an effective

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment for oxidative stress-related neurodegenerative disorders like

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.1068

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort shows promise as an anti-inflammatory.1069 Thousands of

<!-- chunk -->

### years of clinical use shows St. John’s wort works as a wound-healing

<!-- chunk -->

### agent.

<!-- chunk -->

### And St. John’s wort even helps reduce the effects of opium dependence by

<!-- chunk -->

### reducing withdrawal symptoms.1070 Handy if you’re coming off of opiates.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does St. John’s wort feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have had problems with using SSRI prescription antidepressants, St.

<!-- chunk -->

### John’s wort extract may be a good option for you.

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort does not produce the same side effects as pharmaceutical

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants. Sex drive is not affected. No withdrawal symptoms when

<!-- chunk -->

### you stop taking St. John’s wort.

<!-- chunk -->

### Users of St. John’s wort extract say it often works sooner than expected

<!-- chunk -->

### and gets better over time.

<!-- chunk -->

## St. John’s wort extract helps provide better focus, and fewer Obsessive-

<!-- chunk -->

## Compulsive Disorder (OCD) symptoms. Users report an end to

<!-- chunk -->

### procrastination, less irritation, and better mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort extract takes the edge off situations that would normally

<!-- chunk -->

### stress you. Feelings of anxiety are less or non-existent.

<!-- chunk -->

### Women going through menopause report feeling more emotionally stable

<!-- chunk -->

### when using St. John’s wort extract. Mood swings are no longer an issue.

<!-- chunk -->

## If you deal with PTSD you may find that St. John’s wort extract will put a

<!-- chunk -->

### stop to the rage. And long-term depression could be a distant memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are sure your depression is caused by a serotonin imbalance, you

<!-- chunk -->

### should feel the mood-lifting effects of St. John’s wort.

<!-- chunk -->

### But neuroscience is a complicated subject. And everyone’s body and

<!-- chunk -->

### wiring are different. St. John’s wort does not work for all types of

<!-- chunk -->

### depression or anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### If your depression is caused by a hormone imbalance, a depleted

<!-- chunk -->

### microbiome, an issue with dopamine levels or other neuroreceptor issue,

<!-- chunk -->

### you may not experience the benefit of St. John’s wort.

<!-- chunk -->

## And please, please do not combine St. John’s wort with prescription

<!-- chunk -->

## antidepressants! Serotonin Syndrome is real and could kill you. Literally.


<!-- chunk -->

## The Politics of Treatment for Depression

<!-- chunk -->

### Most clinical studies using St. John’s wort for depression have been

<!-- chunk -->

### conducted in Europe. And were targeted in cases of mild to moderate


<!-- chunk -->

### And then came a study done at Vanderbilt University in the US in

<!-- chunk -->

### which made headline news and created a ton of controversy. This study

<!-- chunk -->

### discredited the herb’s use in treating patients with major depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### I’m including this study to draw your attention to why we cannot always

<!-- chunk -->

### rely on “clinical studies” to study a nootropic’s efficacy in brain

<!-- chunk -->

### optimization. And why the nootropics community often resorts to personal

<!-- chunk -->

### experience, and the reviews of other neurohackers.

<!-- chunk -->

### This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial worked with 200 adult

<!-- chunk -->

### outpatients (mean age 42.4 years) who were diagnosed with major

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 900 mg per day of

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort extract or a placebo for 4 weeks. And if they did not

<!-- chunk -->

### respond, the dose was raised to 1,200 mg per day (or a placebo) for

<!-- chunk -->

### another 8 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that there was no significant change in patient

<!-- chunk -->

### depression scores. And that St. John’s wort was no better than placebo for

<!-- chunk -->

### treating major depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Their conclusion was, “St. John’s wort was not effective for treatment of

<!-- chunk -->

### major depression”.1071

<!-- chunk -->

### I bring this study up for one reason: the study was funded by Pfizer, the

<!-- chunk -->

### pharmaceutical manufacture of Zoloft. The leading synthetic

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant medication.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 2015, the FDA in the US pushed Pfizer Inc. to modify the safety

<!-- chunk -->

### warning for Zoloft. Linking Zoloft to causing heart defects in newborns.

<!-- chunk -->

### This in response to hundreds of lawsuits by women who say they weren’t

<!-- chunk -->

### adequately warned that Zoloft could cause defects in their newborns.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zoloft sales for Pfizer made the company $3.3 billion in 2005.1072

<!-- chunk -->

### It seems to me that having a major pharmaceutical company funding the

<!-- chunk -->

### study of an herb that is in direct competition to one of their main profit-

<!-- chunk -->

### centers is a direct conflict of interest. And there was no way Pfizer was

<!-- chunk -->

### going to have a clinical trial show that St. John’s wort was as good as, or

<!-- chunk -->

### better than Zoloft.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s also interesting that sales of St. John’s wort annual USA sales reached

<!-- chunk -->

### a peak of $315 million in 1998. But had declined to about $60 million by

<!-- chunk -->

### 2006.1073 Bad press strongly affected the sales of this natural

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant. And yet the sales of pharmaceutical antidepressants

<!-- chunk -->

### continue to rise.

<!-- chunk -->

## St. John’s wort as a Treatment for Mild-to-Moderate Depression

<!-- chunk -->

### A study at St. John’s Episcopal Hospital in New York compared St. John’s

<!-- chunk -->

### wort to the SSRI sertraline (Zoloft) in the treatment of depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this double-blind, randomized study, 30 outpatients (mean age 45.5

<!-- chunk -->

### years) with mild to moderate depression received 600 mg per day of

<!-- chunk -->

### standardized St. John’s wort extract or 50 mg per day of sertraline for

<!-- chunk -->

### week.

<!-- chunk -->

### This was followed by 900 mg per day of St. John’s wort extract or 75 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### per day of sertraline for another 6 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The severity of depression symptoms was significantly reduced in both

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment groups. Clinical response was noted in 47% of patients receiving

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort. And 40% in patients receiving sertraline.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that St. John’s wort extract was at least as

<!-- chunk -->

### effective as sertraline in the treatment of mild to moderate depression.1074

<!-- chunk -->

## St. John’s wort for Major Depression

<!-- chunk -->

### I include this study done in 2008 for using St. John’s wort as treatment for

<!-- chunk -->

### major depression as a response to the questionable study sponsored by

<!-- chunk -->

### Pfizer in 2001.

<!-- chunk -->

### This study done in Munich, Germany investigated whether extracts of St.

<!-- chunk -->

### John’s wort are more effective than placebo in treating major depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### And as effective with fewer side effects than standard antidepressant

<!-- chunk -->

### drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### This study was a review of 29 trials including a total of 5,489 patients. It

<!-- chunk -->

### included 18 comparisons with placebo and 17 comparisons with synthetic

<!-- chunk -->

### “standard antidepressants”. The standard antidepressants included tricyclic

<!-- chunk -->

### and SSRI antidepressants.

<!-- chunk -->

### The author’s conclusions reported that the available evidence suggests that

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort extracts were superior to placebo in patients with major

<!-- chunk -->

## depression. St. John’s wort extracts were similarly effective as standard

<!-- chunk -->

## antidepressants. And St. John’s wort extracts had fewer side effects than

<!-- chunk -->

### standard antidepressants.1075

<!-- chunk -->

## St. John’s wort helps Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

<!-- chunk -->

### A study done at the Dean Foundation for Health Research and Education

<!-- chunk -->

### analyzed 12 patients who had been diagnosed with OCD. Patients received

<!-- chunk -->

### 450 mg of St. John’s wort twice daily for 12 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study included weekly evaluations using three different Obsessive-

<!-- chunk -->

### Compulsive scales. And a monthly evaluation with the Hamilton Rating

<!-- chunk -->

### Scale for Depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Changes in obsessive compulsive behavior occurred within one week of

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with St. John’s wort. And changes continued to improve

<!-- chunk -->

### over the course of the 12-week trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### 5 of the 12 patients were rated “much” or “very much” improved,

<!-- chunk -->

### patients were rated “minimally” improved, and 1 person had no change in

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

## The researchers concluded that St. John’s wort could be an effective

<!-- chunk -->

## treatment for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).1076


<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort is available from local health food and vitamin stores and

<!-- chunk -->

### online. St. John’s wort comes in capsule, tablet, and powder form. It’s also

<!-- chunk -->

### available as tinctures, teas and oil-based lotions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most St. John’s wort supplements are standardized to contain 3%

<!-- chunk -->

## hypericin. But the most recent clinical studies show that hyperforin is the

<!-- chunk -->

### constituent in St. John’s wort that has the most antidepressant action.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers say that the benefits of St. John’s wort are only applicable to

<!-- chunk -->

### standardized extracts such as LI 160, WS 5570/2, and ZE 117.1077

<!-- chunk -->

### Check the labels and look for:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Perika® which is WS 5570 extract

<!-- chunk -->

### •Kira® which is LI 160 extract

<!-- chunk -->

### •New Chapter SC27 who produce their own extract

<!-- chunk -->

### There are reports and some clinical data which suggest that the

<!-- chunk -->

### photosensitivity caused by hypericin can cause cataracts and blindness. All

<!-- chunk -->

### the more reason to play it safe and go with a high quality St. John’s wort

<!-- chunk -->

### extract containing hyperforin.1078

<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended doses for St. John’s wort extract:

<!-- chunk -->

### •St. John’s wort for anxiety: 900 mg twice daily

<!-- chunk -->

### •St. John’s wort for mild to moderate depression: 300 mg 3-times

<!-- chunk -->

### daily

<!-- chunk -->

### •St. John’s wort for severe depression: 900 – 1800 mg daily

<!-- chunk -->

### •St. John’s wort for OCD: 450 – 1800 mg daily for 12 weeks

<!-- chunk -->

### •St. John’s wort for PMS: 300 – 900 mg daily for 2 menstrual cycles

<!-- chunk -->

### •St. John’s wort for irritable bowel syndrome: 450 mg twice daily for

<!-- chunk -->

### 12 weeks

<!-- chunk -->

### •St. John’s wort for nerve pain: three 900 mcg hypericin tablets for

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment periods of 5 weeks each


<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects with St. John’s wort are generally mild and can include

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach upset, hives, skin rashes, fatigue, restlessness, headache, dry

<!-- chunk -->

### mouth, dizziness, and confusion.

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort can interfere with getting pregnant, or make infertility

<!-- chunk -->

### worse. It can make ADHD symptoms worse. Particularly if you’re taking

<!-- chunk -->

### Ritalin.

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort may increase the risk of psychosis in those with

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia and may contribute to dementia in those with Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort can interact with medications used during surgery. So if

<!-- chunk -->

### you’re anticipating surgery avoid St. John’s wort.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do not take St. John’s wort if you have bipolar disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some St. John’s wort extracts can make your skin and eyes overly

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitive to sunlight. You should avoid sunlamps, tanning booths and

<!-- chunk -->

### tanning beds while using a St. John’s wort product containing hypericin.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is some clinical data showing that St. John’s wort products that

<!-- chunk -->

### contain hypericin may cause blindness.1079

<!-- chunk -->

## St. John’s wort and Serotonin Syndrome

<!-- chunk -->

## Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is a liver enzyme whose job is to

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidize small, foreign organic molecules and toxins so they can be

<!-- chunk -->

### removed from your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some substances, including St. John’s wort and grapefruit juice, affect the

<!-- chunk -->

### enzyme CYP3A4. And can amplify or weaken the action of those drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### and nootropics.1080

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort interacts with tricyclic, SSRI and MAOI antidepressants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taking St. John’s wort with these medications increases their action and

<!-- chunk -->

## could lead to serotonin syndrome which can be deadly.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do not take St. John’s wort with antidepressants including:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Tricyclic: Amitriptyline (Elavil), nortriptyline (Pamelor),

<!-- chunk -->

### imipramine (Tofranil)

<!-- chunk -->

## •SSRI: Citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluvoxamine

<!-- chunk -->

### (Luvox), paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft)

<!-- chunk -->

## •MAOI’s (Phenelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate)

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort can reduce levels of antihistamines in your body. It can

<!-- chunk -->

### increase the risk of bleeding when combined with Plavix and birth control

<!-- chunk -->

### pills. Do not use St. John’s wort with Warfarin as it can reduce its

<!-- chunk -->

### effectiveness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Drugs that suppress the immune system can lose their effectiveness with

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort. It should not be used with drugs that treat HIV and AIDS.

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort can increase the sedative effect of barbiturates,

<!-- chunk -->

### benzodiazepines (Valium), and triptans that treat migraines.

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort also interacts with antifungal drugs, statins, calcium

<!-- chunk -->

### channel blockers, and any other medication that is broken down by the

<!-- chunk -->

### liver. Which covers a lot of drugs and nootropics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin Syndrome is not to be messed with. An overload of serotonin in

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain can make you very sick. And can ultimately kill you. I’m not

<!-- chunk -->

### kidding here.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you suspect anything could cause problems if it’s increased or decreased

<!-- chunk -->

### in your system, do not use St. John’s wort. If your goal is to treat

<!-- chunk -->

### depression and mood issues, you have many other safer options available

<!-- chunk -->

### to you.


<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’ wort is available in tablet, capsule, and powder form. Most are

<!-- chunk -->

### standardized to contain 0.3% hypericin. But the most recent clinical

<!-- chunk -->

## studies show that hyperforin is the constituent in St. John’s wort that has

<!-- chunk -->

## St. John’s wort extract up to 900 - 1,800 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using St. John’s wort extract as a nootropic supplement. But

<!-- chunk -->

### with the strongest warning I’ve issued for any nootropic mentioned in this

<!-- chunk -->

### book.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do not combine St. John’s wort with prescription antidepressants because

<!-- chunk -->

### the combination puts you in serious danger of Serotonin Syndrome.

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s wort may also nullify or amplify the effects of other drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### including nootropics in your stack. This is caused by the suppression or

<!-- chunk -->

### induction of certain enzymes in your liver.

<!-- chunk -->

### Check the “Side Effects” portion of this chapter. And do your research

<!-- chunk -->

# Sulbutiamine

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine has been shown to boost motivation, improve focus, enhance

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and alleviate depression

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulbutiamine (isobutyryl thiamine disulfide) is a synthetic derivative of


<!-- chunk -->

## (thiamine). Thiamine was the first B Vitamin to be discovered

<!-- chunk -->

## by researchers. That’s why it’s called B


<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine is simply two vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### molecules joined together. This

<!-- chunk -->

### chemical bond helps thiamine more easily cross the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Japanese scientists first synthesized Sulbutiamine in an attempt to quell a

<!-- chunk -->

### health crisis within the Japanese population. After WWII, the Japanese

<!-- chunk -->

### diet largely consisted of rice. This left them deficient in several key

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrients including thiamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Insufficient thiamine led to a central nervous system disorder called

<!-- chunk -->

### Beriberi. But supplementing with thiamine alone didn’t help. Because of

<!-- chunk -->

### its poor bioavailability. And a lot of thiamine was needed to cure Beriberi

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine is far more bioavailable than standard thiamine. It is fat-

<!-- chunk -->

### soluble (thiamine is water-soluble) which helps it more easily cross the

<!-- chunk -->

### blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### The discovery of Sulbutiamine cured the Japanese population of a life-

<!-- chunk -->

### threatening disease. And it has since been tested and used throughout the

<!-- chunk -->

### world with much success.

<!-- chunk -->

## Throughout this chapter I’ll refer to Sulbutiamine interchangeably with

<!-- chunk -->

## thiamine. Sulbutiamine is the stronger of the two, so it’s affects are

<!-- chunk -->

### amplified compared to standard thiamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thiamine is a coenzyme used by your body to metabolize food for energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### And to maintain proper heart, nerve, and brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thiamine also helps digest and extract energy from food. It turns nutrients

<!-- chunk -->

## into adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the fuel used by your cell’s

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### And thiamine helps convert carbohydrates into glucose. The energy your

<!-- chunk -->

### body uses for your brain and nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

### One more thing about this miracle B-vitamin. Thiamine contributes to the

<!-- chunk -->

### development of myelin sheaths which wrap around the axons of neurons to

<!-- chunk -->

### protect them from damage and boost brain cell signaling.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not produce thiamine on its own. So you must get it from

<!-- chunk -->

### food including beef, brewer’s yeast, legumes (beans, lentils), milk, nuts,

<!-- chunk -->

### oats, oranges, pork, rice, seeds, wheat, whole-grain cereals, and yeast.

<!-- chunk -->

### But thiamine has poor bioavailability. By synthesizing thiamine and

<!-- chunk -->

### producing Sulbutiamine you end up with a fat-soluble compound that is

<!-- chunk -->

### easily digested. And readily crosses the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulbutiamine vs. Thiamine: What’s the Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine is a synthetic version of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (Thiamine). It is two B


<!-- chunk -->

### molecules chemically bonded together.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thiamine is water-soluble and does not easily cross the blood-brain

<!-- chunk -->

### barrier. Sulbutiamine is a fat-soluble compound that easily crosses the

<!-- chunk -->

### blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine functions in the body just like thiamine. But because it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### more bioavailable, it’s more effective than thiamine.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Sulbutiamine Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

### 1.Sulbutiamine is a fat-soluble molecule that crosses the blood-brain

<!-- chunk -->

### barrier more readily than thiamine. Once in your brain, it increases

<!-- chunk -->

## levels of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP).

<!-- chunk -->

## Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) is directly involved in the citric acid cycle

<!-- chunk -->

### (KREBS) in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### This cycle breaks fatty acids, amino acids and monosaccharides into

<!-- chunk -->

## smaller molecules that produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) energy for

<!-- chunk -->

### your mitochondria. And provide the building blocks of the molecules

<!-- chunk -->

### needed to produce brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### A deficiency of TPP can eventually show up as Wernicke encephalopathy

<!-- chunk -->

### and Korsakoff syndrome. In our society this syndrome is typically caused

<!-- chunk -->

### by chronic alcoholism. But it can also occur after obesity (bariatric)

<!-- chunk -->

### surgery, Crohn’s disease, anorexia and if you’re on kidney dialysis.

<!-- chunk -->

## Symptoms of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome include confusion, inability

<!-- chunk -->

### to form memories, loss of memories and muscle coordination,

<!-- chunk -->

### confabulation (making up stories) and vision changes. And can ultimately

<!-- chunk -->

### (and very rapidly) lead to coma and death.1082

<!-- chunk -->

### Less severe cases of thiamine deficiency include fatigue, weight loss,

<!-- chunk -->

### irritability and confusion.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Sulbutiamine also contributes to the production of the enzyme PDH

<!-- chunk -->

### which is essential in making the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. And

<!-- chunk -->

### for the synthesis of myelin, which forms a sheath around the axons

<!-- chunk -->

### of neurons. Ensuring these neurons can conduct signals.1083

<!-- chunk -->

### The citric acid cycle and enzyme α–KGDH play a role in maintaining

<!-- chunk -->

### optimal levels of the neurotransmitters glutamate, and gamma–

<!-- chunk -->

### aminobutyric acid (GABA).

<!-- chunk -->

### When thiamine levels decrease, the activity of these enzymes are

<!-- chunk -->

### reduced.1084


<!-- chunk -->

### We depend on our diet for thiamine. Very little thiamine is stored in your

<!-- chunk -->

### body. And depletion can occur within 14 days.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thiamine deficiency can be caused by alcoholism, Alzheimer’s Disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### anemia, athletes who reduce food intake, cancer, clogged arteries, Crohn’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease, diabetes, diarrhea and kidney disease. And even a poor diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Low thiamine levels can slow creation of ATP

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Low thiamine levels can cause problems with memory, learning, recall

<!-- chunk -->

### and perception


<!-- chunk -->

### So Sulbutiamine can help age-related cognitive decline, as well as a

<!-- chunk -->

### student looking to do better in school. By boosting acetylcholine,

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine and GABA in the brain. And increased brain energy by fueling

<!-- chunk -->

### cell mitochondria with ATP. And building myelin sheaths that protect our


<!-- chunk -->

## Sulbutiamine benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine is directly involved in the citric acid cycle that creates

<!-- chunk -->

### adenosine triphosphate (ATP) energy within your mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine also plays a role in maintaining optimal levels of the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters glutamate, and gamma–aminobutyric acid (GABA). And

<!-- chunk -->

### contributes to the production of the enzyme PDH which is essential in

<!-- chunk -->

### making the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine will boost cognition, memory and decision-making. And has

<!-- chunk -->

### very effective anxiolytic (anti-depressant) qualities.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Sulbutiamine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine is a fat-soluble form of thiamine which crosses the blood-

<!-- chunk -->

### brain barrier. It has been shown to improve glutamatergic, cholinergic, and

<!-- chunk -->

### dopaminergic neurological transmissions. It may also increase the density

<!-- chunk -->

### of D1 dopamine receptors.1085

<!-- chunk -->

### Nootropics users report:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Sulbutiamine as a study aid. On its own, Sulbutiamine seems to

<!-- chunk -->

### increase attention span for many neurohackers. And when combined

<!-- chunk -->

### with caffeine or any one of the racetams, many report being able to

<!-- chunk -->

### work effortlessly for hours on end. Study and work seems less

<!-- chunk -->

### stressful.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Boost motivation. Sulbutiamine boosts motivation and many report

<!-- chunk -->

### gives them the drive they need for study or work.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Increased focus. Sulbutiamine helps provide laser-like focus at

<!-- chunk -->

### work and school. Some report even with the most tedious of tasks.

<!-- chunk -->

### While staying in a very good mood.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Sociability. Many users report being able to articulate thoughts, and

<!-- chunk -->

### improved speaking ability. Language and your vocabulary seem to

<!-- chunk -->

### flow effortlessly. Thoughts and ideas come with less effort.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Improved mood. Personally, I’ve found Sulbutiamine to be more

<!-- chunk -->

### effective than any prescription anti-depressant I’ve ever tried. And

<!-- chunk -->

### without the side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should be able to experience the effects of Sulbutiamine soon after

<!-- chunk -->

### you take it.


<!-- chunk -->

## Sulbutiamine Improves Mood

<!-- chunk -->

### A study at the University of Wales Swansea in the UK worked with

<!-- chunk -->

### young adult females. Study participants took either a placebo or 50 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### thiamine for 2 months. Mood, memory and reaction times were monitored

<!-- chunk -->

### before and after taking the tablets.

<!-- chunk -->

### The results indicate that after 2 months of thiamine supplementation, the

<!-- chunk -->

### young females:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Were more clearheaded

<!-- chunk -->

### •Felt more composed and energetic

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reaction times improved

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improved mood.1086

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulbutiamine for Chronic Fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

### If you deal with chronic fatigue, Sulbutiamine may be a better option than

<!-- chunk -->

### another cup of coffee. Or a stimulant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at the Hospital Saint-Antoine in Paris studied 326 patients.

<!-- chunk -->

### All suffering from chronic fatigue. Patients were given 400 mg or 600 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### of Sulbutiamine daily. Or a placebo in this double-blind, parallel-group

<!-- chunk -->

### study.

<!-- chunk -->

### Patients were tested on the 7th and 28th days of the trial. Those that used

<!-- chunk -->

### 600 mg of Sulbutiamine had less fatigue.1087

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulbutiamine Improves Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Poor memory is associated with low levels of choline activity in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline is a precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). ACh

<!-- chunk -->

### transmission between neurons helps in memory formation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists decided to find out if Sulbutiamine could help boost choline

<!-- chunk -->

### uptake. They gave a group of mice Sulbutiamine for 10 days, and then

<!-- chunk -->

### tested their memory. The findings suggested Sulbutiamine improved

<!-- chunk -->

### memory formation. And it was due to an increase in choline activity in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain.1088

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study in France involved giving Sulbutiamine or a saline solution

<!-- chunk -->

### to rats for 9 weeks. The results of this study concluded Sulbutiamine

<!-- chunk -->

### provided better working and episodic memory.1089

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulbutiamine Improves Athletic Performance

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers use Sulbutiamine for a boost in physical energy. And

<!-- chunk -->

### it’s created some controversy in professional sports.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Moscow Anti-Doping Center analyzed 16,000 blood samples in a

<!-- chunk -->

### Russian lab in 2009. They were looking for anabolic steroids in athletes.

<!-- chunk -->

### They found that 100 samples contained Sulbutiamine. These samples were

<!-- chunk -->

### collected in-competition. Indicating that Sulbutiamine was intentionally

<!-- chunk -->

### administered for its “ergogenic and mild stimulating properties”.1090

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulbutiamine Improves Erectile Dysfunction

<!-- chunk -->

### One small study was conducted with 20 patients suffering from

<!-- chunk -->

### psychogenic erectile dysfunction. This type of ED is defined as the

<!-- chunk -->

### inability to achieve or maintain an erection because of psychologic

<!-- chunk -->

### factors.

<!-- chunk -->

### The men were given a prescription form of Sulbutiamine ‘Enerion’ for 30-

<!-- chunk -->

### days. 16 of the men showed significant improvement based on the

<!-- chunk -->

### international index of erectile function (IIEF).

<!-- chunk -->

### 3 of 6 men with arterial disorders in their penis showed that Sulbutiamine

<!-- chunk -->

### corrected the problem. The study concluded that erectile dysfunction can

<!-- chunk -->

### be effectively treated with Sulbutiamine.1091


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended Sulbutiamine dosage is 400 mg to 1,000 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Higher doses should be split with one dose in the morning, and the other

<!-- chunk -->

### early afternoon.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some neurohackers warn about dosing Sulbutiamine too late in the day.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s mild ‘stimulant’ qualities could interfere with sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re just starting out with Sulbutiamine, I suggest starting with a low

<!-- chunk -->

### dose and see how your body reacts.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tolerance can be a problem with Sulbutiamine. So when taking it for

<!-- chunk -->

### extended periods, you may find it beneficial to cycle on and off the

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement. For example, take Sulbutiamine for 5 days, and take 2 days

<!-- chunk -->

### off before your next dose.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine powder tastes nasty. So you’d be advised to take it in capsule

<!-- chunk -->

### form. You can save on the cost of Sulbutiamine by making your own

<!-- chunk -->

### capsules.

<!-- chunk -->

### And Sulbutiamine is fat-soluble so take it with a tablespoon of unrefined

<!-- chunk -->

### coconut, or extra virgin olive oil for better absorption.


<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine non-toxic. So is considered well-tolerated and safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects are rare but can include skin rashes and eczema-like outbreaks

<!-- chunk -->

### and higher doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine can also create mood swings. Particularly if you’re bipolar

<!-- chunk -->

### or are taking bipolar medication.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you take Sulbutiamine late in the day you may find it interferes with

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep. Some find it has mild stimulant effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are some reports that Sulbutiamine can be addictive. If you have

<!-- chunk -->

### addiction-like tendencies, you may want to be cautious about using this

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement. It does affect dopamine levels in the brain.


<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine is sold in tablet, capsule, and powder form. Tablets and


<!-- chunk -->

### It’s sold as a prescription medication in some countries under the brand

<!-- chunk -->

### names Arcalion, Enerion, Bisibuthiamine, and Youvitan.


<!-- chunk -->

## Sulbutiamine 1,500 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Sulbutiamine as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does not make Sulbutiamine on its own. So to get its benefits


<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine is especially helpful for those suffering from depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Experience shows it helps stop and reverse the symptoms associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. Likely because this nootropic helps boost the activity of

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine, serotonin, GABA and glutamate in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Personally, I’ve found Sulbutiamine to be more effective (and safer) than

<!-- chunk -->

### any prescription anti-depressant I’ve ever tried.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine is also particularly helpful to students and executives who

<!-- chunk -->

### want to boost cognition, learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine can produce a noticeable increase in mental clarity. And give

<!-- chunk -->

### you a significant energy boost physically and mentally. You’ll feel more

<!-- chunk -->

### awake and alert. Without the side effects you’d get from stimulants like

<!-- chunk -->

### caffeine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine also stacks very well with racetams like Piracetam and

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam.


# Sulforaphane

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane is known for helping with autism, recovery from Traumatic

<!-- chunk -->

### Brain Injury (TBI), preventing the progression of Alzheimer’s and

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s, and is anti-cancer

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulforaphane (1-isothiocyanato-4-methylsulfinylbutane, SFN) is a

<!-- chunk -->

### potent phytochemical. Phyto is the Greek word for plant. In other words,

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane is a phytochemical made by plants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane is found in cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, kale,

<!-- chunk -->

### cauliflower, and radishes in the form of glucoraphanin and myrosinase.

<!-- chunk -->

### But it’s most plentiful in broccoli.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane is synthesized in your gut through a hydrolysis reaction that

<!-- chunk -->

### involves the enzyme myrosinase and glucoraphanin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane is needed to ensure your body gets enough sulfur. A mineral

<!-- chunk -->

### critical for the synthesis of cysteine and methionine which are needed to

<!-- chunk -->

### produce your master antioxidant glutathione.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane is one of the most frequently studied plant-derived

<!-- chunk -->

### isothiocyanate organosulfur compounds. And has been reported to provide

<!-- chunk -->

### a wide range of effects. It is antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial,

<!-- chunk -->

### anticancer, anti-aging, neuroprotective, and antidiabetic.1092

<!-- chunk -->

### A major area of research on sulforaphane is its effect on autism. Studies

<!-- chunk -->

### have shown that sulforaphane improves behavior in young people with

<!-- chunk -->

### autism.1093

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane can help reduce cognitive impairment associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease. It helps prevent potential damage that can be caused

<!-- chunk -->

### by the β-Amyloid aggregation associated with Alzheimer’s and

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s.1094

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane easily crosses the blood-brain barrier. And is a powerful

<!-- chunk -->

### defense against oxidative stress and neuronal damage caused by traumatic

<!-- chunk -->

### brain injury (TBI).1095

<!-- chunk -->

## Studies show that if Sulforaphane is taken within one hour of traumatic

<!-- chunk -->

## brain injury it will improve spatial learning and memory and reduce

<!-- chunk -->

### working memory dysfunction.1096

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have also found that sulforaphane may protect against changes in

<!-- chunk -->

### gene expression that if left unchecked could lead to prostate cancer

<!-- chunk -->

### progression.1097

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Sulforaphane Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulforaphane boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Sulforaphane reduces oxidative stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with the accumulation of

<!-- chunk -->

### Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) within cells, which, when not properly

<!-- chunk -->

### scavenged, may lead to oxidative stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your immune system is designed to produce enzymes that scavenge ROS

<!-- chunk -->

### which prevents oxidative stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Immune system dysfunction has been observed in autism spectrum

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder (ASD). And high levels of ROS which causes oxidative stress are

<!-- chunk -->

### present in those with autism.1098

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane boosts your body’s antioxidant defense mechanism, which

<!-- chunk -->

### protects against oxidative stress and maintains normal and healthy cellular


<!-- chunk -->

### Those with ASD who boost their intake of sulforaphane show

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement in social communication, unusual behavior, and self-

<!-- chunk -->

### regulation behavior.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Sulforaphane is anti-aging.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurological disorders are the leading cause of death and disability

<!-- chunk -->

### worldwide. And most of these disorders share mutual causes such as

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, protein

<!-- chunk -->

### misfolding, ecotoxicity, and neuronal damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### All these disorders are common targets of the nuclear factor erythroid

<!-- chunk -->

### related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling cascade.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nrf2 is the main regulator of redox balance and cellular detox responses

<!-- chunk -->

### and stimulates your cellular defense mechanism.1099

<!-- chunk -->

### And Nrf2 blocks oxidative stress and production of reactive oxygen species

<!-- chunk -->

### (ROS).

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane protects against these neurological disorders by regulating

<!-- chunk -->

### the Nrf2 pathway.1100

<!-- chunk -->

### So, using Sulforaphane as nootropic supplement, you get the anti-aging

<!-- chunk -->

### protection against oxidative stress, which if left unchecked can lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, and other neurodegenerative

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases.1101


<!-- chunk -->

### Sulfur is the 3rd most abundant mineral in your body. You need sulfur to

<!-- chunk -->

### build and repair your DNA. And for healthy skin, ligaments, and tendons.

<!-- chunk -->

### And sulfur protects your cells from oxidative stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane from your diet or as a nootropic supplement provides the

<!-- chunk -->

### sulfur you need to maintain healthy cognitive function. Providing ongoing

<!-- chunk -->

### protection against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you do not consume sulforaphane, it can be difficult to get enough

<!-- chunk -->

### sulfur.

<!-- chunk -->

### Putting yourself at risk for:

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Low levels of antioxidants which lead to free radical damage

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Poor signaling of antioxidant defense systems

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Decreased cognitive function

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Increase risk for neurodegenerative disease

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Increased oxidative stress

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Increased inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ DNA damage

<!-- chunk -->

## Supplementing with Sulforaphane can help maintain healthy brain

<!-- chunk -->

### function throughout your life.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulforaphane benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Turns out that when your mother told you to eat your broccoli because it is

<!-- chunk -->

### good for you, she was right!

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane can protect your brain from oxidative stress that if left

<!-- chunk -->

### unchecked can lead to Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane acts as an antioxidant which help scavenge free radicals and

<!-- chunk -->

### support a healthy immune system. And has the potential to improve some

<!-- chunk -->

### domains of cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane is used by men worldwide to protect against and even

<!-- chunk -->

### reverse prostate cancer. And its anti-cancer functions are now recognized

<!-- chunk -->

### as effective for possibly preventing other types of cancer as well.1102

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane has been shown to provide protection against ultraviolet

<!-- chunk -->

### (UV)-induced skin damage making it an anti-aging compound. And has

<!-- chunk -->

### potential for use in anti-aging drugs and cosmetics.1103

<!-- chunk -->

### And studies have demonstrated the use of Sulforaphane for providing

<!-- chunk -->

### protection from Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). And is a potential candidate

<!-- chunk -->

### for therapy for Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury.1104

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Sulforaphane feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report feeling energized when they take Sulforaphane.

<!-- chunk -->

### People who have been diagnosed as pre-diabetic say it helps them feel less

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigued, more energetic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Others say using Sulforaphane as a nootropic helps their mental health.

<!-- chunk -->

### They feel an improvement in their overall feeling of wellbeing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many people say that Sulforaphane boosts cognitive function. They say it

<!-- chunk -->

### helps them think more clearly.

<!-- chunk -->

### Parents of autistic children report that Sulforaphane helps their children

<!-- chunk -->

### stay calm and focused. They report improved behavior.

<!-- chunk -->

### People with rheumatoid arthritis report that their symptoms are reduced

<!-- chunk -->

### when they consistently use Sulforaphane as a nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane also offers better gastric health. Some people report that it

<!-- chunk -->

### provides relief from the symptoms of GERD/acid reflux.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers with traumatic brain injury say Sulforaphane helps reduce

<!-- chunk -->

### their feelings of anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### And most report that taking Sulforaphane as a nootropic supplement is a

<!-- chunk -->

### great alternative if you don’t like eating broccoli or Brussels sprouts!

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulforaphane Clinical Research

<!-- chunk -->

### Hundreds of clinical studies have been conducted with Sulforaphane.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers found benefits that range from improvement in autism

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms to cancer prevention. And from improvement of Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms to the reduction of diabetic complications.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulforaphane for autism

<!-- chunk -->

### A clinical trial done by researchers in Massachusetts showed that

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane improved behavior in young men with autism spectrum

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder (ASD).

<!-- chunk -->

### In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial, 29 young men

<!-- chunk -->

### (aged 13-27) with moderate to severe ASD received Sulforaphane derived

<!-- chunk -->

### from brussel sprouts or a placebo daily for 18 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### Parents and caregivers evaluated their behavior using the Aberrant

<!-- chunk -->

### Behavior Checklist (ABC) and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). Study

<!-- chunk -->

### doctors evaluated them using the Clinical Global Impression Severity

<!-- chunk -->

### scale (CGI-S).

<!-- chunk -->

### The young men who received Sulforaphane showed a substantial

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement in behavior.

<!-- chunk -->

### There was a 34% improvement on the ABC, and a 17% improvement on

<!-- chunk -->

### the SRS. Using the CGI-I measure, 46% showed significant improvement

<!-- chunk -->

### on social interaction. 54% on aberrant behavior. And 42% on verbal

<!-- chunk -->

### communication.1105

<!-- chunk -->

### In another study, the same researchers looked at 57 children with ASD,

<!-- chunk -->

### aged three to 12 years old. 28 children were given Sulforaphane for

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks, followed by no treatment for six weeks. The other 29 children

<!-- chunk -->

### received a placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in this study found that Sulforaphane improved the behavior

<!-- chunk -->

### of children using the ABC measure. But improvement on the SRS measure

<!-- chunk -->

### was not as dramatic as in the first study. They didn’t measure the CGI-I in

<!-- chunk -->

### the second study.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers pointed out that Sulforaphane is very safe. And it has been

<!-- chunk -->

### shown to lower oxidation levels, improve antioxidant action in the body,

<!-- chunk -->

### increase glutathione production, and lower neuroinflammation. All

<!-- chunk -->

### abnormalities that are associated with autism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers concluded that Sulforaphane shows promise for helping

<!-- chunk -->

### people with autism.1106

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulforaphane for Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers are starting to propose human trials for Sulforaphane’s effect

<!-- chunk -->

### on Alzheimer’s disease. They haven’t been completed yet. But several

<!-- chunk -->

### studies involving animal subjects have been done.

<!-- chunk -->

### In one study, 48 mice were divided into three groups. One control group,

<!-- chunk -->

### one group with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and one group with AD being

<!-- chunk -->

### treated with sulforaphane.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Alzheimer’s group receiving sulforaphane had lower levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### harmful β-Amyloid deposits in their brain. They also had higher levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### glutathione peroxidase that helps protect the brain from free radical

<!-- chunk -->

### damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### The mice treated with sulforaphane had better performance in a water

<!-- chunk -->

### maze and open field test. This showed that their brains were functioning

<!-- chunk -->

### better than the mice who didn’t get sulforaphane.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers concluded that sulforaphane should be considered for use in

<!-- chunk -->

### preventing Alzheimer’s disease. And in therapy for those who already

<!-- chunk -->

### have it.1107

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulforaphane helps prevent cancer

<!-- chunk -->

### The diagnosis of prostate cancer has increased because of increased PSA

<!-- chunk -->

### testing and an aging population. And up to 48% of cases may exhibit PSA

<!-- chunk -->

### progression after a subsequent follow up exam.

<!-- chunk -->

### But because of the risks associated with cancer treatment many men

<!-- chunk -->

### choose a program of “active surveillance” until there is evidence of cancer

<!-- chunk -->

### progression.

<!-- chunk -->

### The problem is there is no medical intervention for men who have chosen

<!-- chunk -->

### active surveillance that could reduce their risk for cancer progression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thankfully, we have a natural solution that is proving to be highly

<!-- chunk -->

### effective. And that solution uses natural nootropic supplements like

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane.

<!-- chunk -->

## A study called the Effect of Sulforaphane on Prostate CAncer

<!-- chunk -->

## PrEvention (ESCAPE) was a randomized, double-blinded 3-arm parallel

<!-- chunk -->

### trial conducted in the UK.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study looked at how Sulforaphane affects prostate cancer. In this

<!-- chunk -->

### study involving 49 patients, they gave broccoli soup to men with low-risk

<!-- chunk -->

### or intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

<!-- chunk -->

### Patients were split into three groups. All groups were required to eat

<!-- chunk -->

### mL of broccoli soup every week for 12 months. Broccoli contains high

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of glucoraphanin, which is a precursor to Sulforaphane.

<!-- chunk -->

### Each group ate soup with a different level of glucoraphanin concentration.

<!-- chunk -->

### Then researchers measured gene expression in biopsied prostate tissue at

<!-- chunk -->

### the beginning of the trial. And at the end of the trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### A change in gene expression could indicate a progression in cancer

<!-- chunk -->

### development.1108

<!-- chunk -->

### Patients in the group that ate the highest levels of glucoraphanin had the

<!-- chunk -->

### healthiest gene expression. And showed higher levels of Sulforaphane in

<!-- chunk -->

### their circulation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers concluded that Sulforaphane helps reduce the risk of cancer

<!-- chunk -->

### progression.1109

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulforaphane Recommended Dosage

<!-- chunk -->

## Recommended Sulforaphane dosage is 35-60 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### But Sulforaphane supplements vary so check the label or manufacturer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### website for dosage specific to the supplement you are using.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulforaphane Side Effects

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulforaphane is non-toxic and safe when consumed in its raw form from

<!-- chunk -->

### broccoli, broccoli sprouts, or kale.

<!-- chunk -->

### When taken as a nootropic supplement, Sulforaphane has few if any side

<!-- chunk -->

### effects if it’s taken at recommended dosages. More is NOT better and may

<!-- chunk -->

### be toxic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane rarely causes increased gas, constipation, or diarrhea.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane is safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding when taken from a

<!-- chunk -->

### whole food source. The safety of Sulforaphane as a supplement is not

<!-- chunk -->

### known during pregnancy and breastfeeding so should be avoided.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane is a source of Sulphur so your supplement may smell nasty

<!-- chunk -->

### depending on how it is manufactured.

<!-- chunk -->

## Type of Sulforaphane to Buy

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane is available in tablets, capsules, or powder. Dosage for each

<!-- chunk -->

### capsule varies widely, so read the label to know how many you need to

<!-- chunk -->

### take to get the recommended dose of 35 - 60 mg.

<!-- chunk -->

## Many formulations include the enzyme myrosinase. The glucoraphanin in

<!-- chunk -->

### broccoli combines with myrosinase in your gut to form Sulforaphane.

<!-- chunk -->

## TrueBroc® is patented form of glucoraphanin extracted from broccoli

<!-- chunk -->

### seeds using a hot water process. This patented Sulforaphane supplement is

<!-- chunk -->

### manufactured in Baltimore and licensed to supplement manufacturers for

<!-- chunk -->

### use in their product.

<!-- chunk -->

## Avmacol® by Nutramax Laboratories is a patented broccoli seed extract

<!-- chunk -->

### (Glucoraphanin) & Myrosimax® (active Myrosinase enzyme) which when

<!-- chunk -->

### digested produces Sulforaphane in your gut. Manufactured in Maryland

<!-- chunk -->

### and licensed to major supplement manufacturers.

<!-- chunk -->

## BrocColinate® by Numedica uses a patented CO2 extraction method to get

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane Glucosinolate from broccoli with added Myrosinase which

<!-- chunk -->

### is a key enzyme needed to convert Sulforaphane Glucosinolate into

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane in your small intestine.


<!-- chunk -->

## Sulforaphane 35-60 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Sulforaphane as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Sulforaphane on its own. You can get

<!-- chunk -->

### glucoraphanin from cruciferous vegetables or a nootropic supplement so

<!-- chunk -->

### your body can synthesize Sulforaphane using the enzyme myrosinase.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane plays a powerful role in cell detoxification and the

<!-- chunk -->

### regulation of a healthy antioxidant defense system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane may be especially helpful in you are dealing with autism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane provides antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial,

<!-- chunk -->

### anticancer, anti-aging, and antidiabetic benefits.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane as a nootropic boosts cognition, helps support recovery from

<!-- chunk -->

### traumatic brain injury (TBI), and helps regulate mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulforaphane protects against neurodegenerative diseases such as

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. And helps prevent cancer cell growth.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s safe to use 35 – 60 mg of Sulforaphane per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### But some labels may be confusing because it will include much higher

<!-- chunk -->

### doses of the precursor glucoraphanin which makes Sulforaphane.

<!-- chunk -->

### So always check the label for dosage recommendations from the

<!-- chunk -->

### manufacturer of the supplement.


# Taurine

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine is anti-anxiety, relieves chronic fatigue, promotes mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### health, supports cellular energy, helps you sleep, and is anti-aging

<!-- chunk -->

## Taurine (2-aminoethane-sulfonic acid) is one the most abundant amino

<!-- chunk -->

### acids in your brain, spinal cord, eyes, and nearly every tissue in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Every region of your brain including the retina in your eyes contains or

<!-- chunk -->

### takes up taurine.

<!-- chunk -->

### You may be familiar with taurine only because it’s a featured ingredient in

<!-- chunk -->

### popular energy drinks like Red Bull, Rock Star, NOS, Amp, Full Throttle,

<!-- chunk -->

### and Monster.

<!-- chunk -->

### Occasionally we’ll see a story about sudden death or seizure from

<!-- chunk -->

### consuming as few as 3 – 4 cans of some energy drink. And because taurine

<!-- chunk -->

### is the featured ingredient many assume that taurine is the problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### Turns out that adding taurine to your nootropic stack is perfectly safe. The

<!-- chunk -->

### hidden issue often missed in the news is energy drink caffeine content

<!-- chunk -->

### ranging from 80 – 300 mg per can.1110

<!-- chunk -->

### Everyone from athletes to exhausted soccer moms grab a Red Bull® to

<!-- chunk -->

### improve performance and make it through their day.

<!-- chunk -->

### But a better option is to avoid the sugar-laden energy drink. And stack a

<!-- chunk -->

### taurine supplement with a cup of coffee or green tea. For a similar effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### Without the negatives.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine functions as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Activating GABA and glycine receptors which affects memory and mood

<!-- chunk -->

### and prevents seizures.1111

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine protects brain cells by reducing intracellular free calcium (Ca2+)

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrations.1112 It is a potent antioxidant, protects from mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction, modulates energy metabolism within cells, modulates genes

<!-- chunk -->

### to induce longevity, inhibits cellular stress associated with Alzheimer’s,

<!-- chunk -->

### acts as ‘quality control’ in brain cell health, and protects against stroke.1113

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine increases stem cells and progenitor cells (neural precursor cells)

<!-- chunk -->

### in your brain including the aging hippocampus and increases the survival

<!-- chunk -->

### of newborn neurons (neurogenesis).1114

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine is synthesized in your body from methionine and cysteine via

<!-- chunk -->

### cysteinesulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSD).1115

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine is a “conditional” amino acid because some of this amino acid is

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesized naturally in your body. And you get the remaining taurine

<!-- chunk -->

### your body requires from eating seafood, meat, poultry, and eggs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine was discovered by German scientists Friedrich Tiedemann and

<!-- chunk -->

### Leopold Gmelin in 1827 who first extracted it from ox bile. It’s named

<!-- chunk -->

### after the Latin taurus which means bull or ox.

<!-- chunk -->

### Since taurine is found almost exclusively in animal-based foods, many

<!-- chunk -->

### vegans and vegetarians are at risk for taurine deficiency.1116

<!-- chunk -->

### Science also shows that taurine levels decline with age.1117 Possibly

<!-- chunk -->

### because the aging body and brain cannot supply enough of the precursors

<!-- chunk -->

### required to synthesize taurine.1118

<!-- chunk -->

### The structure of taurine has two primary differences from essential amino

<!-- chunk -->

### acids.

<!-- chunk -->

### First, taurine’s amino group is attached to a beta-carbon instead of an

<!-- chunk -->

### alpha-carbon. And second, the acid group in taurine is sulfonic acid,

<!-- chunk -->

### instead of carboxylic acid like in other amino acids.1119

<!-- chunk -->

### Because of this distinctive structure, taurine is not used in the synthesis of

<!-- chunk -->

### proteins in your body and brain. Instead, it provides a host of other

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits which we’ll cover in this review.

<!-- chunk -->

### The more we learn about taurine, the more we realize it is one of the most

<!-- chunk -->

### essential substances in the human body.

<!-- chunk -->

### After extensive animal studies showing all the benefits of taurine,

<!-- chunk -->

### scientists in Japan were curious if there was a correlation in human health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Using data from a WHO study covering 61 populations in 25 countries

<!-- chunk -->

### they confirmed that populations with the highest levels of taurine in their

<!-- chunk -->

### system lived the longest.1120

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, taurine is essential for minimizing damage from beta-

<!-- chunk -->

### amyloid proteins associated with Alzheimer’s, protecting against

<!-- chunk -->

### environmental toxins, preventing mitochondrial dysfunction, and

<!-- chunk -->

### supporting the inhibitory GABA system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine is needed for promoting long-term potentiation for memory

<!-- chunk -->

### formation, reducing brain inflammation, stimulating growth of new

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons (neurogenesis), and protecting your brain from the damaging

<!-- chunk -->

### effects of stroke.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Taurine work in the brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Taurine may help anxiety and depression. If you deal with anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### or depression, you know the negative effects on learning, work and

<!-- chunk -->

### your quality of life. Supplementing with taurine as a nootropic may

<!-- chunk -->

### help.1121

<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows that taurine may help alleviate depression by changing

<!-- chunk -->

### depression-related signaling cascades in the hippocampus.1122

<!-- chunk -->

### One human study with 121 bipolar patients aged 18 – 25 demonstrated a

<!-- chunk -->

### reduction in manic episodes when supplemented with taurine.1123

<!-- chunk -->

### And several animal studies have shown taurine nootropic supplementation

<!-- chunk -->

### may help in the clinical treatment of anxiety. By modulating the GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### and glycine receptors in the brain. And preventing neurotoxicity and

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial energy failure.1124

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Taurine is anti-aging. Studies show that taurine levels fall as you

<!-- chunk -->

### get older. And supplementing with taurine seems to slow the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### aging process.1125

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine protects brain cells from pesticides and heavy metals such as

<!-- chunk -->

### lead.1126 It helps prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and regulates calcium

<!-- chunk -->

### levels.1127 And taurine prevents toxicity by reversing declines in the

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibitory GABA system.1128

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine supplementation reduces inflammatory processes caused by

<!-- chunk -->

### excessive iron accumulation that can lead to Alzheimer’s and

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s.1129 And it stops Amyloid-β from damaging mitochondria by

<!-- chunk -->

### activation of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT 1) which helps prevent Alzheimer’s.1130

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine also plays a critical role in creating new brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### (neurogenesis). Research has found that taurine activates dormant stem

<!-- chunk -->

### cells in the brain.1131 And boosts the survival of new neurons which results

<!-- chunk -->

### in an increase in adult brain cells.


<!-- chunk -->

### Some taurine is produced in your body from methionine and cysteine. But

<!-- chunk -->

### the remainder must come from your diet. If you are vegan or vegetarian,

<!-- chunk -->

### chances are high that you are not getting enough taurine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Diseases such as diabetes, cancer, liver disease, kidneys or heart can also

<!-- chunk -->

### deplete taurine. As can deficiencies in Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (P-5-P), zinc,

<!-- chunk -->

### magnesium, and Vitamin A. And eating food containing monosodium

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamate (MSG).

<!-- chunk -->

### Insufficient taurine means:

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ reduced GABA can lead to anxiety and depression

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ vision problems

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ oxidative stress destroys neurons and synapses

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ insulin resistance

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) declines

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine is one of the least expensive nootropic supplements there is. So if

<!-- chunk -->

### there the slightest doubt you are getting enough taurine then add it to your


<!-- chunk -->

## Taurine benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine is the most abundant amino acid that you’ve never heard of.

<!-- chunk -->

### Strong evidence suggests taurine could be the secret factor in the world’s

<!-- chunk -->

### longest-living populations.1132

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show taurine:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Critical for normal human brain development1133

<!-- chunk -->

### •Prevents mitochondrial dysfunction within brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

## •Supports GABA in your brain preventing neurotoxicity & stress

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reduces inflammation that can lead to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s

<!-- chunk -->

### •Stimulates neurogenesis which is anti-aging

<!-- chunk -->

### •Shields brain cells from stroke-induced brain cell damage

<!-- chunk -->

### •Prevents beta-amyloid damage that could lead to Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### •Protects brain cells from heavy metals and pesticides

<!-- chunk -->

### •Needed along with NMDA and dopamine receptors for long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### potentiation needed for long-term memory formation1134

<!-- chunk -->

### And here we’re only investigating taurine’s effects on your brain. This

<!-- chunk -->

### essential amino acid can also restore insulin sensitivity, mitigate diabetic

<!-- chunk -->

### complications, reverse symptoms of heart disease, prevent and treat fatty

<!-- chunk -->

### liver, and reverse tinnitus.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are interested in living a longer, healthier, and more active life,

<!-- chunk -->

### consider adding taurine to your nootropic stack.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Taurine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report that supplementing with taurine is a simple way to

<!-- chunk -->

### support energy levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sleep is better, and taurine may be a safe alternative to prescription sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### meds.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most people using taurine report sharper eyesight. Muscle pain is reduced,

<!-- chunk -->

### less depression, and no more insulin resistance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some report that adding taurine to their nootropic stack helped relieve

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic fatigue syndrome.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with taurine is effective for lowering blood pressure and

<!-- chunk -->

### reducing the occurrence of atrial fibrillation.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have issues after eating food containing monosodium glutamate

<!-- chunk -->

### (MSG), taurine can help eliminate the headache and nausea.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taurine Clinical Research

<!-- chunk -->

## Taurine for autism

<!-- chunk -->

### Autism spectrum disorder is thought to be associated with oxidative stress

<!-- chunk -->

### caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). So oxidative stress could be a

<!-- chunk -->

### potential target for therapeutic intervention for autism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylation capacity, sulfate levels, and total glutathione levels are

<!-- chunk -->

### decreased in autism. On the other hand, oxidative glutathione, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### ratio of oxidative to reduced glutathione are increased.

<!-- chunk -->

### So decreasing oxidative stress might be a potential treatment for

<!-- chunk -->

### autism.1135

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine is a well-known antioxidant and regulator of inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in New York tested 66 children aged 1.5 – 11.5 years who

<!-- chunk -->

### were diagnosed with autism. And the controls in this study were the kids’

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy siblings and parents.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study found that 21 out of 66 autistic children had low taurine

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrations. The researchers concluded the data implied that taurine

<!-- chunk -->

### may be a valid biomarker for at least some with autism.1136

<!-- chunk -->

## Taurine may help ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have shown low dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and striatum

<!-- chunk -->

### segments of the ADHD brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### A very recent study conducted in Taiwan revealed that high-dose taurine

<!-- chunk -->

### calmed hyperactive behavior and brain signaling in ADHD rats.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine significantly affected dopamine transporter levels, dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### uptake and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression.1137

<!-- chunk -->

### Mounting evidence in ADHD research also suggests a strong relationship

<!-- chunk -->

### between inflammation and ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and

<!-- chunk -->

### C-reactive protein are turning out to be diagnostic markers of ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### These cytokines induce changes in dopamine and norepinephrine in the

<!-- chunk -->

### prefrontal cortex.

<!-- chunk -->

### A recent study in Taiwan showed that high-dose taurine significantly

<!-- chunk -->

### reduced interleukin (IL)-1 and C-reactive protein which in turn reduced

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperactive behavior.1138

<!-- chunk -->

## Taurine for OCD

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show that patients with OCD have increased glutamate activity

<!-- chunk -->

### and decreased GABA in the brain. And it could be genetic.

<!-- chunk -->

### One specific gene (SLC1A1) codes for transporters to clear glutamate

<!-- chunk -->

### from synapses, and boost GABA production.1139 If you are missing this

<!-- chunk -->

### gene, you’ll have problems with glutamate and GABA and likely

<!-- chunk -->

### experience symptoms of OCD.

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA plays a critical role in regulating excitability in neuronal networks

<!-- chunk -->

### in your brain. Taurine has been proven to activate GABA receptors and

<!-- chunk -->

### even boost GABA levels in your brain.1140 Helping to reduce symptoms of

<!-- chunk -->

### OCD.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taurine for epilepsy

<!-- chunk -->

### Read the reviews of taurine supplements and now and again you’ll see

<!-- chunk -->

### someone mention that consistent use of taurine reduces the severity and

<!-- chunk -->

### number of seizures they experience.

<!-- chunk -->

### Imbalances between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters appear to

<!-- chunk -->

### be the mechanism of epileptic seizures. And taurine serves as an

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibitory neuromodulator.

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in your brain. So the

<!-- chunk -->

### regulation of GABA plays a prominent role in preventing excitability and

<!-- chunk -->

### seizures.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine is a GABA


<!-- chunk -->

### receptor agonist. High-doses of taurine activate this

<!-- chunk -->

### receptor as well as the glycine receptor which both suppress neuronal

<!-- chunk -->

### firing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Several clinical studies have been conducted to test the efficacy in using

<!-- chunk -->

### taurine to control epilepsy. Reviews are mixed as only about 1/3 of

<!-- chunk -->

### patients respond favorably to taurine therapy.1141 So if you’ve tried

<!-- chunk -->

### everything else with little success you may want to give taurine a try.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taurine Recommended Dosage

<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended taurine nootropic dosage is 500 mg – 2 gm per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### The safe upper limit for taurine is 3 gm per day.1142

<!-- chunk -->

### Instead of getting your taurine from an energy drink, try a taurine

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement with a cup of coffee or tea, and a high-quality B-Complex

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement. You’ll feel better and get the same benefit.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine is rapidly absorbed and used in your body and brain. But studies

<!-- chunk -->

### show that a single dose won’t do much in providing a benefit you can feel.

<!-- chunk -->

### Continual, daily, long-term nootropic usage of taurine builds and the

<!-- chunk -->

### maintains adequate levels of taurine in your system.1143

<!-- chunk -->

### With very few exceptions, high doses of taurine are well tolerated without

<!-- chunk -->

### adverse side effects.1144

<!-- chunk -->

## Taurine Side Effects

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine is well-tolerated and safe for most people. And should not cause

<!-- chunk -->

### any side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### High taurine dosage should be avoided if you are dealing with bipolar

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder because it could make your symptoms worse.

<!-- chunk -->

## Type of Taurine to buy

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine is available in capsules and powder form.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine capsules are usually 500 or 1000 mg each.

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid trying to get your taurine from energy drinks because the dose is

<!-- chunk -->

### too low for any nootropic benefit. And they are loaded with sugar, caffeine,

<!-- chunk -->

### and other ingredients that are contrary to good health.


<!-- chunk -->

## Taurine 500 mg – 2 gm per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using taurine as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does make some taurine on its own. But the rest must come

<!-- chunk -->

### from meat, poultry, seafood, or dairy. Or a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine is especially helpful for relieving anxiety and stress. If you

<!-- chunk -->

### haven’t had much luck with prescription anti-anxiety meds or

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants, or other nootropics for anxiety, you may want to try

<!-- chunk -->

### taurine.

<!-- chunk -->

### For antiaging benefits, and a longer, healthier life you should add taurine

<!-- chunk -->

### to your nootropic stack.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine is essential for a healthy brain, heart, muscles, eyes and hearing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taurine is particularly effective for those using levodopa to treat

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s Disease because this drug depletes taurine in your body.1145

<!-- chunk -->

### Doctors sometimes recommend dosages of taurine up to 6 grams per day

<!-- chunk -->

### for treating high blood pressure, diabetes, congestive heart failure, anemia,

<!-- chunk -->

### cystic fibrosis and after surgery.

<!-- chunk -->

### But for most neurohackers, up to 2 grams per day of taurine is adequate.

<!-- chunk -->

### Just avoid trying to get your daily taurine dose from energy drinks. The

<!-- chunk -->

### dose is too low and the risk from the other ingredients in these drinks is

<!-- chunk -->

### too high.


# Tryptophan

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan has been shown to help alleviate anxiety, depression, ADHD,

<!-- chunk -->

### SAD, OCD, PMS, memory loss, and pain

<!-- chunk -->

## Tryptophan is an essential amino acid and precursor to serotonin,

<!-- chunk -->

### melatonin and niacin (Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### ) in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

## The enzyme Tryptophan hydroxylase converts Tryptophan into 5-HTP (5-

<!-- chunk -->

### hydroxytryptophan).

<!-- chunk -->

## The decarboxylation of 5-HTP to serotonin is dependent on the presence

<!-- chunk -->

### of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### , and pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (P5P).

<!-- chunk -->

## The further conversion of serotonin into melatonin requires the presence

<!-- chunk -->

### of SAM-e (S-Adenosyl-L-methionine).

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin is often referred to as the “happiness molecule”. Low serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### levels can result in pain, insomnia, depression, seasonal affective disorder,

<!-- chunk -->

### and chronic fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

### For your body to manufacture serotonin, it needs an adequate supply of the

<!-- chunk -->

## natural amino acid Tryptophan. As a nootropic supplement, Tryptophan is

<!-- chunk -->

### used for anxiety, ADHD, depression, insomnia, memory loss, pain, and

<!-- chunk -->

### eating disorders.1146

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan is found in abundance in oats, bananas, dried prunes, milk,

<!-- chunk -->

### tuna, cheese, bread, chicken, turkey, peanuts, and chocolate.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eating food containing Tryptophan will increase levels of this amino acid

<!-- chunk -->

### in your body. But not necessarily boost serotonin levels in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here’s why…

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan is one of 8 essential amino acids and has the lowest

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration in the body of all the amino acids. Tryptophan requires and

<!-- chunk -->

### competes for active transport to the brain. And competes for the same

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors as the other amino acids.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research has also found that serotonin levels are enhanced by

<!-- chunk -->

### carbohydrates in your meals because insulin release accelerates the serum

<!-- chunk -->

### removal of some of the amino acids that Tryptophan is competing with.

<!-- chunk -->

### And if your meal has a higher percentage of proteins, it also slows

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin elevation in your brain.1147

<!-- chunk -->

### Since Tryptophan from food has issues working its way to your brain to

<!-- chunk -->

### make serotonin, why not skip that step and supplement with 5-HTP

<!-- chunk -->

## instead? Tryptophan and 5-HTP both penetrate the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### And 5-HTP is the intermediate step in serotonin synthesis.

<!-- chunk -->

### See my chapter on 5-HTP for more on why supplementing with 5-HTP

<!-- chunk -->

### instead of Tryptophan is not such a good idea.

<!-- chunk -->

### A lack of bioavailable Tryptophan in your body can have a big impact on

<!-- chunk -->

### your life. Low levels of Tryptophan and serotonin imbalances in the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### are associated with ADHD. Studies have found that children with ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### have 50% lower than average levels of Tryptophan.1148

<!-- chunk -->

### Low levels of Tryptophan can result in short- and long-term memory loss.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with Tryptophan has been found to improve memory in

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy adults.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Tryptophan work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Tryptophan boosts memory. Tryptophan’s main nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### mechanism of action is as a precursor to the neurotransmitter

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin. Other neurotransmitters such as melatonin, dopamine,

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine and beta-endorphin increase following Tryptophan

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation.1149

<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows that Tryptophan and serotonin play a significant role in

<!-- chunk -->

### memory. Enhanced brain serotonin has been shown to improve cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### performance in animals and humans. And decreasing levels of serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### through Tryptophan depletion impairs cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study done in Pakistan assessed memory in rats following Tryptophan

<!-- chunk -->

### administration. The rats received Tryptophan doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg

<!-- chunk -->

### of body weight for 6 weeks. The study showed significant improvement in

<!-- chunk -->

### memory of rats following both doses of Tryptophan.1150

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Tryptophan enhances mood. As a precursor to serotonin,

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan can have a significant effect on mood. Supplementing

<!-- chunk -->

### with Tryptophan has been found to increase not only serotonin, but

<!-- chunk -->

### growth hormone and prolactin as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers infused 11 healthy male subjects with doses of 5, 7.5 and

<!-- chunk -->

### grams of Tryptophan. And then monitored their hormonal and behavioral

<!-- chunk -->

### responses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan produced significant effects on mental and physical sedation

<!-- chunk -->

### but did not increase levels of tranquilization. Tryptophan provided a

<!-- chunk -->

### calming effect without knocking these guys out even at high doses.1151


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Tryptophan levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Tryptophan hydroxylase levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Stress, insulin resistance and age increase

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Magnesium and Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### levels decline


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Concentration, working memory and executive function decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Appetite regulation, energy and alertness decline

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes can happen at an age. And are influenced by declining

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan levels. Very little dietary Tryptophan is available for protein

<!-- chunk -->

### and serotonin synthesis. And for many people this can be a problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### Anxiety, depression, ADHD, memory loss, binge eating, and a host of

<!-- chunk -->

### other mental and physical issues have been correlated with low

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan levels.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tryptophan benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Just living in our modern society seems to leave us irritable, stressed-out,

<!-- chunk -->

### and anxious. Worst case is problems sleeping, depression, aggressive

<!-- chunk -->

### behavior, reduced motivation, pain and even suicidal thinking.

<!-- chunk -->

## And all have been traced to not enough serotonin in our brain.1152

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin, the happiness molecule relies on an adequate supply of

<!-- chunk -->

## Tryptophan for synthesis. Researchers now recognize that the role

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin plays in psychiatric and behavior disturbances comes from

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan depletion.1153

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme needed for serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### production. And is involved in the conversion of Tryptophan to 5-HTP (5-

<!-- chunk -->

### Hydroxytryptophan) needed to make serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### This enzyme (Tryptophan hydroxylase) can be inhibited by stress, insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### resistance, magnesium or Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency or increasing age.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan and 5-HTP can penetrate the blood-brain barrier. But

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan requires active transport and competes for the same receptors

<!-- chunk -->

### with other amino acids including tyrosine, phenylalanine, valine, leucine,

<!-- chunk -->

### and isoleucine.1154

<!-- chunk -->

### To complicate things even more, serotonin levels are enhanced by

<!-- chunk -->

### carbohydrates in our diet because insulin release accelerates serum

<!-- chunk -->

### removal of the amino acids competing for Tryptophan transport. And high

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of protein in our diet slows increase in serotonin.1155

<!-- chunk -->

### So now you know why it’s helpful to add supplemental L-Tryptophan to

<!-- chunk -->

### your nootropic stack.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Tryptophan feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Many try L-Tryptophan the first time to cure insomnia or as an alternative

<!-- chunk -->

### to prescription sleep meds.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dosing L-Tryptophan in the evening will typically ensure you’ll feel great

<!-- chunk -->

### the next day. You should have more energy for working out.

<!-- chunk -->

### Anxiety levels should decrease. Happiness levels should rise. Tryptophan

<!-- chunk -->

### could help with memory. Music will sound better. Feelings of self-esteem

<!-- chunk -->

### will improve.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some neurohackers report being able to taper off prescription

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant meds by supplementing with L-Tryptophan.


<!-- chunk -->

## 5-HTP and Tryptophan are natural alternatives for the treatment of

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. And often used as alternatives to prescription antidepressant

<!-- chunk -->

### treatments because they don’t come with the side effects associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### But as neurohackers we don’t have a lot of research to help us decide if

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with Tryptophan makes sense. (If we base our decisions on

<!-- chunk -->

### clinical trials).

<!-- chunk -->

### Much of the research looks at finding out if low levels of Tryptophan are

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with depression and poor cognition. But there is very little

<!-- chunk -->

### clinical evidence that supplementing with Tryptophan will help reverse

<!-- chunk -->

### low Tryptophan levels. And if adding this nootropic to our stack will boost

<!-- chunk -->

### mood and cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia decided to comb

<!-- chunk -->

### through the research to find out if clinical trials supported the natural

<!-- chunk -->

### health claims of using 5-HTP and/or Tryptophan for depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team located 108 trials of which only 2 studies involving a total of

<!-- chunk -->

### people had sufficient data to qualify. The team concluded that the very

<!-- chunk -->

### limited data showed 5-HTP and Tryptophan better that placebo for

<!-- chunk -->

### alleviating depression. But that larger and more studies were needed

<!-- chunk -->

### before their widespread use could be recommended.1156

<!-- chunk -->

## Low Tryptophan = Depression and Poor Cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### 20 patients in remission or partial remission from depression were studied

<!-- chunk -->

### in a double-blind, crossover design trial. Tryptophan was artificially

<!-- chunk -->

### depleted in these patients so scientists could look at the effects on

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team found what we see in real life. Lower levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan had a negative effect on mood, their ability to process positive

<!-- chunk -->

### information, and attention.1157

<!-- chunk -->

## Tryptophan Helps Manage Depression

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin has been recognized as the neurotransmitter that is key to

<!-- chunk -->

### managing depression for the last 30 years. Most of the prescription drug

<!-- chunk -->

### therapies for depression work by raising serotonin levels at the relevant

<!-- chunk -->

### synapses.

<!-- chunk -->

### We also know that Tryptophan is the immediate precursor to serotonin in

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain. So researchers, using a “what came first, the chicken or the egg”

<!-- chunk -->

### approach, decided to find out if low serotonin levels or low Tryptophan

<!-- chunk -->

### levels were to blame for depression symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in China analyzed levels of Tyrosine, Tryptophan and

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin in patients with major depressive disorder. And found that all

<!-- chunk -->

### three were decreased in depressed patients. (Note that Tyrosine is a

<!-- chunk -->

### precursor to dopamine in the brain).1158

<!-- chunk -->

### The Center for Addiction and Health in Toronto conducted a randomized,

<!-- chunk -->

### double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 30 depressed individuals.

<!-- chunk -->

### Treatment was fluoxetine (Prozac®) 20 mg per day, 2-4 grams of

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan per day or a placebo for 8 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mood was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the

<!-- chunk -->

### Beck Depression Index during the trial. During the 1st week there was a

<!-- chunk -->

### significant decrease in depression in those who used fluoxetine or

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan.

<!-- chunk -->

### At 4 weeks the research team recorded a disruption in sleep patterns for

<!-- chunk -->

### those using fluoxetine or a placebo. But not the Tryptophan group.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team concluded that combining 20 mg of fluoxetine with 2 g of

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan was a safe protocol for treating depression. Patients

<!-- chunk -->

### experienced a rapid decrease in depressive symptoms. And the

<!-- chunk -->

### combination had a protective effect on sleep patterns.1159

<!-- chunk -->

## DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME. The trials combining Tryptophan with

<!-- chunk -->

### SSRI’s, SNRI’s and MAOI’s are all done under professional supervision.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember, Tryptophan is a precursor to serotonin. And antidepressant

<!-- chunk -->

### meds also boost serotonin in the brain. When combined, serotonin levels

<!-- chunk -->

### are boosted even more.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herein lies the problem. If you increase serotonin too much, you put

<!-- chunk -->

## yourself in real danger of Serotonin Syndrome. Which can lead to all

<!-- chunk -->

### kinds of nasty side effects. Including death.1160

<!-- chunk -->

### DO NOT combine Tryptophan with antidepressant meds unless you are

<!-- chunk -->

### doing so under the careful supervision of a doctor. It is much too

<!-- chunk -->

### dangerous attempting this on your own.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tryptophan Boosts Exercise Performance

<!-- chunk -->

### Ever wondered why you cut a workout session short even though physical

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue wasn’t an issue? Researchers found it could be due to low

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan levels. And its effects on serotonin in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### 20 healthy young men aged 21 years used a cycle ergometer at about 50%

<!-- chunk -->

### of their physical capacity for 10 minutes followed by maximum intensity

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise for another 30 minutes. This sequence was repeated 3-times, and

<!-- chunk -->

### after the 4th series, each participant continued at the highest speed they

<!-- chunk -->

### could sustain for 20 minutes.

<!-- chunk -->

### This protocol was performed twice: once with and once without

<!-- chunk -->

## Tryptophan. Researchers found peak power output during the last

<!-- chunk -->

## minutes were higher on trials performed with Tryptophan than those who

<!-- chunk -->

### performed on a placebo.1161

<!-- chunk -->

### Another trial in Spain recruited 12 healthy sportsmen who ran on a

<!-- chunk -->

### treadmill until exhaustion. Once while supplementing with Tryptophan

<!-- chunk -->

### and once with a placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### Total exercise time, perceived exertion rate, maximum heart rate, peak

<!-- chunk -->

### oxygen consumption, pulse recovery rate, and excess post-exercise oxygen

<!-- chunk -->

### consumption were determined during the two trials.

<!-- chunk -->

### Total exercise time was nearly 50% greater after receiving Tryptophan

<!-- chunk -->

### than after receiving a placebo. Perceived exertion rate was lower when

<!-- chunk -->

### using Tryptophan.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that the longer exercise time could be due to

<!-- chunk -->

### increased pain tolerance as a result of Tryptophan supplementation.1162

<!-- chunk -->

## Tryptophan Relieves Symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder

<!-- chunk -->

## Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a form of depression experienced by

<!-- chunk -->

### many during the winter months. Symptoms include difficulty waking,

<!-- chunk -->

### decreased energy, weight gain, carbohydrate craving, difficulty

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrating, decreased libido, withdrawal, anxiety, depression and

<!-- chunk -->

### irritability.

<!-- chunk -->

### The first order of treatment is often light therapy. But many do not respond

<!-- chunk -->

### to light therapy typically because of a mutation in the melanopsin gene

<!-- chunk -->

### and the associated signaling pathway between the retina and the pineal

<!-- chunk -->

### gland.1163

<!-- chunk -->

### The pineal gland in your brain is your source of melatonin which

<!-- chunk -->

### influences sleep cycles. Melatonin is synthesized from serotonin which is

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesized from Tryptophan.1164

<!-- chunk -->

### So if light therapy doesn’t work, possibly supplementing with Tryptophan

<!-- chunk -->

### to stimulate production of serotonin and melatonin could be effective.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada

<!-- chunk -->

### set out to find if Tryptophan could help those with Seasonal Affective

<!-- chunk -->

### Disorder (SAD) where light therapy failed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Patients were treated for 2 weeks using light therapy. Those who did not

<!-- chunk -->

### respond to light therapy were treated with 1 g Tryptophan 3-times per day

<!-- chunk -->

### for 2 weeks while continuing light therapy.

<!-- chunk -->

### The addition of Tryptophan resulted in a significant reduction in

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. 64% of the patients in this study showed very good clinical

<!-- chunk -->

### responses to the combined treatment with minimal side effects.1165


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dosage of Tryptophan is 500 – 1,000 mg per day for

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive benefit or sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### The University of Michigan Health Department recommends much higher

<!-- chunk -->

### doses for:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Lowering appetite and cravings: 500 mg – 2 grams per day

<!-- chunk -->

### •Depression or Anxiety: 2 – 6 grams per day (with medical

### Tryptophan is a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme needed for serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### production. And requires magnesium and Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### to synthesize

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan is also a precursor to the synthesis of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (niacin). So if

<!-- chunk -->

### you don’t have enough niacin in your body, supplementing with L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan will not efficiently produce serotonin because it’s being used

<!-- chunk -->

### to produce niacin. Which also depletes stores of the vitamin cofactors B


<!-- chunk -->

### ,


<!-- chunk -->

### So supplement L-Tryptophan with a B-Vitamin complex that includes

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamins B


<!-- chunk -->

### , and magnesium.

<!-- chunk -->

### Note that some of the clinical trials used in this post use much higher

<!-- chunk -->

### doses of Tryptophan. Which is not recommended and usually not

<!-- chunk -->

### necessary.

<!-- chunk -->

### Too much Tryptophan will make you sleepy. And could produce excess

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of 5-HTP and serotonin which can lead to Serotonin Syndrome.


<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan is a normal part of your diet and considered non-toxic and safe

<!-- chunk -->

### at recommended doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### But in the unlikely event that you already have adequate levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan in your body, supplementing with more could cause problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### As can dosing more that the recommended amount.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tryptophan could cause stomach upset, loss of appetite, nausea, heartburn,

<!-- chunk -->

### drowsiness, headaches, dry mouth and sexual problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Start at the lowest dose to see how your body reacts. When first starting

<!-- chunk -->

### with L-Tryptophan take your dose in the evening to avoid possible

<!-- chunk -->

### drowsiness issues.

<!-- chunk -->

## Caution: Low to moderate doses of Tryptophan (30 mg per pound of body

<!-- chunk -->

### weight), or about 4.5 grams for the average 165 lb. adult is considered safe

<!-- chunk -->

### and free of side effects. However, most don’t need to dose at nearly these


<!-- chunk -->

### DO NOT use L-Tryptophan if you are taking antidepressant medications

<!-- chunk -->

### including SSRI’s. Because these drugs delay normal degradation of

### serotonin in brain synapses leaving more serotonin circulating in your


<!-- chunk -->

### Too much Tryptophan in combination with these drugs can produce

<!-- chunk -->

## Serotonin Syndrome which can lead to delirium, involuntary muscle

<!-- chunk -->

### contractions, high fever, and coma. And worse case and a very real

### scenario is death.1167


<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tryptophan is available in tablet and capsule form usually 500 – 1,000

<!-- chunk -->

### mg.

<!-- chunk -->

### You also get Tryptophan in foods you eat including chocolate, oats,

<!-- chunk -->

### bananas, dried dates, milk, cottage cheese, meat, fish, turkey, and peanuts.

<!-- chunk -->

### Approximately 300 mg of Tryptophan is available in three ounces of

### to your stack.


<!-- chunk -->

## Tryptophan 500 – 1,000 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

## I recommend using Tryptophan as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does get some Tryptophan from the food you eat. But this

<!-- chunk -->

### amino acid is competing with other amino acids for transport to your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. It’s competing for the same receptors. And carbohydrates vs.

<!-- chunk -->

### proteins in your meals can affect Tryptophan’s ability to synthesize

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with L-Tryptophan will make more of this amino acid

<!-- chunk -->

### available to synthesize serotonin and melatonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tryptophan is especially helpful for those with low serotonin levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Boosting this crucial neurotransmitter can help alleviate insomnia, pain,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### Adding L-Tryptophan to your nootropic stack can also boost the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine and melatonin. Improving

### sleep, cognition, memory, mood and decision-making.

<!-- chunk -->

### Start with 500 mg of L-Tryptophan per day and take it in the evening. See

<!-- chunk -->

### how your body reacts and how you feel the next day. Increase the dose to

# Turmeric

<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric has been shown to increase Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,

<!-- chunk -->

### fight depression, improve cognition, focus and libido, and protect the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### from inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

## Turmeric (Curcuma longa) is one of the most powerful natural remedies

<!-- chunk -->

### in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine. This ancient herbal remedy has been

<!-- chunk -->

### used for at least 6,000 years.1168

<!-- chunk -->

### It is one of the most studied herbs in Ayurvedic, Siddha, Unani and

<!-- chunk -->

### Chinese healing. Turmeric has remarkable nootropic properties. And

<!-- chunk -->

### stands far above many modern medicines used to treat neurodegenerative

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases like depression, Alzheimer’s and stroke.

<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric is a perennial shrub native to southern Asia. It is a member of

<!-- chunk -->

### the ginger family (Zingiberaceae). And the Chinese name, jianghuang,

<!-- chunk -->

### literally means “yellow ginger.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Most of the turmeric we get is grown in India. But turmeric is also

<!-- chunk -->

### cultivated in China, Taiwan, Japan, Myanmar (Burma), Indonesia and

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout Africa.

<!-- chunk -->

### The major constituent of turmeric is curcumin (diferuloylmethane), which

<!-- chunk -->

### constitutes up to 90% of total curcuminoid content, with

<!-- chunk -->

### desmethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin comprising the

<!-- chunk -->

### remainder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric is used extensively in several countries as part of their system of

<!-- chunk -->

### national medicine. Turmeric is listed in the official Ayurvedic

<!-- chunk -->

### Pharmacopoeia of India. In the Pharmacopoeia of the People’s Republic of

<!-- chunk -->

### China. In the Japanese Herbal Medicines Codex.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Germany, turmeric is listed in the Drug Codex, approved in the

<!-- chunk -->

### Commission E monographs, and in the form of tea in the official German

<!-- chunk -->

### Standard License monographs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Curcumin and turmeric have been extensively researched for their anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### tumor, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and analgesic (pain-relieving)

<!-- chunk -->

### properties. In fact, a search of the U.S. PubMed database for research on

<!-- chunk -->

### turmeric returns 5,334 clinical trials on animals and humans.1169

<!-- chunk -->

### And yet the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health

<!-- chunk -->

### which is part of the same U.S. National Institutes of Health has this to say

<!-- chunk -->

### about turmeric:

<!-- chunk -->

### “There is little reliable evidence to support the use of turmeric for any

<!-- chunk -->

### health condition because few clinical trials have been conducted.”1170

<!-- chunk -->

### That statement by an official medical resource in the USA tells you

<!-- chunk -->

### something about the American health care system. And its view of

<!-- chunk -->

### alternative medicines. And why books like “Head First” and websites like

<!-- chunk -->

### Nootropics Expert are so important for our nootropics community. So we

<!-- chunk -->

### can make our own decisions on how to boost our cognitive health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric, also known as “Indian Saffron”, has been used for thousands of

<!-- chunk -->

### years in traditional South Asian cuisine, and is the basic ingredient in

<!-- chunk -->

### curry.

<!-- chunk -->

### One recent study with 1,010 elderly Asian subjects found that those who

<!-- chunk -->

### ate curry “often” or “very often” had significantly higher cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### performance.1171

<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric has potent antidepressant qualities. And has been found to be

<!-- chunk -->

### more potent than the antidepressant Prozac. Researchers think Turmeric

<!-- chunk -->

### works by reducing the stress hormone cortisol while increasing levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### the neurotransmitter serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

## Turmeric’s main active component curcumin provides protection against

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s, major depression, epilepsy, and other neurodegenerative

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. Scientists believe that much of this protective action comes

<!-- chunk -->

### from curcumin’s anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

<!-- chunk -->

### Curcumin modulates neurotransmitter levels in your brain. And on a

<!-- chunk -->

### molecular level is a potent inhibitor of reactive astrocyte expression which

<!-- chunk -->

### prevents apoptosis (cell death) in your brain.1172

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Turmeric Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Turmeric enhances neuroplasticity. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic

<!-- chunk -->

### Factor (BDNF) is a growth hormone responsible for the creation of

<!-- chunk -->

### new neurons (neurogenesis) in your brain. Higher levels of BDNF

<!-- chunk -->

### can increase mood, intelligence, memory and productivity. And can

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce risks for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and


<!-- chunk -->

### Using turmeric or its active compound curcumin can boost your

<!-- chunk -->

### intelligence and memory. And can elevate your mood especially if you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### prone to depression. Several studies have shown that turmeric or its active

<!-- chunk -->

### component curcumin significantly boosts BDNF.1173

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers found that curcumin activated extracellular signal-regulated

<!-- chunk -->

### kinases (ERKs) and p38 kinases, cellular signal transduction pathways

<!-- chunk -->

### known to be involved in the regulation of neuronal plasticity and stress

<!-- chunk -->

### responses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Administration of curcumin to mice in this study increased the number of

<!-- chunk -->

### newly generated cells in the hippocampus. Showing that curcumin

<!-- chunk -->

### enhances hippocampus neurogenesis. And that curcumin activity in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain enhances neuroplasticity and repair of brain cells.1174

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study using the turmeric volatile oil Ar-turmerone showed this

<!-- chunk -->

### compound also supported regeneration of brain cells. Scientists discovered

<!-- chunk -->

### that when neural stem cells were bathed in Ar-turmerone, up to 80% more

<!-- chunk -->

### stem cells grew into neurons or other cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists then injected this turmeric extract into a part of rat’s brains

<!-- chunk -->

### where these cells are located. And witnessed a similar increase in growth

<!-- chunk -->

### of stem cells into neurons.1175

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Turmeric boosts dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### These are the ‘feel good’ neurotransmitters in your brain. Turmeric

<!-- chunk -->

### and its active compound curcumin has been studied and used

<!-- chunk -->

### effectively as an anti-depressant for centuries.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in India set out to establish how curcumin worked in the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### to provide this antidepressant action. In this study they investigated both

<!-- chunk -->

### curcumin and its ability to boost mood as well as the effect of Piperine as

<!-- chunk -->

### a bioavailability enhancer.

<!-- chunk -->

### The scientists found that curcumin increased serotonin and dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### levels in the brain. And inhibited monoamine oxidase enzymes (both

<!-- chunk -->

### MAO-A and MAO-B) just like popular prescription antidepressant

<!-- chunk -->

### MAOI’s. Curcumin even enhanced the effectiveness of popular SSRI

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants Prozac, Effexor, and Zyban.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team found no increase in norepinephrine when using curcumin to

<!-- chunk -->

### boost neurotransmitters. Avoiding the irritability and other symptoms of

<!-- chunk -->

### an over-amped fight-or-flight response.

<!-- chunk -->

### And the scientists found that stacking curcumin with Piperine significantly

<!-- chunk -->

### boosted bioavailability. They concluded that curcumin combined with

<!-- chunk -->

### Piperine was a “potent natural antidepressant approach to managing

<!-- chunk -->

### depression”.1176


<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic stress, anxiety and free radicals (oxidation) damage your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### This damage can manifest in several ways including memory loss, brain

<!-- chunk -->

### fog, anxiety, depression, and even neurodegenerative diseases like

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

<!-- chunk -->

## ↓ Chronic stress reduces memory

<!-- chunk -->

## ↓ Toxins kill brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

## ↓ Free radicals destroy neurons and synapses

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Serotonin and dopamine decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor declines

<!-- chunk -->

### Under conditions of chronic stress or depression your brain loses the

<!-- chunk -->

### capacity to transmit signals between neurons efficiently. Memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition and decision-making all suffer as a result.

<!-- chunk -->

## Turmeric benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### A member of the ginger family of herbs, turmeric is the seasoning that

<!-- chunk -->

### gives curry powder its yellow color. It’s long been known for its anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory and antioxidant properties. And is actively studied today for

<!-- chunk -->

### applications as a nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric or anyone of its several active compounds including curcumin

<!-- chunk -->

### and Ar-turmerone undoes damage to your brain caused by depression or

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric and curcumin boost neuron regrowth (neurogenesis), increases

<!-- chunk -->

### dendrites, repairs DNA, reduces inflammation, counters free radical

<!-- chunk -->

### damage, and boosts neurotransmitters.

<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric inhibits monoamine oxidase enzymes (both MAO-A and MAO-

<!-- chunk -->

### B) just like popular prescription antidepressant SSRI’s and MAOI’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows that curcumin or turmeric can boost the effects of some

<!-- chunk -->

### popular antidepressants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Boosting the ‘feel-good’ neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine can

<!-- chunk -->

### alleviate depression, improve mood, boost alertness, cognition, decision-

<!-- chunk -->

### making, memory and even libido.

<!-- chunk -->

### Curcumin, the most active component of turmeric, activates genes to

<!-- chunk -->

### produce a huge array of antioxidants that serve to protect your

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### Curcumin also improves glucose metabolism, which is great for

<!-- chunk -->

### maintaining a healthy balance of gut bacteria. This critical microbiome in

<!-- chunk -->

### your gut directly influences how well your brain functions.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Turmeric feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Curcumin is the main active component of turmeric. So most of the

<!-- chunk -->

## positive reviews and studies have been conducted using curcumin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Curcumin is known to possess antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### hypertensive, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-tumor, anti-cancer, anti-phlogistic,

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-diabetic, anti-psoriasis, anti-thrombotic, anti-hepatotoxic and a host

<!-- chunk -->

### of other useful properties.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are in perfect physical and mental health, you may not feel the

<!-- chunk -->

### effects of supplementing with turmeric or curcumin. Turmeric’s

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroprotective qualities may not be felt if your brain is in perfect

<!-- chunk -->

### working order. But the effects of long-term supplementation will help you

<!-- chunk -->

### ward off diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most frequent comment from supplementing with turmeric comes

<!-- chunk -->

### from those dealing with chronic pain. Turmeric relieves the pain of

<!-- chunk -->

### osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic pain usually results in insomnia or poor sleep quality, loss of

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, depression, and other stress-related symptoms. Adding curcumin

<!-- chunk -->

### or turmeric to your nootropic stack can help relieve chronic pain. You’ll

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep better and feel more alert the next day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with turmeric or curcumin improves attention, working

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, and mood. And is reported to relieve the symptoms of migraine

<!-- chunk -->

### headaches.


<!-- chunk -->

## Eat Your Curry

<!-- chunk -->

### Curcumin, from the curry spice turmeric, has been shown to have

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. And can reduce beta-

<!-- chunk -->

### amyloid plaques that are associated with Alzheimer’s Disease. But

<!-- chunk -->

### scientists were not satisfied with the evidence of turmeric’s benefits in real

<!-- chunk -->

### life.

<!-- chunk -->

### So in 2003, a research team in Singapore recruited 1,010 non-demented

<!-- chunk -->

### elderly Asian people aged 60 – 93 years. The authors of the study

<!-- chunk -->

### compared Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores for three

<!-- chunk -->

### categories and regular curry consumption.

<!-- chunk -->

### The scientist found that those who consumed curry “occasionally” and

<!-- chunk -->

### “often or very often” had much higher MMSE scores than those who

<!-- chunk -->

### “never or rarely” consumed curry.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study authors reported that regular curry consumption was evidence of

<!-- chunk -->

### better cognitive performance. The bottom-line → eat your curry.1177

<!-- chunk -->

## Turmeric as an anti-depressant

<!-- chunk -->

### A study conducted in India looked at the efficacy and safety of using

<!-- chunk -->

### curcumin, one of the active ingredients found in turmeric, for treating

<!-- chunk -->

### major depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### 60 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder were chosen to

<!-- chunk -->

### receive either 20 mg of fluoxetine (Prozac), 1000 mg of curcumin, or a

<!-- chunk -->

### combination of both daily for 6 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study found that the best response (77.8%) was with the group of

<!-- chunk -->

### patients treated with a combination of curcumin and Prozac. The Prozac-

<!-- chunk -->

### only group experienced a 64.7% improvement in depression symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### And the curcumin-only group came in at 62.5%.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that curcumin could be used as an effective and

<!-- chunk -->

### safe treatment for patients with major depression.1178

<!-- chunk -->

## Curcumin Reduces Stress

<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine to manage

<!-- chunk -->

### stress and depression-related disorders. Scientists had already figured out

<!-- chunk -->

### turmeric’s antidepressant effects in animal and human studies. So they

<!-- chunk -->

### imagined that curcumin may also alleviate stress caused by HPA

<!-- chunk -->

### (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) dysfunction.

<!-- chunk -->

### For this study the scientists used rats. They subjected the animals to stress

<!-- chunk -->

### for 20 days by putting them through several tasks known to stress a rat.

<!-- chunk -->

### Putting rats through this unfortunate (for the rats) series of events

<!-- chunk -->

### produced the kind of symptoms you would see in humans subjected to

<!-- chunk -->

### ongoing, chronic stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### The rats had abnormal adrenal gland weight, increased thickness in the

<!-- chunk -->

### adrenal cortex, elevated cortisol levels and reduced glucocorticoid

<!-- chunk -->

### receptor (GR) mRNA expression. These changes were reversed by giving

<!-- chunk -->

### the rats curcumin in their food.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team also found that chronic stress down-regulated BDNF

<!-- chunk -->

### levels and reduced the ratio of cAMP to CREB levels in the hippocampus

<!-- chunk -->

### and frontal cortex of the rats. Giving the rats curcumin blocked all these

<!-- chunk -->

### stress-induced physical responses in their brains.

<!-- chunk -->

### The scientists concluded that these results provided compelling evidence

<!-- chunk -->

### that the behavioral effects of curcumin in chronically stressed animals,

<!-- chunk -->

### and by extension humans, could be related to the modulating effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### curcumin on the HPA axis and neurotrophin expressions.1179


<!-- chunk -->

### You cannot get the immediate therapeutic and nootropic benefits of

<!-- chunk -->

### turmeric by simply eating more curry. Or adding turmeric to your food.

<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric root contains only about 3% curcumin.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most convenient way to start experiencing the benefits of turmeric is

<!-- chunk -->

### to get a high quality, 100% organic turmeric extract that contains at least

<!-- chunk -->

### 95% curcuminoids.

<!-- chunk -->

### But curcumin and turmeric on their own are poorly absorbed by your gut.

<!-- chunk -->

### You must boost the bioavailability and absorption of this potent nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### And the most efficient way to boost bioavailability is to combine turmeric

<!-- chunk -->

## or curcumin with Piperine. One study showed combining curcumin with

<!-- chunk -->

### mg of Piperine increased bioavailability by 2000%!1180

<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric is fat-soluble so you must take it with a high quality fat for

<!-- chunk -->

### maximum absorption. You can use unrefined coconut or extra virgin olive

<!-- chunk -->

### oil.

<!-- chunk -->

### Standardized turmeric or turmeric extract (95% curcuminoids) 750 mg 3-

<!-- chunk -->

### times per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric liquid extract (1:1) 30 – 90 drops per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tincture (1:2) 15 – 30 drops 4-times per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dried turmeric root powder 2.5 – 4 grams per day.


<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric is natural and considered non-toxic and safe when taken at

<!-- chunk -->

### recommended doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taking large amounts of turmeric for extended periods can cause stomach

<!-- chunk -->

### upset, and possibly ulcers.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have gallstones or a bile passage obstruction you should not

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement with turmeric.

<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric may lower blood sugar levels which could be a problem for

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pregnant and breastfeeding women should not supplement with turmeric.

<!-- chunk -->

### And because turmeric can act as a blood thinner, stop supplementing with

<!-- chunk -->

### turmeric 2 weeks before surgery. Turmeric can also strengthen the effects

<!-- chunk -->

### of blood thinning medications.


<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric is available as a powder, tablets, capsules, tincture, and tea. And

<!-- chunk -->

### is preferred over curcumin if you’re using it for inflammatory conditions

<!-- chunk -->

### like arthritis, tendonitis, or an autoimmune condition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Curcumin is a natural chemical found in and extracted from turmeric.

<!-- chunk -->

### Several companies have developed their own version of this powerful

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sabinsa’s Curcumin C3 Complex® boasts the most clinical studies of any

<!-- chunk -->

### of the patented forms of curcumin. This curcumin product is standardized

<!-- chunk -->

### to 95% Curcuminoids. Sabinsa also produces the standardized Piperine

<!-- chunk -->

### extract called BioPerine®. And supplement makers who feature Curcumin

<!-- chunk -->

### C3 Complex® from Sabinsa also typically include BioPerine® in their

<!-- chunk -->

### formula.

<!-- chunk -->

## BCM95® by DolCas Biotech is a standardized extract of turmeric

<!-- chunk -->

### containing curcumin-essential oil complex of 86% curcuminoids and 7-9%

<!-- chunk -->

### essential oils. As far as I can tell this is the only extract that includes

<!-- chunk -->

### turmeric volatile oils which is important to cognitive health. Recall from

<!-- chunk -->

## earlier in this article that turmeric volatile oil Ar-turmerone supported

<!-- chunk -->

### regeneration of brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

## Longvida® is a standardized curcumin extract that the company claims is

<!-- chunk -->

### at least 67-285 times more bioavailable than standard 95% curcumin. But

<!-- chunk -->

### does not contain any of the volatile oils found in natural turmeric. One

<!-- chunk -->

### study showed that this extract increases synapses in mice.1181 Another

<!-- chunk -->

### study in humans showed Longvida® significantly improved attention,

<!-- chunk -->

### working memory, and mood compared to placebo.1182

<!-- chunk -->

## Meriva® is another patented form of curcumin combined with soy

<!-- chunk -->

### lecithin. The two compounds are a 1:2 ratio with microcrystalline

<!-- chunk -->

### cellulose added. The company claims that the addition of soy lecithin

<!-- chunk -->

### improves bioavailability of curcumin. Total curcumin in each capsule is

<!-- chunk -->

### 20%. Much higher doses of this curcumin extract are needed for

<!-- chunk -->

### optimizing cognition. And is primarily targeted at bone, joint, eye and skin

<!-- chunk -->

### health.

<!-- chunk -->

## Active ingredients of Turmeric include curcuminoids and volatile oils.

<!-- chunk -->

### Look for the percentage of active ingredients listed on the bottle or

<!-- chunk -->

### package. Your best option is choosing a standardized extract of at least

<!-- chunk -->

### 95% curcuminoids.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unless the supplement contains a patented compound from the companies

<!-- chunk -->

### listed above, you can assume that the extract has been processed using

<!-- chunk -->

### toxic solvents to extract curcumin from turmeric (not good).

<!-- chunk -->

### And avoid supplements that list “other ingredients” on the label. Look for

<!-- chunk -->

## Certified Organic to ensure the root used to make your Turmeric

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement is free of heavy metals, pesticides and herbicides.


<!-- chunk -->

## Turmeric Extract (95% curcuminoids) 750 mg 3-times per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Turmeric or Curcumin as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Turmeric on its own. So to get its benefits you


<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric is the anti-Alzheimer’s spice. Studies show that in parts of India

<!-- chunk -->

### where curries are eaten most often, Alzheimer’s disease is extremely rare.

<!-- chunk -->

## Turmeric is especially helpful for those suffering from depression or

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic pain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric has a combination of curcuminoids, volatile oils and proteins

<!-- chunk -->

### that make it anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### septic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some neurohackers maintain that turmeric or curcumin is the best

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic. You can increase the bioavailability of turmeric by combining it

<!-- chunk -->

### with Piperine (black pepper extract) and a healthy fat like olive or coconut

<!-- chunk -->

### oil.

<!-- chunk -->

## You can safely take up to 3,000 mg of Turmeric extract daily if needed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most get all the benefit they need with 750 mg. Dosed 3-times per day.


# Tyrosine

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine enhances working memory, executive function, creative flow

<!-- chunk -->

### states, stress reduction, better mood, anti-anxiety and lessens symptoms of

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Tyrosine is the master precursor required to form all catecholamine

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain converts L-Tyrosine to L-DOPA which then produces the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter dopamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The unused dopamine is then further converted into the neurotransmitters


<!-- chunk -->

### This triad of neurotransmitters are collectively referred to as

<!-- chunk -->

### “catecholamines”.

<!-- chunk -->

### “Tyrosine” is derived from the Greek word tyros, meaning cheese. It was

<!-- chunk -->

### first discovered by German chemist Justus von Liebig in 1846 in the

<!-- chunk -->

### protein casein from cheese.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine is considered a non-essential amino acid because it can be

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesized in your body from phenylalanine. Which is found in many

<!-- chunk -->

### high-protein foods such as poultry, fish, dairy, nuts, soy products, lima

<!-- chunk -->

### beans, avocados, and bananas.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tyrosine enhances working memory and executive function in the

<!-- chunk -->

### prefrontal cortex. It helps with creative flow states, is fuel for inspiration,

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive flexibility, and the kind of “convergent thinking” you do in

<!-- chunk -->

### multiple choice exams.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tyrosine assists in the production of thyroid hormones T


<!-- chunk -->

### (triiodothyronine) and T


<!-- chunk -->

### (thyroxine) which are crucial in maintaining both

<!-- chunk -->

### overall physical and cognitive health.

### N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine (NALT) is the amino acid L-Tyrosine with an acetyl

<!-- chunk -->

### group added. When you take NALT as a supplement, it breaks down in

<!-- chunk -->

### your kidneys back into L-Tyrosine. So in theory, the two supplements offer

<!-- chunk -->

### the same benefits.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is some debate in the nootropics community on which is more

<!-- chunk -->

### effective. NALT or plain L-Tyrosine. NALT is a more soluble form of L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine so it should be more bioavailable to your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, some studies report that in some cases, a sizeable percentage of

<!-- chunk -->

### supplemental NALT is excreted in urine before it’s converted into L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine.1183

<!-- chunk -->

### On a personal note, I haven’t had any issues using NALT as a source of L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine. It gives me a dopamine and adrenal boost you’d expect from

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with a dopamine precursor.

<!-- chunk -->

### But when I haven’t any NALT around I successfully switch to L-Tyrosine

<!-- chunk -->

### although at a slightly higher dose.

<!-- chunk -->

### When dealing with ADHD/ADD, L-Tyrosine is particularly effective when

<!-- chunk -->

### stacked with ALCAR (Acetyl-L-Carnitine) and CDP-Choline. They both

<!-- chunk -->

### easily crosses the blood-brain barrier for boosting acetylcholine levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### And seems to positively influence serotonin levels. And Tyrosine provides

<!-- chunk -->

### my brain with the dopamine it needs to mitigate symptoms of

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD/ADD.

<!-- chunk -->

### I find that L-Tyrosine stacked with 20 mg of Ritalin twice a day works

<!-- chunk -->

### particularly well. Clearly, this brain doesn’t have the capacity to produce

<!-- chunk -->

### enough dopamine on its own. And needs the boost that comes from

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with Tyrosine.

<!-- chunk -->

### So like all nootropics, YMMV. Always consider how each nootropic works

<!-- chunk -->

### synergistically with others in your stack. And how they work with any

<!-- chunk -->

### meds you need to take.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is as much art as it is science. And experimentation is key for optimal


<!-- chunk -->

### How does L-Tyrosine work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tyrosine boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.L-Tyrosine improves memory and cognition under acute stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Acute stress is defined as short-term stressors that can affect

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition. Examples are extreme heat or cold. Things like cold

<!-- chunk -->

### showers, extreme sports, car accidents, relationship problems,

<!-- chunk -->

### intense movies, business deals gone awry, exams and war zones.

<!-- chunk -->

### In one study done at the University of Bedfordshire in the UK, the effect of

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tyrosine on cognitive performance was measured before an exercise

<!-- chunk -->

### task.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers recruited 8 soccer players. And had them complete a 90-

<!-- chunk -->

### minute soccer simulation performance test in an environmental chamber

<!-- chunk -->

### set at 77 degrees Fahrenheit.

<!-- chunk -->

### The soccer players were given either L-Tyrosine before exercise or a

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo. Cognitive performance was measured before the exercise task.

<!-- chunk -->

### Then again at “half-time”, following half time, and following the entire

<!-- chunk -->

### simulation.

<!-- chunk -->

### The cognitive performance task assessed dual-task and vigilance. The

<!-- chunk -->

### outcome revealed that cognitive vigilance and reaction time among soccer

<!-- chunk -->

### players significantly improved following administration of L-Tyrosine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Results showed that in warm-weather conditions, L-Tyrosine could

<!-- chunk -->

### enhance cognitive function and prevent cognitive impairment during

<!-- chunk -->

### exposure to exercise-heat stress.1184

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.L-Tyrosine boosts neurotransmitters. L-Tyrosine taken as a

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement converts into the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### helps control movement in your body, is fundamental to memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### attention and problem solving.

<!-- chunk -->

### The unused dopamine can then convert into the neurotransmitters


<!-- chunk -->

### Norepinephrine is important for attentiveness, emotions, sleeping,

<!-- chunk -->

### dreaming, and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

### Epinephrine drives your ‘flight-or-flight’ response. It’s what prompts your

<!-- chunk -->

### reaction to dangerous circumstances, emergency situations, or in stressful

<!-- chunk -->

### situations or environments.

<!-- chunk -->

### In one study done in the Netherlands, researchers determined if L-Tyrosine

<!-- chunk -->

### would boost cognitive resources associated with cognitive control. They

<!-- chunk -->

### performed tests designed to measure “working memory” using the N-Back

<!-- chunk -->

### Test.

<!-- chunk -->

### Study participants were assigned to engage in a “1-back” condition of easy

<!-- chunk -->

### difficulty and then a 2-back condition of tougher difficulty. Those that

<!-- chunk -->

### used L-Tyrosine demonstrated superior performance in the 2-back test, but

<!-- chunk -->

### not the 1-back test.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study authors suggested that L-Tyrosine provides greater cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### enhancement when cognitive demand increases.

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom-line; supplementation of L-Tyrosine may help you increase

<!-- chunk -->

## your IQ score due to maximizing catecholamine reserves.1185


<!-- chunk -->

### As we get older, our brain and body chemistry and energy metabolism


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Dopaminergic neurons are damaged or die


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Thyroid hormones decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Stress levels increase

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Working memory and mood decline

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes are often attributed to aging. But could be a result of

<!-- chunk -->

### dietary and lifestyle choices.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unchecked, they could lead to neurodegenerative diseases like

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s, a drop-in quality of life and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Tyrosine benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tyrosine can boost levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine,

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine, and epinephrine. And contributes to the production of

<!-- chunk -->

### thyroid hormones T


<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine can help boost cognition especially in stressful situations. It helps

<!-- chunk -->

### improve decision making, ‘flow state’ and creativity, cognitive flexibility,

<!-- chunk -->

### and working memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Tyrosine converts into L-DOPA to produce dopamine. L-DOPA is also

<!-- chunk -->

### used to make melanin in your body. This conversion process helps in the

<!-- chunk -->

### removal of neurotoxic quinones.

<!-- chunk -->

### And chelates heavy metals like mercury and lead which can accumulate in

<!-- chunk -->

### and damage neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### The dopamine that is not used by your brain is available to produce

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine (noradrenaline) which is important for attentiveness,

<!-- chunk -->

### emotions, sleeping, dreaming, and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tyrosine can be an effective nootropic when stacked with ADHD/ADD

<!-- chunk -->

### meds like Ritalin or Adderall. It helps supply extracellular dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### needed to improve the effectiveness of stimulants used to boost the uptake

<!-- chunk -->

### of dopamine in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does L-Tyrosine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Keep in mind that L-Tyrosine is a precursor to catecholamines. So if

<!-- chunk -->

### you’re not ‘low’ on dopamine, norepinephrine, or epinephrine – you may

<!-- chunk -->

### not ‘feel’ anything.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers report a lift in mood, better focus, concentration,

<!-- chunk -->

### increased energy, and an overall sense of well-being. L-Tyrosine can help

<!-- chunk -->

### readjust your motivation levels. It can help lower anxiety levels, especially

<!-- chunk -->

### social anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with L-Tyrosine can help bring your blood pressure down if

<!-- chunk -->

### its elevated from a stressful situation or environment. Take it before the

<!-- chunk -->

### stressful event if you can.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tyrosine helps buffer the effects of stimulants like caffeine or

<!-- chunk -->

### amphetamines. It helps potentiate and prolong the effects of Ritalin or

<!-- chunk -->

### Adderall and reduces the crash.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re into athletics or do manual work, you’ll find that supplementing

<!-- chunk -->

### with L-Tyrosine before a workout or construction job will leave you

<!-- chunk -->

### feeling great afterwards. It helps mitigate many of the effects of acute

<!-- chunk -->

### stress caused by short-term stressors.

<!-- chunk -->

### And L-Tyrosine helps your body to produce melanin, so you may find it

<!-- chunk -->

### easier to get a tan while at the beach.

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Tyrosine Research

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Tyrosine to treat ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### Several studies have investigated using L-Tyrosine for the treatment of

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD. One informal study published in the 1980’s determined that L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine resulted in short-term relief from ADHD symptoms. But subjects

<!-- chunk -->

### eventually reached tolerance and a diminished effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is important for neurohackers to keep in mind. It seems that L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine on its own can benefit some more than others. Regardless of if

<!-- chunk -->

### you’re treating ADHD or are perfectly cognitively healthy.

<!-- chunk -->

### I’ve seen more than one report of nootropic users experiencing tolerance

<!-- chunk -->

### after just a week of supplementing with L-Tyrosine. But most peer-

<!-- chunk -->

### reviewed, published studies show positive results.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study published in Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment in

<!-- chunk -->

### looked at using amino acid precursors for the treatment of ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### Including L-Tyrosine for dopamine, and 5-HTP for serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study used 85 young people aged 4 – 18 years old, all with a clinical

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosis of ADHD. They were treated for an initial period of 8 –

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### Urinary samples to determine serotonin and dopamine levels were

<!-- chunk -->

### collected within the first 4 weeks. If they didn’t reach adequate levels,

<!-- chunk -->

### subjects were moved to higher dosing levels 2 and then 3 until they got

<!-- chunk -->

### relief from symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers found that the dopamine and serotonin precursors yielded

<!-- chunk -->

### similar results to Strattera and Ritalin. And “the amino acid protocol may

<!-- chunk -->

### be equal in efficacy to potent, pharmaceutical ADHD medications”.1186

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Tyrosine reduces blood pressure under stress

<!-- chunk -->

### This study is particularly interesting for its nootropic application. It’s

<!-- chunk -->

### commonly understood that blood pressure rises when we’re under stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### The source of stress doesn’t really matter. Stress up = blood pressure up.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study in Amsterdam showed that L-Tyrosine administration decreased

<!-- chunk -->

### blood pressure about 15 minutes after ingestion. This study involved

<!-- chunk -->

### assessing task performance following acute stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Acute stress is usually short-term and can be caused by driving, fighting,

<!-- chunk -->

### athletics, martial arts training, war, combat training, CrossFit, cold

<!-- chunk -->

### showers, loud music, intense movies, loud noises, business deals,

<!-- chunk -->

### relationships, school, exams and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### The point is this study is applicable to every one of us. The study found

<!-- chunk -->

### that L-Tyrosine reduced diastolic blood pressure within 15 minutes of

<!-- chunk -->

### taking the supplement. And blood pressure normalized within 1 hour.

<!-- chunk -->

### This study tells us that L-Tyrosine may promote a decrease in blood

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure caused by stress. And could be used to mitigate the effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### stressful situations if taken prior to the stressful event.1187

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Tyrosine promotes cognitive flexibility

<!-- chunk -->

### Cognitive flexibility applies to those who can adjust their thinking quickly

<!-- chunk -->

### to adapt to novel situations and stimuli. A high degree of cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### flexibility is associated with increased fluid intelligence, superior reading

<!-- chunk -->

### and comprehension, and a healthier brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recent research (2015) supports the idea that L-Tyrosine promotes

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive flexibility. In this trial, researchers recruited 22 adults. And

<!-- chunk -->

### setup a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

<!-- chunk -->

### All subjects were assigned a task switching procedure to measure their

<!-- chunk -->

### flexibility. The results showed that receiving L-Tyrosine supplementation

<!-- chunk -->

### increased cognitive flexibility compared to the placebo group.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers determined that “L-Tyrosine can facilitate cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### flexibility by repleting cognitive resources”.1188

<!-- chunk -->

### The team observed that increased cognitive flexibility was likely due to a

<!-- chunk -->

### boost in dopamine concentrations. They noted that L-Tyrosine enhanced

<!-- chunk -->

### usage of various cognitive resources. And one way to increase your

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive flexibility would be to start supplementing with L-Tyrosine.

<!-- chunk -->

### It stands to reason that people who are close-minded, set it their ways, are

<!-- chunk -->

### resistant to change and can’t cope with unexpected stimuli or situations

<!-- chunk -->

### have “cognitive rigidity”. And it’s likely due to suboptimal dopamine


<!-- chunk -->

## L-Tyrosine Recommended Dosage

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tyrosine suggested dosage for cognitive benefit is 500 mg – 2 grams per


<!-- chunk -->

### You may find your body responds to smaller doses. Or even more if you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### stacking it with stimulants like ADHD meds. Listen to your body and see

<!-- chunk -->

### how you react.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you find you do not experience the full benefit from L-Tyrosine, then try

<!-- chunk -->

### using it an hour before or two hours after a meal. Because L-Tyrosine

<!-- chunk -->

### taken as a supplement may compete with other amino acids in food for

<!-- chunk -->

### transport into your system.

<!-- chunk -->

### I personally stack 500 mg L-Tyrosine with my Ritalin dose twice per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### And a final dose of L-Tyrosine late afternoon to prevent a stimulant crash.

<!-- chunk -->

### NOTE: long-term use of L-Tyrosine can suppress serotonin. Symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### include depression, fatigue or severe anxiety feeling much like a panic

<!-- chunk -->

### attack. You can easily counter this by supporting serotonin with a 250 –

<!-- chunk -->

### 500 mg L-Tryptophan about 60 mins. before bed.

<!-- chunk -->

## L-Tyrosine Side Effects

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tyrosine is considered non-toxic and very safe. Most neurohackers don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### have any negative side effects from using L-Tyrosine.

<!-- chunk -->

### At higher doses there are reports of stomach issues and migraines.

<!-- chunk -->

### Migraine problems usually happen to those who already suffer from

<!-- chunk -->

### migraines. This may be an indication that your neurotransmitter levels are

<!-- chunk -->

### already optimal, and you don’t need to supplement with L-Tyrosine.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tyrosine can increase your thyroid hormones. So if you are

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperthyroid, you should use caution when supplementing with L-Tyrosine

<!-- chunk -->

### because it may change the way your thyroid meds work.

<!-- chunk -->

### And if you’re taking MAO inhibitors (MAOI’s) like selegiline, Azilect,

<!-- chunk -->

### Marplan or Nardil you should not use L-Tyrosine.

<!-- chunk -->

### MAOI’s work in your brain by blocking the enzyme monoamine oxidase.

<!-- chunk -->

### This enzyme normally removes excess dopamine. But when you block the

<!-- chunk -->

### enzyme, more dopamine is released.

<!-- chunk -->

### So using L-Tyrosine in combination with MAOIs could raise dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### levels too high. Resulting in a rapid rise in blood pressure (hypertensive

<!-- chunk -->

### crisis). Causing severe headache, nausea and sweating, severe anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### rapid heartbeat, chest pain, vision changes, shortness of breath and

<!-- chunk -->

### confusion.

<!-- chunk -->

### A severe increase in blood pressure from this combo can lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### hemorrhagic stroke or a heart attack.

<!-- chunk -->

## Where to buy L-Tyrosine

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tyrosine is available to buy in powder, capsule, and tablet form.

<!-- chunk -->

### Capsules and tablets are usually 300 – 500 mg.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some pre-made nootropic stacks and workout stacks also include L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine as part of their formula.

<!-- chunk -->

### N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine (NALT) is an alternative to regular L-Tyrosine. NALT

<!-- chunk -->

### has an acetyl group added to L-Tyrosine in an attempt to make it more

<!-- chunk -->

### bioavailable.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ensure you read labels carefully and stick with manufacturers who follow

<!-- chunk -->

### Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). And are GMP-Certified.

<!-- chunk -->

### And do your best to avoid toxic “other ingredients” which are usually

<!-- chunk -->

### listed at the bottom of “Supplement Facts” labels.


<!-- chunk -->

## L-Tyrosine 500 mg 2 or 3-times per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using L-Tyrosine as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does synthesize some L-Tyrosine from phenylalanine which

<!-- chunk -->

### comes from high-protein foods like chicken, fish, almonds, avocados, and

<!-- chunk -->

### bananas.

<!-- chunk -->

### But most of us don’t get enough L-Tyrosine from our diet. So

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation will help.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tyrosine is helpful for most neurohackers to combat stress and sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### deprivation. It’ll boost dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s particularly helpful if you take L-Tyrosine prior to a stressful situation,

<!-- chunk -->

### workout, or physically demanding job.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tyrosine is especially helpful to those dealing with ADHD/ADD. It’s a

<!-- chunk -->

### great compliment to stack with stimulant meds like Ritalin or Adderall.

<!-- chunk -->

### L-Tyrosine will provide the dopamine your brain needs. It will help smooth

<!-- chunk -->

### out and prolong the effects of stimulant meds. And help prevent the

<!-- chunk -->

### associated crash when they wear off.

<!-- chunk -->

### A good stack for ADHD each time you are using your usual med dose is L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine 500 mg, Alpha GPC, or CDP-Choline 300 mg, and ALCAR

<!-- chunk -->

### mg.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely use up to 2,000 mg of L-Tyrosine per day when stacking

<!-- chunk -->

### with ADHD meds. But in smaller divided doses throughout your day.


# Uridine Monophosphate

<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine Monophosphate has been shown to increase neuron and synapse

<!-- chunk -->

### density, dopamine and acetylcholine release, boost learning and memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### and decrease depression

<!-- chunk -->

## Uridine Monophosphate (UMP or 5′-uridylic acid) is a pyrimidine

<!-- chunk -->

### nucleoside found in all living organisms ranging from humans to bacteria.

<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine is one of 4 repeating units that make up RNA (Ribonucleic Acid).

<!-- chunk -->

## RNA and DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) are the main information carrying

<!-- chunk -->

### molecules in each of your cells. Uridine is so important to brain

<!-- chunk -->

### development, that it is included in human baby formulas.1189

<!-- chunk -->

### RNA works as a messenger molecule, carrying the blueprint provided by

<!-- chunk -->

### DNA to tiny cellular factories called ribosomes. Ribosomes are in charge

<!-- chunk -->

### of protein synthesis and use the blueprint sent over from DNA by RNA to

<!-- chunk -->

### produce the right protein for the job required.

<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine is essential for optimized cognition and memory throughout your

<!-- chunk -->

### life. When taken as a nootropic supplement, Uridine Monophosphate

<!-- chunk -->

### easily crosses the blood-brain barrier.1190 UMP has much better

<!-- chunk -->

### bioavailability than dietary sources of uridine.

<!-- chunk -->

## CDP-Choline levels are increased once uridine reaches your brain. CDP-

<!-- chunk -->

## Choline is required for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC). PC in

<!-- chunk -->

## turn is a precursor of the essential neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh).

<!-- chunk -->

### Increased levels of PC and acetylcholine improves cognitive function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine is also a major building block for the synthesis of neurons and

<!-- chunk -->

### synapses. And uridine enhances the growth of dendrites, which are

<!-- chunk -->

### projections from neurons that facilitate connections with other neurons.1191

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom line is that without uridine to make up RNA, DNA couldn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### get the info out for proteins to be synthesized. And life as we know it

<!-- chunk -->

### would cease to exist.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our bodies create some uridine. And we get uridine from the RNA of

<!-- chunk -->

### foods we eat including beets, beer, broccoli, fish, mushrooms, oats,

<!-- chunk -->

### parsley, sugar cane, tomatoes, and brewer’s yeast. Beer provides some of

<!-- chunk -->

### the highest uridine content of all the foods tested.

<!-- chunk -->

### The problem is most of the uridine we get from food never makes it from

<!-- chunk -->

### our digestive system to our brain. So we need to supplement with uridine

<!-- chunk -->

### monophosphate (UMP) to experience the benefits of uridine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine does much more than merely act as a building block of RNA.

<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine acts in the formation of neurotransmitters, and the creation of new

<!-- chunk -->

### synapses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Adding uridine monophosphate to your nootropic stack can help improve

<!-- chunk -->

### alertness, focus, memory, learning ability and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers have found that Uridine Monophosphate alone can improve

<!-- chunk -->

### memory. But stacking UMP with DHA (Omega-3) and choline works in

<!-- chunk -->

### synergy, increasing the number of synapses. Resulting in improved

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition.1192

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Uridine Monophosphate Work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine Monophosphate boosts brain health and function in several ways.

<!-- chunk -->

### But two in particular stand out.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Uridine improves memory. Uridine helps boost learning and

<!-- chunk -->

### memory in several ways. Uridine helps the growth of new synapses

<!-- chunk -->

### in your brain, increases signaling between neurons, and assists in the

<!-- chunk -->

### formation of acetylcholine (ACh).

<!-- chunk -->

### Memory is largely dependent on neuroplasticity which is associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with the ability to learn and form memories. This process of turning

<!-- chunk -->

### experiences into memories relies on the growth of new neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### (neurogenesis), new synapses (synaptogenesis), dendrite formation, and

<!-- chunk -->

### network reorganization.

<!-- chunk -->

### New neurons (neurogenesis) are encased in a phospholipid layer made

<!-- chunk -->

## up partly of phosphatidylcholine (PC). PC is made from CDP-Choline

<!-- chunk -->

## which is produced with the help of uridine.1193 Supplementing with

<!-- chunk -->

### uridine gives your brain the ability to create more phospholipids by

<!-- chunk -->

### providing an abundance of CDP-Choline. Resulting in new and stronger


<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine is a precursor to the formation of CDP-Choline which is a

<!-- chunk -->

### precursor to the formation phosphatidylcholine (PC). PC separates into

<!-- chunk -->

### choline and sphingomyelin in your brain. Choline is then available to

<!-- chunk -->

### form acetylcholine (ACh). Optimal ACh levels is crucial for cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### performance.1194

<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine also helps increase synapse formation (synaptogenesis) by

<!-- chunk -->

### enhancing neurite growth. Uridine signals this outgrowth by activating

<!-- chunk -->

### the P2Y2 receptor which controls neuron differentiation and synaptic

<!-- chunk -->

### protein synthesis.1195

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Uridine impacts mood. Uridine stimulates the release of the ‘feel-

<!-- chunk -->

### good’ neurotransmitter dopamine in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phospholipids like phosphatidylcholine (PC) are required for cellular

<!-- chunk -->

### growth and repair, and specifically for synaptic function. PC synthesis is

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled by levels of its precursor CDP-Choline which is produced from

<!-- chunk -->

### cytidine triphosphate (CTP) and phosphocholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers found that supplementing with uridine monophosphate

<!-- chunk -->

### boosted levels of CDP-Choline. By promoting the synthesis of uridine

<!-- chunk -->

### triphosphate (UTP), which was partly converted to CTP.

<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine also enhanced neurite outgrowth with the help of nerve growth

<!-- chunk -->

### factor (NGF). The research team found that dopamine release correlated

<!-- chunk -->

### with neurite outgrowth influenced by UMP.1196

<!-- chunk -->

### Increased levels of dopamine has a significant effect on mood, learning

<!-- chunk -->

### and attention.


<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine levels decline as we age. And if you were not breast-fed as a baby,

<!-- chunk -->

### you started life at a deficit. Breast milk provides the uridine required for

<!-- chunk -->

### optimal brain growth.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Cognition, memory, recall, reaction time and mood diminish


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neurons and synapses decline

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes in brain energy metabolism are contributing factors to

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, ALS,

<!-- chunk -->

### epilepsy, and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### But even if you’re not concerned with age-related cognitive decline, or the

<!-- chunk -->

### effects of aging, Uridine Monophosphate can help.

<!-- chunk -->

## Uridine Monophosphate benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine plays a critical role in the pyrimidine metabolism in your brain.1197

<!-- chunk -->

## In the simplest terms, uridine monophosphate promotes neuron and

<!-- chunk -->

### synapse growth and DNA repair.1198

<!-- chunk -->

### Benefits reported by neurohackers include uplifting and stabilizing mood,

<!-- chunk -->

### reducing stress and OCD symptoms, a reduction in anxiety, and

<!-- chunk -->

### modulating and normalizing dopamine release.

<!-- chunk -->

### Adding uridine monophosphate to your nootropic stack helps:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reduce general cognitive decline

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increase free phosphatidylcholine (PC)

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increase acetylcholine in your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increase receptor (neurogenesis), and synapse (synaptogenesis)

<!-- chunk -->

### densities

<!-- chunk -->

### •Improve cellular phospholipid membrane health

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boost learning and memory

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Uridine Monophosphate feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report the effects of uridine monophosphate (UMP)

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation is most pronounced when stacked with DHA or Omega-

<!-- chunk -->

### 3’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### UMP elevates mood and relieves depression. Feelings of “well-being’ are

<!-- chunk -->

### enhanced. And verbal fluidity, memory and focus are all noticed at doses

<!-- chunk -->

### as low as 150 mg of UMP.

<!-- chunk -->

### Those dealing with ADHD report that uridine monophosphate increases

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition without causing anxiety or mood changes. This is backed up by

<!-- chunk -->

### science that shows uridine reduces the side effects associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### medication that effects dopamine and GABA neurotransmission.1199

<!-- chunk -->

### Others report that uridine monophosphate helps bring clarity of thought,

<!-- chunk -->

### resolving problems is faster and easier, math is easier, and making

<!-- chunk -->

### decisions from a clear emotional state simplifies life.

<!-- chunk -->

### The common thread through most reviews on uridine monophosphate is

<!-- chunk -->

### greater success when stacking UMP with a choline like Alpha GPC and

<!-- chunk -->

### Omega-3’s. This synergy is backed up by multiple clinical trials.


<!-- chunk -->

### We have plenty of research on uridine monophosphate. But most of the

<!-- chunk -->

### studies and trials have been done using animals. Likely because uridine is

<!-- chunk -->

### naturally found in every cell of the human body. It’s a key element in a

<!-- chunk -->

### chain of four molecules that make up the RNA chain.

<!-- chunk -->

### And since uridine is a natural element, it cannot be patented. So very little

<!-- chunk -->

### money can be made by the large pharmaceutical companies since UMP

<!-- chunk -->

### can’t be sold as a “drug”.

<!-- chunk -->

### The clinical evidence that we do have for uridine monophosphate strongly

<!-- chunk -->

### suggests that it is a powerful and useful nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

## Uridine Monophosphate Boosts Intelligence

<!-- chunk -->

### Consumption of certain nutrients can influence brain function even if

<!-- chunk -->

### you’re not trying to “fix a problem”. We know that supplemental DHA

<!-- chunk -->

### (Omega-3) can improve cognition in humans. DHA makes up 60% of your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain and is most prominent in the phospholipid membrane of each of your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Adding DHA to your nootropic stack has also been shown to increase the

<!-- chunk -->

### density of dendritic spines in the hippocampus which enhances synaptic

<!-- chunk -->

### transmission.1200

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers have found that supplemental Uridine Monophosphate (UMP)

<!-- chunk -->

### also promotes synthesis of synaptic phosphatides. But scientists found that

<!-- chunk -->

### taking DHA with UMP has an even greater effect on synthesis of synaptic

<!-- chunk -->

### phosphatides. Greater than taking each nootropic on its own.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists also found that combining DHA with UMP and choline amplifies

<!-- chunk -->

### increases in dendritic density in the hippocampus.

<!-- chunk -->

### In one very detailed study with gerbils, researchers found that the

<!-- chunk -->

## combination of DHA, UMP and choline significantly increased learning

<!-- chunk -->

## and memory in the young animals.1201

<!-- chunk -->

### Gerald Weissmann, MD, Editor-in-Chief of The FASEB Journal said of

<!-- chunk -->

### this study, “Now that we know how to make gerbils smarter, it’s not too far

<!-- chunk -->

### a stretch to hope that people’s intelligence can also be improved. Quite

<!-- chunk -->

### frankly, this can’t happen soon enough, as every environmentalist,

<!-- chunk -->

### advocate of evolution and war opponent will attest.”

<!-- chunk -->

### The synergy of these three nootropics (DHA, UMP and choline) in

<!-- chunk -->

### boosting learning and memory are powerful motivation for any

<!-- chunk -->

### neurohacker to add these supplements to their stack.

<!-- chunk -->

## Uridine Monophosphate Fights Depression

<!-- chunk -->

### Research has confirmed the antidepressant effects of omega-3 fatty acids.

<!-- chunk -->

### Associate Professor of Psychiatry William A. Carlezon Jr. of Harvard also

<!-- chunk -->

## found that uridine, a compound found in sugar beets and molasses, has

<!-- chunk -->

### similar effects. And when both Omega-3 and uridine were used in

<!-- chunk -->

### combination, there were found to be effective at lower doses of each.

<!-- chunk -->

### Professor Carlezon speculated that the antidepressant effects of Omega-3

<!-- chunk -->

### and uridine were caused by affecting fats in the brain. Making membranes

<!-- chunk -->

### more resilient eased the flow of neurotransmitters.

<!-- chunk -->

### An imbalance of neurotransmitters is thought to be a cause of depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### To test this theory, the Professor and his colleagues put rats through a 15-

<!-- chunk -->

### minute swim test during which the animals eventually stopped trying to

<!-- chunk -->

### climb out of the water tank and became largely immobile. Just enough to

<!-- chunk -->

### keep their heads above water.

<!-- chunk -->

### After the test, the rats were dried off with a towel, placed in a warm

<!-- chunk -->

### enclosure for 30 minutes and then returned to their cages. The next day,

<!-- chunk -->

### rats were retested for 5 minutes each. And the rats that hadn’t received

<!-- chunk -->

### enough omega-3’s or uridine became motionless much more quickly.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers equate the onset of immobility in rats to depression in

<!-- chunk -->

### humans. The animals that received either Omega-3 or uridine, or lower

<!-- chunk -->

### doses of both, continued to swim around.

<!-- chunk -->

### Professor Carlezon said of the study, “They seem to be protected from the

<!-- chunk -->

### ability of stress to cause depression”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Adding Omega-3’s or uridine monophosphate to your stack can help you

<!-- chunk -->

### avoid depression. For an even more pronounced antidepressant effect,

<!-- chunk -->

### combine Omega-3’s with uridine monophosphate, but at lower doses of

<!-- chunk -->

### each.1202

<!-- chunk -->

## Uridine Monophosphate May Help Prevent Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s researchers agree that cognitive decline seen in Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### patients is caused by loss of brain synapses. Researchers at MIT had a

<!-- chunk -->

### theory that restoring some of these synapses could provide an effective

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment for Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### An MIT team reported in Brain Research that rodents given a cocktail of

<!-- chunk -->

### DHA (Omega-3), uridine and choline showed a greatly increased

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration of dendritic spines. These dendritic spines receive messages

<!-- chunk -->

### in postsynaptic neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### The head of the research team Professor Richard Wurtman said of the

<!-- chunk -->

### study that synapse regeneration had occurred. To Alzheimer’s researchers,

<!-- chunk -->

### this synapse regeneration was very unusual and came as a surprise.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, some of the rats received all three compounds (Omega-3,

<!-- chunk -->

### uridine, and choline), and some received only one. The improvements in

<!-- chunk -->

### synapse growth and cognitive ability were greatest in the rats given all

<!-- chunk -->

### three.1203

<!-- chunk -->

### Other research ongoing for at least the last 10 years shows that early

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment using “diet” could significantly slow the progression of


<!-- chunk -->

### The research suggests that supplementing with Omega-3’s, uridine

<!-- chunk -->

### monophosphate and choline may help you avoid Alzheimer’s altogether.

<!-- chunk -->

### Published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, a study from the

<!-- chunk -->

### University of Eastern Finland and conducted throughout Europe proved

<!-- chunk -->

### you could reduce dementia risk. And reduce amyloid accumulation in

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s mouse models.

<!-- chunk -->

### The results of this study showed that even slight changes in the

<!-- chunk -->

### composition of the diet may, under a sufficiently long period of time and

<!-- chunk -->

### at an early stage of the disease, lead to significant changes in brain

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism and improved memory performance.1204

<!-- chunk -->

### The supplements used in this study included uridine-monophosphate,

<!-- chunk -->

### phospholipids, B-vitamins, and antioxidants. This combination has been

<!-- chunk -->

### put into a new supplement called “Souvenaid” which is undergoing

<!-- chunk -->

### clinical trials in Europe and the United States.


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dosage of Uridine Monophosphate (UMP) for nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### benefit is 150 - 250 mg per day twice per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend taking UMP with a good multivitamin that includes the B-

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin group and a broad range of trace minerals including magnesium.

<!-- chunk -->

### For best results stack UMP with Omega-3’s that include at least 700 mg of

<!-- chunk -->

### DHA and 300 mg of EPA.

<!-- chunk -->

### Introduce a good choline source after a couple of weeks of supplementing

<!-- chunk -->

### with uridine monophosphate. Start with 50 mg of Alpha GPC or CDP

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline. And increase your dose depending on response to 300 mg.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you find that choline supplementation increases depression, stop using

<!-- chunk -->

### choline and try using ALCAR as an alternative.

<!-- chunk -->

### Everyone’s body chemistry is different. To find the optimal dose of uridine

<!-- chunk -->

### monophosphate for you will take patience and some experimentation. Too

<!-- chunk -->

### little UMP and you won’t see any benefit for a long time. Too much

<!-- chunk -->

### uridine and you’ll feel emotionally dull and/or overly focused.


<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine is produced naturally in your body. So is considered well-tolerated

<!-- chunk -->

### and safe. Taking uridine monophosphate with food may help avoid any

<!-- chunk -->

### side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report only minor side effects like a decrease in emotions

<!-- chunk -->

### (feeling like a robot). But this has only been noted at very high doses of

<!-- chunk -->

### uridine monophosphate.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you do not respond well to B-Vitamins or SAM-e, you may not enjoy

<!-- chunk -->

### the benefits of UMP. Especially if you have problems with methylation.


<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine Monophosphate (UMP) is available in capsule and powder form.

<!-- chunk -->

### UMP is water soluble and can be taken sublingually.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sublingual doses are reported to be up to 7 – 10-times the equivalent dose

<!-- chunk -->

### compared to taking UMP orally.

<!-- chunk -->

### Triacetyluridine (TAU) comes in capsules and is fat soluble. TAU is up to

<!-- chunk -->

### -7-times stronger when taken orally compared to UMP.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report that UMP is more effective, and a better value that

<!-- chunk -->

### TAU.


<!-- chunk -->

## Uridine Monophosphate 150 - 250 mg twice per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Uridine Monophosphate (UMP) as a nootropic


<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does make some uridine on its own. And you get uridine from

<!-- chunk -->

### the food you eat. But research has shown that your body does not retain

<!-- chunk -->

### enough of a usable form of uridine for cognitive benefit.

<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine Monophosphate is critical for the formation of RNA (ribonucleic

<!-- chunk -->

### acid). The main messenger molecule needed to transfer DNA’s blueprints

<!-- chunk -->

### for protein synthesis.

<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine is a precursor in the synthesis of CDP Choline. Which is a

<!-- chunk -->

### precursor to the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC). PC is required for

<!-- chunk -->

### the synthesis of acetylcholine (ACh).

<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine enhances the release of the feel-good neurotransmitter dopamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### And uridine enhances the growth of neurons and synapses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Uridine Monophosphate is especially helpful if you’re dealing with stress

<!-- chunk -->

### or depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest a dose of 150 - 250 mg of UMP twice daily. It takes a while to

<!-- chunk -->

### feel the effects of uridine monophosphate. But you can amplify the effects

<!-- chunk -->

### of UMP by stacking it with 300 mg of Alpha GPC or CDP Choline and

<!-- chunk -->

### 700-1,000 mg of DHA (Omega-3).

<!-- chunk -->

### Do not push it by taking much more than the recommended dose of UMP.

<!-- chunk -->

### You may experience unwanted side effects.


# Valerian

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian is known for its anti-anxiety and calming effects and promoting

<!-- chunk -->

### restful sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

## Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) is an herb native to Europe and northern

<!-- chunk -->

### Asia. And is now grown in England, Holland, and the USA for nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement manufacturers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Valeriana officinalis belongs to the Valerianaceae family of plants which

<!-- chunk -->

### includes as many as 250 different types. Many are referred to as

<!-- chunk -->

### “Valerian”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Valeriana officinalis is the species used in Europe and the USA. Valerian

<!-- chunk -->

### edulis is used in Mexico and Valerian wallichii is used in India. V. edulis

<!-- chunk -->

### contains substantially higher concentrations of valepotriates (up to 8%).

<!-- chunk -->

### Here we are investigating the nootropic benefits of the most widely used

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian supplement in the West; Valeriana officinalis.1205 The medicinal

<!-- chunk -->

### part of the plant used in nootropic supplements is the root or rhizome.

<!-- chunk -->

### The sedative effects of Valerian were first mentioned by Hippocrates

<!-- chunk -->

### several thousand years ago. And have since been confirmed in clinical

<!-- chunk -->

### trials by modern medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian likely got its name from the Latin word valere meaning to be

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy or strong.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Greek physician Galen used Valerian for treating epilepsy and

<!-- chunk -->

### insomnia. It’s modern usage likely got its start in 1567 by Italian

<!-- chunk -->

### nobleman Fabio Colonna, who suffered from epilepsy. He found Galen’s

<!-- chunk -->

### reference and claimed it completely restored his health.1206

<!-- chunk -->

### Valeriana officinalis contains over 150 compounds. But those identified of

<!-- chunk -->

### clinical importance are valepotriates, and their breakdown products

<!-- chunk -->

### baldrinals, valerenic acid, Valerenal, and valeranone.1207

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian also contains the amino acids arginine, GABA, tyrosine, and

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, Valerian is used primarily to lower stress and promote a

<!-- chunk -->

### good night’s sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Valerian work in the brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## Valerian boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Valerian improves sleep. Valerian is the most commonly used

<!-- chunk -->

### herbal nootropic to induce sleep in the USA and Europe. Research

<!-- chunk -->

### continues to establish accurately why this supplement works to help

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### But so far, science has determined that the compounds valerenic acid and

<!-- chunk -->

### bornyl acetate found in Valerian account for its sleep-inducing qualities.

<!-- chunk -->

### These compounds inhibit the breakdown of GABA in the brain resulting in

<!-- chunk -->

### sedation. And the aqueous extracts (water-based) of Valerian roots contain

<!-- chunk -->

### significant amounts of GABA which could directly cause sedation.1208

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at the University of California in San Francisco did a

<!-- chunk -->

### systematic review of all the sleep using Valerian studies they could find.

<!-- chunk -->

### To find out if Valerian really did improve sleep like everyone said it does.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team found 16 randomized, controlled trials totaling 1,093 patients

<!-- chunk -->

### that satisfied their criteria. Doses ranged from 225 to 1,215 mg of Valerian

<!-- chunk -->

### per day. Only 2 studies stated that the herb was standardized to a specific

<!-- chunk -->

### amount of valerenic acid.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the evidence overall was clear. Valerian is a more attractive option to

<!-- chunk -->

### other sleep agents because of the lack of a ‘hangover effect’ the next day.

<!-- chunk -->

### And overall, patients got to sleep faster and had better quality sleep.1209

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Valerian reduces stress. A natural alternative to benzodiazepines,

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian helps reduce anxiety. And helps you cope with stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter known to counterbalance

<!-- chunk -->

### the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. And research shows that often,

<!-- chunk -->

### those suffering from anxiety disorders are dealing with a dysfunctional

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA system.1210

<!-- chunk -->

### Of all the studies demonstrating Valerian’s ability to help control anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### and stress is best shown in the following study.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the most stressful and painful procedures in female medicine is

<!-- chunk -->

### hysterosalpingography. This procedure evaluates the uterine cavity and

<!-- chunk -->

### fallopian tubes and is typically performed on infertile women.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this study, 64 infertile women undergoing hysterosalpingography (HSG)

<!-- chunk -->

### were given a single dose of 1,500 mg Valeric capsules 90 minutes before

<!-- chunk -->

### starting the procedure. Valerenic acid is one of the active compounds

<!-- chunk -->

### found in Valerian.

<!-- chunk -->

### Anxiety severity was measured before and then again 90 minutes after the

<!-- chunk -->

### procedure. The researchers concluded that Valerenic acid (Valerian)

<!-- chunk -->

### significantly reduces anxiety in women undergoing HSG.1211


<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic stress, anxiety, poor blood flow and free radicals (oxidation) can

<!-- chunk -->

### damage your brain. And one of the ways this manifests is memory loss.

<!-- chunk -->

### It comes as no surprise that people with memory loss experience higher

<!-- chunk -->

### rates of anxiety and depression. As verified in one Australian research

<!-- chunk -->

### study.1212


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Toxins kill brain cells from the inside


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) declines

<!-- chunk -->

### Under conditions of chronic anxiety your brain loses the capacity to

<!-- chunk -->

### transmit signals between neurons efficiently. Memory, cognition, and

<!-- chunk -->

### decision-making all suffer as a result.

<!-- chunk -->

## Valerian benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian extract helps relieve anxiety. The valerenic acid and valerenol in

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian binds to GABA


<!-- chunk -->

### receptors which provides its anxiolytic effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### Like the prescription drugs Xanax and Valium but without the side effects

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with these pharmaceuticals.1213

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show that valerenic acid also modulates serotonin and

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine in the hippocampus and amygdala regions of your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Also providing an anti-anxiety effect.1214

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian helps reduce the time it takes you to fall asleep. And provides a

<!-- chunk -->

### better night’s sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### One Swedish study showed Valerian provided ‘perfect’ sleep for 49% of

<!-- chunk -->

### the people in the study. And 89% reported ‘improved’ sleep while using

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian.1215

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian seems to cause sedation by increasing GABA levels in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian provides GABA as one of its natural compounds, prevents

<!-- chunk -->

### reuptake of GABA in neurons, and inhibits the enzyme that naturally

<!-- chunk -->

### degrades GABA in your brain.1216

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian helps ease menstrual cramps in women which naturally provides

<!-- chunk -->

### an anti-anxiety effect.1217

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian helps reduce hyperactivity in those dealing with ADHD.1218

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian reduces symptom severity in those with restless leg syndrome.

<!-- chunk -->

### And improves sleep quality.1219

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian extract has been used for years in Iran to treat epilepsy. One

<!-- chunk -->

### study in rats showed that Valerian (aqueous) extract provides this

<!-- chunk -->

### anticonvulsant effect by acting on adenosine receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

### Note however that petroleum ether-based extract of Valerian did NOT

<!-- chunk -->

### provide this benefit in epilepsy.1220

<!-- chunk -->

### So, make sure that if you are buying a Valerian extract for epilepsy that

<!-- chunk -->

### you know exactly what type of extract the manufacturer is using. And that

<!-- chunk -->

### is it NOT petroleum-ether based.

<!-- chunk -->

### And Valerian also helps reduce the symptoms of OCD.1221

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Valerian feel?

<!-- chunk -->

## The effects of supplementing with Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) can

<!-- chunk -->

### help tame anxiety and help you sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian for sleep doesn’t act like prescription sleeping aids which make

<!-- chunk -->

### you feel you can’t stay awake. Instead, Valerian before bed helps your

<!-- chunk -->

### body and brain relax and allows you to drift off to sleep naturally.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some report experiencing vivid dreams when they take Valerian extract

<!-- chunk -->

### before bed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report that Valerian extract is better than Valium® or Xanax®

<!-- chunk -->

### for combating stress without the side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are dealing with ADHD, you may find that adding Valerian to your

<!-- chunk -->

### stack will help calm you. And turn off your mind enough so you can get

<!-- chunk -->

### some rest.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report that Valerian helps tame the symptoms of Restless

<!-- chunk -->

### Leg Syndrome. A few say it even helps calm the symptoms of Parkinson’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some say using Valerian helps eliminate migraines.

<!-- chunk -->

### Low dose Valerian may help alleviate social anxiety for some people.

<!-- chunk -->

## Valerian Clinical Research

<!-- chunk -->

## Valerian for sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian has been used to treat insomnia since ancient times. In an open

<!-- chunk -->

### label case with 11,168 patients, over 70% reported that Valerian was

<!-- chunk -->

### effective in helping them fall asleep, reduced sleep disturbances and

<!-- chunk -->

### decreased restlessness and tension.1222

<!-- chunk -->

### If you live in a noisy environment and it’s affecting your sleep, you’ll like

<!-- chunk -->

### this one. A study conducted in Germany with a stack containing Valerian

<!-- chunk -->

### and hops reduced sleep disturbances caused by noise in a high-traffic

<!-- chunk -->

### area. This combo increased slow-wave and REM sleep.1223

<!-- chunk -->

## Valerian helps ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### Hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention are symptoms of ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### Symptoms that can often be attributed to low levels of GABA in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### A 3-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study was conducted to

<!-- chunk -->

### determine the efficacy of Valeriana officinalis tincture (MT) on ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### children between the ages of 5 and 11 years, pre-diagnosed with ADHD,

<!-- chunk -->

### were recruited.

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian tincture or placebo was given to the kids 3-times per day for

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study found a statistically significant improvement in the kids’

<!-- chunk -->

### behavior with particular reference to sustained attention, anxiety and

<!-- chunk -->

### impulsivity and/or hyperactivity.1224

<!-- chunk -->

## Valerian for OCD

<!-- chunk -->

### 31 outpatients diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

<!-- chunk -->

### were recruited to participate in a double-blind, randomized trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### Patients were randomly assigned a capsule of Valerian extract (765 mg)

<!-- chunk -->

### once per day or a placebo for 8 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study showed a significant difference between the Valerian and

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo group by the end of the treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that Valerian extract has “anti-obsessive and

<!-- chunk -->

### compulsive effects” in patients with OCD.1225

<!-- chunk -->

## Valerian for stress reduction

<!-- chunk -->

### During World War 1, Valerian was used to prevent and treat shell shock in

<!-- chunk -->

### front-line troops. And was used during World War 11 to help calm the

<!-- chunk -->

### residents of London during air bombing raids.1226

<!-- chunk -->

### More recently, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 24 healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### volunteers received 3 separate doses (600 mg, 1200 mg, 1800 mg) of a

<!-- chunk -->

### standardized product containing Lemon Balm and Valerian officinalis

<!-- chunk -->

### extracts, plus a placebo, on separate days separated by a 7 day wash out

<!-- chunk -->

### period.

<!-- chunk -->

### The results showed the 600 mg dose of this stack reduced anxiety. But the

<!-- chunk -->

### highest dose did not work as well as the lower dose stack.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team concluded that the combination of Lemon Balm and

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian extract possessed anxiolytic properties.1227

<!-- chunk -->

## Valerian Recommended Dosage

<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended Valerian nootropic dosage for:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Stress reduction – 200 – 600 mg Valerian extract (aqueous,

<!-- chunk -->

### standardized to contain 0.8% valerenic or valeric acid)

<!-- chunk -->

### oValerian tea – 1.5 – 3 grams Valerian root steeped in boiling

<!-- chunk -->

### water

<!-- chunk -->

### •Insomnia – 300 – 900 mg of Valerian extract (aqueous, standardized

<!-- chunk -->

### to contain 0.8% valerenic or valeric acid) 60 – 90 minutes before

<!-- chunk -->

### bed

<!-- chunk -->

### oValerian tea – 1.5 – 3 grams Valerian root steeped in

<!-- chunk -->

### mg boiling water taken 60 –90 minutes before bed

<!-- chunk -->

### oLemon balm – 120 mg Valerian extract with 80 mg lemon

<!-- chunk -->

### balm extract 60 – 90 minutes before bed

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show it may take a week or two of continuous daily usage before

<!-- chunk -->

### you’ll experience the full effects of using Valerian.

<!-- chunk -->

### Higher dosages of Valerian extract should be taken in smaller amounts 2 –

<!-- chunk -->

### 3 times per day. For example, 600 mg Valerian daily would be 3 doses of

<!-- chunk -->

### 200 mg each.

<!-- chunk -->

## Valerian Side Effects

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian is well-tolerated and safe for most people. But side effects can

<!-- chunk -->

### occur and include headaches, dry mouth, excitability, uneasiness, heart

<!-- chunk -->

### palpitations, stomach upset and even insomnia in some people.

<!-- chunk -->

### Although it’s rare, some report feelings of sluggishness the next morning.

<!-- chunk -->

### A few have reported vivid dreams when using Valerian. If you are prone to

<!-- chunk -->

### nightmares, Valerian may cause you to dream more and have more

<!-- chunk -->

### nightmares.

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian root smells particularly nasty and is offensive to most people. If

<!-- chunk -->

### you can’t stand the smell, make sure you get this supplement in capsule

<!-- chunk -->

### form.

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian can interact with and should not used while on prescription

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants and benzodiazepines.

<!-- chunk -->

## Type of Valerian to buy

<!-- chunk -->

### The dried root or rhizome of Valerian officinalis is primarily used for its

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic benefits.

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian root is available in capsules, tablets, liquid extracts and as a tea.

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian officinalis extract is available in capsules, tablets and powder

<!-- chunk -->

### form.

<!-- chunk -->

### The pharmacopeia name for Valerian root is Valerianae radix.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows that there can be considerable differences in Valerian

<!-- chunk -->

### content including essential oil, valerenic acid and derivatives, and

<!-- chunk -->

### valepotriates depending on where the Valerian is grown and when it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### harvested.1228

<!-- chunk -->

### Adulteration of Valerian supplements is a problem world-wide with

<!-- chunk -->

### unscrupulous manufacturers substituting other species of plants. Including

<!-- chunk -->

### from the Valerian species but not officinalis.

<!-- chunk -->

### So make sure you choose a trustworthy manufacturer who clearly tests

<!-- chunk -->

### their product. And tests every single batch that comes in to their facility

<!-- chunk -->

### and has a 3rd party test the product after encapsulation and before the

<!-- chunk -->

### product is offered for sale.


<!-- chunk -->

## Valerian 200 – 600 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Valerian as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Valerian on its own. So you must take it as a


<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian is especially helpful for those suffering from anxiety, chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### stress, and insomnia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian is reported to work well for those dealing with Obsessive

<!-- chunk -->

### Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Taming racing thoughts, and helpful in

<!-- chunk -->

### dealing with stressful situations.

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian is also helpful for those suffering from the hyperactivity

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely take up to 900 mg of Valerian daily if needed. One dose

<!-- chunk -->

### first thing in the morning. One dose early afternoon. And the last dose in

<!-- chunk -->

### the evening.

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian as a sleep aid seems to be particularly effective when stacked

<!-- chunk -->

### with Lemon Balm. The two work in synergy to help promote sleep. But

<!-- chunk -->

### when combined, use lower doses of each.


# Vinpocetine

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine is known for increasing cerebral circulation, taming

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation and oxidative stress, and boosting alertness, cognition,

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration, memory and mood

<!-- chunk -->

## Vinpocetine (periwinkle extract, ethyl apovincaminate, Cavinton,

<!-- chunk -->

## Bravinton, Ceractin, Intelectol) is a semi-synthetic derivative of

<!-- chunk -->

### vincamine, an alkaloid derived from the lesser periwinkle plant (Vinca

<!-- chunk -->

### Minor L.).

<!-- chunk -->

### A flowering plant native to central and southern Europe and Turkey, Vinca

<!-- chunk -->

### Minor is also grown as ground cover in the United States.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine was first isolated from the periwinkle plant in 1975 by

<!-- chunk -->

### chemist Csaba Szántay. Hungarian pharmaceutical company Gedeon

<!-- chunk -->

### Richter began manufacturing Vinpocetine in 1978. Vinpocetine continues

<!-- chunk -->

### to be one of the company’s top selling drugs world-wide.1229

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine is used as a prescription drug in Japan, Europe, Mexico and

<!-- chunk -->

### Russia for the treatment of cognitive and cerebrovascular disorders. In the

<!-- chunk -->

### USA and Canada, Vinpocetine is sold as an OTC dietary supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other uses include using Vinpocetine for the prevention of motion

<!-- chunk -->

### sickness, menopause symptoms, chronic fatigue syndrome, seizure

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, hearing and eye disorders, and even as a topical application to

<!-- chunk -->

### increase female sexual response.1230

<!-- chunk -->

### Since it was first released in 1978, Vinpocetine has earned a well-deserved

<!-- chunk -->

### reputation with the nootropics community for optimizing cognitive health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Primarily by boosting cerebral blood flow.

<!-- chunk -->

### But to understand how and why Vinpocetine boosts cognition and protects

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain, we need to dive in to how blood flows in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### An optimized adult brain gets about 1/7th of your heart’s output of blood

<!-- chunk -->

### every minute. Your brain needs this blood flow for a constant supply of

<!-- chunk -->

### glucose, oxygen and other nutrients to keep it functioning properly.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unlike other organs and muscles in your body, your brain cannot stand an

<!-- chunk -->

### interruption in this steady flow of blood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Two carotid arteries in the sides of your neck send blood to the front and

<!-- chunk -->

### top of your brain. Arteries in your vertebrae (spine) join with your carotid

<!-- chunk -->

## arteries at the base of your brain to form the Circle of Willis.1231

<!-- chunk -->

### The Circle of Willis is critical because it is the only area of your body

<!-- chunk -->

### where all four major blood vessels join. Allowing blood to be sent to areas

<!-- chunk -->

### where it is needed. Even if one of the major blood vessels becomes

<!-- chunk -->

### blocked.

<!-- chunk -->

### We’ll take a look at “How things go bad” later in this chapter. The good

<!-- chunk -->

### news is that Vinpocetine can have a profound effect on maintaining and

<!-- chunk -->

### repairing your brain’s blood vessels, cerebral blood flowing through the

<!-- chunk -->

### Circle of Willis, and to individual brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine not only helps increase cerebral blood flow, it also works as a

<!-- chunk -->

### powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### And Vinpocetine inhibits the enzyme PDE1 which can increase cAMP and

<!-- chunk -->

### cGMP levels. These cyclic nucleotides in turn activate a series of kinases

<!-- chunk -->

### that phosphorylate the transcription factors cAMP response element

<!-- chunk -->

### binding protein (CREB) and serum response factor (SRF), leading to the

<!-- chunk -->

### expression of plasticity-related genes.1232 Boosting neuroplasticity

<!-- chunk -->

### enhances cognition and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Vinpocetine work in the Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## Vinpocetine boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Vinpocetine boosts cerebral circulation. Your brain only accounts

<!-- chunk -->

### for about 2% of your bodyweight, but it consumes about 20% of the

<!-- chunk -->

### oxygen and nutrients circulating in your blood.1233 This is why

<!-- chunk -->

### strong, healthy cerebral blood flow is so critical to your brain health

<!-- chunk -->

### and cognitive performance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine inhibits an enzyme called PDE1 (phosphodiesterase type 1)

<!-- chunk -->

### while reducing calcium levels in brain cells. When both of these are

<!-- chunk -->

### elevated, the smooth muscle in blood vessels contract, narrowing the

<!-- chunk -->

### diameter of blood vessels. And restricting blood flow to that area of the


<!-- chunk -->

### You may be familiar with PDE5 inhibitors like Viagra® which work to

<!-- chunk -->

### dilate blood vessels and maintain healthy blood flow to your penis.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine has a similar mechanism of action in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### In two separate clinical studies, chronic ischemic post-stroke patients were

<!-- chunk -->

### treated with either a single infusion, or daily infusion of Vinpocetine for

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine increased cerebral glucose uptake and glucose metabolism in

<!-- chunk -->

### both the stroke region of the patient’s brains as well as the intact brain

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue.

<!-- chunk -->

### Patients in the 2-week long treatment also showed increased cerebral

<!-- chunk -->

### blood flow especially in the thalamus, basal ganglia and visual cortex

<!-- chunk -->

### regions of the brain.1234

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Vinpocetine is an anti-inflammatory. Vinpocetine prevents the

<!-- chunk -->

### upregulation of NFκB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of

<!-- chunk -->

### activated B cells) by TNFα (tumor necrosis factor alpha).

<!-- chunk -->

### This sounds a little complicated but has serious implications in the

<!-- chunk -->

### development of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s Disease. Here’s how it

<!-- chunk -->

### works…

<!-- chunk -->

### NFκB is a protein complex that controls transcription of DNA, cytokine

<!-- chunk -->

### production (signaling protein) and cell survival. TNFα is a signaling

<!-- chunk -->

### protein (cytokine) involved in inflammation produced by neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine inhibits this action.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine also reduces the TNFα-induced expression of the mRNA of

<!-- chunk -->

### pro-inflammatory molecules such as interleukin-1β, monocyte

<!-- chunk -->

### chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1

<!-- chunk -->

### (VCAM-1).

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers have found that Vinpocetine prevents this inflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

### response at the cellular nucleus level. And this mechanism of action is

<!-- chunk -->

### independent of Vinpocetine’s action on PDE1.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is a very big deal because TNFα contributes to the neuronal cell death

<!-- chunk -->

### found in Parkinson’s Disease. And there is growing evidence that the

<!-- chunk -->

### accumulation of amyloid-β protein leads to an up-regulation of

<!-- chunk -->

### interleukins and TNFα that contributes to neurodegeneration leading to


<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists are now working on trying to determine if Vinpocetine can

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce inflammation in the brain. And help protect the brain from

<!-- chunk -->

### developing Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s.1235


<!-- chunk -->

### Poor cerebral blood flow, inflammation and free radicals (oxidation) can

<!-- chunk -->

### damage your brain. And one of the ways this manifests is memory loss.

<!-- chunk -->

### Left unchecked, it can develop into serious neurodegenerative diseases

<!-- chunk -->

### like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Cognitive function declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Inflammation kills brain cells from the inside


<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Anxiety, depression and moodiness increase

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Concentration and memory declines

<!-- chunk -->

### Poor cerebral circulation causes a domino effect in the brain affecting

<!-- chunk -->

### many critical processes. Memory, cognition, and decision-making all

<!-- chunk -->

### suffer as a result.

<!-- chunk -->

## Vinpocetine benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine is one of the most researched nootropics on the planet. It was

<!-- chunk -->

### introduced to clinical practice in Hungary in 1978 for the treatment of

<!-- chunk -->

### cerebrovascular (brain blood flow) disorders and related symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Since then Vinpocetine has become a “reference compound” in

<!-- chunk -->

### pharmacological research of cognitive deficits caused by hypoxia (oxygen

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency), ischemia (inadequate blood supply) and research into cyclic

<!-- chunk -->

### nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP).

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine’s mechanism of action in the brain includes:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increasing brain blood circulation and oxygen utilization

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increased tolerance for hypoxia and ischemia

<!-- chunk -->

### •Anticonvulsant activity

<!-- chunk -->

### •Inhibiting the PDE1 enzyme

<!-- chunk -->

### •Increasing the pliability of red blood cells

<!-- chunk -->

### •Inhibiting the aggregation of platelets (blood clots)1236

<!-- chunk -->

### Hundreds of studies in animals and humans have shown Vinpocetine can

<!-- chunk -->

### repair and reverse the effects of damage caused by strokes. Vinpocetine

<!-- chunk -->

### can prevent the inflammation and damage by free radicals that can lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine can improve glucose and oxygen supply to critical brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### through increased blood flow. Improving cognition, concentration, mental

<!-- chunk -->

### agility, anxiety, depression and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Vinpocetine feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### You should be able to feel the effects of Vinpocetine within an hour of

<!-- chunk -->

### taking it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report that Vinpocetine reduces brain fog and mental

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue. Most experience improved focus, memory and even an improved

<!-- chunk -->

### sense of well-being.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine’s effect on short-, working- and long-term memory can be

<!-- chunk -->

### profound. Remembering names, numbers and life events becomes easier.

<!-- chunk -->

### At work or in school, Vinpocetine can assist in learning and helping your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain commit it to memory. You should feel a significant difference in

<!-- chunk -->

### your ability to focus at work.

<!-- chunk -->

### Like any nootropic, Vinpocetine is not going to turn back the clock 30 or

<!-- chunk -->

### 40 years. But it will help to keep your brain functioning more smoothly.


<!-- chunk -->

## Vinpocetine Improves Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### 12 healthy female volunteers were treated with 40 mg Vinpocetine 3-times

<!-- chunk -->

### per day, or a placebo, for 2 days in this randomized double-blind crossover

<!-- chunk -->

### study.

<!-- chunk -->

### On day 3 of the study, and one hour following morning dosage of

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine, the women completed a battery of psychological tests. The

<!-- chunk -->

### study found that those who used Vinpocetine had a significant

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement in memory when compared to placebo.1237

<!-- chunk -->

## Vinpocetine Repairs Long-Term Potentiation

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have been having problems with long-term memory lately, this

<!-- chunk -->

### study is for you.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers produced a “medial septal lesion” on rats in the lab. The

<!-- chunk -->

### medial nuclei are an area of the brain composed of medium-size neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### These neurons receive signals from different areas of your brain including

<!-- chunk -->

### your hippocampus.

<!-- chunk -->

### A lesion cuts off communication with an important memory-formation

<!-- chunk -->

### area of your brain. The effect of a lesion in this study was on hippocampus

<!-- chunk -->

### function and the long-term potentiation pathway.

<!-- chunk -->

### The scientists found that damage in this area of the brain negatively

<!-- chunk -->

### affects long-term potentiation. The rats were then given either

<!-- chunk -->

### physostigmine, piracetam, Vinpocetine or Hydergine one hour after the

<!-- chunk -->

### lesion. And once-a-day for 6 days after the operation.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study found that all of the drugs used in this study produced complete

<!-- chunk -->

### restoration of long-term potentiation. And shows that Vinpocetine is one of

<!-- chunk -->

### the most effective and least expensive ways to restore long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### potentiation and long-term memory formation.1238

<!-- chunk -->

## Vinpocetine Enhances Cognitive Performance

<!-- chunk -->

### A placebo-controlled, randomized double-blind trial was conducted at the

<!-- chunk -->

### University of Surrey with 203 dementia patients using Vinpocetine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Patients received either 10 mg of Vinpocetine 3-times per day, 20 mg of

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine 3-times per day or a placebo 3-times per day for 16 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The patients were assessed on cognitive performance and measure of

<!-- chunk -->

### quality of life, including depression. The subjects using Vinpocetine

<!-- chunk -->

### experienced a significantly improved cognitive performance score

<!-- chunk -->

### compared to placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study concluded that Vinpocetine was useful in the management of

<!-- chunk -->

### patients with symptoms of dementia. And there was no statistical

<!-- chunk -->

### difference in cognitive scores with 10 mg or 20 mg of Vinpocetine.1239


<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine has a reputation among neurohackers and in clinical trials for

<!-- chunk -->

### safety at recommended doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### The recommended dosage for Vinpocetine is 10 mg taken 3-times per day

<!-- chunk -->

### with food. Vinpocetine seems to be more effective when taken with a meal

<!-- chunk -->

### or high quality fat like coconut or olive oil.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely dose up to 60 mg of Vinpocetine per day total. But clinical

<!-- chunk -->

### trials and user experience nearly always report that higher doses provide

<!-- chunk -->

### no added benefit.


<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine is well-tolerated and safe for use by most people. But if

<!-- chunk -->

### you’re particularly sensitive to supplements and drugs, try a starting dose

<!-- chunk -->

### of 5 mg of Vinpocetine and see how your body reacts.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re dealing with low blood pressure you should avoid using

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine. This nootropic affects blood flow not only in your brain, but

<!-- chunk -->

### through your entire system. If you take Vinpocetine and feel light-headed

<!-- chunk -->

### or dizzy it could be a sign your blood pressure is low.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine affects clotting factors in your blood. And may decrease red

<!-- chunk -->

### blood cell platelet aggregation. So if you are using blood thinners or high

<!-- chunk -->

### doses of aspirin you should avoid Vinpocetine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Stop taking Vinpocetine at least 2 weeks before surgery because of its

<!-- chunk -->

### effect on blood thinning and flow.


<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine usually comes in 5, 10 or 20 mg tablets.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine is available as an OTC supplement in the United States and

<!-- chunk -->

### Canada. Many countries around the world require a prescription to

<!-- chunk -->

### purchase Vinpocetine.


<!-- chunk -->

## Vinpocetine 10 mg 3-times per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Vinpocetine as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not make Vinpocetine on its own. So you must take it as a


<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and is available within

<!-- chunk -->

### an hour of taking it. Vinpocetine works more effectively if taken with

<!-- chunk -->

### food.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine is especially helpful for those suffering from brain fog and

<!-- chunk -->

### memory loss. Vinpocetine helps increase cerebral blood flow bringing

<!-- chunk -->

### more oxygen and nutrients to brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine is helpful for those dealing with stroke recovery. This

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic helps restore blood flow to damaged areas of the brain affected

<!-- chunk -->

### by stroke. And helps prevent damage caused by the increase in free

<!-- chunk -->

### radicals typically released during stroke recovery.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine is also helpful for those suffering from Alzheimer’s. It has

<!-- chunk -->

### been shown to boost blood flow to areas of the brain affected by amyloid-β

<!-- chunk -->

### protein aggregation. Vinpocetine helps tame inflammation associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### the disease. And studies are now underway to determine if Vinpocetine can

<!-- chunk -->

### prevent Alzheimer’s from taking hold in the first place.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely take up to 60 mg of Vinpocetine daily if needed. One dose

<!-- chunk -->

### first thing in the morning. One dose early afternoon. And the last dose in

<!-- chunk -->

### the evening.

<!-- chunk -->

### And for memory, Vinpocetine is great to stack with most of the racetams.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report good success stacking Vinpocetine with Gotu Kola.


# (Thiamine)


<!-- chunk -->

### is known as an effective mosquito repellant, boosts motivation,

<!-- chunk -->

### improves focus, enhances memory, alleviates chronic pain, depression and

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety


<!-- chunk -->

## (Thiamine) is the first B Vitamin to be discovered by

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers. “Thio-vitamine” refers to its sulfur-containing content. It’s

<!-- chunk -->

## called B


<!-- chunk -->

### because it was the first of the B complex vitamins to be

<!-- chunk -->

### identified.

<!-- chunk -->

### It was Kanehiro Takaki, surgeon general of the Japanese navy back in

<!-- chunk -->

### that figured something was amiss. Sailors were dying on his ships from a

<!-- chunk -->

### disease called Beriberi. And Takaki surmised it had something to do with

<!-- chunk -->

### sailors eating only white rice.

<!-- chunk -->

### It wasn’t until 1897 that Christiaan Eijkman, a military doctor in the

<!-- chunk -->

### Dutch East Indies figured out that the bran removed from white rice was

<!-- chunk -->

### causing problems. Something was missing in the diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 1911, Polish biochemist Casimir Funk isolated what he called a

<!-- chunk -->

### “vitamine” from rice bran. Dutch chemists went on to isolate and

<!-- chunk -->

### crystallize the active agent in 1926. US chemist Robert Williams

<!-- chunk -->

### determined the structure of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### . And synthesized it in 1936.1240

<!-- chunk -->

### In Japan, it was found that insufficient thiamine led to a central nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### system disorder called Beriberi. But supplementing with thiamine alone

<!-- chunk -->

### didn’t help because of its poor bioavailability. A lot of thiamine was

<!-- chunk -->

### needed to cure Beriberi symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### So Japanese scientists created a derivative of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### called

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulbutiamine in an attempt to quell the health crisis within the Japanese

<!-- chunk -->

### population.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine is far more bioavailable than standard thiamine. It is fat-

<!-- chunk -->

### soluble (thiamine is water-soluble) which helps it more easily cross the

<!-- chunk -->

### blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Advanced neurohackers add Sulbutiamine to their stack instead of standard


<!-- chunk -->

### (thiamine) because it’s better absorbed and used by your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### than B


<!-- chunk -->

### Thiamine is a coenzyme used by your body to metabolize food for energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### And to maintain proper heart, nerve, and brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thiamine also helps digest and extract energy from food. It helps turn

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the cellular fuel used

<!-- chunk -->

### by your cells and synthesized in your mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### And thiamine helps convert carbohydrates into glucose. The energy your

<!-- chunk -->

### body uses for your brain and nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

### One more thing about this miracle B-vitamin. Thiamine contributes to the

<!-- chunk -->

### development of myelin sheaths which wrap around neurons to protect

<!-- chunk -->

### them from damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does not produce thiamine on its own. So you must get it from

<!-- chunk -->

### food including beef, brewer’s yeast, legumes (beans, lentils), milk, nuts,

<!-- chunk -->

### oats, oranges, pork, rice, seeds, wheat, whole-grain cereals, and yeast.

<!-- chunk -->

## Thiamine vs. Sulbutiamine: What’s the Difference?

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine is a synthetic version of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (Thiamine). It is two B


<!-- chunk -->

### molecules chemically bonded together.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thiamine is water-soluble and does not easily cross the blood-brain

<!-- chunk -->

### barrier. Sulbutiamine is a fat-soluble compound that easily crosses the

<!-- chunk -->

### blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine functions in the body just like thiamine. But because it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### more bioavailable it’s more effective than thiamine.


<!-- chunk -->

## (Thiamine) work in the Brain?


<!-- chunk -->

### (Thiamine) boosts brain health and function in several ways.

<!-- chunk -->

### But two in particular stand out.

<!-- chunk -->

### 1.Thiamine increases levels of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). TPP is

<!-- chunk -->

### directly involved in the citric acid (KREB) cycle in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### This cycle breaks fatty acids, amino acids and monosaccharides into

<!-- chunk -->

### smaller molecules that produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) energy

<!-- chunk -->

### within your mitochondria. And provide the building blocks of the

<!-- chunk -->

### molecules needed to produce brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### A deficiency of TPP can eventually show up as Wernicke encephalopathy

<!-- chunk -->

### and Korsakoff syndrome. In our society this syndrome is typically caused

<!-- chunk -->

### by chronic alcoholism. But it can also occur after obesity (bariatric)

<!-- chunk -->

### surgery, Crohn’s disease, anorexia, diabetes, and if you’re on kidney

<!-- chunk -->

### dialysis.

<!-- chunk -->

## Symptoms of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome include confusion, inability

<!-- chunk -->

### to form memories, loss of memories and muscle coordination,

<!-- chunk -->

### confabulation (making up stories) and vision changes. And can ultimately

<!-- chunk -->

### (and very rapidly) lead to coma and death.1241

<!-- chunk -->

### Less severe cases of thiamine deficiency include fatigue, weight loss,

<!-- chunk -->

### irritability and confusion.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Thiamine also contributes to the production of the enzyme PDH

<!-- chunk -->

### which is essential for making the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### And for the synthesis of myelin, which forms a sheath around the

<!-- chunk -->

### axons of neurons. Ensuring these neurons can conduct signals.1242

<!-- chunk -->

### The citric acid (KREB) cycle and enzyme α–KGDH play a role in

<!-- chunk -->

### maintaining optimal levels of the neurotransmitters glutamate, and

<!-- chunk -->

### gamma–aminobutyric acid (GABA).

<!-- chunk -->

### When thiamine levels decrease, the activity of these enzymes are

<!-- chunk -->

### reduced.1243


<!-- chunk -->

### We depend on our diet for thiamine. Very little thiamine is stored in your

<!-- chunk -->

### body. And depletion can occur within 14 days.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thiamine deficiency can be caused by alcoholism, Alzheimer’s Disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### anemia, athletes who reduce food intake, cancer, clogged arteries, Crohn’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease, diabetes, diarrhea, gastric bypass surgery and kidney disease. And

<!-- chunk -->

### even a poor diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### Several foods are also considered “anti-thiamine factors” (ATF) and

<!-- chunk -->

### contribute to the risk of thiamine deficiency in otherwise healthy people.

<!-- chunk -->

### Certain plants contain ATF, which react with thiamine to form an oxidized,

<!-- chunk -->

### inactive product.

<!-- chunk -->

### Consuming large amounts of tea and coffee (including decaffeinated), as

<!-- chunk -->

### well as chewing tea leaves and betel nuts, have been associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### thiamine depletion in humans.1244

<!-- chunk -->

### ATF include mycotoxins (molds) that break thiamine down in the blood. If

<!-- chunk -->

### you eat certain raw, fresh-water fish, raw shellfish, and ferns you are at a

<!-- chunk -->

### greater risk of thiamine deficiency.1245 Thiamine is also inactivated by

<!-- chunk -->

### cooking food.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thiamine is a cofactor of several enzymes including transketolase,

<!-- chunk -->

### pyruvate dehydrogenase, and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thiamine deficiency decreases cerebral glucose utilization which results

<!-- chunk -->

### in mitochondrial damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists have seen through the electron microscope; disintegrating

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, chromatin clumping, and swelling of degenerating neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Yikes!

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Low thiamine levels can slow creation of ATP

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Energy levels drop

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Low thiamine levels can cause problems with memory, learning, recall

<!-- chunk -->

### and perception


<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Blood pressure drops, reflexes decline, and calf muscles get tender

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Heart muscles enlarge

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Severe thiamine deficiency can result in psychosis

<!-- chunk -->

### Thiamine supplementation can help nearly every active adult, as well as a

<!-- chunk -->

### student looking to do better in school. By boosting acetylcholine,

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamate and GABA in the brain. Providing increased brain energy by

<!-- chunk -->

### fueling cell mitochondria with ATP. And building myelin sheaths that

<!-- chunk -->

### protect our neurons.


<!-- chunk -->

## (Thiamine) benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Thiamine occurs in your body as free thiamine and as various

<!-- chunk -->

## phosphorylated forms: thiamine monophosphate (TMP), thiamine

<!-- chunk -->

## triphosphate (TTP), and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), which is also

<!-- chunk -->

### known as thiamine diphosphate.

<!-- chunk -->

## The synthesis of TPP from free thiamine requires magnesium, adenosine

<!-- chunk -->

### triphosphate (ATP), and the enzyme thiamine pyrophosphokinase. TPP is

<!-- chunk -->

### required for the metabolism of carbohydrates and branched-chain amino

<!-- chunk -->

### acids.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thiamine is directly involved in the citric acid (KREB) cycle that is

<!-- chunk -->

### needed for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) energy production within your

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thiamine also plays a role in maintaining optimal levels of the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters glutamate, and gamma–aminobutyric acid (GABA). And

<!-- chunk -->

### contributes to the production of the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase

<!-- chunk -->

### (PDH) which is essential in making the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thiamine will boost cognition, memory and decision-making. And

<!-- chunk -->

### provides very effective anxiolytic (anti-depressant) qualities.


<!-- chunk -->

## (Thiamine) feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Thiamine is water-soluble and has been shown to improve glutamate, and

<!-- chunk -->

### γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurological transmissions.1246

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are perfectly healthy and don’t have a thiamine deficiency, you’ll

<!-- chunk -->

### likely not feel anything after supplementing with thiamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### But I’ve come across study after study, and reports on forums, where lab

<!-- chunk -->

### tests showed thiamine and thiamine pyrophosphate within range. And yet

<!-- chunk -->

### people were dealing with “mild thiamine deficiency”. The problem is

<!-- chunk -->

### “mild thiamine deficiency” can turn your world upside down.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are hypothyroid or dealing with Hashimoto’s there is a very good

<!-- chunk -->

### chance you would benefit from thiamine supplementation. Same with

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes, fibromyalgia and inflammatory bowel disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report that supplementing with thiamine is an effective

<!-- chunk -->

### mosquito repellent. I personally have found that when those around me are

<!-- chunk -->

### getting eaten by mosquitoes I avoid the bites because I’m supplementing

<!-- chunk -->

### with Sulbutiamine twice per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many report thiamine supplementation boosts attention, energy, and

<!-- chunk -->

### motivation. A reduction in brain fog and increased mental clarity with less

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### Those dealing with fibromyalgia and nerve pain report a significant

<!-- chunk -->

### decrease in pain levels.


<!-- chunk -->

### Most of the research conducted on Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (Thiamine) has been with

<!-- chunk -->

### people dealing with fatigue or pain associated with fibromyalgia, thyroid

<!-- chunk -->

### disease and other debilitating conditions. And most have very few

<!-- chunk -->

### participants. But the results in every trial I’ve reviewed are profound.


<!-- chunk -->

## (Thiamine) Improves Symptoms of Fibromyalgia

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’ve ever had to deal with fibromyalgia, you are familiar with the hell

<!-- chunk -->

### of living with chronic pain, fatigue, insomnia and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some studies suggest that many of the symptoms of fibromyalgia could be

<!-- chunk -->

### related to mild thiamine deficiency due to a dysfunction of the active

<!-- chunk -->

### transport of thiamine from blood to the mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### One very small study conducted in Italy recruited 3 female patients with

<!-- chunk -->

### fibromyalgia. Levels of thiamine and thiamine pyrophosphate in the blood

<!-- chunk -->

### were measured. The patients then received from 600 mg to 1800 mg of

<!-- chunk -->

### thiamine per day. And the results were astounding:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Patient 1: 71.3% reduction in fatigue; 80% reduction in pain

<!-- chunk -->

### •Patient 2: 37% reduction in fatigue; 50% reduction in pain

<!-- chunk -->

### •Patient 3: 60.7% reduction in fatigue; 60% reduction in pain

<!-- chunk -->

### One patient reported improvement at 600 mg of thiamine. Doses for the

<!-- chunk -->

### other 2 patients were increased by 300 mg every 3 days. And experienced

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement in their symptoms at a dose of 1500 mg. None of the patients

<!-- chunk -->

### experienced side effects.1247


<!-- chunk -->

## (Thiamine) for Chronic Fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

### If you deal with chronic fatigue, Thiamine may be a better option than

<!-- chunk -->

### another cup of coffee. Or a stimulant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Italy noted that previous studies on fatigue and related

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders like inflammatory bowel disease improved after therapy with

<!-- chunk -->

### high-dose thiamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team chose 3 stroke patients who also experienced fatigue. Severity of

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale. Note that lab tests

<!-- chunk -->

### showed free thiamine and thiamine pyrophosphate levels were within the

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy reference range in all the patients.

<!-- chunk -->

### High-dose thiamine therapy was started. And resulted in a significant

<!-- chunk -->

### decrease in fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that post-stroke fatigue and related disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### could be a manifestation of mild thiamine deficiency. Likely due to

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction of intracellular transport of thiamine, or other enzyme

<!-- chunk -->

### abnormalities.1248


<!-- chunk -->

## (Thiamine) and Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Italy hypothesized that the chronic fatigue accompanying

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory and autoimmune diseases is a clinical manifestation of mild

<!-- chunk -->

### thiamine deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is both an autoimmune disease and cause of

<!-- chunk -->

### hypothyroidism. In this study, 3 Hashimoto’s patients complaining of

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic fatigue were recruited.

<!-- chunk -->

### All 3 patients received 600 mg of thiamine per day, or 100 mg of thiamine

<!-- chunk -->

### intravenously (IV) once every 4 days. Thiamine treatment led to partial or

<!-- chunk -->

### complete remission of fatigue within a few hours or days.1249


<!-- chunk -->

### (Thiamine) according to the

<!-- chunk -->

### American FDA is 1.2 mg per day. Pregnant and breastfeeding women is a

<!-- chunk -->

### whopping 1.4 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers would laugh at these recommendations. “Mild

<!-- chunk -->

### thiamine deficiency” affects a significant segment of the population in any

<!-- chunk -->

### country.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most clinical studies use thiamine doses from 300 up to 1800 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom-line is thiamine dosing is completely up to you. No side

<!-- chunk -->

### effects are reported even at higher doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Mayo Clinic recommends:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Menstrual cramps – 100 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### •Epilepsy – 50 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### •Alcoholic liver disease and withdrawal – 100 mg injections of

<!-- chunk -->

### thiamine hydrochloride

<!-- chunk -->

### •Coma or hypothermia – 100 mg injections

<!-- chunk -->

### •Thiamine deficiency due to nutrition – 100 mg injections

<!-- chunk -->

### •Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome – 5 – 200 mg injections1250

<!-- chunk -->

### Some natural health clinics offer (expensive) thiamine therapy

<!-- chunk -->

### intravenously (IV) and doses are usually 25 – 50 mg per session.


<!-- chunk -->

### (Thiamine) is non-toxic. So is considered well-tolerated and

<!-- chunk -->

### safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects are rare but very high doses can include stomach upset.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are taking Digoxin, diuretics or Dilantin you should consult your

<!-- chunk -->

### doctor before supplementing with thiamine.


<!-- chunk -->

## Thiamine hydrochloride (HCl): Most Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (Thiamine)

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements available from online retailers and vitamin shops come as

<!-- chunk -->

### Thiamine hydrochloride (HCl). And come in 50 – 500 mg tablets.

<!-- chunk -->

## Benfotiamine (S-benzoylthiamine O-monophosphate) is a synthetic S-

<!-- chunk -->

### acyl derivative of thiamine. This fat-soluble form of thiamine is much

<!-- chunk -->

### more bioavailable than HCI. Benfotiamine typically comes in 150 –

<!-- chunk -->

### mg capsules. Dosage is up to 900 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide (TTFD) (Fursultiamine): TTFD is a

<!-- chunk -->

### disulfide derivative of thiamine developed in Japan for treating Beriberi.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s a synthetic form of thiamine that mimics the naturally occurring

<!-- chunk -->

### thiamine produced in garlic.1251

<!-- chunk -->

### TTFD is a form of thiamine that is water-soluble, and much more difficult

<!-- chunk -->

### to find in vitamin shops. Brand names include Lipothiamine,

<!-- chunk -->

### Allithiamane, Adventan, Alinamin-F, Benlipoid, Bevitol Lipophil, Judolor.

<!-- chunk -->

### TTFD comes in 50 mg capsules. And the primary side effect is you smell

<!-- chunk -->

### like garlic after taking it.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulbutiamine: Sulbutiamine is my preferred form of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (Thiamine) for cognitive enhancement. Sulbutiamine is sold in tablet,

<!-- chunk -->

### capsule, and powder form. Tablets and capsules are usually 750 mg each.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine is a synthetic version of thiamine (two thiamine molecules

<!-- chunk -->

### bound together). It’s sold as a prescription medication in some countries

<!-- chunk -->

### under the brand names Arcalion, Enerion, Bisibuthiamine, and Youvitan.


<!-- chunk -->

## (thiamine) 50 - 100 mg per day


<!-- chunk -->

### (Thiamine) as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does not make thiamine on its own. So to get its benefits you

<!-- chunk -->

### must get it from food or take it as a supplement.


<!-- chunk -->

### is especially helpful for those suffering from low energy

<!-- chunk -->

### levels, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Experience shows thiamine helps stop and reverse the symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with fatigue. Likely because this nootropic helps boost the

<!-- chunk -->

### activity of acetylcholine, GABA and glutamate in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thiamine is also a very effective mosquito repellant. I live in SE Florida

<!-- chunk -->

### where we’re currently under a Zika scare. But I do not experience

<!-- chunk -->

### problems with mosquitoes. Likely because of adequate thiamine levels in

<!-- chunk -->

### my body.

<!-- chunk -->

## Personally, I’ve found Sulbutiamine to be much better for cognition than

<!-- chunk -->

### standard thiamine. And more effective (and safer) than any prescription

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-depressant I’ve ever tried.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulbutiamine is also particularly helpful to students and executives who

<!-- chunk -->

### want to boost cognition, learning and memory.


<!-- chunk -->

### can produce a noticeable increase in mental clarity. And give

<!-- chunk -->

### you a significant energy boost physically and mentally. You’ll feel more

<!-- chunk -->

### awake and alert. Without the side effects you’d get from stimulants like

<!-- chunk -->

### caffeine.


<!-- chunk -->

### is a must have addition for any nootropic stack. If you are

<!-- chunk -->

### using any of the racetams like Piracetam and Aniracetam you may want to

<!-- chunk -->

### consider adding Sulbutiamine as well.


# (Niacin)


<!-- chunk -->

### is known for increased alertness, clarity, focus, memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### enhanced mood and energy, is a potent antioxidant and free radical

<!-- chunk -->

### scavenger, lowers LDL-cholesterol, increases HDL-cholesterol and lowers

<!-- chunk -->

### triglycerides


<!-- chunk -->

## (Niacin, nicotinic acid, 3-pyridine-carboxylic acid) is one of

<!-- chunk -->

### eight B-Vitamins. Niacin is a precursor to the coenzymes nicotinamide

<!-- chunk -->

### adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide

<!-- chunk -->

### phosphate (NADP).

<!-- chunk -->

### NAD is needed to catabolize fats, carbohydrates, proteins, and alcohol.

<!-- chunk -->

### And NAD is involved in cell signaling and DNA repair.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin is found in, and critical for the health of every cell in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

## NADH is the reduced form of NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide),

<!-- chunk -->

### making it the “active” form which can donate electrons.

<!-- chunk -->

### NADH is the primary carrier of electrons from glucose and lactate for

<!-- chunk -->

### adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. ATP is the fuel source made

<!-- chunk -->

### within mitochondria. The power supply in each of your brain cells. So you

<!-- chunk -->

### need niacin to produce NADH to transfer the energy from the food you eat

<!-- chunk -->

### into a type of energy your body can use.

<!-- chunk -->

### Not enough NADH leads to ATP depletion, which can eventually lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### cell death.1252

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have shown that supplementing with niacin improves cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### function, enhances cellular energy, boosts cerebral circulation, increases

<!-- chunk -->

### endurance, switches ‘off’ aging genes, and extends life span.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin naturally occurs in foods like eggs, fish, meat, milk, peanuts,

<!-- chunk -->

### mushrooms, green vegetables, and yeast.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body also naturally synthesizes niacin from the amino acid

<!-- chunk -->

### tryptophan you get from food. This synthesis requires Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### ,

<!-- chunk -->

### riboflavin and an enzyme containing iron.

<!-- chunk -->

### But only about 2% of dietary tryptophan is converted to niacin. Not nearly

<!-- chunk -->

### enough that your body requires which is why supplementation is needed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin supplementation has been used to treat addiction, ADHD, arthritis,

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s Disease, depression, memory loss and schizophrenia. And for

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxing nearly every foreign substance that can find its way into your fat

<!-- chunk -->

### cells.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Russian-designed nootropic Picamilon is a combination of niacin and

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA. And is used to improve memory, concentration, focus, relieve

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety and lower blood pressure.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, niacin helps boost cognition, memory and neuroplasticity.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Niacin work in the brain?

<!-- chunk -->

## Niacin boosts brain health in several ways. But two in particular stand out.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Niacin increases cellular energy. Niacin is the precursor to NAD.

<!-- chunk -->

### NAD acts as an electron carrier, meaning it can accept and donate

<!-- chunk -->

### electrons to various enzymes involved in energy metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### NAD is transformed into NADH. NADH then donates its electron to the

<!-- chunk -->

### electron transport chain where a number of ATP molecules are formed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Using niacin as a supplement increases the available NAD molecules that

<!-- chunk -->

### can take part in energy metabolism. And increasing the amount of energy

<!-- chunk -->

### in each cell.1253

<!-- chunk -->

### By providing the means for ATP synthesis, niacin is involved in cognition,

<!-- chunk -->

### focus, concentration, memory, and processing speed. And niacin plays an

<!-- chunk -->

### important role in mediating brain aging and tissue damage. Even

<!-- chunk -->

### decreasing the damage done by strokes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston studied the

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroprotective effects of CoQ10 and niacin in mouse models of

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Impaired energy metabolism has been

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with some symptoms of PD.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers administered MPTP which is poison to neurons. It disrupts

<!-- chunk -->

### the energy metabolism of neurons that release dopamine. The affected

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine cells are also unable to release as much glutamate which results

<!-- chunk -->

### in decreased dopamine in people with PD.

<!-- chunk -->

### The combination of CoQ10 and niacin protected against both mild and

<!-- chunk -->

### moderate dopamine depletion. The researchers concluded that CoQ10 and

<!-- chunk -->

### niacin improve mitochondrial energy production.1254

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Niacin increases Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF).

<!-- chunk -->

### BDNF has been termed “Miracle-Gro for the brain”. Higher levels

<!-- chunk -->

### of BDNF have been associated with increased intelligence, mood,

<!-- chunk -->

### productivity and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit tested the hypothesis that

<!-- chunk -->

### niacin could increase synaptic plasticity and axon growth in stroke

<!-- chunk -->

### patients.

<!-- chunk -->

### Male Wistar rats were purposely given a stroke and then treated with

<!-- chunk -->

### extended release niacin (Niaspan) for 14 days. Niacin increased synaptic

<!-- chunk -->

### plasticity and axon growth as a result of restored BDNF.1255

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and

<!-- chunk -->

### Metabolism showed that niacin stimulated growth hormone.1256


<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin deficiency is considered rare by government health agencies,

<!-- chunk -->

### particularly in the West. But even mild niacin deficiency can have a

<!-- chunk -->

### negative impact on your health and cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mild niacin deficiency can be caused by digestive problems that decreases

<!-- chunk -->

### the amount of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (niacin) or tryptophan that your body absorbs.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are gluten intolerant, you’re at a higher risk of being niacin

<!-- chunk -->

### deficient. If you have Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) or Crohn’s Disease

<!-- chunk -->

### you have an increased chance of niacin deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### Excessive alcohol consumption, birth control pills, anorexia, and those on

<!-- chunk -->

### a vegan diet can be deficient in niacin.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Energy levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Fatigue increases

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Anxiety, hyperactivity, depression, headaches and hallucinations

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Metabolism declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Insomnia increases

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Irritability increases

<!-- chunk -->

### Some experts believe a lack of niacin and other B-Vitamins is at least

<!-- chunk -->

### partially responsible for the large increase in mental health disorders and

<!-- chunk -->

### violent crimes in recent decades.1257

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these niacin deficiency-related changes are contributing factors to

<!-- chunk -->

### the neurodegenerative diseases of aging, age-related cognitive decline,

<!-- chunk -->

### including Alzheimer’s and schizophrenia.

<!-- chunk -->

### But even if things haven’t degenerated to such a debilitating level, niacin


<!-- chunk -->

## Niacin benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Research has shown that people with low niacin levels are far more

<!-- chunk -->

### vulnerable to addiction, depression, heart disease, schizophrenia, and other

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic conditions. Low niacin levels can happen at any age. Even at birth.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin can improve cholesterol levels. Supplementing with niacin has been

<!-- chunk -->

### shown to help those who are at increased risk for heart attacks, stroke, and

<!-- chunk -->

### other forms of heart disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin can help reduce hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and

<!-- chunk -->

### assist in avoiding heart disease. And niacin helps reduce inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin plays a role in diabetes treatment because it helps balance blood

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin helps to reduce skin inflammation, flare ups, irritation, redness and

<!-- chunk -->

### for treating severe cases of acne.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin can help protect against Alzheimer’s and dementia.1258 Niacin

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation is also associated with decreased risk for age-related

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive decline, memory loss, migraines, depression, motion sickness,

<!-- chunk -->

### insomnia and even alcohol dependence.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin is also used for treating and to help prevent schizophrenia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show that niacin supplementation lowers the risk or severity of

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin is an effective treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED) because it

<!-- chunk -->

### acts as a vasodilator that helps improve blood flow to the penis.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Niacin feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin supplementation can help relieve depression and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### Circulation should improve and you’ll feel like you have more energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### People taking statins to control cholesterol report severe side effects. But

<!-- chunk -->

### when adding niacin to their supplement stack, most experience a reduction

<!-- chunk -->

### in blood pressure. And some have stopped taking statins as a result.

<!-- chunk -->

### Those dealing with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) report

<!-- chunk -->

### combining niacin with St. John’s wort reduced OCD symptoms. And was

<!-- chunk -->

### better than using the SSRI Prozac®, or the benzodiazepine Ativan®

<!-- chunk -->

### (lorazepam).

<!-- chunk -->

### Taken before bedtime some neurohackers report a reduction in insomnia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lower back pain and hip pain may be reduced with niacin

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin can help reduce severe acne and other skin inflammation problems.


<!-- chunk -->

## Niacin helps Reduce Bad Cholesterol

<!-- chunk -->

### Therapeutic doses of niacin have been shown to reduce serum cholesterol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin significantly increases HDL-cholesterol (good cholesterol),

<!-- chunk -->

### decreases LPL-cholesterol (bad cholesterol) and triglycerides. Changes in

<!-- chunk -->

### blood lipid profile considered to be protective of your heart.

<!-- chunk -->

### Low levels of HDL-cholesterol are one of the major risk factors for

<!-- chunk -->

### coronary heart disease. And an increase in HDL levels is associated with a

<!-- chunk -->

### reduction of that risk.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Coronary Drug Project was conducted between 1966 and 1975 to

<!-- chunk -->

### assess the long-term efficacy and safety of niacin in 8,241 men aged 30 to

<!-- chunk -->

### 64 years old. All men had experienced some type of heart problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### Compared to placebo, patients who took 3 grams of niacin daily

<!-- chunk -->

### experienced an average 10% reduction in total blood cholesterol, a 26%

<!-- chunk -->

### decrease in triglycerides, a 27% decrease in recurrent heart attacks, and a

<!-- chunk -->

### 26% decrease in stroke.1259

<!-- chunk -->

## Niacin for Detox

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are dealing with chronic health issues, chances are good you could

<!-- chunk -->

### benefit from a detoxification program. Even if you’re feeling perfectly

<!-- chunk -->

### ‘healthy’ you could likely use a good detox.

<!-- chunk -->

### Simply living in our modern society exposes us to thousands of chemicals

<!-- chunk -->

### that have the potential to get into our bodies from the food we eat, air we

<!-- chunk -->

### breathe, water we drink and things we touch.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study done in Portland, Oregon investigated the effects of a 7-day

<!-- chunk -->

### detox program on well-being in 25 disease-free, healthy participants. The

<!-- chunk -->

### 7-day detox produced a statistically significant (47%) reduction in the

<!-- chunk -->

### Metabolic Screening Questionnaire scores. And a 23% increase in liver

<!-- chunk -->

### detox capacity.1260 Even healthy people feel better after detox.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 1977, L. Ron Hubbard developed his “Sweat Program” to facilitate

<!-- chunk -->

### detox. The program includes niacin, sauna, and a supplement regimen to

<!-- chunk -->

### restore critical vitamins and minerals to the newly detoxed body.

<!-- chunk -->

### This niacin detox program has been used to treat Gulf War Syndrome, the

<!-- chunk -->

### fire fighters and first responders to the 9/11 attacks in New York1261, and is

<!-- chunk -->

### used by hundreds of naturopaths.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin affects adipocytes which causes an increase in free fatty acid (FFA)

<!-- chunk -->

### release from adipose tissue (body fat). Release of free fatty acids releases

<!-- chunk -->

### fat-stored toxins for excretion from the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin also causes prostaglandin D2 release which dilates small blood

<!-- chunk -->

### vessels in the skin. The same reaction responsible for the “niacin flush”.

<!-- chunk -->

### This dilation increases the movement of xenobiotics (foreign chemicals)

<!-- chunk -->

### for excretion through sweating (which is where the sauna comes into the

<!-- chunk -->

### detox program).

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin is also a precursor to NADH which regenerates the master

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant glutathione. Niacin reduces inflammation by decreasing

<!-- chunk -->

### reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines.

<!-- chunk -->

## Niacin helps treat Depression

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin is especially helpful if you are taking antidepressants. Drugs to

<!-- chunk -->

### treat depression have an anti-inflammatory effect, including inhibition of

<!-- chunk -->

### the rate-limiting enzyme of the kynurenine pathway. This metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### pathway is involved in the production of NAD and NADH.

<!-- chunk -->

### The inhibition of this pathway increases serotonin as more tryptophan

<!-- chunk -->

### becomes available for serotonin synthesis. More serotonin helps decrease


<!-- chunk -->

### But this also leaves less tryptophan available for niacin synthesis. Which

<!-- chunk -->

### causes depression and basically cancels out the benefits of using

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants.1262

<!-- chunk -->

### So if you’re on SSRI’s you may want to add niacin to your stack.

<!-- chunk -->

## Niacin for the Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction

<!-- chunk -->

### Dyslipidemia is the name of the condition involving high LDL-cholesterol

<!-- chunk -->

### (bad), high triglycerides (bad), and low HDL-cholesterol (bad).

<!-- chunk -->

### Dyslipidemia is closely related to erectile dysfunction (ED).

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Hong Kong ran a placebo-controlled trial with 160 male

<!-- chunk -->

### patients with ED and dyslipidemia. Half the men with ED received

<!-- chunk -->

### mg of niacin, and the other half received a placebo daily for 12 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The main outcome of the study was a significant improvement in erectile

<!-- chunk -->

### function. And the researchers concluded that “niacin alone can improve

<!-- chunk -->

### erectile function in men suffering from moderate to severe ED”.1263


<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin is naturally produced in your body from tryptophan. And you get

<!-- chunk -->

### niacin from eating certain foods including beef, chicken, tuna, sunflower

<!-- chunk -->

### seeds, salmon, green peas, turkey, and mushrooms. So niacin is considered

<!-- chunk -->

### non-toxic and safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Note that higher doses of niacin are usually divided into evenly split doses

<!-- chunk -->

### 2 – 4 times per day. So 2 gram of niacin daily would be 500 mg 4-times


<!-- chunk -->

### •Prevention of heart disease: niacin 4 grams per day

<!-- chunk -->

### •Lowering bad cholesterol and boosting good cholesterol: niacin

<!-- chunk -->

### grams per day

<!-- chunk -->

### •To slow the progression of newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes:

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacinamide 25 mg/kg of body weight daily

<!-- chunk -->

### •Preventing or treating Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (niacin) deficiency: 50 – 100 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### per day

<!-- chunk -->

### •To treat pellagra (severe niacin deficiency): 300 – 500 mg daily

<!-- chunk -->

### •For treating osteoarthritis: Niacinamide 3 grams per day

<!-- chunk -->

### •For reduced risk of cataracts: 44 mg of niacin per day

<!-- chunk -->

### •Preventing Alzheimer’s Disease: 100 mg per day. Note that there is

<!-- chunk -->

### no reliable evidence that niacin can prevent Alzheimer’s although

<!-- chunk -->

### there is plenty of evidence that Alzheimer’s patients consistently

<!-- chunk -->

### show low niacin levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Treating erectile dysfunction (ED): 500 mg 3-times per day

<!-- chunk -->

### •Treating schizophrenia: 3 grams of niacin and 3 grams of ascorbic

<!-- chunk -->

### acid (Vitamin C) daily1264


<!-- chunk -->

### Standard niacin (nicotinic acid) is naturally produced in your body. And

<!-- chunk -->

### considered non-toxic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin can lower blood pressure so if you are on blood pressure lowering

<!-- chunk -->

### medication be cautious about supplementing with niacin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin may decrease the effectiveness of diabetes medication because

<!-- chunk -->

### long-term use of niacin can increase blood sugar. So you may need to

<!-- chunk -->

### increase your diabetes meds.

<!-- chunk -->

### Statins are notorious for causing muscle wasting. And when combined

<!-- chunk -->

### with niacin it may increase this muscle wasting problem. You may want to

<!-- chunk -->

### cut back on your statins as you increase your niacin dose. Many stop

<!-- chunk -->

### taking statins altogether when using niacin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin (nicotinic acid) and sustained-release niacin causes “flushing” in

<!-- chunk -->

### many people. Here we address how to reduce or eliminate the side effect

<!-- chunk -->

### of niacin flushing.

<!-- chunk -->

## Preventing Niacin Flushing

<!-- chunk -->

## Regular immediate-release niacin (nicotinic acid) causes “flushing” in

<!-- chunk -->

### many people. And they avoid supplementing with niacin as a result.

<!-- chunk -->

### Standard niacin flushing results from activation of the niacin receptor G

<!-- chunk -->

### protein-coupled receptor 109A (GPR109A) in skin Langerhans cells. This

<!-- chunk -->

### leads to the production of prostaglandins, including prostaglandin D


<!-- chunk -->

### (PGD


<!-- chunk -->

### ) and prostaglandin E


<!-- chunk -->

### (PGE


<!-- chunk -->

### ), which act on receptors in the

<!-- chunk -->

### capillaries (small blood vessels in your skin).1265

<!-- chunk -->

### This flushing sensation comes from blood vessel dilation and manifests

<!-- chunk -->

### itself as redness, warmth of the skin and tingling or itching. It happens

<!-- chunk -->

### rapidly and lasts for about 1 hour.

<!-- chunk -->

### This flushing sensation is NOT an allergic reaction. And only feels

<!-- chunk -->

### uncomfortable. Here are some strategies to avoid niacin flushing.

<!-- chunk -->

### First, “slow-release” niacin may prevent flushing. But is NOT the answer

<!-- chunk -->

### because it will not provide the LDL-cholesterol (bad) lowering benefits.

<!-- chunk -->

### And can be toxic to your liver when used long-term.1266

<!-- chunk -->

## Inositol hexanicotinate is commonly referred to as no-flush niacin or

<!-- chunk -->

### flush-free niacin and is preferred by many neurohackers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even though I’ve seen a couple of clinical studies claiming this version of

<!-- chunk -->

### niacin has no effect on lipid profiles when it comes to cholesterol1267, user

<!-- chunk -->

### reviews consistently report the opposite.

<!-- chunk -->

## They do not experience flushing with Inositol hexanicotinate even at high

<!-- chunk -->

### doses, and their cholesterol and triglyceride levels all benefited and came

<!-- chunk -->

### within a healthy range.

<!-- chunk -->

### A newer version of “extended-release” niacin called Niaspan® does not

<!-- chunk -->

### produce the flushing effect. And has been shown to have the same effects

<!-- chunk -->

### on good cholesterol and triglycerides as instant-release niacin.1268

<!-- chunk -->

### Niaspan® is prescription-only and is now available as a prescription

<!-- chunk -->

### generic at lower cost.

<!-- chunk -->

### One effective way to reduce flushing with instant-release niacin and

<!-- chunk -->

### extended-release niacin is to take a 325 mg aspirin tablet 30 minutes prior

<!-- chunk -->

### to taking your niacin.1269

<!-- chunk -->

### You can also try splitting your dose of niacin into smaller doses taken

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout the day. Flushing will be reduced if not completely eliminated.

<!-- chunk -->

### And long-term niacin users note that flushing goes away after about a

<!-- chunk -->

### week of long-term niacin use.


<!-- chunk -->

## (Niacin) is not stored in your body and must be ingested daily

<!-- chunk -->

### from food or as a supplement. Niacin as a supplement comes in several

<!-- chunk -->

### forms:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Niacin (nicotinic acid, (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) or ‘free-form’

<!-- chunk -->

### nicotinic acid even at large doses of 3 or 4 grams are nearly

<!-- chunk -->

### completely absorbed by adults. This version causes ‘flushing’ above

<!-- chunk -->

### 50 mg which can be avoided. Refer to the “Side Effect” section of

<!-- chunk -->

### this article on niacin. Doses above 1500 mg per day can be toxic to

<!-- chunk -->

### your liver.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Niacinamide (nicotinic acid amide) has a similar profile to that of

<!-- chunk -->

### free form niacin. But unlike free-form niacin does not produce a

<!-- chunk -->

### flushing effect. Doses above 3 grams per day can be toxic to your

<!-- chunk -->

### liver.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Slow-release niacin is nicotinic acid using an ion exchange or wax

<!-- chunk -->

### matrix developed to slowly release niacin to avoid the flushing

<!-- chunk -->

### effect. Liver toxicity has been shown in doses above 500 mg of

<!-- chunk -->

### extended-release niacin.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Inositol hexanicotinate (IH) is an “extended-release niacin” sold as

<!-- chunk -->

### “Flush Free Niacin” and has 6 molecules of niacin covalently

<!-- chunk -->

### bonded to one molecule of inositol. The IH version of niacin does

<!-- chunk -->

### not produce a flushing effect. Studies show that an average of 70%

<!-- chunk -->

### of the dose you take gets absorbed by your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show that the benefits to lowering bad cholesterol with the IH

<!-- chunk -->

### form of niacin are not nearly as effective as free-from niacin.1270 But user

<!-- chunk -->

### reviews are the opposite of these clinical findings. No toxicity is

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with high doses of IH.

<!-- chunk -->

### Slo-Niacin®, is sold over the counter. Niaspan® is an extended-release

<!-- chunk -->

### niacin formula sold as a prescription drug.

<!-- chunk -->

## Note: Both slow-release niacin and extended-release niacin (inositol

<!-- chunk -->

### hexanicotinate) are marketed and labeled as “Flush-Free Niacin”. But they

<!-- chunk -->

### are not the same and you should avoid slow-release niacin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Slow-release niacin causes liver toxicity at relatively low doses and does

<!-- chunk -->

### not provide the lipid balancing effects like free-form niacin and extended-

<!-- chunk -->

### release niacin.


<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin B3 (Niacin) 1000 mg 3-times per pay

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Niacin as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body does make some Niacin on its own. And you can get it by eating

<!-- chunk -->

### meat, poultry, and fish. But studies have shown we don’t get an adequate

<!-- chunk -->

### supply of Niacin from food sources.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin is particularly helpful for vegetarians because very little Niacin is

<!-- chunk -->

### available from vegetables.

<!-- chunk -->

### Niacin is especially helpful for those suffering Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

<!-- chunk -->

### and ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest starting with a dose of 500 mg daily. And Niacin is a great

<!-- chunk -->

### compliment to a stack including any nootropic. Do your best to use free-

<!-- chunk -->

### form niacin if you can tolerate the flush. Or even better, use an extended-

<!-- chunk -->

# (Pantothenic Acid)


<!-- chunk -->

### is known to enhance alertness, cognition, energy, hearing,

<!-- chunk -->

### vision, elevate mood, lower anxiety and normalize healthy cholesterol

<!-- chunk -->

### levels


<!-- chunk -->

## (Pantothenic Acid) is one of 8 water-soluble B-vitamins that

<!-- chunk -->

### are absolutely vital to the highly optimized brain. And is essential to all

<!-- chunk -->

### forms of life.


<!-- chunk -->

### is found in every cell in your body including your brain. The

<!-- chunk -->

## name Pantothenic is derived from the Greek word pantothen, meaning

<!-- chunk -->

### “from everywhere”. Reflecting the idea that small amounts of pantothenic

<!-- chunk -->

### acid can be found in nearly every food.

<!-- chunk -->

## Foods rich in pantothenic acid include animal organs (liver and kidney),

<!-- chunk -->

### fish, shellfish, milk products, eggs, avocados, legumes, mushrooms, and

<!-- chunk -->

### sweet potatoes. Avocados contain the highest amount of pantothenic acid

<!-- chunk -->

### among commonly consumed foods, with one avocado containing about

<!-- chunk -->

### mg.

<!-- chunk -->

## Pantothenic Acid is a precursor in the biosynthesis of Coenzyme-A (CoA).

<!-- chunk -->

### CoA is an essential enzyme in a variety of chemical reactions that sustain

<!-- chunk -->

### life.

<!-- chunk -->

## CoA as Acetyl-CoA is required for generating energy from fat,

<!-- chunk -->

### carbohydrates, and proteins. This energy in the form of glucose is the fuel

<!-- chunk -->

### source for each cell.

<!-- chunk -->

## Acetyl-CoA is also involved in the citric acid cycle (KREBs), in the

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis of essential fats, cholesterol, steroid hormones, vitamins A and

<!-- chunk -->

### D, and the neurotransmitters acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Coenzyme A derivatives are also required for the synthesis of melatonin

<!-- chunk -->

### which controls your circadian rhythm and sleep/awake cycle. And for the

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism of drugs and toxins in your liver.


<!-- chunk -->

### is essential for the synthesis of acetylcholine (ACh). Adequate

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of ACh can boost focus, memory, learning, and reduce brain fog.


<!-- chunk -->

### is critical for converting nutrients from food into energy,

<!-- chunk -->

### balancing blood sugar, reducing LDL-(bad) cholesterol, lowering blood

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure, preventing nerve damage and pain, and preventing heart failure.


<!-- chunk -->

### plays a part in the synthesis and metabolism of proteins,

<!-- chunk -->

### carbohydrates, and fats. Turning them into energy that your brain uses to

<!-- chunk -->

### fire neurotransmitters in your brain.


<!-- chunk -->

### is required for the manufacture of red blood cells, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### stress and sex hormones produced in your adrenal glands.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### is crucial for converting the choline in your

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic stack into acetylcholine (ACh). Without adequate levels of B


<!-- chunk -->

### you will not experience the benefits of using precursors to ACh like Alpha

<!-- chunk -->

### GPC and CDP-Choline.


<!-- chunk -->

## (Pantothenic Acid) work in the Brain?


<!-- chunk -->

### (Pantothenic Acid) boosts brain health and function in several

<!-- chunk -->

### ways. But two in particular stand out.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

## increases energy. Pantothenic acid is an essential

<!-- chunk -->

### coenzyme involved in mitochondrial aerobic respiration. Vitamin


<!-- chunk -->

### ’s role in the citric acid cycle (KREBs) and electron transport

<!-- chunk -->

### chain helps convert nutrients from food into energy which is used to

<!-- chunk -->

### make adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the fuel source within

<!-- chunk -->

### each of your cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pantothenic acid takes part in the synthesis of Acetyl-CoA which is at the

<!-- chunk -->

### heart of the KREBs cycle. Acetyl-CoA in your brain is also involved in the

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis of cholesterol, amino acids, phospholipids, and fatty acids.

<!-- chunk -->

### CoA is also involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

## acetylcholine and serotonin, and steroid hormones. User reviews of those

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with pantothenic acid claim to having more energy. This

<!-- chunk -->

### boost in energy comes from this long series of events stemming from

<!-- chunk -->

### pantothenic acid.1271

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

## helps reduces stress. Pantothenic acid is often referred

<!-- chunk -->

## to as the “anti-stress vitamin”. Your adrenal glands use CoA (made

<!-- chunk -->

### partly from pantothenic acid) along with cholesterol and Vitamin C

<!-- chunk -->

### to manufacture cortisol and epinephrine.

<!-- chunk -->

### When cortisol levels are low, your ability to cope and respond to stress is

<!-- chunk -->

### compromised. And if your cortisol levels are abnormally high (a common

<!-- chunk -->

## problem), your body’s reserve of pantethine (the active form of

<!-- chunk -->

### pantothenic acid) needs to be replenished in order to sustain good adrenal

<!-- chunk -->

### function.1272


<!-- chunk -->

### has a reputation for reducing stress, anxiety and depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic stress, anxiety and lower acetylcholine levels can damage your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. This damage can manifest in several ways including memory loss,

<!-- chunk -->

### brain fog, anxiety, depression, and even neurodegenerative diseases like

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Acetylcholine synthesis declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Concentration, memory, learning, and recall decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ LDL-cholesterol (bad) and triglycerides increase

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ HDL-cholesterol (good) levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Wound healing takes longer

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Energy levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Numbness, tingling, burning sensations, shooting pain in the feet

<!-- chunk -->

### increase


<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation can help increase acetylcholine, epinephrine

<!-- chunk -->

### and serotonin levels in your brain. And help modulate cortisol levels

<!-- chunk -->

### produced in your adrenal glands. Helping you to cope with stress and

<!-- chunk -->

### lessen depression.


<!-- chunk -->

## (Pantothenic Acid) benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### When you take Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### as a supplement, it is converted to pantethine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pantethine is a more stable disulfide (double bonded) form of pantothenic

<!-- chunk -->

### acid.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is this active form of pantothenic acid that is converted into the enzyme

<!-- chunk -->

### Coenzyme-A (CoA). CoA plays a critical role in the metabolism and

<!-- chunk -->

### breakdown of the three essential micronutrients: proteins, carbohydrates,

<!-- chunk -->

### and fats.

<!-- chunk -->

### CoA is a cofactor in more than 70 enzymatic pathways including:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Amino acid catabolism

<!-- chunk -->

### •Acetylcholine synthesis

<!-- chunk -->

### •Carbohydrate metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

### •Fatty acid oxidation

<!-- chunk -->

### •Heme synthesis

<!-- chunk -->

### •Pyruvate degradation

<!-- chunk -->

### •Phase II detox acetylation

<!-- chunk -->

### CoA is also involved in the initial steps of cholesterol synthesis and all the

<!-- chunk -->

### downstream metabolites of cholesterol including steroid, Vitamin D and

<!-- chunk -->

### bile acids.

<!-- chunk -->

### CoA helps break down the carbon skeleton of amino acids which are

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolized to pyruvate and enter the KREBs cycle. This cycle is crucial

<!-- chunk -->

### to ATP synthesis within your mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### CoA directs acetyl groups to form ubiquinone (CoQ10), squalene and

<!-- chunk -->

### cholesterol. You also need CoA for the transport of long chain fatty acids

<!-- chunk -->

### into mitochondria where fats are converted into energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom-line is CoA is behind the production of hemoglobin, bile, sex

<!-- chunk -->

### and adrenal hormones (steroids), cholesterol and the neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine and serotonin in your brain.


<!-- chunk -->

## (Pantothenic Acid) feel?


<!-- chunk -->

### is water-soluble and has been shown to improve mood, energy

<!-- chunk -->

### and cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers who supplement with pantothenic acid report being

<!-- chunk -->

### wonderfully optimistic, energetic, and mentally sharp.

<!-- chunk -->

### People report Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### helps them focus better, they feel a profound

<!-- chunk -->

### increase in energy and concentration improves.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many people dealing with acne find their skin looks great. Acne is cleared

<!-- chunk -->

### within a few days to a few weeks of supplementing with pantothenic acid.

<!-- chunk -->

### Men and women find that supplementing with Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### helps prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### hair loss. And if taken early enough may even help avoid hair turning

<!-- chunk -->

### prematurely gray.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some neurohackers report that pantothenic acid helps improve vision and

<!-- chunk -->

### hearing.


<!-- chunk -->

## (Pantothenic Acid) reduces Acne

<!-- chunk -->

### 100 people of Chinese descent (45 males and 55 females) aged 10 –

<!-- chunk -->

### years with severe acne were treated with high-dose pantothenic acid. A

<!-- chunk -->

### total of 10 grams per day were given in 4 divided doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Participants were also asked to apply a cream to affected areas 4 – 6 times

<!-- chunk -->

### per day. The cream contained 20% pantothenic acid.

<!-- chunk -->

### Their face became noticeably less oily within 3 days of starting therapy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Within 2 weeks, facial pore size became smaller and acne lesions began to

<!-- chunk -->

### heal. And the rate of new acne eruptions had slowed.

<!-- chunk -->

### By 8 weeks, acne was usually controlled. Most acne lesions were gone and

<!-- chunk -->

### new eruptions occurred only occasionally. The participants with severe

<!-- chunk -->

### acne required 6 months of treatment to control acne.

<!-- chunk -->

### The author of the study noted that in some of the severe cases, daily doses

<!-- chunk -->

### of 15 – 20 grams of pantothenic acid would produce a faster response.

<!-- chunk -->

### patients were monitored for 18 months; the maintenance dose needed to

<!-- chunk -->

### control acne ranged from 1 – 5 grams per day of pantothenic acid.1273


<!-- chunk -->

## (Pantethine) to decrease LDL-Cholesterol

<!-- chunk -->

### User reviews consistently show success with lowering LDL-cholesterol

<!-- chunk -->

### and triglycerides and raising HDL-cholesterol by supplementing with


<!-- chunk -->

### (Pantethine).

<!-- chunk -->

### The National University of Health Sciences in Illinois conducted an

<!-- chunk -->

### evaluation of clinical trials from 1966 to 2002 for studies using the

<!-- chunk -->

## pantethine version of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### to improve cholesterol.

<!-- chunk -->

### 28 clinical trials with a pooled population of 646 ‘hyperlipidemic’

<!-- chunk -->

### subjects were evaluated. Mean age of participants were 52.8 years.

<!-- chunk -->

### Average study length was 12.7 weeks with an average dosage of 900 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### per day of pantethine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The mean decrease of LDL-cholesterol (bad cholesterol) was 10 – 20%.

<!-- chunk -->

### The mean decrease of triglycerides was 14 – 33%. And the mean increase

<!-- chunk -->

### of HDL-cholesterol (good cholesterol) was 4 – 11%.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that “pantothenic acid was an effective

<!-- chunk -->

### therapeutic option in treating patient populations with total serum

<!-- chunk -->

### cholesterol levels greater than 200 mg/dL, and/or serum triacylglycerol

<!-- chunk -->

### levels greater than 150 mg/dL.”

<!-- chunk -->

### The team noted that the full benefit of pantethine may not be attained until

<!-- chunk -->

### at least 4 months from beginning supplementation. And that pantethine is

<!-- chunk -->

### a well-tolerated therapeutic agent that deserves much more attention than

<!-- chunk -->

### it has recently received.1274


<!-- chunk -->

## (Pantothenic Acid) increases Longevity


<!-- chunk -->

### is believed to extend life span. But research in humans for

<!-- chunk -->

### obvious reasons has been difficult. Humans live longer than most

<!-- chunk -->

### mammals. And tracking human subjects for life would be prohibitively

<!-- chunk -->

### expensive.

<!-- chunk -->

### So animal research is the next best thing. A team in Austin gave 33 young

<!-- chunk -->

### male and female mice 300 μg of calcium pantothenate daily in drinking

<!-- chunk -->

### water. Forty-one control mice did not receive the vitamin supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### The mean life span for mice who received calcium pantothenate was 653.1

<!-- chunk -->

### days. And for the control mice life span was 549.8 days. The mice using


<!-- chunk -->

### lived 19% longer.1275

<!-- chunk -->

## Royal jelly has long been used as a longevity supplement. And some of the

<!-- chunk -->

## science backs this up. Pantothenic acid is the primary anti-aging factor

<!-- chunk -->

### isolated from royal jelly.

<!-- chunk -->

### The combination of pyridoxine, biotin and sodium yeast nucleate extended

<!-- chunk -->

### the lifespan of the common fruit fly. And the addition of pantothenic acid

<!-- chunk -->

### further increased life span.1276

<!-- chunk -->

### Seems that supplementing with pantothenic acid (Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### ) will help you

<!-- chunk -->

### live longer.


<!-- chunk -->

### If you are using an acetylcholine (ACh) precursor like Alpha GPC or CDP

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline in your nootropic stack, you should be using Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### . Because


<!-- chunk -->

### is needed to make Coenzyme-A (CoA). CoA and choline are needed to

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesize acetylcholine.


<!-- chunk -->

### (Pantothenic Acid) is a one-to-

<!-- chunk -->

### two ratio with a choline supplement. For example, 250 mg of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### with 500 mg of CDP Choline.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you don’t get enough Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### , you may not notice significant

<!-- chunk -->

### improvements when supplementing with your preferred choline source. If

<!-- chunk -->

### you’ve added choline to your racetam stack and still get a “choline

<!-- chunk -->

### headache” it’s likely because you don’t have adequate Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### in your

<!-- chunk -->

### system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pantothenic Acid or Pantethine is generally well tolerated in doses up to

<!-- chunk -->

### 1,200 mg/day. Some neurohackers report doses above 1,000 mg can induce

<!-- chunk -->

### gastrointestinal side effects like nausea or heartburn.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) containing estrogen and progestin

<!-- chunk -->

### may increase the requirement for additional pantothenic acid.

<!-- chunk -->

### Use of Pantothenic Acid in combination with cholesterol-lowering drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### (statins) or with Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (niacin or nicotinic acid) may produce

<!-- chunk -->

### additive effects on blood lipids. So be careful because you could lower

<!-- chunk -->

### LDL-cholesterol to unhealthy levels.


<!-- chunk -->

### (Pantothenic Acid) is non-toxic. So is considered well-

<!-- chunk -->

### tolerated and safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects are rare but very high doses can include stomach upset, nausea

<!-- chunk -->

### or diarrhea.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are taking the antibiotic tetracycline, you should avoid using extra


<!-- chunk -->

### because it could negate the effects of tetracycline.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are on cholinesterase inhibitors used for treating Alzheimer’s, you

<!-- chunk -->

### should not be using Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

## When choosing a Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### supplement, your basic choice is between

<!-- chunk -->

## Pantethine or Pantothenic Acid.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pantethine is by far the more active choice when it comes to producing

<!-- chunk -->

### CoA. And this is backed up by many clinical trials. Researchers have

<!-- chunk -->

### pointed out that Pantethine creates twice as much CoA compared to

<!-- chunk -->

### Pantothenic Acid.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, Pantothenic acid does have its benefits. It enhances adrenal

<!-- chunk -->

### function and modulates inflammation. If you can, find a supplement that

<!-- chunk -->

### combines both.


<!-- chunk -->

### supplement labels will show pantothenic acid as “Calcium” or

<!-- chunk -->

### “sodium D-pantothenate” which is used for treating stress, migraines and

<!-- chunk -->

### allergies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pantethine is mainly recommended for lowering blood cholesterol levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### And pantethine is better for stacking with a choline supplement because it

<!-- chunk -->

### creates more CoA than other forms of pantothenic acid.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pantothenol (panthenol) is a stable alcohol analog of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (pantothenic acid), which can be rapidly converted to pantothenic acid by

<!-- chunk -->

### humans.


<!-- chunk -->

## (Pantothenic Acid) up to 1,000 mg per day


<!-- chunk -->

### as a nootropic supplement.

## Your body does not make Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### on its own. So to get its benefits you

<!-- chunk -->

### must get it from food or take it as a supplement.


<!-- chunk -->

### is especially helpful for those suffering from low energy

<!-- chunk -->

### levels, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Experience shows Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### helps stop and reverse the symptoms

### caffeine.


<!-- chunk -->

### is a must have addition for any nootropic stack. If you are

<!-- chunk -->

### using any of the racetams like Piracetam and Aniracetam and are using a

## (Pyridoxine) promotes vivid dreams

<!-- chunk -->

### Read the reviews of those supplementing with Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### and you’ll come

<!-- chunk -->

### across several reports of improved sleep and vivid dreams. And we have

<!-- chunk -->

### science to back this up.

### 12 college students participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial

<!-- chunk -->

### to examine the various claims that Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### increase dream vividness,

### and the ability to recall dreams.

<!-- chunk -->

### The students were given 100 or 250 mg of Vitamin B

## (Pyridoxine) may prevent Parkinson’s Disease

<!-- chunk -->

### A study out of the Netherlands suggests that Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### could cut the risk

<!-- chunk -->

### of Parkinson’s Disease in half.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers in Rotterdam recruited 5,289 people over the age of 55 and

<!-- chunk -->

### assessed their dietary intake using food questionnaires. This study looked

<!-- chunk -->

### into reports that increased levels of the amino acid homocysteine may

<!-- chunk -->

### promote Parkinson’s Disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Numerous studies have reported that higher intakes of folate, Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### and Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### decrease blood homocysteine levels and could offer

<!-- chunk -->

### protection from Parkinson’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### It has also been proposed that Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### could provide antioxidant

<!-- chunk -->

### effects. And could reduce the risk factor for Parkinson’s by a mechanism

<!-- chunk -->

### that is not related to homocysteine.

<!-- chunk -->

### After 9.7 years of follow-up, 72 new cases of Parkinson’s Disease had

<!-- chunk -->

### been diagnosed. The average Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### intake was 1.63 mg per day,

<!-- chunk -->

### average B


<!-- chunk -->

### intake was 5.3 mcg per day, and average folate intake was

<!-- chunk -->

### 218.7 mcg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### No significant reductions in the risk of Parkinson’s were found for folate

<!-- chunk -->

### or Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### . But when the researchers limited their calculations to the

<!-- chunk -->

### 66% of participants who were smokers, they found that the protective

<!-- chunk -->

### effects of high Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### intake appeared limited to this group.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers noted that several studies indicate the protective effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### nicotine on brain cells and reduced the risk of Parkinson’s. Which

<!-- chunk -->

### suggests that Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### plus nicotine provides mutually reinforcing

<!-- chunk -->

### beneficial effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Since folate and Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### showed no relationship to reduced

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s, the researchers concluded it was not homocysteine that was

<!-- chunk -->

### behind the newly diagnosed patients.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study authors said that the apparent benefits of B


<!-- chunk -->

### , “may point towards

<!-- chunk -->

### an alternative mechanism… because several lines of evidence suggest

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroprotective properties of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### through antioxidant capacities”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxidative stress has been shown to be prominent in Parkinson’s Disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### and higher Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### intake may reduce Parkinson’s risk through its

## (Pyridoxine) to beat Panic Attacks

<!-- chunk -->

### Reduced serotonin levels are known as one of the causes of panic attacks

<!-- chunk -->

### and hyperventilation attacks. Serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan.

<!-- chunk -->

### And for the synthesis of serotonin, you need Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### and iron.

<!-- chunk -->

### The clarify how this works, researchers at Atago Hospital in Japan

<!-- chunk -->

### checked the blood levels (vitamins B


<!-- chunk -->

### , B


<!-- chunk -->

### , and B


<!-- chunk -->

### and iron) of patients

<!-- chunk -->

### who came into the ER with a panic attack or hyperventilation attack.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team measured parameters in 21 patients compared to 20 healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### volunteers. The study found that both Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### and iron levels were

<!-- chunk -->

### significantly lower in the panic and hyperventilation attack people than in

<!-- chunk -->

### the healthy volunteers.

<!-- chunk -->

### There was no significant difference in Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### or B


<!-- chunk -->

### . The study

<!-- chunk -->

## concluded that low blood concentrations of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

## and iron are

<!-- chunk -->

### involved in panic and hyperventilation attacks.1288


<!-- chunk -->

## Recommended dosage of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (P-5-P) form of Vitamin


<!-- chunk -->

## is up to 100 mg per day. P-5-P is the only ‘active’ form of B


<!-- chunk -->

### available

<!-- chunk -->

### and preferred for nootropic usage. (see “Side Effects” for toxicity with

<!-- chunk -->

### regular Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### ).

<!-- chunk -->

### The enzyme L-dopa decarboxylase depends on P-5-P to convert L-DOPA

<!-- chunk -->

### into dopamine. And is involved in the final stages of serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis.1289

<!-- chunk -->

### An analysis of data collected in the USA in 2003-2004 indicated that


<!-- chunk -->

### intake from food averaged about 1.9 mg per day.1290 The

<!-- chunk -->

### problem is some forms of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### from plants (pyridoxine glucoside)

<!-- chunk -->

### are not very bioavailable.

<!-- chunk -->

### In most cases, and certainly that of neurohackers using nootropics to boost

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters or improve mood, Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### from diet alone is not

<!-- chunk -->

### enough.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study mentioned above shows that even those supplementing with

### mg per day of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### or less had blood levels of B


<!-- chunk -->

### much too low.


<!-- chunk -->

### is water-soluble and you excrete it in urine, so supplementation

### daily is critical.

<!-- chunk -->

### Women taking birth control pills, or who are menstruating are usually low

<!-- chunk -->

### in Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### . Those following a strict vegetarian diet are also typically

<!-- chunk -->

### deficient in B


<!-- chunk -->

### Drugs like L-DOPA, anti-tuberculosis medications, metal chelators,

<!-- chunk -->

### methylxanthines to treat respiratory conditions, and long-term use of

<!-- chunk -->

### NSAIDs, anti-convulsants, and phenobarbital all inhibit Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism. If you are using any of these drugs you are likely low in B


<!-- chunk -->

### You can safely dose up to 100 mg per day of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### with no toxic


<!-- chunk -->

### (Pyridoxine) is non-toxic at recommended doses. So is

<!-- chunk -->

### considered well-tolerated and safe.

## Pyridoxine neuropathy is a form of nerve damage caused by high doses of


<!-- chunk -->

### when taken for extended periods. Symptoms are loss of

<!-- chunk -->

### coordination, extreme skin sensitivity, bone pain, muscle weakness, and

<!-- chunk -->

### numbness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pyridoxine neuropathy has been reported in doses of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### of 200 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### to 5 grams per day for extended periods. When dosing was stopped,

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms usually disappeared.1291,

<!-- chunk -->

### This nerve damage has been identified as the destruction of axons and

### higher levels of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### toxicity.1293,

### from food and supplements comes in the form of Pyridoxine,

<!-- chunk -->

### Pyridoxal, and Pyridoxamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### These forms of B

## Your body does not make Vitamin B

# (Inositol)


<!-- chunk -->

### is known to decrease anxiety, depression, panic attacks, mood

<!-- chunk -->

### swings, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and alleviate the symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### causing bulimia


<!-- chunk -->

## (Inositol, cyclohexanehexol) is a sugar alcohol and isomer of

<!-- chunk -->

### glucose. As a nootropic, inositol is involved in brain cell signaling, and is

<!-- chunk -->

### a component of cell membranes.


<!-- chunk -->

### is no longer considered a ‘true’ B-Vitamin because your body

<!-- chunk -->

## can make inositol on its own. A “true vitamin” is either essential for life

<!-- chunk -->

### and/or cannot be made by the human body. So inositol no longer qualifies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inositol is used in your brain as a “secondary messenger”. It facilitates

<!-- chunk -->

### communication between brain cells. All of your major neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### need inositol to relay messages.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inositol is also a component making up the phospholipid ‘shell’ encasing

<!-- chunk -->

### each brain cell. Once again, inositol acts as a messenger of sorts by

<!-- chunk -->

### assisting in the transport of amino acids, proteins and neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### across and into the brain cell.

<!-- chunk -->

## Inositol is a ‘group’ of 9 molecules called ‘stereoisomers’. Myo-inositol is

<!-- chunk -->

### the most abundant stereoisomer, making up 90-95% of the total free

<!-- chunk -->

### inositol in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (Inositol) can be used to treat panic attacks and

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), bulimia,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression in bipolar disorder and mood swings.

<!-- chunk -->

### Myo-inositol is involved in cell-signaling. In the simplest terms, myo-

<!-- chunk -->

### inositol hears from the first neuron that it’s about to fire over a

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter. And passes that information on to the receiving neuron.

<!-- chunk -->

### Not enough inositol and the neurotransmitter can’t do its job.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inositol is one busy molecule in your body:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Myo-inositol affects mRNA which regulates cell volume.1295

<!-- chunk -->

## •Phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways control signals inside and

<!-- chunk -->

### outside of brain cells.1296

<!-- chunk -->

## •Inositol plays a role in DNA repair1297

<!-- chunk -->

## •Inositol affects long-term potentiation1298

<!-- chunk -->

## •Myo-inositol is a component of cell membranes

<!-- chunk -->

## •Myo-inositol regulates cell metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

## •Myo-inositol regulates cell energy consumption


<!-- chunk -->

## (Inositol) work in the Brain?


<!-- chunk -->

### (Inositol) boosts brain health and function in several ways. But


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Inositol

<!-- chunk -->

## influences neuroplasticity and neurotransmitters.

<!-- chunk -->

### Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has been used to

<!-- chunk -->

### treat depression, Parkinson’s Disease, stroke and pain. But the

<!-- chunk -->

### maximum effect of tDCS in the brain was not until several minutes

<!-- chunk -->

### after treatment. Which indicates the effects of tDCS is not by direct

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter action like you would expect for example if you

<!-- chunk -->

### were using a nootropic.1299

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers concluded the effect of tDCS was best explained by the

<!-- chunk -->

### activation of a ‘secondary messenger system’, and modulation of brain cell

<!-- chunk -->

### membrane proteins.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and hormones have been shown to

<!-- chunk -->

### exert their action via an intracellular (inside the cell) secondary messenger

<!-- chunk -->

### system in which the activated neuroreceptor stimulates the turnover of

<!-- chunk -->

### inositol phospholipids.1300

<!-- chunk -->

### Clinical studies have found that low levels of inositol are present in

<!-- chunk -->

### patients with anorexia, brain disorders and depression.1301 And abnormal

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of myo-inositol in middle-aged adults can signal the initial stages of

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive decline such as Alzheimer’s and dementia.1302

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Inositol helps reduce anxiety and depression. Long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### potentiation needed for encoding long-term memories, and long-

<!-- chunk -->

### term depression, rely on neural signal transmission and synaptic

<!-- chunk -->

### plasticity. And both are strongly influenced by the myo-inositol and

<!-- chunk -->

### phosphoinositide pathway.1303

<!-- chunk -->

### A meta-analysis and systematic review of clinical studies were evaluated

<!-- chunk -->

### comparing inositol for depression and anxiety disorders. The researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### concluded that inositol was beneficial for treating depression and

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety.1304


<!-- chunk -->

### Inositol is an important component of brain cell membranes. And is

<!-- chunk -->

### critical as a secondary messenger for both intra- and extra-cellular

<!-- chunk -->

### signaling.

<!-- chunk -->

### Low inositol levels have been found in those with major depressive

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

### Science does not yet know if low inositol is a result of or contributes to

<!-- chunk -->

### these diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Inositol levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Serotonin and dopamine receptor density declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Anxiety and depression get worse

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Concentration, cognition and memory decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ LDL-cholesterol (bad) and triglycerides increase

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ HDL-cholesterol (good) levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Inflammation and oxidative stress damage neurons


<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation can help increase the density of serotonin and

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine receptors in your brain. And improve neurotransmitter

<!-- chunk -->

### signaling. Helping you to cope with stress, lessen depression and improve


<!-- chunk -->

## (Inositol) benefits

<!-- chunk -->

## Myo-inositol enhances serotonin neuroreceptor sensitivity.1305 And several

<!-- chunk -->

### studies have proposed a SSRI-like role for myo-inositol. Researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### believe inositol works as a SSRI because it is a secondary messenger of

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### In other words, inositol gets a message from the 1st neuron that says it

<!-- chunk -->

### wants to send over a serotonin molecule. Inositol picks up that message

<!-- chunk -->

### and lets the receiving neuroreceptor know there’s an incoming serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### molecule. Serotonin signaling is fixed and depression goes away.1306

<!-- chunk -->

### In some regions of your brain, serotonin acts more like a

<!-- chunk -->

### “neuromodulator” rather than a “classic” neurotransmitter. And can affect

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamate and GABA as well.1307

<!-- chunk -->

### Inositol as a secondary messenger, is an integral part of neuroplasticity

<!-- chunk -->

### and neurotransmitter signaling. Affecting anxiety, alertness,

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration, cognition, depression and all forms of memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### A large percentage of patients do not respond to SSRI’s when used to treat

<!-- chunk -->

### depression or anxiety. The problem could be depression not related to

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin or GABA deficiency (they could have a dopamine problem

<!-- chunk -->

### instead).

<!-- chunk -->

### But if it is serotonin-related depression and there is no response to SSRI’s,

<!-- chunk -->

### inositol may help. Myo-inositol helps relay the messages sent and

<!-- chunk -->

### received by serotonin receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another problem with SSRI’s like lithium is Serotonin Syndrome. Too

<!-- chunk -->

### much serotonin can be released in the brain which can be toxic and deadly.

<!-- chunk -->

### Or the SSRI can deplete stores of inositol which raises serotonin levels too

<!-- chunk -->

### high.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once again, inositol comes benefits. Researchers found that myo-inositol

<!-- chunk -->

### + lithium alleviated Serotonin Syndrome.1308

<!-- chunk -->

### Myo-inositol regulates blood sodium levels which helps in the

<!-- chunk -->

### maintenance of healthy myelin sheaths that protect neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Myo-inositol protects your brain from a leaky blood-brain barrier that if

<!-- chunk -->

### left unchecked, would allow toxins produced in your liver to enter your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain.1309

<!-- chunk -->

### Inositol can relieve anxiety and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).

<!-- chunk -->

### Myo-inositol can reduce panic attacks. And inositol can reduce mood

<!-- chunk -->

### swings.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show that inositol is as effective as SSRI’s in treating the

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of bulimia and binge eating.1310

<!-- chunk -->

### Inositol can protect against lung cancer caused by smoking.1311

<!-- chunk -->

### Myo-inositol increases sperm concentration, total sperm count, decreases

<!-- chunk -->

### follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone in infertile

<!-- chunk -->

### males.1312

<!-- chunk -->

### Myo-inositol can help lower LDL-cholesterol (bad-cholesterol), C-

<!-- chunk -->

### reactive protein and blood glucose levels while increasing HDL-

<!-- chunk -->

### cholesterol (good cholesterol).1313

<!-- chunk -->

### Inositol reduces inflammation. Phosphatidylinositol reduces pro-

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory cytokines.1314 And D-chiro-inositol decreases the mRNA

<!-- chunk -->

### expression and secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 6 (IL-

<!-- chunk -->

### 6).1315

<!-- chunk -->

### D-chiro-inositol has anti-aging properties and can extend lifespan.1316

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom-line is inositol is a potent pseudo-vitamin and can be a great

<!-- chunk -->

### compliment to any nootropic stack.


<!-- chunk -->

## (Inositol) feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Inositol makes it easier to fall asleep. Unlike other sleep-inducing

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics or sleep meds, it doesn’t “knock you out”. Falling asleep is just

<!-- chunk -->

### effortless.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inositol increases serotonin and dopamine receptor densities. So damage

<!-- chunk -->

### that you may have done to dopamine receptors are repaired (particularly

<!-- chunk -->

### an issue with ADHD stimulant meds). And serotonin is simply more

<!-- chunk -->

### effective. Anxiety decreases, motivation goes up and depression goes

<!-- chunk -->

### away.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inositol is great for social occasions because anxiety levels decrease. In

<!-- chunk -->

### fact, inositol outperformed fluoxetine (Prozac®) at reducing panic attacks

<!-- chunk -->

### and can become effective in just a few days. With no side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some neurohackers feel that supplementing with inositol is the best anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### depressant they’ve every used. The real beauty of inositol is you can safely

<!-- chunk -->

### combine it with the current antidepressant (i.e. SSRI) medication you

<!-- chunk -->

### currently take. Your antidepressant meds may work better!

<!-- chunk -->

### Inositol is a proven remedy for treating the symptoms of Obsessive-

<!-- chunk -->

### Compulsive Disorder (OCD). You should feel a noticeable reduction in

<!-- chunk -->

### negative thoughts. Some things just won’t bother you as much. And won’t

<!-- chunk -->

### dominate your thoughts so easily.

<!-- chunk -->

### And inositol is an effective method of taming panic attacks.


<!-- chunk -->

## Inositol to Treat Panic Attacks

<!-- chunk -->

### Estimates are that only about 70% of patients respond to standard drug

<!-- chunk -->

### treatments for panic disorder. And many often discontinue the drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### because of negative side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Israeli researchers decided to compare inositol with the SSRI fluvoxamine

<!-- chunk -->

### (Luvox®) for panic disorder. In this double-blind, controlled, random-order

<!-- chunk -->

### crossover study 20 patients completed 1 month of 18 grams per day of

<!-- chunk -->

### inositol and 1 month of 150 mg per day of fluvoxamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the first month, inositol reduced the number of panic attacks per week

<!-- chunk -->

### by 4 compared to only 2.4 for fluvoxamine. Nausea and fatigue were noted

<!-- chunk -->

### with those using Luvox® but not with inositol.

<!-- chunk -->

### The natural compound inositol was more effective than a SSRI for treating

<!-- chunk -->

### panic disorder.1317


<!-- chunk -->

## (Inositol) for Depression

<!-- chunk -->

### A study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry noted that levels

<!-- chunk -->

### of inositol in depressed patients were lower than normal. In this trial, the

<!-- chunk -->

### authors administered 12 grams per day of inositol or a placebo to

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed patients for 4 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The overall improvement in depression scores was significantly greater

<!-- chunk -->

### than placebo by week 4. And no side effects were noted.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers commented that “this is the first time a precursor strategy

<!-- chunk -->

### for a secondary messenger rather a neurotransmitter” was used in treating


<!-- chunk -->

### The authors concluded that “inositol had a significant antidepressant

<!-- chunk -->

### effect”.1318

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study tried using inositol to treat Premenstrual Dysphoric

<!-- chunk -->

### Disorder (PMDD). PMDD is a particularly nasty form of PMS. It’s a

<!-- chunk -->

### condition in which a woman has severe depression, irritability and tension

<!-- chunk -->

### before menstruation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists don’t really know what causes PMDD except it has something to

<!-- chunk -->

### do with serotonin. Serotonin is the “calming neurotransmitter”. When it

<!-- chunk -->

### fails for any reason you get depressed, irritable, obsessive, negative and

<!-- chunk -->

### worried.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this 2-phase clinical trial, PMDD patients were given myo-inositol in

<!-- chunk -->

### powder form, or a soft-gel capsule equivalent to 2 grams of myo-inositol.

<!-- chunk -->

### The results showed a significant improvement on 3 different scales of

<!-- chunk -->

### measuring depression. Inositol significantly improved PMDD and

<!-- chunk -->

### associated depression, irritability and tension.1319


<!-- chunk -->

## (Inositol) for OCD

<!-- chunk -->

### Inositol is good for treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). OCD

<!-- chunk -->

### is a type of anxiety characterized by unwanted, recurring thoughts and

<!-- chunk -->

### behaviors.

<!-- chunk -->

### One double-blind, controlled crossover trial treated 13 OCD patients with

<!-- chunk -->

### 18 grams per day of inositol for 6 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The OCD patients had significantly lower scores on the Yale-Brown

<!-- chunk -->

### Obsessive Compulsive Scale when taking inositol than when taking

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### The authors concluded that “inositol is effective in depression, panic, and

<!-- chunk -->

### obsessive-compulsive disorder, a spectrum of disorders responsive to

<!-- chunk -->

### selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI’s)”.1320


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dosage for inositol is up to 3 grams per day. Typically split

<!-- chunk -->

### into 3-doses of 1 gram each. One in the morning, one at noon, and your

<!-- chunk -->

### final dose before bedtime.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clinically effective dosage for depression and anxiety is up to 12 grams

<!-- chunk -->

### per day. Split your dose into 3-times per day. 4 grams in the morning,

<!-- chunk -->

### grams at noon and 4 grams prior to bedtime.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clinically effective dosage for OCD is up to 18 grams per day. Split into

<!-- chunk -->

### equal doses of 6 grams each.

<!-- chunk -->

### The clinical dosages mentioned here are the ones used in clinical trials.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most people experienced relief of symptoms within 3 months. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### people showed improvements within a week or sooner.

<!-- chunk -->

## Important note: It should not be necessary for you to go as high as 12 or

<!-- chunk -->

### 18 grams per day. Inositol should be just as effective for you in much

<!-- chunk -->

### smaller doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most neurohackers notice benefits when taking 3 – 4 grams per day or

<!-- chunk -->

### less.


<!-- chunk -->

### (Inositol) is non-toxic. So is considered well-tolerated and

<!-- chunk -->

### safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Higher doses like those used in clinical trials could result in flatulence,

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach upset, nausea, diarrhea, increased mood swings for bipolar or

<!-- chunk -->

### psychosis patients.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’ve been diagnosed with bipolar or bipolar-spectrum disorder, please

<!-- chunk -->

### consult a pharmacist or your doctor before using inositol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have shown and neurohackers verify that inositol supplementation

<!-- chunk -->

### may reduce testosterone levels and libido. Most of the Low-T reports were

<!-- chunk -->

### by woman but I’ve heard a few men reporting Low-T and libido from

<!-- chunk -->

### inositol as well.


<!-- chunk -->

### Inositol is available in capsules, softgels, and in powder form.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inositol powder is the least expensive way to supplement with this

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic. Inositol is basically a sugar, so it tastes sweet. Not as sweet as

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar but it tastes good on its own. Or mixed in your favorite beverage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lecithin is comprised of both inositol and choline. So lecithin as a

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement will provide you with inositol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inositol is often supplied by supplement manufacturers as “inositol +

<!-- chunk -->

### choline”. The thinking behind this combined supplement is that inositol

<!-- chunk -->

### compliments the effects of choline.

<!-- chunk -->

### When inositol and choline are used together, they are supposed to improve

<!-- chunk -->

### nerve function and help you metabolize cholesterol.

<!-- chunk -->

### But high doses of choline can leave you depressed and sleepy. So if you

<!-- chunk -->

### want to add inositol to your nootropic stack, I suggest you avoid the

<!-- chunk -->

### combination and go with straight inositol.


<!-- chunk -->

## (Inositol) up to 3 grams per day


<!-- chunk -->

## (Inositol) as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does make Vitamin B

# (Folate)


<!-- chunk -->

### is known to improve mood, energy, initiative, alertness,

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration, psychomotor speed, and social activity


<!-- chunk -->

## (Folate, folic acid, 5-methylenetetrahydrofolate) is water-

<!-- chunk -->

### soluble, and one of 8 B-Vitamins.

<!-- chunk -->

### Folate functions as a coenzyme in single-carbon transfers in the synthesis

<!-- chunk -->

### of DNA and RNA. And converts homocysteine to methionine which is

<!-- chunk -->

### used in the synthesis of S-Adenosyl-methionine (SAMe).1321

<!-- chunk -->

### As a nootropic, folate is also involved in gene expression, amino acid

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis, myelin synthesis, and is required for the synthesis of the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine and serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many neurohackers, including doctors and other health professionals

<!-- chunk -->

## confuse folate with folic acid. They are NOT the same.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this chapter, we’ll explore the differences between folate and folic acid.

<!-- chunk -->

### And how Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (folate) is critical for the fully optimized brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Folate is used in red blood cell production, helps break down and use

<!-- chunk -->

### proteins, and just about every other process in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Folate deficiency is found in at least a third of those suffering from

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. Folate touches nearly everything happening in your brain. And

<!-- chunk -->

### the reason why we’re investigating it here. Folate should be part of your


<!-- chunk -->

### Green leafy vegetables, or ‘foliage’ are rich sources of folate. And how

<!-- chunk -->

### ‘folate’ got its name. You can also get folate from citrus fruit juice,

<!-- chunk -->

### legumes, fortified foods and liver.

<!-- chunk -->

## When you eat vegetables containing folate, or eat flour-enriched with folic

<!-- chunk -->

## acid, an enzyme called MTHFR (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate

<!-- chunk -->

### reductase) converts folic acid and food folate into 5-

<!-- chunk -->

### methylenetetrahydrofolate (methyl-folate or 5-MTHF).

<!-- chunk -->

## Folate is a general term for a group of various tetrahydrofolate (THF)

<!-- chunk -->

## derivatives naturally found in food. Folic acid refers to an oxidized

<!-- chunk -->

### synthetic compound used in dietary supplements and food fortification.

<!-- chunk -->

### THF can enter the main and natural folate metabolic cycle which starts out

<!-- chunk -->

### in the mucosa of your small intestine. Synthetic folic acid on the other

<!-- chunk -->

### hand undergoes initial reduction and methylation in your liver, where

<!-- chunk -->

### conversion to the THF form requires the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the problems with choosing the unnatural folic acid version is if

<!-- chunk -->

### there is low activity of the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme, combined with

<!-- chunk -->

### high intake of folic acid, you end up with unnatural levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### unmetabolized folic acid entering your circulation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Several studies have reported the presence of this unmetabolized folic acid

<!-- chunk -->

### in blood following consumption of folic acid supplements, or folic acid-

<!-- chunk -->

### fortified food.1322

<!-- chunk -->

### We have growing evidence in Western society that we generally test for

<!-- chunk -->

### excess levels of unnatural folic acid. Due mainly to eating processed foods

<!-- chunk -->

### and folic acid-enriched flour. And still suffer from a folate deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### High doses of synthetic folic acid may increase your risk of cancer,

<!-- chunk -->

### immune system damage and other health problems.1323

<!-- chunk -->

## Problems with MTHFR

<!-- chunk -->

### Another major problem affecting folate deficiency is problems with the

<!-- chunk -->

## MTHFR gene. Remember that this enzyme called MTHFR (5,10-

<!-- chunk -->

### methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) is needed to convert folic acid and

<!-- chunk -->

### food folate into 5-methylenetetrahydrofolate.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are two common variants in this gene that affects the functioning of

<!-- chunk -->

## MTHFR. They are called C677T and A1298C. Both variants are genetically

<!-- chunk -->

### inherited. And depending on their presence in your system, can reduce the

<!-- chunk -->

### effectiveness of MTHFR from 30 – 70%. Another cause for folate

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### Estimates of the prevalence of these mutations in our general population

<!-- chunk -->

### are up to 60%. Some doctors report that nearly every patient in their

<!-- chunk -->

### practice have one or both MTHFR mutations.1324

<!-- chunk -->

### And we have clinical evidence of the association between both MTHFR

<!-- chunk -->

### mutations in depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.1325

<!-- chunk -->

### Folate is one busy molecule in your body:

<!-- chunk -->

## •Donates a methyl group to homocysteine to make SAMe. The

<!-- chunk -->

### methyl donor SAMe is involved in the formation of phospholipids,

<!-- chunk -->

### glutathione, myelin, coenzyme Q10, carnitine and creatine in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain

<!-- chunk -->

### •Synthesizes the enzyme cofactor biopterin (BH4) which is critical

<!-- chunk -->

### for the synthesis of major neurotransmitters including dopamine,

<!-- chunk -->

### epinephrine, norepinephrine and serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### •Synthesizes DNA and tRNA

<!-- chunk -->

### •Recycles and reduces the inflammatory amino acid homocysteine

<!-- chunk -->

### •Builds red and white blood cells and platelets.


<!-- chunk -->

## (Folate) work in the Brain?


<!-- chunk -->

### (Folate) boosts brain health and function in several ways. But


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Folate influences neuroplasticity and neurotransmitters. Folate is

<!-- chunk -->

### required for the synthesis of the neurotransmitters dopamine,

<!-- chunk -->

### epinephrine, and serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### The active metabolite of folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF, L-

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylfolate), participates in re-methylation of the amino acid

<!-- chunk -->

### homocysteine, creating methionine. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the

<!-- chunk -->

### downstream metabolite of methionine, is involved in numerous

<!-- chunk -->

### biochemical methyl donation reactions, including reactions forming the

<!-- chunk -->

### above-mentioned neurotransmitters.

<!-- chunk -->

### Without the participation of 5-MTHF in this process, SAMe and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter levels decrease in the cerebrospinal fluid, contributing to

<!-- chunk -->

### the disease process of depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have shown that those being treated for depression with SSRI

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants, and not responding to these drugs, can get a much better

<!-- chunk -->

### response by taking folate with their antidepressants.1326

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Folate helps reduce depression. Folate is involved in one-carbon

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism in the brain. This folate cycle is responsible for the

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis of methyl groups, which are utilized by SAMe in several

<!-- chunk -->

### methylation reactions involving nucleoproteins, proteins,

<!-- chunk -->

### phospholipids, neurotransmitters, and monoamines.

<!-- chunk -->

### Deficiency of both folate and Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### will impair methylation

<!-- chunk -->

### processes. Causing the accumulation of homocysteine. Low concentrations

<!-- chunk -->

### of folate in your blood, red blood cells and cerebrospinal fluid are

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with depression and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows that cognitive function is related to methylation processes

<!-- chunk -->

### in your brain.1327 This depression hypothesis is supported by the similar

<!-- chunk -->

### effect of SAMe on monoamine metabolism, which is also implicated in

<!-- chunk -->

### depression.1328

<!-- chunk -->

### The lowest concentrations of folate and SAMe in cerebrospinal fluid are

<!-- chunk -->

### found in dementia, including Alzheimer’s Disease.1329


<!-- chunk -->

### Methyl-folate (5-MTHF) works with Vitamins B


<!-- chunk -->

### , B


<!-- chunk -->

### as well as

<!-- chunk -->

### cofactors like magnesium in this methylation cycle in every cell in your

<!-- chunk -->

### body and brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## The metabolic process called methylation occurs when one molecule

<!-- chunk -->

### provides a methyl group, which is a carbon atom linked to three hydrogen

<!-- chunk -->

### atoms, to another molecule. And makes things like creatine, carnitine,

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10, phosphatidylcholine (PC), melatonin and a bunch of other crucial

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters and substances in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylation is involved in cognition, repairing DNA, turning genes on and

<!-- chunk -->

### off, fighting infections and inflammation, getting rid of toxins and much,

<!-- chunk -->

### much more.

<!-- chunk -->

### Problems with methylation (which can be caused by not enough folate)

<!-- chunk -->

### can contribute to addictions, Alzheimer’s, anxiety, ADD and ADHD,

<!-- chunk -->

### bipolar and manic depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, dementia,

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes, fibromyalgia, schizophrenia, and hypothyroidism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylation is not only involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters but

<!-- chunk -->

### breaking them down as well. This critical step, when broken, causes a

<!-- chunk -->

### buildup of neurotransmitters that can lead to seizures, insomnia, panic

<!-- chunk -->

### attacks, fits of rage, and more. Much more.

<!-- chunk -->

### A deficiency of methyl-folate (5-MTHF) in your body caused by problems

<!-- chunk -->

### with this methylation pathway leads to a deficiency of glutathione, your

<!-- chunk -->

### major antioxidant. This can take shape as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue,

<!-- chunk -->

### increased immune activation, chemical sensitivities and even diseases like

<!-- chunk -->

### ALS, MS, and Parkinson’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Not enough folate and you can experience:

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Mitochondrial dysfunction1330

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Depression, mood and social function decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Cognitive function declines

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Concentration, cognition and memory decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Risk of Alzheimer’s and dementia increase

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Risk of anemia increases

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Irritability, forgetfulness, and mental sluggishness increase


<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation can help increase the density of serotonin and

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine neurotransmitters in your brain. And improve neurotransmitter

<!-- chunk -->

### signaling. Helping you to cope with stress, lessen depression and improve


<!-- chunk -->

## (Folate) benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Depression affects about a quarter of the US population who will have at

<!-- chunk -->

### least one depressive episode in their lifetime. (My apologies to our readers

<!-- chunk -->

### from other countries. I only have statistics for the USA).

<!-- chunk -->

### But world-wide, folate deficiency is found in at least a third of those

<!-- chunk -->

### suffering from depression. And research shows that folate levels even in

<!-- chunk -->

### the “normal range” might be inadequate for methyl donation and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter synthesis.

<!-- chunk -->

### By adding folate, or methyl-folate to your nootropic stack, you’re adding a

<!-- chunk -->

### necessary ingredient for the synthesis of the neurotransmitters dopamine,

<!-- chunk -->

### epinephrine, norepinephrine and serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### The active metabolite of folate (5-MTHF, L-methyl-folate) participates in

<!-- chunk -->

### the re-methylation of the amino acid homocysteine creating methionine.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAMe, the downstream metabolite of methionine, is involved in several

<!-- chunk -->

### methyl donor reactions, including forming most of your major

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methyl-folate also seems to save the day by stepping in, and substituting

<!-- chunk -->

### for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential cofactor in neurotransmitter

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis (when BH4 is low).

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom-line: folate helps boost alertness, attention, cognition,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, and mood. And helps alleviate brain fog, anxiety and depression.


<!-- chunk -->

## (Folate) feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Up to 60% of us do not produce enough of the enzyme needed to break

<!-- chunk -->

### down the synthetic folic acid found in supplements and fortified foods like

<!-- chunk -->

### breakfast cereal and bread. And the simple presence of this impostor in

<!-- chunk -->

### our diet is likely contributing to many of our modern diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report that dosing with methyl-folate:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Boosts alertness and energy levels

<!-- chunk -->

### •Relief from chronic pain

<!-- chunk -->

### •Tolerance for heat increases

<!-- chunk -->

### •Sociability increases

<!-- chunk -->

### •Relief from depression, fatigue and paranoia

<!-- chunk -->

### •Fewer headaches

<!-- chunk -->

### •Mental clarity increases

<!-- chunk -->

### •Much happier, calmer, more energetic

<!-- chunk -->

### •Gingivitis and gum inflammation decreases


<!-- chunk -->

## Folate as an Antidepressant

<!-- chunk -->

### Many who use antidepressants experience little to no relief in depressive

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms. And researchers set out to find out why antidepressant meds

<!-- chunk -->

### were not working.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Jerome Sarris of the University of Melbourne decided to do a meta-

<!-- chunk -->

### analysis of clinical trials using ‘nutrients’ along with antidepressants in

<!-- chunk -->

### PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science up to 2015.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team found that Omega-3’s combined with antidepressants

<!-- chunk -->

### boosted the success of using these meds for depression. The team also

<!-- chunk -->

## found strong evidence for methyl folate, Vitamin D, and SAMe.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research showed that using folic acid or inositol provided no benefit.

<!-- chunk -->

### The team concluded there was strong evidence for using methyl folate,

<!-- chunk -->

### Omega-3, Vitamin D and SAMe with antidepressants to reduce

<!-- chunk -->

### depression.1331

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study in Milan compared using methyl-folate with the

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant Trazadone. 96 patients with dementia received either 50 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### of methyl-folate per day, or 100 mg of Trazadone.

<!-- chunk -->

### After 4 weeks of treatment, depression scores for the methyl-folate

<!-- chunk -->

### patients decreased more than for the Trazadone patients.1332

<!-- chunk -->

## Folate Reduces Risk for Dementia

<!-- chunk -->

### Folate deficiency is associated with a tripling in the risk of developing

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia among elderly people. Researchers tracked 518 people over the

<!-- chunk -->

### age of 65 for 2 years for dementia development. The study found that the

<!-- chunk -->

### onset of dementia was much more likely in those whose folate levels fell

<!-- chunk -->

### over 2 years.1333

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study published in the British Medical Journal looked at the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological status of 24 folate-deficient patients compared with a control

<!-- chunk -->

### group of 21 normal folate-level patients.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study showed a significant increase in organic brain syndrome in the

<!-- chunk -->

### folate-deficient group.1334 Organic brain syndrome is a general term used

<!-- chunk -->

### to describe decreased mental function caused by something other than

<!-- chunk -->

### psychiatric illness.


<!-- chunk -->

## (Folic Acid) Improves Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association

<!-- chunk -->

### evaluated nutritional status and cognitive function in 260 men and women

<!-- chunk -->

### older than 60 years. The study showed there was a significant relation

<!-- chunk -->

### between impaired abstract thinking ability and memory, and lower folate

<!-- chunk -->

### levels and intake.1335

<!-- chunk -->

### In another open study of 38 folate deficient subjects with depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### lethargy, and memory impairment, 50 mg of folinic acid per week for

<!-- chunk -->

### days significantly improved visuomotor performance, visuospatial

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, logical reasoning, associative memory, and activities for daily

<!-- chunk -->

### living.1336


<!-- chunk -->

### Recommended dosage for Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (Folate) is 500 mcg.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you decide to add folate to your nootropic stack, start with B


<!-- chunk -->

### in the

<!-- chunk -->

### form of methylcobalamin. And then introduce your dose of methyl-folate

<!-- chunk -->

### and cofactors such as Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### , Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### , Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### , trimethyl

<!-- chunk -->

### glycine, and Vitamin C

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have an adverse reaction to methyl-folate (agitation, increased

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, headache), you can take Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (nicotinic acid or niacinamide)

<!-- chunk -->

### in 50 mg dosages every 30 minutes until you experience relief.

<!-- chunk -->

### Note that Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (niacin) requires SAMe for its metabolism. And can

<!-- chunk -->

### contribute to a drop in methylation if you’re low in SAMe. It is also a

<!-- chunk -->

### cofactor for the enzyme COMT that breaks down norepinephrine,

<!-- chunk -->

### epinephrine, and estrogen, which are all potentially elevated if you are

<!-- chunk -->

### experiencing anxiety.


<!-- chunk -->

### (Folate) is non-toxic. So is considered well-tolerated and safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### But note that higher doses of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### like those used in clinical trials

<!-- chunk -->

### nearly always use synthetic folic acid. If you are deficient in Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### ,

<!-- chunk -->

### and many people are, can manifest as anemia. And is undisguisable from

<!-- chunk -->

### folate deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### Large doses of folate could correct anemia. Without correcting the

<!-- chunk -->

### underlying B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency. And leave you at risk for irreversible brain

<!-- chunk -->

### damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is why the US Institute of Medicine advises that all adults limit their

<!-- chunk -->

### intake of folic acid supplements to 1 mg daily.

<!-- chunk -->

### Note that it is unlikely that you’ll encounter this problem by using folate

<!-- chunk -->

### or methyl-folate instead of folic acid. But we don’t have the science yet to

<!-- chunk -->

### back this claim up.

<!-- chunk -->

### High concentrations of unmetabolized folic acid in your blood, especially

<!-- chunk -->

### if you’re low in Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### , could result in a compromised immune

<!-- chunk -->

### system. And problems with cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other side effects of using folic acid, particularly in high doses include

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach problems, insomnia, skin reactions, confusion, loss of appetite,

<!-- chunk -->

### nausea and seizures.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many medications interfere with folic acid absorption including

<!-- chunk -->

### antibiotics, Dilantin, Daraprim, chemo meds, antacids, proton pump

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibitors, anti-seizure medications, NSAIDS (ibuprofen and naproxen),

<!-- chunk -->

### Azulfidine, and Methotrexate.


<!-- chunk -->

### (Folate) is available in capsules, softgels, and in powder form.

<!-- chunk -->

## Studies have shown that the active form of folate, methyl-folate, which is

<!-- chunk -->

### more easily absorbed, and easily crosses the blood-brain barrier, may be

<!-- chunk -->

### effective in the prevention and treatment of depression and dementia.1337

<!-- chunk -->

### Look for a folate supplement that says “L-Methylfolate”, “5-

<!-- chunk -->

### methyltetrahydrofolate” or “5-MTHF” on the label. Even better, with the

<!-- chunk -->

### word Quatrefolic® or Metafolin® which are branded forms of folate

<!-- chunk -->

### ensuring their purity and effectiveness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid any product, including multivitamins, which list “folic acid” on the

<!-- chunk -->

### label.


<!-- chunk -->

## (Folate) up to 500 mcg


<!-- chunk -->

### (Folate) as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does not make Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### on its own. So you must get folate

<!-- chunk -->

### from food or a supplement.


<!-- chunk -->

### (Folate) is especially helpful for those suffering from anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, panic attacks, or OCD. Folate can help improve energy levels,

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce insomnia, and help increase energy levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Experience shows Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### helps stop and reverse the symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with high homocysteine levels.


<!-- chunk -->

### is also particularly helpful to quell anxiety caused by social

<!-- chunk -->

### situations.


<!-- chunk -->

### can help you get a good night’s sleep. You may find it as

<!-- chunk -->

### effective as sleep meds and other nootropics used for sleep. You’ll awaken

<!-- chunk -->

### feeling refreshed and calm. Ready to start your day.


<!-- chunk -->

### (Folate) is up to 1,000 mcg per

<!-- chunk -->

### day. Start low at 500 mcg and see how your body reacts.

<!-- chunk -->

## Please refer to Dosage Notes in this chapter for adding the other B-

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamins to your stack for an optimal methylation cycle. Your

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters are counting on it.


# (Cobalamin)


<!-- chunk -->

### is known to enhance alertness, cognition, energy, vision,

<!-- chunk -->

### elevate mood, lower anxiety and pain, and relieve insomnia


<!-- chunk -->

## (Cobalamin) is one of 8 water-soluble B-vitamins that are

<!-- chunk -->

### absolutely vital to the highly optimized brain. And is essential to every

<!-- chunk -->

### cell in your body including your brain.


<!-- chunk -->

### is essential for the synthesis of DNA, RNA and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters, the maintenance of myelin sheaths protecting neurons,

<!-- chunk -->

### (nerve disease), sensory disturbances, imbalance when walking, weakness,

<!-- chunk -->

### and psychiatric problems ranging from cognitive and behavioral problems

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic we explore in Head First. Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

## is called “Cobalamin”

<!-- chunk -->

## because it contains the rare earth element cobalt.1338


<!-- chunk -->

### is absorbed in your intestines from food or a supplement using

<!-- chunk -->

### a process called intrinsic factor. The vitamin is then transferred to

### transcobalamin II (TC-II/B

### ) which acts as a transporter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Through a very complex process which I’m not going to try to explain

<!-- chunk -->

### here, B


<!-- chunk -->

### is converted into the active forms coenzyme 5’-deoxyadenosyl

<!-- chunk -->

### and methylcobalamin (MeB


<!-- chunk -->

### ).1339

<!-- chunk -->

### Foods rich in Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### include fish, shellfish, meat (especially liver),

<!-- chunk -->

### poultry, eggs, milk and milk products.1340 The two best sources by far of


<!-- chunk -->

### are clams and liver.

<!-- chunk -->

### You cannot get adequate amounts of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### from plants. Vegetarians

<!-- chunk -->

### and vegans are especially in danger of B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency. Regardless of what

<!-- chunk -->

### food and supplement manufacturers say.

<!-- chunk -->

### Plant foods contain analogs of B


<!-- chunk -->

### which are similar to, but not the same

<!-- chunk -->

### as, Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### . They bind to B

### Trying to get your Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### from yeast products like Red Star

<!-- chunk -->

### And Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### is light sensitive. If stored in open bins or clear plastic

<!-- chunk -->

### bags or jars, B


<!-- chunk -->

### vaporizes and disappears.

<!-- chunk -->

### Meat and animal products are your best source of natural Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### . But

<!-- chunk -->

### is difficult because it is

<!-- chunk -->

## (Cobalamin) work in the Brain?


<!-- chunk -->

### (Cobalamin) boosts brain health and function in several ways.

<!-- chunk -->

### But two in particular stand out.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

## increases cognition. Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### is a precursor in the

<!-- chunk -->

### biosynthesis of all major neurotransmitters in your brain including

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine, dopamine, GABA, norepinephrine and serotonin.


<!-- chunk -->

### is an integral part of the one-carbon cycle involved in the

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis of methionine. This amino acid, methionine donates the methyl

<!-- chunk -->

### group required for methylation to occur.

<!-- chunk -->

### This biochemical process helps synthesize neurotransmitters, myelin (the

<!-- chunk -->

### sheath that protects neurons) and keeps homocysteine levels in check.

<!-- chunk -->

### Elevated levels of homocysteine have been associated with several

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s


<!-- chunk -->

### Even mild Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency has been associated with accelerated

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive decline. Researchers at Tufts University examined data from

<!-- chunk -->

### men and women enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study.

<!-- chunk -->

### They focused on scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE),

<!-- chunk -->

### which is a short list of questions and tasks used to screen for dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### The subjects were divided into 5 groups, based on their vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### blood


<!-- chunk -->

### MMSE scores declined by 0.24 points per year over the 8-year follow-up

<!-- chunk -->

### period. Cognitive decline was faster in the bottom 2 groups that had the

<!-- chunk -->

### lowest levels of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that “having plasma (blood) Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### levels

<!-- chunk -->

### from 187 to 256.8 pmol/L… predicts especially rapid cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### decline”.1342

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

## helps reduce depression. Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### is a precursor in

<!-- chunk -->

### the biosynthesis of GABA and serotonin. GABA is an amino acid and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter produced by glutamate in your brain. This

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibitory neurotransmitter prevents other ‘excitatory’

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters from being released. Resulting in an anti-anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### and calming effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin is a neurotransmitter made from the amino acid tryptophan.

<!-- chunk -->

### This inhibitory neurotransmitter governs the stimulatory neurotransmitter

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine from overwhelming your brain. Adequate serotonin levels make

### One case study out of India reviewed the case of a 57-year-old woman who

<!-- chunk -->

### was given months of anti-psychotic and antidepressant medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### Including 2 rounds of electro-shock therapy before anyone thought to

<!-- chunk -->

### check her Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### This woman’s symptoms included anxiety, constipation, movement

<!-- chunk -->

### abnormalities, perceptual disturbances (hearing her name called), lethargy,

<!-- chunk -->

### tearfulness and finally catatonia. She remained depressed, suicidal, and

<!-- chunk -->

### lethargic despite her treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Within 2 months of identifying her Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency and subsequent

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment, this woman reverted to her baseline 14 years before. And

<!-- chunk -->

### remained stable with no additional treatment.1343


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency usually causes neurological and psychiatric issues

<!-- chunk -->

### in adults aged 40 – 90. B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency rarely affects younger people. But

<!-- chunk -->

### can be a problem if the mother is deficient during pregnancy.

<!-- chunk -->

### A B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency can manifest as disease of the spinal cord (myelopathy),

<!-- chunk -->

### disease of the nerves (neuropathy), sensory disturbances, gait

<!-- chunk -->

### abnormalities, weakness, cognitive and behavioral disturbances, and

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neuron myelin sheath is damaged

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Neurons degenerate

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Weakness, vision problems, cognition issues, abnormal reflexes

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Bladder and erectile dysfunction

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Tingling sensation, pain and numbness

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Delusions, hallucinations, memory decline, depression and dementia

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Brain shrinkage

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Impaired DNA synthesis and replication


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency can often be caused by Pernicious anemia which is

<!-- chunk -->

### an autoimmune disease that affects the mucous membrane layer of the

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach. This can be a result of destruction of parietal cells, lack of

<!-- chunk -->

### hydrochloric acid, or a failure to produce intrinsic factor.

<!-- chunk -->

### Parietal cells are required to create intrinsic factor to supply your body

<!-- chunk -->

### with adequate Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### . When these cells are damaged, intrinsic factor

### is not produced. And B


<!-- chunk -->

### cannot be absorbed for use by your body and


<!-- chunk -->

### Parietal cell death can be caused by excess alcohol consumption,

<!-- chunk -->

### Intrinsic factor is required for Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### absorption from food or

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements. If left untreated you experience B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency even if you’re

<!-- chunk -->

### getting B

## (Cobalamin) benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### When you take Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (Cobalamin) as a nootropic supplement, it is

<!-- chunk -->

### transported across your intestinal wall by the carrier protein intrinsic

<!-- chunk -->

### factor. It is then degraded, freeing cobalamin to be attached to

<!-- chunk -->

### transcobalamin II for transport to cells in your body.1344


<!-- chunk -->

### is a co-factor in the one-carbon cycle that is required for the

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis of DNA, RNA, neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, dopamine,

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA, norepinephrine and serotonin), and the myelin sheath that protects

<!-- chunk -->

### each of the axons in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### This one-carbon pathway is involved in the synthesis of the amino acid

<!-- chunk -->

### methionine. This amino acid donates methyl groups for the methylation of

<!-- chunk -->

### DNA, RNA, neurotransmitters, and myelin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methionine is synthesized from the amino acid homocysteine. Preventing

<!-- chunk -->

### high levels of this amino acid to accumulate will prevent problems

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout your body including neurodegenerative disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cobalamin is also required for the conversion of methylmelonyl CoA into

<!-- chunk -->

### succinyl Coenzyme-A for the myelin sheath that protects your axons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Problems with this conversion degrades myelin. Causing problems with

<!-- chunk -->

### your central nervous system and damaging axons needed for brain cell

<!-- chunk -->

### signaling.


<!-- chunk -->

### can:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reduce the severity and frequency of asthma attacks and allergies

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reverse early signs of Alzheimer’s Disease if caught in time

<!-- chunk -->

### •Lift your mood by boosting the “happy molecule” serotonin in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reduce the side effects of Metformin in diabetes patients

<!-- chunk -->

### •Provide optimal concentration, focus and memory

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reduce the risk of macular degeneration and prevent blindness

<!-- chunk -->

### •Maintain healthy hair, skin, and nails

<!-- chunk -->

### •Remove homocysteine and protect your heart

<!-- chunk -->

### •Raise sperm counts and improve sperm mobility in men

<!-- chunk -->

### •Prevent neuron damage if you lack intrinsic factor

<!-- chunk -->

### •Reduce some of the symptoms of schizophrenia

<!-- chunk -->

### •Help prevent osteoporosis and build strong bones

<!-- chunk -->

### The key message here is to maintain optimal Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### levels in your

<!-- chunk -->

### body and brain. Don’t be duped by marketers selling Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### energy

<!-- chunk -->

### drinks boasting more energy. Or a magic pill to boost memory, or aid in

<!-- chunk -->

### weight loss.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have a specific health problem like pernicious anemia or are

<!-- chunk -->

### deficient in this vitamin, then B


<!-- chunk -->

### can help. If you maintain optimal levels

<!-- chunk -->

### of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### in your system, supplementing will not increase your

<!-- chunk -->

### energy levels.


<!-- chunk -->

### is a key brain vitamin that plays an important role in a healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous system and optimally functioning brain. Low levels of B


<!-- chunk -->

### can

<!-- chunk -->

### definitely lead to poor memory and cognition.


<!-- chunk -->

## (Cobalamin) feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers who supplement with Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### report a reduction in brain

<!-- chunk -->

### fog and better sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### People on statins for cholesterol and metformin for diabetes report a

<!-- chunk -->

### dramatic decrease in pain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers report better focus and mood, colors seem brighter and more

<!-- chunk -->

### intense, energy levels improve, and an overall improved sense of well-

<!-- chunk -->

### being.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficient you may feel a big boost in energy. And

<!-- chunk -->

### feelings of deep exhaustion can disappear within a few days.


<!-- chunk -->

### Much of the research in Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency are presented as

<!-- chunk -->

### individual ‘case reports’ on one person.

<!-- chunk -->

### One report in French was about a woman with no history of psychiatric

<!-- chunk -->

### problems. But upon admission she was uncooperative, disoriented, had

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and attention problems, a sleep disorder and she looked older

<!-- chunk -->

### than her real age.

<!-- chunk -->

### This woman was depressed, had a guilt complex, devalued herself, and her

<!-- chunk -->

### movements and speech were very slow. A lab test revealed she had a

<!-- chunk -->

### problem with intrinsic factor.

<!-- chunk -->

### Her therapy was Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### replacement using hydroxycobalamin 1,000

<!-- chunk -->

### mg per day for 10 days. Her mental state improved dramatically within a

<!-- chunk -->

### few days.1345

<!-- chunk -->

### Another case report was of a middle-aged man with Obsessive-Compulsive

<!-- chunk -->

### Disorder (OCD). He was given methylcobalamin therapy and symptoms of

<!-- chunk -->

### OCD dramatically improved.1346


<!-- chunk -->

## and Folate Prevent Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### A study in Stockholm explored the association of low Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### folate levels with the occurrence of Alzheimer’s Disease. A population-

<!-- chunk -->

### based study sampled 370 non-demented people aged 75 years or older and

<!-- chunk -->

### who had not been treated with B


<!-- chunk -->

### and folate.

<!-- chunk -->

### This group was followed for 3 years to detect the incidence of

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s. The researchers compared low levels of B


<!-- chunk -->

### and folate with

<!-- chunk -->

### people who had normal levels of the two vitamins.

<!-- chunk -->

### Subjects who had low levels of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### or folate had twice the risk of

<!-- chunk -->

### developing Alzheimer’s. And this association was even stronger in

<!-- chunk -->

### subjects with good baseline cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study concluded that Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### and folate may be involved in the

<!-- chunk -->

### development of Alzheimer’s Disease. And that monitoring blood B


<!-- chunk -->

### folate concentration in the elderly may be relevant for the prevention of

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s Disease.1347


<!-- chunk -->

## (Cobalamin) to Treat Depression

<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows that people with major depression often have low blood

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of folate and Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### . Low folate levels are also linked to poor

<!-- chunk -->

### response to antidepressants. And treatment with folic acid and/or Vitamin


<!-- chunk -->

### has been shown to improve response to antidepressants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Folate and Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### are involved in one-carbon metabolism in which

<!-- chunk -->

### SAM-e is formed. SAM-e donates methyl groups that are crucial for

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Increased homocysteine is a functional marker of both folate and Vitamin


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency. Increased homocysteine levels are found in depressed

<!-- chunk -->

### patients. One study out of Norway showed increased blood levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### homocysteine were associated with increased risk of depression (but not

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety).

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded that doses of both Methylfolate (800 mcg daily)

<!-- chunk -->

### and Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (1 mg daily) should be tried to improve treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### outcomes for depression.1348


<!-- chunk -->

### is water-soluble and considered non-toxic in recommended

<!-- chunk -->

### doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### A varied diet including meat, seafood and milk products should provide

<!-- chunk -->

### enough Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### to prevent deficiency. But vegetarians and vegans

<!-- chunk -->

### cannot get enough B


<!-- chunk -->

### from food and should supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Typical recommended dosage for nootropic benefit and optimal brain

<!-- chunk -->

### health is 100 mcg or 1 mg of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### Neurohackers older than 40 and those who have a problem with Vitamin


<!-- chunk -->

### absorption should use 100 – 400 mcg or 1-4 mg of B


<!-- chunk -->

### If you test Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficient, recommended dosage is 2,000 mcg daily

<!-- chunk -->

### for a week, then 1,000 mcg doses of B


<!-- chunk -->

### once per week for a month.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thereafter, your maintenance dose is 1,000 mcg monthly.1349


<!-- chunk -->

### (Cobalamin) is non-toxic. So is considered well-tolerated and

<!-- chunk -->

### safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Doses as high as 2 mg of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### daily by mouth or 1 mg monthly by

<!-- chunk -->

### injection have been shown to produce no significant side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### When high doses of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### are given orally, only a small percentage

<!-- chunk -->

### can be absorbed which likely explains the low toxicity levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Proton pump inhibitors and other drugs used to treat acid reflux is known

<!-- chunk -->

### to prevent absorption of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### . So you may need to take B


<!-- chunk -->

### sublingually.

<!-- chunk -->

### Antibiotics, drugs to treat gout and metformin to treat diabetes all

<!-- chunk -->

### decrease Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### levels or B


<!-- chunk -->

### absorption. If you use any of these

<!-- chunk -->

### drugs you should have your levels checked and possibly supplement with


<!-- chunk -->

### Nitrous oxide used as an anesthetic and recreational drug oxidizes and

<!-- chunk -->

### inactivates Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### . So you should likely get tested and possibly

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement with B


<!-- chunk -->

### is available as tablets, capsules, liquid drops, sublingual

<!-- chunk -->

### tablets, sprays and lozenges.

<!-- chunk -->

### The sublingual tablets, sprays and lozenges are marketed as more

<!-- chunk -->

### absorbable or bioavailable. Some clinical studies do not support this

<!-- chunk -->

### claim, but user experience shows otherwise.

<!-- chunk -->

### Logic tells us that a lozenge or spray absorbed under your tongue gets into

<!-- chunk -->

### your bloodstream and across the blood-brain barrier more readily than

<!-- chunk -->

### something you swallow and need to digest.

<!-- chunk -->

### Low quality Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### supplements, and B


<!-- chunk -->

### found in multivitamins or

<!-- chunk -->

## B-Complex formulas, is usually cyanocobalamin. This form of B


<!-- chunk -->

### is not

<!-- chunk -->

### well absorbed and produces a small amount of cyanide in your body

<!-- chunk -->

### (cyanocobalamin).

<!-- chunk -->

### Higher quality Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

## comes as methylcobalamin or

<!-- chunk -->

## adenosylcobalamin which are the forms of B


<!-- chunk -->

### naturally occurring in your

<!-- chunk -->

### body.

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylcobalamin is your better choice if you are deficient in B


<!-- chunk -->

### or have

<!-- chunk -->

### the MTHFR genetic defect which reduces your ability to methylate this

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamin.

<!-- chunk -->

## Adenosylcobalamin works better for some who want to avoid the cyanide

<!-- chunk -->

### that comes in cyanocobalamin, and who can’t tolerate methylcobalamin.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hydroxycobalamin is another high-quality form of Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### that

<!-- chunk -->

### converts to methylcobalamin in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you test Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficient, your doctor may encourage you to get


<!-- chunk -->

## shots. Especially if you have pernicious anemia, nerve

<!-- chunk -->

### damage or chronic digestive problems like Crohn’s Disease or ulcerative

<!-- chunk -->

### colitis.

<!-- chunk -->

## But research has found that taking oral B


<!-- chunk -->

## supplements is as effective as

# B


<!-- chunk -->

## shots.1350 And user reviews support this finding.

<!-- chunk -->

### Note that Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

## needs to be balanced with Vitamin B

## and Folate

<!-- chunk -->

### (Methylfolate) for best results if using as a nootropic supplement.


<!-- chunk -->

## (Cobalamin) 1 mg per day

### as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does not make Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### on its own. So to get its benefits you

<!-- chunk -->

### must get it from food or take it as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend staying away from cheap cyanocobalamin B


<!-- chunk -->

## Go with Methylcobalamin, Adenosylcobalamin, or Hydroxycobalamin.


<!-- chunk -->

### is especially helpful for those dealing with brain fog, fatigue,

<!-- chunk -->

### nerve pain, sleep and memory problems.


<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation is critical for anyone over 40 years old

<!-- chunk -->

### because of absorption issues with B

### from food.


<!-- chunk -->

### is also particularly helpful if you are using proton pump

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibitors for acid reflux, have Type-1 diabetes, or show positive for

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia or Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### The recommended dosage for Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency is 2,000 mcg daily

<!-- chunk -->

### for a week, then 1,000 mcg doses of B

### Remember that Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

## needs to be balanced with Vitamin B

## Folate (Methylfolate) for best results if using as a nootropic supplement.


# Vitamin D

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D has been shown to relieve depression & SAD, is critical for

<!-- chunk -->

### learning & memory, and helps prevent age-related cognitive decline

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

## (cholecalciferol or calciol) is the fat-soluble steroid hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### form of Vitamin D. The “sunshine vitamin” is considered essential. Your

<!-- chunk -->

### skin synthesizes Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### from ultraviolet-B (UVB) sunlight.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nearly every tissue and cell type in your body and brain has Vitamin D

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors (VDR). It’s commonly associated with immune and bone health.

<!-- chunk -->

### But Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### as a nootropic supplement is critical for optimal cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### health. It’s an integral part of neurotransmitter synthesis, gene expression,

<!-- chunk -->

### DNA maintenance and repair, and the forms of neuroplasticity needed for

<!-- chunk -->

### memory formation and retrieval.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D deficiency (hypovitaminosis D) is an undeclared worldwide

<!-- chunk -->

### pandemic affecting nearly 50% of the population on this planet.

<!-- chunk -->

### The major cause of this Vitamin D deficiency is inadequate exposure to

<!-- chunk -->

### sunlight. Wearing sunscreen with a SPF of 30 reduces Vitamin D synthesis

<!-- chunk -->

### in your skin by more than 95%.1351

<!-- chunk -->

### Working and living indoors in our modern world contributes to this

<!-- chunk -->

### problem. Those with a naturally dark skin tone require 3 – 5-times longer

<!-- chunk -->

### sun exposure to the make the same amount of Vitamin D as those with a

<!-- chunk -->

### lighter skin tone.1352

<!-- chunk -->

### Also at risk of Vitamin D deficiency includes anyone who works indoors,

<!-- chunk -->

### breastfed infants, older adults, and anyone homebound, or who wear long

<!-- chunk -->

### garments for religious reasons. If you have fat malabsorption issues,

<!-- chunk -->

### obese, or on certain medications you are also at risk.

<!-- chunk -->

### You risk a host of problems if you don’t get enough Vitamin D. Including

<!-- chunk -->

### Type-2 diabetes, depression, cognitive impairment, Parkinson’s, or

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s Disease among others.

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin D exists in two forms. Vitamin D

<!-- chunk -->

## 2

<!-- chunk -->

### is obtained from the UV

<!-- chunk -->

### irradiation of the yeast sterol ergosterol and is found naturally in sun-

<!-- chunk -->

### exposed mushrooms.

<!-- chunk -->

## UVB light from the sun strikes the skin, and humans synthesize Vitamin

# D


<!-- chunk -->

### , which is the most “natural” form.

<!-- chunk -->

### Note: I’ll be using Vitamin D and Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### interchangeably throughout

<!-- chunk -->

### this chapter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with high quality Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### is inexpensive and simple. If

<!-- chunk -->

### you could do one thing to improve the efficacy and potency of your

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic stack. Add Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### to your daily stack.


<!-- chunk -->

### is unique because it is not a standard vitamin. It’s actually a

<!-- chunk -->

### fat-soluble steroid hormone.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D is mostly made in your skin from sun exposure. Not from food

<!-- chunk -->

### like most of our other vitamins.

<!-- chunk -->

### When Ultraviolet-B (UVB) light from the sun strikes your skin, your body

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesizes Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D that comes from your skin, or from food or a supplement, is not

<!-- chunk -->

### active. It first requires hydroxylation in your liver by the enzyme vitamin

<!-- chunk -->

### D-25-hydroxylase (25-OHase) to 25(OH)D.1353

<!-- chunk -->

### Then 25(OH)D requires further hydroxylation in your kidneys by

<!-- chunk -->

### 25(OH)D-1-OHase to form the biologically active form of vitamin D

<!-- chunk -->

## called 1,25(OH)2D (cholecalciferol).

<!-- chunk -->

### You get some Vitamin D from foods like fatty fish (tuna, salmon, and

<!-- chunk -->

### mackerel), beef liver, cheese, egg yolks, and mushrooms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some foods in the USA are fortified with Vitamin D. It’s added to

<!-- chunk -->

### breakfast cereals, soy beverages, yogurt, and margarine. Check the

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrition fact panel on the food label.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cholecalciferol is also produced industrially for use in nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements, and to fortify foods. It is produced using ultraviolet

<!-- chunk -->

### irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol extracted from lanolin in sheep’s wool.

### is involved in the synthesis of GABA, glutamate and

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamine, and dopamine in the brain.1356


<!-- chunk -->

### protects against DNA damage through prevention of telomere

<!-- chunk -->

### shortening and inhibition of telomerase activity. And prevents oxidative

<!-- chunk -->

### damage to DNA.1357


<!-- chunk -->

### is involved in neuromodulation, regulation of neurotrophic

<!-- chunk -->

### factors, neuroprotection, neuroplasticity, and brain development. All in

<!-- chunk -->

### areas of the brain associated with depression. Supplementation could be an

<!-- chunk -->

### important part of treatment of depression.1358

<!-- chunk -->

### Recent research shows Vitamin D is involved in nerve growth factor (NGF)

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis. Which is responsible for the growth and maintenance of


<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D is also involved in neuron apoptosis. Studies have shown that

<!-- chunk -->

### low Vitamin D levels interrupts this cell cycle. Leading to several

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological disorders including dementia, Parkinson’s, MLS, epilepsy,

<!-- chunk -->

### and schizophrenia.1359

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease is associated with a decrease in Vitamin D receptors

<!-- chunk -->

### in the hippocampus. Lack of gene expression from insufficient Vitamin D

<!-- chunk -->

### contributes to Parkinson’s Disease.1360

<!-- chunk -->

### Hypovitaminosis D (low Vitamin D) is associated with an increase in

<!-- chunk -->

### proinflammatory cytokines and a decrease in anti-inflammatory cytokines.

<!-- chunk -->

### The increase in these specific cytokines is associated with the degradation

<!-- chunk -->

### of the myelin sheath. Leading to Multiple Sclerosis (MLS).

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies are currently underway for using Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### to reduce seizures in

<!-- chunk -->

### those dealing with epilepsy. The anticonvulsant effects are based on


<!-- chunk -->

### ’s ability to regulate the expression of genes. A process that is

<!-- chunk -->

### mediated by Vitamin D receptors.1361

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists and researchers in labs around the world continue to build on the

<!-- chunk -->

### knowledgebase for Vitamin D. And how the sunshine vitamin affects

<!-- chunk -->

### human cognition and overall health.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Vitamin D work in the brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Vitamin D helps relieve depression. Vitamin D activates genes that

<!-- chunk -->

### regulate your immune system and the release of neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### including dopamine and serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research has also located Vitamin D receptors in areas of the brain linked

<!-- chunk -->

### to depression. A meta-analysis of clinical studies on depression and

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D status including 31,424 participants showed that low Vitamin D

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrations is associated with depression.1362

<!-- chunk -->

### One of several other studies on Vitamin D1363 and depression showed that

<!-- chunk -->

### older adults with low Vitamin D levels were 11-times more likely to be

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed than those with normal levels.1364

<!-- chunk -->

### And if you’re currently using antidepressants without much success, this

<!-- chunk -->

### next study may provide some hope.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study conducted in Iran with 42 patients with major depressive disorder

<!-- chunk -->

### participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. One

<!-- chunk -->

### group received 1,500 IU of Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### plus 20 mg of fluoxetine (Prozac®),

<!-- chunk -->

### or fluoxetine alone for 8 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this 8-week trial, the vitamin D + fluoxetine combination was superior

<!-- chunk -->

### to fluoxetine alone in controlling depressive symptoms.1365

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Vitamin D is essential for learning and memory. Vitamin D has

<!-- chunk -->

### been shown to play a critical role in neuron cell growth and

<!-- chunk -->

### differentiation, neuron transmission, and the neuroplasticity that’s

<!-- chunk -->

### essential for optimal learning and memory.1366

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D has been shown in the lab to protect against age-related

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive decline. In one study conducted in Detroit, researchers worked

<!-- chunk -->

### with aged rats. Older rats have problems with cognitive testing. Along

<!-- chunk -->

### with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, decreased levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-inflammatory cytokines, and higher levels of amyloid-beta proteins in

<!-- chunk -->

### their brains.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with Vitamin D for only 21 days reversed the inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### and improved the clearance of amyloid-beta. Showing potential for using

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D to prevent age-related cognitive decline.1367


<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D deficiency is a global health problem. Over a billion people

<!-- chunk -->

### worldwide are Vitamin D deficient.1368

<!-- chunk -->

### The major cause of this deficiency is the lack of appreciation that getting

<!-- chunk -->

### enough sun every day is the major source of Vitamin D for most people.

<!-- chunk -->

### Very few foods contain Vitamin D. And foods that are fortified are

<!-- chunk -->

### inadequate to provide a child or adult’s daily requirement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Top that off with the media and mainstream medical establishment

<!-- chunk -->

### hysteria about skin cancer. And the use of sunblock.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you work indoors, wear ‘extensive’ clothing, use sunblock, are dark

<!-- chunk -->

### skinned, overweight, aged, or consciously avoid the sun, you are at risk for

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Pathogens can inhibit Vitamin D receptors

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Lack of natural sun exposure depresses Vitamin D levels

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Caffeine inhibits Vitamin D receptors

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Testosterone levels decline

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Risk of bone fractures increases

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Increased risk of cancer, autoimmune disease, hypertension, infectious

<!-- chunk -->

### disease

<!-- chunk -->

### ↓ Severe Vitamin D deficiency can result in dementia and Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### ↑ Increase in symptoms of depression


<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation can help alleviate depression and improve

<!-- chunk -->

### learning and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin D benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Not too long ago, Vitamin D was simply known as the ‘bone vitamin’. But

<!-- chunk -->

### there has been a surge in Vitamin D research over the last decade.

<!-- chunk -->

### Out of that research, it was discovered that nearly every cell type and

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue in your body have receptors for this essential vitamin. And quickly

<!-- chunk -->

### changed how we understand the role of Vitamin D in the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### We now know that Vitamin D deficiency is a problem worldwide. To put

<!-- chunk -->

### this in perspective, studies estimate 64% of Americans don’t get enough

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D.1369

### We now have clinical evidence that Vitamin D influences our autoimmune

<!-- chunk -->

### system, heart health, prevents infectious disease, and supports optimal


<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease, asthma, autism, depression, cancer, and diabetes.

<!-- chunk -->

### A Japanese study found that 1,200 IU of Vitamin D daily reduced the risk

<!-- chunk -->

### of getting the flu by almost 50%.1370

<!-- chunk -->

### One 7-year study showed Vitamin D deficiency substantially increased the

<!-- chunk -->

### risk of non-Alzheimer’s dementia.1371 Another 7-year study associated

<!-- chunk -->

### higher Vitamin D levels with a significantly lower risk of developing

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s.1372

<!-- chunk -->

### Animal and human studies suggest that Vitamin D could help in the

<!-- chunk -->

### prevention and treatment of cognitive decline and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Vitamin D feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### If you work or spend most of your time indoors, you’re getting less sun

<!-- chunk -->

### than you should. And you may notice that your mood deteriorates as you

<!-- chunk -->

### spend less time outside. This is especially noticeable in the winter if you

<!-- chunk -->

### live well far north or south of the Equator.

<!-- chunk -->

### A capsule of Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### in the morning is like a little dose of sunshine.

<!-- chunk -->

### You’ll feel brighter even on the grayest of days.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many who supplement with Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### report feeling happier. Energy

<!-- chunk -->

### levels are higher, and feelings of depression stay away.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some report a noticeable decrease in fibromyalgia pain. Pain after

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise is less pronounced.

<!-- chunk -->

### Seasonal depression is officially known as “Seasonal Affective Disorder”

<!-- chunk -->

### (SAD). Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### is a potent remedy for many experiencing SAD. It’ll

<!-- chunk -->

### keep that winter depression at bay and reduce mood swings.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many report that supplementing with Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### reduces insomnia. Sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### is deeper and your mood is better the next day.


<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin D may prevent autism

<!-- chunk -->

### A study led by Professor Brue Ames of Children’s Hospital Oakland

<!-- chunk -->

### Research Institute demonstrated that oxytocin, serotonin, and vasopressin

<!-- chunk -->

### are all activated by Vitamin D.

<!-- chunk -->

### Abnormal social behavior is one of the symptoms of autism. And has been

<!-- chunk -->

### previously linked to low serotonin and Vitamin D levels in the brain. This

<!-- chunk -->

### study shed light on the mechanism of action that could explain this

<!-- chunk -->

### relationship.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study showed that Vitamin D activates the transcription of the

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin-synthesizing gene tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) in the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### at a Vitamin D response element (VDRE). And suppresses the transcription

<!-- chunk -->

### of TPH1 in tissues outside the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study explains that this mechanism shows how low Vitamin D

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone levels result in aberrant serotonin synthesis. Leading to abnormal

<!-- chunk -->

### brain development.

<!-- chunk -->

## The study authors suggested, “Supplementation with Vitamin D and

<!-- chunk -->

## tryptophan is a practical and affordable solution to help prevent autism

<!-- chunk -->

### and possibly ameliorate some symptoms of the disorder.”1373

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin D may prevent dementia & stroke

<!-- chunk -->

### Dementia is one of the greatest health challenges of our time. An

<!-- chunk -->

### estimated 44 million people worldwide suffer from dementia. This number

<!-- chunk -->

### is expected to triple by 2050 as the population ages.

<!-- chunk -->

### A recent study at the University of Exeter Medical School found that

<!-- chunk -->

### adults who were slightly deficient in Vitamin D have a 53% increased risk

<!-- chunk -->

### of developing dementia of any kind.

<!-- chunk -->

### That risk increased to 125% in those who were severely deficient in

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D. The same study found that the moderately deficient group were

<!-- chunk -->

### 69% more likely to develop Alzheimer’s. And the severely deficient were

<!-- chunk -->

### 122% more likely to develop this disease.1374

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study at the University of Heidelberg in Germany included 3,316

<!-- chunk -->

### patients who were referred for evaluation of their arteries. Those with low

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D levels were found to be more likely to have a fatal stroke within

<!-- chunk -->

### the next 7 years.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded, “vitamin D supplementation is a promising

<!-- chunk -->

### approach in the prevention of strokes”.1375

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin D prevents depression

<!-- chunk -->

### Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a mood disorder characterized by

<!-- chunk -->

### depression that occurs during fall and winter months when sunlight levels

<!-- chunk -->

### are low.

<!-- chunk -->

### SAD typically coincides with a sudden drop in Vitamin D levels in the

<!-- chunk -->

### body. Several studies have suggested that SAD could be due to changing


<!-- chunk -->

### levels. Which affects serotonin levels in the brain.1376

<!-- chunk -->

### One study with adults dealing with Vitamin D deficiency found that

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with 4,000 IU of Vitamin D daily for 2 months relieved

<!-- chunk -->

### their depression symptoms.1377

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study recruited 441 people in an outpatient clinic in Norway. This

<!-- chunk -->

### randomized, double-blind trial had patients using 20,000 or 40,000 IU

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D per week or placebo for 1 year.

<!-- chunk -->

### Subjects with serum Vitamin D levels below 40 nmol L were significantly

<!-- chunk -->

### more depressed than those with levels above 40 nmol L. In the two groups

<!-- chunk -->

### given Vitamin D there was a significant improvement in depression

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms after 1 year. But no improvement in the placebo group.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study concluded, “It appears to be a relation between serum levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### 25(OH)D and symptoms of depression. Supplementation with high doses of

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamin D seems to ameliorate these symptoms indicating a possible

<!-- chunk -->

### causal relationship.”1378

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin D Recommended Dosage

<!-- chunk -->

### The Institute of Medicine recommends 4,000 IU per day for Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin D is fat-soluble. So make sure you take it with a meal containing

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy fats. Or a tablespoon of unrefined coconut oil or extra-virgin olive

<!-- chunk -->

### oil.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggests

<!-- chunk -->

### optimal Vitamin D status is achieved with a serum (blood) 25-

<!-- chunk -->

### hydroxyvitamin D concentration >75 nmol/L.

<!-- chunk -->

### To achieve blood levels of 100 nmol/L, research has found that you need

<!-- chunk -->

### total daily Vitamin D supplementation of 4,000 IU.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is possible to get your daily dose of Vitamin D from the sun. And total-

<!-- chunk -->

### body sun exposure provides the equivalent of 10,000 UI of Vitamin D.1379

<!-- chunk -->

### But chances are none of us has the opportunity to sunbathe nude every

<!-- chunk -->

### single day to get our dose of Vitamin D.

<!-- chunk -->

### To determine how much Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### you needed to take to achieve optimal

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrations of this crucial vitamin, researchers recruited 138 volunteers

<!-- chunk -->

### for a 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found that if your blood Vitamin D status was less than

<!-- chunk -->

### nmol/L you needed a daily intake of 5,000 IU. And for those above the

<!-- chunk -->

### nmol/L you needed a dose of 3,800 IU of Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### per day.1380

<!-- chunk -->

### The Institute of Medicine also found that the dose for lowest observed

<!-- chunk -->

### adverse effect level is 40,000 IU of Vitamin D daily for at least 12 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

## Get your Vitamin D levels checked. Be sure the lab tests for “25-

<!-- chunk -->

## hydroxyvitamin D”. To raise your blood levels of Vitamin D to optimal

<!-- chunk -->

### levels, you need to take 100 IU of Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### for each 1 ng/mL you need to

<!-- chunk -->

### raise it.1381

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin D side effects

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D is non-toxic. So is considered well-tolerated and safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Side effects are rare but can include dry mouth, fatigue, headaches,

<!-- chunk -->

### metallic taste, nausea, sleepiness, and vomiting.

<!-- chunk -->

### Doses of Vitamin D higher than 4,000 IU daily is possibly unsafe because

<!-- chunk -->

### it could cause excessive blood levels of calcium. But note that much

<!-- chunk -->

### higher doses are sometimes used for short-term treatment of Vitamin D

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D could worsen atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). If you

<!-- chunk -->

### have sarcoidosis, histoplasmosis, are hyperthyroid, have lymphoma, or

<!-- chunk -->

### tuberculosis Vitamin D could increase blood calcium levels causing kidney

<!-- chunk -->

### stones and other problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D may affect blood pressure. So be cautious about using Vitamin D

<!-- chunk -->

### if you’re dealing with blood pressure disorders, are taking drugs or

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements that affect blood pressure.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D may affect blood sugar levels. So if you’re taking drugs for

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes or insulin you should monitor your Vitamin D levels and adjust

<!-- chunk -->

### medication as necessary.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some drugs used to treat lower cholesterol, psoriasis, calcium channel

<!-- chunk -->

### blockers, corticosteroids, and others may interact with Vitamin D.

<!-- chunk -->

## Type of Vitamin D to buy

<!-- chunk -->

### The preferred way of getting Vitamin D is by exposing your skin to the

<!-- chunk -->

### sun. But the color of your skin will affect the synthesis of this essential

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lighter skin may require 45 minutes of exposure 3-times per week. Dark

<!-- chunk -->

### skin may require up to 3-hours of exposure 3-times per week.

<!-- chunk -->

### But since most of us spend so much time indoors. And have the nasty habit

<!-- chunk -->

### of using sunscreen when we do go outside. To maintain adequate Vitamin

<!-- chunk -->

### D levels supplementation is best.

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

## (cholecalciferol) is preferred over Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### (ergocalciferol),

<!-- chunk -->

### since D


<!-- chunk -->

### is the type of Vitamin D your body synthesizes naturally.

<!-- chunk -->

### A meta-analysis by the Cochrane Database investigated mortality rates

<!-- chunk -->

### for those who supplemented with Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### vs Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### . The analysis

<!-- chunk -->

### of 50 randomized controlled trials included 95,000 participants showed:

<!-- chunk -->

### •A 6% risk reduction among those who used Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### •A 2% risk increase among those who used Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### The overwhelming evidence shows that you are more likely to die using


<!-- chunk -->

### rather than D


<!-- chunk -->

### .1382

<!-- chunk -->

### So if your doctor prescribes synthetic Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### (Drisdol), kindly decline

<!-- chunk -->

### and get a Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### supplement at the vitamin shop.


<!-- chunk -->

### is available in softgel capsules, tablets and as a liquid.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have trouble digesting fat, Vitamin D injections are also available by

<!-- chunk -->

### prescription.

<!-- chunk -->

## Calcitriol is a synthetic Vitamin D analog available by prescription which

<!-- chunk -->

### is used by dialysis and hypoparathyroid patients.


<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

## 4,000 IU’s per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does make Vitamin D on its own by synthesizing it from UVB

<!-- chunk -->

### sunlight on exposed skin. Which is the preferred way of getting Vitamin D.

<!-- chunk -->

### But all kinds of things can interfere with getting enough Vitamin D from

<!-- chunk -->

### sunlight. Fall and Winter in both hemispheres, cloud cover, smog, skin

<!-- chunk -->

### color, sunscreen, and too much clothing are all factors.

<!-- chunk -->

### And most of us spend so much time indoors, to get its benefits you should

<!-- chunk -->

### take Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s best if you get your Vitamin D levels checked. Be sure the lab tests for

<!-- chunk -->

## “25-hydroxyvitamin D”. To raise your blood levels of Vitamin D to

<!-- chunk -->

### optimal levels, you need to take 100 IU of Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### for each 1 ng/mL you

<!-- chunk -->

### need to raise it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D is especially helpful for anxiety and depression. Vitamin D

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency has been associated with depression, schizophrenia, psychotic

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms, and suicide.1383

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D is also helpful for those dealing with autism, Alzheimer’s, and


<!-- chunk -->

### Doses should not exceed 10,000 IU daily unless supervised by a doctor.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D toxicity can happen with doses exceeding 40,000 IU per day for

<!-- chunk -->

### an extended period.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D supplementation is one of the simplest and least expensive ways

<!-- chunk -->

### to optimize your brain. And should be part of every nootropic stack.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D is fat-soluble. So make sure you take your dose with a meal. Or

<!-- chunk -->

### a high-quality fat like unrefined coconut or extra virgin olive oil.

<!-- chunk -->

### But please see the “Vitamin D Side Effects” section of this chapter above

<!-- chunk -->

### for conditions and medication interactions before you start using Vitamin

<!-- chunk -->

### D.


# Zinc

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc improves alertness, cognition, focus, memory, learning, recall,

<!-- chunk -->

### reduces brain fog, is an antioxidant, helps neuroplasticity, and protects

<!-- chunk -->

### against glutamate-toxicity.

<!-- chunk -->

## Zinc is an essential trace element required for optimal brain health and


<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc is integral to the synthesis of proteins, the regulation of signaling

<!-- chunk -->

### cascades, gene transcription and neurotransmitter transport. It’s involved

<!-- chunk -->

### in DNA repair and synthesis and methylation.

<!-- chunk -->

### You may think of zinc as a natural cold remedy or the white lip balm you

<!-- chunk -->

### use at the beach. But zinc is needed in small amounts every day to

<!-- chunk -->

### maintain optimal brain function and overall health.

<!-- chunk -->

### In practical terms, adequate levels of zinc in your system works as an

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant fighting free radical damage. It helps maintain both male and

<!-- chunk -->

### female hormone balance. And zinc plays a role in neurotransmitter release

<!-- chunk -->

### affecting learning, memory, and mood.1384

<!-- chunk -->

### When zinc levels are low, you’ll feel fatigued, concentration will be poor,

<!-- chunk -->

### you’ll get sick more often, and simple wounds won’t heal.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc inhibits NMDA receptors which reduces glutamate toxicity. And zinc

<!-- chunk -->

### modulates the activity of proteins such as receptors and enzymes that are

<!-- chunk -->

### involved in the regulation of macromolecules, the regulation of signaling

<!-- chunk -->

### cascades and gene transcription, and transport processes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Low zinc levels are found in those suffering from depression, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### lower the level the more severe the depression. Zinc increases serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### uptake in select brain regions which boosts the efficacy of antidepressants.

<!-- chunk -->

### And it reduces depression because is increases BDNF.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc is involved in preserving genomic stability by regulating redox

<!-- chunk -->

### homeostasis (both oxidant and antioxidant signaling), DNA repair,

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis, and methylation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines (including nuclear

<!-- chunk -->

### factor-κB). And zinc protects against cognitive decline due to toxic copper

<!-- chunk -->

### levels.1385

<!-- chunk -->

### Adequate levels of zinc are crucial for growth and development when

<!-- chunk -->

### you’re young. And required for proper taste and smell.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our earliest physical evidence of zinc for therapeutic use comes from the

<!-- chunk -->

### wreck of the ancient ship “Relitto del Pozzino” which sank off the coast of

<!-- chunk -->

### Tuscany around 120 B.C. Archaeologists found the remains of a 2,000-

<!-- chunk -->

### year-old medicine chest containing several tin pyxis (cylindrical box with

<!-- chunk -->

### a lid).

<!-- chunk -->

### Inside one of the tins were five medicinal tablets about the size of an

<!-- chunk -->

### American quarter and perfectly preserved. The pills contained a zinc

<!-- chunk -->

### compound which ancient writings tell us may have been used as an

<!-- chunk -->

### eyewash.1386

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc deficiency is common around the world including in the USA. This

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency occurs because we don’t eat enough foods that contain zinc.1387

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body needs about 10 – 20 mg of zinc per day because it can’t store

<!-- chunk -->

### zinc.

<!-- chunk -->

### You get zinc from eating seafood like oysters or lobster. Beef, pork, and

<!-- chunk -->

### chicken provide smaller amounts of zinc per serving. And it’s also present

<!-- chunk -->

### in eggs, yogurt, cheese, and some nuts.

<!-- chunk -->

### But not only don’t most of us eat enough zinc-containing food, many

<!-- chunk -->

### plants contain phytates which block the absorption of zinc in your body. So

<!-- chunk -->

### vegetarians are particularly vulnerable to zinc deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### We’ll dive deeper into zinc deficiency and its causes below in the section

<!-- chunk -->

### “How things go bad”. And we’ll cover the easily recognizable symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### of deficiency as well.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Zinc work in the brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc boosts brain health and function in several ways. But two in


<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Zinc is an antidepressant. Zinc plays a role in modulating your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain and body’s response to stress and depression. More than

<!-- chunk -->

### enzymes in your body use zinc help make DNA, protein synthesis,

<!-- chunk -->

### and cell division.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc is also critical for signaling between and within neurons and other

<!-- chunk -->

## cells in your body. Zinc fingers are present in at least 3% of all your cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Proteins that contain zinc fingers act as interaction modules that bind

<!-- chunk -->

### DNA, RNA, proteins, and other molecules.1388

<!-- chunk -->

### The highest amount of zinc is found in your brain. Particularly your

<!-- chunk -->

### hippocampus. Zinc deficiency can lead to symptoms of depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### aggression, seizures, violence, ADHD, and problems with learning and


<!-- chunk -->

### A study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry shows that

<!-- chunk -->

### malnourished children exhibit a striking increase in behavioral disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### and aggressive behavior. Kids with nutritional deficiencies demonstrated a

<!-- chunk -->

### 41% increase in aggression by age 8! And at age 17, they demonstrated a

<!-- chunk -->

### 51% increase in violent and antisocial behavior.

<!-- chunk -->

### The malnourished kids weren’t getting enough critical minerals like zinc

<!-- chunk -->

### and iron. Or the B vitamins they needed to develop healthy nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### systems.1389

<!-- chunk -->

### Levels of zinc have been found to be low in those suffering from

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. In fact, the more depressed someone is, the lower the zinc

<!-- chunk -->

### level.1390

<!-- chunk -->

### Several human studies have demonstrated that supplementing zinc when

<!-- chunk -->

### using SSRIs help in the effectiveness of these antidepressants. One double-

<!-- chunk -->

### blind, randomized trial with 44 patients with major depression were

<!-- chunk -->

### randomly assigned to receive zinc or a placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### At the conclusion of the 12-week study, the researchers found that “zinc

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation together with SSRI antidepressant drugs improves major

<!-- chunk -->

### depressive disorders more effectively than in patients who were using a

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo plus antidepressants (SSRIs).”1391

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Zinc is required for memory formation. Research in the last

<!-- chunk -->

### decade has shown that the presence of zinc in synaptic vesicles of

<!-- chunk -->

### excitatory neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and

<!-- chunk -->

### regulates synaptic plasticity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Long-term potentiation is a form of synaptic plasticity that has been

<!-- chunk -->

### shown to underlie learning and memory. Zinc in these vesicles is critical

<!-- chunk -->

### to proper function of these brain circuits.1392

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc deficiency is associated with poor memory. And deficiency impairs

<!-- chunk -->

### signaling of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is also

<!-- chunk -->

### involved in long-term potentiation and memory.1393

<!-- chunk -->

### One very recent study revealed that the presence of zinc changes the

<!-- chunk -->

### dynamic of release of neurotransmitters like dopamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc causes the cellular pore to close more slowly than usual. Meaning the

<!-- chunk -->

### vesicle stays open longer. And releases more of neurotransmitter

<!-- chunk -->

### molecules.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers concluded, “Our results finally provide a connection

<!-- chunk -->

### between zinc and the regulation of neurotransmitter release. This could be

<!-- chunk -->

### important for the formation and storage of memories.”1394

<!-- chunk -->

### Read the reviews of neurohackers supplementing with zinc and many

<!-- chunk -->

### report better energy and focus. Clinical research backs this up. But nearly

<!-- chunk -->

### always when correcting a zinc deficiency.1395

<!-- chunk -->

### One Italian study investigated whether zinc supplementation could help

<!-- chunk -->

### restore memory in stroke patients. 26 patients took 10 mg of zinc daily for

<!-- chunk -->

### 30 days.

<!-- chunk -->

### On day 30 of the trial, researchers found that zinc supplementation

<!-- chunk -->

### significantly assisted in neurological recovery in the stroke patients.1396

<!-- chunk -->

### And animal models suggest that zinc supplementation may increase

<!-- chunk -->

### resilience to Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). For treating anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, learning, and memory deficits caused by TBI.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this trial, rats with injury to the frontal cortex were fed either a zinc

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement or zinc supplemented diet. The rats were also given a zinc

<!-- chunk -->

### injection an hour after injury.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research team found that zinc supplementation may be an effective

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment option for improving cognitive impairment and depression

<!-- chunk -->

### following TBI.1397


<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc deficiency is a problem world-wide including in countries like the

<!-- chunk -->

### United States for several reasons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our modern diet typically includes a lot of grains which are usually

<!-- chunk -->

### processed including packaged grain products like cereals. Zinc is found in

<!-- chunk -->

### grains. But this type of zinc is bound to phytates naturally found in these

<!-- chunk -->

### grains. Which block zinc absorption in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### So zinc found in whole foods like grain and legumes are not a good source

<!-- chunk -->

### of this essential trace element. And the zinc you get from eating meat can

<!-- chunk -->

### also be blocked if your meal contains grains or legumes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eating high carbohydrate foods, especially processed foods in the USA

<!-- chunk -->

### and other western countries are one of the reasons zinc deficiency is

<!-- chunk -->

### increasing.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’re vegan or vegetarian, you’re particularly susceptible to zinc

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency. If you have chronic digestive problems, leaky gut syndrome, or

<!-- chunk -->

### drink too much alcohol you’re in danger of zinc deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc deficiency symptoms include:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Cravings for salty or sweet foods

<!-- chunk -->

### •Eating disorders like bulimia or anorexia

<!-- chunk -->

### •Chronic fatigue syndrome

<!-- chunk -->

### •Hair loss

<!-- chunk -->

### •Irritable bowel syndrome

<!-- chunk -->

### •Impaired growth and sexual development (in kids)

<!-- chunk -->

### •Infertility & impotence - hypogonadism in males

<!-- chunk -->

### •Iron non-responsive anemia

<!-- chunk -->

### •Hormonal issues like bad PMS symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### •Hyperactivity (as in ADHD)

<!-- chunk -->

### •Delayed wound healing

<!-- chunk -->

### •Impaired adrenal function resulting in anxiety and stress

<!-- chunk -->

### •Low immunity (you get colds and flu often)

<!-- chunk -->

### •Pica (eating dirt)

<!-- chunk -->

### •Poor concentration and memory

<!-- chunk -->

### •Skin disorders like acne

<!-- chunk -->

### •Taste and smell problems

<!-- chunk -->

### •Weight loss or gain

<!-- chunk -->

### Any of these problems can happen at any age including in the developing

<!-- chunk -->

### child. And can be a result of not getting an adequate supply of zinc.

<!-- chunk -->

## Zinc benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc plays a critical role in how well your brain and body function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Adequate levels of zinc will increase your immunity and help you fight

<!-- chunk -->

### colds. A Cochrane review concluded that “zinc (lozenges or syrup) is

<!-- chunk -->

### beneficial in reducing the duration and severity of the common cold in

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy people, when taken within 24 hours of onset of symptoms”.1398

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory which helps support

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy cell division and a healthy brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc balances hormones which have a direct role in not only your sexual

<!-- chunk -->

### health. But in controlling anxiety, stress, mood, and sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Healthy zinc levels help lower inflammation and oxidative stress. The

<!-- chunk -->

### endothelium or thin layer of cells that line blood vessels rely on adequate

<!-- chunk -->

### zinc levels. Supporting a strong blood-brain barrier and cerebral blood

<!-- chunk -->

### flow.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc is involved in protein synthesis which is required by your body to use

<!-- chunk -->

### the amino acids you get from food. Which are needed for neurotransmitter

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis and contributing to energy production within mitochondria in

<!-- chunk -->

### every one of your brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Healthy energy levels and avoidance of chronic fatigue rely on adequate

<!-- chunk -->

### zinc levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Low zinc levels are a biomarker for depression. And under conditions of

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic stress, you tend to get rid of zinc through sweat, urine, and your

<!-- chunk -->

### saliva.

<!-- chunk -->

### So if your depressed you may want to try supplementing with zinc.

<!-- chunk -->

### Especially if you’re on SSRIs or other antidepressants. Research has found

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds work better when stacked with a

<!-- chunk -->

### zinc supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## How does Zinc feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Most neurohackers report that supplementing with zinc helps them relax

<!-- chunk -->

### before bed and sleep better. Recovery from workouts is faster.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many report that zinc helps boosts their libido.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc first thing in the morning seems to help many with energy and focus

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout the day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc supports a healthy immune system so you can avoid colds and the flu.

<!-- chunk -->

### And if you come down with a bug, zinc can shorten the duration of the

<!-- chunk -->

### illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some neurohackers say zinc keeps allergies from flaring up. And many

<!-- chunk -->

### with skin problems say zinc supplementation reduces acne because it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### anti-inflammatory and antibacterial.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are Adult ADHD, you may experience a decrease in anxiety or

<!-- chunk -->

### perception of stress. And notice an improvement in mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### One thing to note from all the research is improvements from using zinc

<!-- chunk -->

### only manifest if you are zinc deficient. With our modern diet, chances are

<!-- chunk -->

### you are zinc deficient. See “Zinc recommended dosage” below.

<!-- chunk -->

## Zinc Clinical Research

<!-- chunk -->

## Zinc’s role in anxiety & depression

<!-- chunk -->

### The latest research suggests depression is associated with decreased

<!-- chunk -->

### neurogenesis and enhanced neurodegeneration. Which in part is the result

<!-- chunk -->

### of inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### And lately there is mounting evidence that depression could be related to

<!-- chunk -->

### decreased zinc levels.1399

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc deficiency leads to less zinc in neuron synapses which results in an

<!-- chunk -->

### increase in NMDA receptors. This can cause an overload of toxic


<!-- chunk -->

### With an overabundance of glutamate we get a decrease in GABA, BDNF,

<!-- chunk -->

### and nerve growth factor. This excitotoxicity is thought to be responsible

<!-- chunk -->

### for seizures, migraines, dementia, anxiety, depression, and bipolar

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Japan worked with 30 women

<!-- chunk -->

### to study the effect of zinc supplementation on mood. Half of the women

<!-- chunk -->

### took a multivitamin. And the other half received a multivitamin with 7 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### of zinc per day for 10 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The women who took the multivitamin/zinc combo showed a significant

<!-- chunk -->

### reduction in anger, hostility, and depression. The women who took only

<!-- chunk -->

### the multivitamin showed no improvement in mood.1400

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study with depressed overweight subjects found that depression

<!-- chunk -->

### decreased in those supplementing with zinc. But zinc produced no effect on

<!-- chunk -->

### mood in those who were not depressed in the first place.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers concluded that the improved mood in overweight subjects was

<!-- chunk -->

### likely through increasing BDNF levels by using zinc.1401

<!-- chunk -->

## Zinc may relieve symptoms of ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

### In the last decade, several studies have been conducted into the role trace

<!-- chunk -->

### elements like zinc play in ADHD. Zinc is required for the production and

<!-- chunk -->

### modulation of melatonin which helps regulate dopamine function.1402

<!-- chunk -->

### So the theory is that those with ADHD may benefit from supplementing

<!-- chunk -->

### with zinc.

<!-- chunk -->

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Turkey was conducted with

<!-- chunk -->

### boys and girls with a primary diagnosis of ADHD. Half the group received

<!-- chunk -->

### 150 mg zinc sulfate for 12 weeks while the control group got a placebo.

<!-- chunk -->

### The study concluded “Zinc monotherapy was significantly superior to

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo in reducing symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity and impaired

<!-- chunk -->

### socialization in patients with ADHD.”1403

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study found that free fatty acids and zinc levels were lower in

<!-- chunk -->

### those with ADHD. But concluded that they didn’t know if zinc deficiency

<!-- chunk -->

### was the principal cause of ADHD. Or a secondary cause.

<!-- chunk -->

### A study in Croatia again showed that supplementing with 55 mg per day of

<!-- chunk -->

### zinc sulfate helped reduce the symptoms of ADHD.1404

<!-- chunk -->

### Considering the major role zinc plays in everything from cell growth to

<!-- chunk -->

### DNA synthesis to neurotransmitter synthesis and transport. And if your

<!-- chunk -->

### child is diagnosed ADHD and you don’t want to start them on stimulants.

<!-- chunk -->

### You may want to try zinc with a good Omega-3 high in DHA and see if you

<!-- chunk -->

### witness any improvement in ADHD symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

## Zinc may prevent autism

<!-- chunk -->

### Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) range from a severe form called autistic

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder, to a milder form called Asperger syndrome. If a child has

<!-- chunk -->

### specific symptoms of either of these disorders, but does not meet specific

<!-- chunk -->

### criteria for either, the diagnosis is called pervasive developmental disorder

<!-- chunk -->

### not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS).

<!-- chunk -->

### This complex disease can be inherited, but likely also involves

<!-- chunk -->

### environmental factors.1405

<!-- chunk -->

### A study published in Biomarker Insights in 2011 worked with 79 autistic

<!-- chunk -->

### subjects to study the association between copper and zinc plasma levels

<!-- chunk -->

### and individuals with autism, Asperger’s, and PDD-NOS.

<!-- chunk -->

### Participants in the study were tested for zinc, copper, and antioxidant

<!-- chunk -->

### levels. Then based on their deficiencies, they were prescribed the

<!-- chunk -->

### appropriate dose of antioxidants (Vitamin C, E, B


<!-- chunk -->

### as well as Magnesium,

<!-- chunk -->

### and Manganese if warranted). And they were given zinc picolinate daily

<!-- chunk -->

### for at least 8 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### At the conclusion of the therapy, those with autism and PDD-NOS had

<!-- chunk -->

### significantly lower levels of copper. All three groups had higher levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### zinc.

<!-- chunk -->

### Severity of symptoms decreased in autistic individuals following zinc and


<!-- chunk -->

### therapy related to awareness, receptive language, focus and

<!-- chunk -->

### attention, hyperactivity, tip toeing, eye contact, sound sensitivity, tactile

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitivity, and seizures.

<!-- chunk -->

### But none of the symptoms in the Asperger’s patients improved after

<!-- chunk -->

### therapy.1406

<!-- chunk -->

## Zinc recommended dosage

<!-- chunk -->

### The recommended adult dosage is 30 mg of zinc daily, balanced with 2 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### of copper.

<!-- chunk -->

### The best food source for zinc by far is oysters. Trailing far behind is other

<!-- chunk -->

### seafood, beef, pork, chicken, some nuts, and some dairy products.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vegans and vegetarians take note: don’t count on getting any benefit from

<!-- chunk -->

### zinc supplied by vegetables because the phytates in veggies block zinc

<!-- chunk -->

### absorption in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body needs zinc, but too much zinc is toxic. And it’s difficult to test

<!-- chunk -->

### for zinc using lab tests.

<!-- chunk -->

### But there is a simple DIY test first reported in The Lancet that can help

<!-- chunk -->

### you determine zinc levels. Premier Research Labs sells a Liquid Zinc

<!-- chunk -->

### Assay that is available from most local and online vitamin shops.

<!-- chunk -->

### You taste a teaspoon of Zinc Assay and depending on how the liquid tastes,

<!-- chunk -->

### you can assess your levels according to their guide.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clearly there is a sweet spot for zinc consumption, and more is definitely

<!-- chunk -->

### not better. More than 50 mg zinc per day can reduce copper levels, mess

<!-- chunk -->

### with iron function, and reduce immune function.

<!-- chunk -->

## Zinc Side Effects

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc toxicity typically happens when you take too much zinc. And can

<!-- chunk -->

### result in abdominal cramps, diarrhea, headaches, loss of appetite and

<!-- chunk -->

### vomiting.

<!-- chunk -->

### Antibiotics like Cipro® and tetracycline interact with zinc. Inhibiting the

<!-- chunk -->

### absorption of both zinc and the antibiotic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc can reduce the absorption of the rheumatoid arthritis drug

<!-- chunk -->

### penicillamine. To prevent this interaction you should take your zinc

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement at least 2 hours before or after you take your arthritis meds.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some diuretics can increase urinary excretion of zinc by as much as 60%.

<!-- chunk -->

### Prolonged use of these drugs can severely deplete your zinc levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc can raise your blood pressure. And too much zinc for men can be

<!-- chunk -->

### suppress testosterone and over inhibit DHT. Resulting in symptoms often

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with using the hair growth drug finasteride.

<!-- chunk -->

### Men should also note that too much zinc can dull nerves including nerves

<!-- chunk -->

### in your penis. Because excess zinc can over-inhibit NMDA receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

## Type of Zinc to buy

<!-- chunk -->

## Zinc is sold in as zinc gluconate, zinc sulfate, zinc ascorbate, zinc

<!-- chunk -->

### picolinate and various other forms.

<!-- chunk -->

### The percentage of bioavailability for zinc varies by form:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Zinc Ascorbate 15%

<!-- chunk -->

### •Zinc Bisglycinate 25%

<!-- chunk -->

### •Zinc Carbonate 52%

<!-- chunk -->

### •Zinc Citrate 31%

<!-- chunk -->

### •Zinc Chloride 48%

<!-- chunk -->

### •Zinc Sulphate 22%

<!-- chunk -->

### •Zinc Picolinate 20%

<!-- chunk -->

### So if you’re using Zinc Picolinate 50 mg tablet, your body may only get

<!-- chunk -->

### about 20% of that zinc for use by your cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### But more importantly is the fine balance between copper and zinc. Zinc

<!-- chunk -->

### reduces the amount of copper your body absorbs because copper competes

<!-- chunk -->

### with zinc to bind with metallothionein (binding protein that brings zinc

<!-- chunk -->

### into the cells).

<!-- chunk -->

### The ratio of copper and zinc in your body is more important than the

<!-- chunk -->

### amount of each.


<!-- chunk -->

## Zinc 30 mg per day

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend using Zinc as a nootropic supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your body does not make Zinc on its own. So to get its benefit it needs to

<!-- chunk -->

### come from your diet. Or you must take it as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc is especially helpful for treating anxiety and depression. Studies have

<!-- chunk -->

### demonstrated that zinc levels are low in those dealing with depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### And the lower the zinc level, the more severe the depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have also shown that if you are having limited success using

<!-- chunk -->

### prescription anti-anxiety drugs or antidepressants that you may increase

<!-- chunk -->

### their effectiveness by supplementing with zinc.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc is also particularly useful in helping alleviate the hyperactivity part

<!-- chunk -->

### of ADHD. Impaired impulsivity and improved socialization get a boost as

<!-- chunk -->

### well.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc is also required for efficiently encoding and retrieving memories.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc deficiency is a problem worldwide. Especially if you’re vegan or

<!-- chunk -->

### vegetarian.

<!-- chunk -->

### But too much zinc is toxic. Keep your dose of zinc below 50 mg per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### And stack it with 2 mg of copper to keep your copper/zinc ratio stable.


# NOOTROPIC STACK

# RECOMMENDATIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### In this book we have looked at over a hundred nootropic supplements.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here we’re going to take it a step further and look at some

<!-- chunk -->

### recommendations.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most neurohackers find that to reach their brain hacking goals, it takes a

<!-- chunk -->

### combination of supplements working together.

<!-- chunk -->

### We call this a “nootropic stack”. And all it means is 2 or more

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements working together, in synergy, to fix something in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Or boost something.

<!-- chunk -->

### When it comes to boosting cognitive performance – you can choose to

<!-- chunk -->

### improve memory, focus, stamina, neuroprotection, creativity, and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### And I realize this sounds like an overall, general type of neurohacking. But

<!-- chunk -->

### I’ve found that “fixing” or repairing a problem with your brain falls under

<!-- chunk -->

### the category of “boosting cognitive performance”. Everything else tends to

<!-- chunk -->

### fall into place.

<!-- chunk -->

### But one of the first things I want you to understand is “one-size-fits-all”

<!-- chunk -->

### doesn’t apply when it comes to nootropic supplements. There isn’t one

<!-- chunk -->

### “magic pill” no matter what the television commercials say.

<!-- chunk -->

### Each of us has a brain that is unique to us. Our brain ‘wiring’ is influenced

<!-- chunk -->

### by genetics, food, water, environmental toxins, lifestyle, and a thousand

<!-- chunk -->

### other things.

<!-- chunk -->

### This uniqueness was verified by researchers at Carnegie Mellon

<!-- chunk -->

### University who used a diffusion MRI to map the brain’s structural

<!-- chunk -->

### connections in 699 brains. They found that each person’s connections are

<!-- chunk -->

### so unique they could identify a person based on this brain “fingerprint”

<!-- chunk -->

### with near perfect accuracy.1407

<!-- chunk -->

### So when recommending certain nootropics to help brain function, please

<!-- chunk -->

### understand that these are just ‘suggestions’. This is certainly not medical

<!-- chunk -->

### advice. And caution is strongly advised when using any of these


<!-- chunk -->

### If possible, work with a naturopathic health professional who understands

<!-- chunk -->

### natural supplements. How they interact with certain health conditions. And

<!-- chunk -->

### many prescription drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Always start with the lowest dose possible to see how your body reacts.

<!-- chunk -->

### Understand that combining two or more nootropics could mean reducing

<!-- chunk -->

### the dosage of each.

<!-- chunk -->

### Successfully using nootropic supplements to boost, and repair your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### means a lot of trial and error to find out which nootropics in this book are

<!-- chunk -->

### appropriate for you.

<!-- chunk -->

### For each of these recommendations, I encourage you to refer to the

<!-- chunk -->

### previous chapter which covers each nootropic in much more detail. And

<!-- chunk -->

### includes dosage notes, side effects, drug interactions, and available forms.

# Best Nootropics for Cognition,

# Thinking and Decision-Making

<!-- chunk -->

### Ever gone to the supermarket to get a box of Cheerios? And it wasn’t until

<!-- chunk -->

### you got to the supermarket, you realized that there were 20 difference

<!-- chunk -->

### kinds of Cheerios. You saw original Cheerios. There were honey-nut

<!-- chunk -->

### Cheerios, apple-cinnamon, multigrain, banana nut, and then of course all

<!-- chunk -->

### the generic varieties of Cheerios.

<!-- chunk -->

### And then you find yourself spending a half hour in the cereal aisle of the

<!-- chunk -->

### supermarket. Trying to choose between boxes of Cheerios. Do you think

<!-- chunk -->

### this could be a problem?

<!-- chunk -->

### Cognition is the mental action or process you go through when hunting

<!-- chunk -->

### down the ideal box of Cheerios. And understanding it through thought,

<!-- chunk -->

### experience, and your physical senses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cognition includes thinking, knowing based on experience, short-,

<!-- chunk -->

### working-, and long-term memory, decision-making and problem solving.

<!-- chunk -->

### Whoever thought selecting a box of Cheerios could be so complicated?

<!-- chunk -->

### There’s a lot going on in your brain making the ideal selection and will

<!-- chunk -->

### likely take more than one nootropic. You can start with:


<!-- chunk -->

### brain. ACh is associated with learning and memory, concentration

<!-- chunk -->

### and focus.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Lion’s Mane Mushroom 1,000 mg twice per day. Lion’s Mane

<!-- chunk -->

### increases Brain Nerve Growth Factor or neurogenesis. Improving

<!-- chunk -->

### attention, focus, encoding new memories, thinking, depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, and helps repair damaged neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

## •L-Tyrosine 500 mg twice per day. L-Tyrosine is a precursor to

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine in your brain. More dopamine helps improve alertness,

<!-- chunk -->

### focus, working memory and executive function (decision-making).

<!-- chunk -->

## •Rhodiola Rosea 150 - 200 mg per day. Rhodiola Rosea boosts mood

<!-- chunk -->

### by influencing serotonin and norepinephrine levels in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola is known for improving alertness, energy, memory, mood,

<!-- chunk -->

### is anti-anxiety and anti-depressant, reduces fatigue, and boosts

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition and concentration.


<!-- chunk -->

### up to 100 mg per day. Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### is a required

<!-- chunk -->

### coenzyme for the synthesis of most major neurotransmitters in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. And helps enhance alertness, cognition, energy, memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### mood. Your brain cannot make these critical neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### without Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

## (folate) 400 mcg per day. Folate is required for the

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis of nearly all major neurotransmitters in your brain. Folate

<!-- chunk -->

### is known to improve mood, energy, initiative, alertness,

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration, psychomotor speed, and social activity


<!-- chunk -->

### 100 mcg per day. Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### is essential for the

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis of DNA, RNA and neurotransmitters in your brain. B


<!-- chunk -->

### enhances alertness, cognition, memory, decision-making and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain cannot make these critical neurotransmitters without


<!-- chunk -->

### You’ll find me recommending B-Vitamins often in these stacks. Because

<!-- chunk -->

### without the B-Vitamins, you’re brain simply won’t work. Many

<!-- chunk -->

### neurohackers, myself included, found it wasn’t until we added critical B-

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamins to our nootropic stack that took our cognition to the next level.

<!-- chunk -->

### For each nootropic in this stack, please refer to the previous section of this

<!-- chunk -->

### book where each supplement is listed. There you’ll find dosage

<!-- chunk -->

### recommendations, side effects, drug contraindications and more.

# Best Nootropics for Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s go back to the cereal aisle in the supermarket for a minute. Your

<!-- chunk -->

### search for the perfect box of Cheerios relies on your memory. The type of

<!-- chunk -->

### Cheerios you bought before. Warnings from the Environmental Working

<!-- chunk -->

### Group about GMO’s. Your kid’s favorite Cheerios. How to read the labels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remembering the shopping list before you left home.

<!-- chunk -->

### There’s a lot going on in your brain just to buy a box of Cheerios. And it

<!-- chunk -->

## uses several different types of memory. Short-term memory is also known

<!-- chunk -->

### as primary or active memory. And is limited to what you remember for

<!-- chunk -->

### to 30 seconds. At this point we’re comparing the different kinds of

<!-- chunk -->

### Cheerios sitting on the supermarket shelf.

<!-- chunk -->

## Long-term memory is the type of memory associated with an event or

<!-- chunk -->

### information you acquired long ago. This is a complicated form of memory

<!-- chunk -->

### influenced by your perception of an event or thing, conditioning, or any

<!-- chunk -->

### other input. And is encoded using long-term potentiation and

<!-- chunk -->

### strengthening neurons and synapses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Long-term memory comes in when you remember that your family hated

<!-- chunk -->

### the type of Cheerios you brought home 3 weeks ago. And made you vow to

<!-- chunk -->

### never buy them again.

<!-- chunk -->

## Working memory is distinct from short-, and long-term memory. These are

<!-- chunk -->

### memories that are not only remembered, but simultaneously processed

<!-- chunk -->

### with information that is important to you. You remember the purpose of

<!-- chunk -->

### the information, and why you decided to remember it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Working memory comes in when your reading Cheerios box labels. And

<!-- chunk -->

### recall that you should avoid GMO’s. And why GMO’s are bad for you.

<!-- chunk -->

### Added sugar is bad for you too.

<!-- chunk -->

### Each type of memory can be assisted by different nootropics. Because

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters, cerebral blood flow, long-term potentiation, hormones

<!-- chunk -->

### and more all come into play for memory. Just to buy a box of Cheerios.


<!-- chunk -->

### brain. ACh is associated with memory and learning, focus and

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration.

<!-- chunk -->

## •DHA (Omega 3) 1,000 mg per day. DHA makes up a large portion

<!-- chunk -->

### of your brain’s gray matter. This fatty acid helps form cell

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes, neurons, and synapses which are needed to form and

<!-- chunk -->

### encode memories.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Huperzine-A 200 mcg every 2nd day. Hup-A helps promote memory

<!-- chunk -->

### by optimizing acetylcholine (ACh) levels. Optimizing ACh with

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine-A means you need to make sure there’s enough material

<!-- chunk -->

### available to make ACh in your brain. And we do that by using Alpha

<!-- chunk -->

### CPC or CDP-Choline.

<!-- chunk -->

## •L-Theanine 100 mg 3-times per day. Found naturally in green tea

<!-- chunk -->

### and available as a nootropic supplement, L-Theanine helps optimize

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA, dopamine and serotonin. Improving anxiety, focus, learning,

<!-- chunk -->

### and mood. This prevents you from melting down in the cereal aisle

<!-- chunk -->

### in the hunt for the perfect Cheerios selection. Great for taming

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety and for sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Noopept 10 mg 3-times per day. Noopept stimulates dopamine, and

<!-- chunk -->

### nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin receptors in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Boosting cognition, memory, retention, logical thinking, improving

<!-- chunk -->

### your reflexes and mood. Here we’re taking our Cheerios hunt to the

<!-- chunk -->

### next level.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Phosphatidylserine (PS) 100 mg 3-times per day. PS is vital for

<!-- chunk -->

### brain health. Highly concentrated in cell membranes, PS helps in the

<!-- chunk -->

### release, storage and activity of neurotransmitters and receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

### Boosting cognition, focus, memory and recall.

<!-- chunk -->

### Boosting all types of memory with this nootropic stack means you

<!-- chunk -->

### remembered to grab the grocery list before you left home. You realize

<!-- chunk -->

### your family likes only one type of Cheerios. You recall where it is on the

<!-- chunk -->

### shelf once you get to the supermarket. And within a couple of weeks, your

<!-- chunk -->

### 30 -minute Cheerios hunt has been whittled down to 30-seconds. Life is

<!-- chunk -->

### good.

<!-- chunk -->

### Just a reminder to check dosage recommendations, side effects, drug

<!-- chunk -->

### interactions and more in the chapter before this where each nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement is discussed in much more detail.

# Best Nootropics for Depression & Anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you remember what it used to be like to be in a ‘good mood’ all of the

<!-- chunk -->

### time? Making the trip to the supermarket to pick up the family’s Cheerios

<!-- chunk -->

### was fun. Simply marveling at the marketing ingenuity behind 20 different

<!-- chunk -->

### kinds of Cheerios made you laugh.

<!-- chunk -->

### There was no anxiety behind choosing the right box of Cheerios. And no

<!-- chunk -->

### depression behind the ridiculous increase in Cheerios prices from two

<!-- chunk -->

### years ago.

<!-- chunk -->

### But anxiety and depression are something most of us have had to deal with

<!-- chunk -->

### at one time of another. For me, being ADD and hypothyroid was like a

<!-- chunk -->

### double whammy. And it took a while to dig out of the hole I was in.

<!-- chunk -->

### Anxiety and depression are often ‘grouped’ together both in nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### circles as well as in the psychiatric/medical world. But they are two

<!-- chunk -->

### distinctly different conditions. Even though the cause of anxiety and

<!-- chunk -->

### depression may overlap.

<!-- chunk -->

### All kinds of conditions can contribute to anxiety and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurotransmitter levels that are deficient or out of balance can cause

<!-- chunk -->

### severe depression. Illness and stress can cause anxiety and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Poor cerebral blood flow, a lack of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor

<!-- chunk -->

### (BDNF), excess proinflammatory cytokines, mental fatigue from lack of

<!-- chunk -->

### cellular energy, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke and more can all cause

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here are a few nootropics that can help lift your mood, and quell the

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety. But realize this is by no means an exhaustive list. These are what

<!-- chunk -->

### I’ve found work for me. They may work for you too.

<!-- chunk -->

### And if your depression or anxiety is severe, please, please seek

<!-- chunk -->

### professional help while you’re exploring your nootropic options.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Aniracetam 750 mg twice per day. This member of the racetam-

<!-- chunk -->

### family of nootropics, Aniracetam is very well known for helping

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety and depression. And one of my favorites. Aniracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### activates D


<!-- chunk -->

### and D


<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine receptors in your brain. Reducing

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety and improving cognition, learning, memory and mood. I

<!-- chunk -->

### have used Aniracetam every day for the last 10 years. And can’t

<!-- chunk -->

### imagine doing without it.


<!-- chunk -->

### brain. ACh is associated with focus, concentration, memory, mood

<!-- chunk -->

### and learning. And the choline each provides is needed when using

<!-- chunk -->

### any racetam (like Aniracetam).

<!-- chunk -->

## •Ashwagandha 250 - 500 mg per day. Used for thousands of years in

<!-- chunk -->

### Ayurvedic medicine, Ashwagandha helps relieve stress, fatigue,

<!-- chunk -->

### restores energy and concentration, and normalizes blood sugar.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Bacopa Monnieri 45% bacosides is 450 mg per day. Bacopa

<!-- chunk -->

### Monnieri is believed by some to be the best nootropic available

<!-- chunk -->

### today. This adaptogen helps prevent chemical and physical stress

<!-- chunk -->

### instead of suppressing them like many modern antidepressants.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Lemon Balm 300 mg twice per day. This plant from the mint

<!-- chunk -->

### family, Lemon Balm inhibits the GABA transaminase enzyme.

<!-- chunk -->

### Which in turn helps maintain adequate levels of GABA in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resulting in a calming effect and relieving anxiety and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Rhodiola Rosea 150 - 200 mg per day. Rhodiola increases AMPK

<!-- chunk -->

### which helps decrease depression and stress-related mood swings,

<!-- chunk -->

### reduces fatigue, stimulates energy and alertness and boots cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Sulbutiamine 400 mg twice per day. Synthesized in the lab from


<!-- chunk -->

### (thiamine), Sulbutiamine is another favorite of mine

<!-- chunk -->

### because it boosts memory, motivation and is a great antidepressant. I

<!-- chunk -->

### can’t imagine going a day without my 2-doses of Sulbutiamine.


<!-- chunk -->

### up to 100 mg per day. Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### is a required

<!-- chunk -->

### coenzyme for the synthesis of most major neurotransmitters in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. And helps enhance alertness, cognition, energy, memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### mood.


<!-- chunk -->

### 100 mcg per day. Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### is essential for the

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis of DNA, RNA and neurotransmitters in your brain. B


<!-- chunk -->

### enhances alertness, cognition, memory, decision-making and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Note that you don’t need every nootropic listed here to alleviate your

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety and depression. In fact, using everything on this list could do more

<!-- chunk -->

### harm. The key is to experiment through trial and error until you find what

<!-- chunk -->

### works best for you.

<!-- chunk -->

### Experiment, and find your favorites. Each supplement is readily available

<!-- chunk -->

### at your local vitamin shop or online. Go for purity and organic if possible.

<!-- chunk -->

### The only nootropics in this stack I’d suggest you use no matter what else

<!-- chunk -->

### you choose are Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline and the B-Vitamins. Make

<!-- chunk -->

### shopping for Cheerios fun again.

# Best Nootropics for Energy

# (physical & mental) & Motivation

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’ve ever felt mentally drained after writing an exam, an intense

<!-- chunk -->

### study session, a misunderstanding with your partner, or working out a

<!-- chunk -->

### business problem -- nootropics can help.

<!-- chunk -->

### Energy and motivation kinda’ go hand-in-hand in my book.

<!-- chunk -->

### When I’m energized, it usually translates into motivation to get things

<!-- chunk -->

### done. When energy stores are depleted in my brain and body, I’m burned

<!-- chunk -->

### out and nothing much is going to happen.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mental fatigue has a variety of causes. Depleted neurotransmitters can

<!-- chunk -->

### cause fatigue as well as a host of other issues. A lack of Adenosine

<!-- chunk -->

### Triphosphate (ATP) which is the energy source for brain cells is another

<!-- chunk -->

### cause of mental fatigue. And leads to neurodegenerative disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hormones that are out of balance or deficient can cause fatigue. And poor

<!-- chunk -->

### cerebral blood flow which provides oxygen and nutrients to brain cells can

<!-- chunk -->

### result in fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

### The amount of available mental energy has a direct influence on cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### and mental performance. Let’s look at the nootropics that can fix mental

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue and boost motivation.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR) 500 mg twice per day. ALCAR boosts

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine (ACh) and transports fatty acids through cell

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes into mitochondria for brain cell energy production. One

<!-- chunk -->

### of my favorite nootropics, ALCAR increases memory, mental

<!-- chunk -->

### alertness, fluid thought and is a powerful antioxidant. If you decide

<!-- chunk -->

### to try ALCAR, use it with Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline for best

<!-- chunk -->

### results.

<!-- chunk -->

## •CoQ10 & Ubiquinol 200 mg per day. CoQ10 is essential for

<!-- chunk -->

### producing Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) which is made within

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria in brain cells. Improving athletic performance, works

<!-- chunk -->

### as an antioxidant, and battles fatigue and depression. Ubiquinol

<!-- chunk -->

### should be part of every nootropic stack. Particularly if you’re over

<!-- chunk -->

### 40.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Alpha Lipoic Acid 100 mg twice per day. The natural form R-

<!-- chunk -->

### Lipoic Acid functions as a co-factor for mitochondrial enzymes

<!-- chunk -->

### involved in energy production.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Creatine up to 5 grams per day. Creatine acts as fuel for cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Including your brain cells. And provides ‘energy on demand’ when

<!-- chunk -->

### you need it. Creatine is a favorite of nootropic users because of the

<!-- chunk -->

### fuel demanded by brain cells especially under physical or mental

<!-- chunk -->

### stress. After crossing your blood-brain barrier, creatine binds to

<!-- chunk -->

### phosphate. Creatine phosphate in turn fuels energy production for


<!-- chunk -->

## •NADH 5 – 20 mg per day. NADH is a coenzyme used in the

<!-- chunk -->

### formation of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the energy source

<!-- chunk -->

### produced within mitochondria in your brain cells. NADH boosts

<!-- chunk -->

### alertness, mental performance, energy, and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## •PQQ 10 – 20 mg per day. PQQ helps create mitochondria in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells. When cellular energy gets a boost, you can experience

<!-- chunk -->

### better and faster thinking, learning is easier, recall is faster, and

<!-- chunk -->

### you’ll be more resistant to fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Rhodiola Rosea 150 - 200 mg per day. Rhodiola Rosea increases

<!-- chunk -->

### AMPK which triggers the use of stored energy from fats in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells. Boosting alertness, energy and cognition while

<!-- chunk -->

### decreasing depression and stress-related mood swings.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Ginseng 500 mg twice per day. Ginseng boosts ATP production

<!-- chunk -->

### within mitochondria for more energy. It helps improve mood and

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce stress. Ginseng works as an adaptogen, reduces adrenal

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue, and boosts GABA use for an anti-stress benefit.

<!-- chunk -->

### For a pure, clean energy boost try combining R-Lipoic Acid, ALCAR,

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 and PQQ twice per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Experiment and find out what works best for you to raise your energy and

### motivation levels.

# Best Nootropics for Brain

# Repair and Maintenance

<!-- chunk -->

### According to the American Center for Disease Control (CDC) an

<!-- chunk -->

### estimated 1.7 million in the US suffer from Traumatic Brain Injury every

<!-- chunk -->

### year.

<!-- chunk -->

### And that’s just for the USA. This is clearly a world-wide problem for the

<!-- chunk -->

### human race.

<!-- chunk -->

### Brain injury covers a lot of territory and includes concussion, Post Stroke

<!-- chunk -->

### Syndrome, sports and athletic injuries, damage from pharmaceuticals,

<!-- chunk -->

### environmental toxins, bad food and water, polluted air and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### The mechanics of injury can affect cerebral blood flow, torn tissue,

<!-- chunk -->

### damage to neurons, altered brain waves and neurotransmitters, free radical

<!-- chunk -->

### and oxidative damage and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now the “official” line from the FDA and other governmental authorities

<!-- chunk -->

### in the USA and many countries world-wide, nootropic supplements and

<!-- chunk -->

### other ‘natural’ substances cannot repair brain injury.

<!-- chunk -->

### While this is certainly not medical advice, and you should absolutely seek

<!-- chunk -->

### professional medical help for brain injury, neurohackers have found relief

<!-- chunk -->

### on their own experimenting with nootropics. Here’s a small sample of

<!-- chunk -->

### what we’ve found useful.

<!-- chunk -->

## •CDP-Choline. CDP-Choline provides your brain with choline which

<!-- chunk -->

### aids in the synthesis of acetylcholine (ACh). And cytidine in CDP-

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline converts to uridine which is important for neural membrane

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis.

<!-- chunk -->

## •DHA (Omega 3). DHA makes up a large portion of your brain’s

<!-- chunk -->

### gray matter. This fatty acid helps form cell membranes, neurons and

<!-- chunk -->

### synapses which are needed to form and encode memories.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Phosphatidylcholine (PC). PC is a phospholipid which helps build

<!-- chunk -->

### and repair brain cell membranes.

<!-- chunk -->

## •PQQ. The enzyme cofactor PQQ facilitates the growth of new

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria in your brain cells. Boosting the production of nerve

<!-- chunk -->

### growth factors in cells that support creation of new neurons. And

<!-- chunk -->

### reduces inflammation and oxidative stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Pterostilbene. Found in cranberries, blueberries, and grapes,

<!-- chunk -->

### Pterostilbene is a potent antioxidant, stimulates Brain-Derived

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), and promotes neuroplasticity. By

<!-- chunk -->

### reducing oxidative stress, Pterostilbene not only helps repair your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain, but also helps prevent heart attacks and stroke.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Resveratrol. This polyphenol antioxidant found in the skin of

<!-- chunk -->

### grapes, Resveratrol improves blood flow and reduces inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Improving cell survival and neurogenesis in the hippocampus,

<!-- chunk -->

### resulting in better memory and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Turmeric. Turmeric is unique in its ability to reduce inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### common to Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and brain tumors.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now there’s a temptation to throw everything into this nootropic stack if

<!-- chunk -->

### you’re having real problems with brain damage. But once again caution is

<!-- chunk -->

### advised. Work with a professional neurologist while you’re experimenting

<!-- chunk -->

### and exploring your nootropic options.

<!-- chunk -->

### All the nootropics on this list are safe to use within recommended doses.

<!-- chunk -->

### But each of us has unique brain and body chemistry. And each of us will

<!-- chunk -->

### react differently to everything on this list. These are general guidelines on

<!-- chunk -->

### what we’ve found to work with brain repair. And maintaining a healthy


<!-- chunk -->

### Start with low doses of three or four from the list. See how your body and

<!-- chunk -->

### brain reacts. And continue to experiment. Try new nootropics until you

<!-- chunk -->

### find your ideal stack.


# HOW TO CREATE THE BEST

# NOOTROPIC STACK

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’ve spent any time on my website NootropicsExpert.com or YouTube

<!-- chunk -->

### channel, or have experimented with nootropics before, you have a good

<!-- chunk -->

### idea how certain nootropic supplements can benefit your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### But if you’re just getting started with nootropics, the choices can seem

<!-- chunk -->

### overwhelming. Where do you start?

<!-- chunk -->

### Allow me a minute or two to share my story. How I discovered nootropics.

<!-- chunk -->

### And how I ended up with the nootropic stack I’m using now.

<!-- chunk -->

### About sixteen years ago my wife introduced me to her psychiatrist. My

<!-- chunk -->

### career and relationship were on rocky ground, and she was desperate. So

<!-- chunk -->

### was I.

<!-- chunk -->

### What happened next was nothing short of a miracle to my mind. Within

<!-- chunk -->

## minutes this very wise and knowledgeable man diagnosed me as Adult

# ADD.

<!-- chunk -->

### This of course was news to me. But what happened as a result of that first

<!-- chunk -->

### meeting was a complete life change.

<!-- chunk -->

### This doctor prescribed Ritalin. From the first day it was like someone had

<!-- chunk -->

### flipped the switch. And turned the lights on in my brain. For the first time

<!-- chunk -->

### in my adult life I could focus. My thinking became clearer.

<!-- chunk -->

### This complete transformation lasted for about 7 years. But Ritalin wasn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### as effective for ADD symptoms as it was in the beginning.

<!-- chunk -->

### I had been diagnosed as hypothyroid a couple of years prior. The brain fog

<!-- chunk -->

### and fatigue were taking its toll on my career and marriage again. We tried

<!-- chunk -->

### switching to Adderall and it didn’t work.

<!-- chunk -->

### By then I’d learned enough about how my brain worked. Had a good idea

<!-- chunk -->

### what was wrong. And decided to go the “natural” route with nootropics.

<!-- chunk -->

### I discovered a pre-formulated nootropic stack that helped me avoid going

<!-- chunk -->

### back on stimulants.

<!-- chunk -->

### My life started to turn around and continued to get better as I

<!-- chunk -->

### experimented with other nootropics.

<!-- chunk -->

### I continue to use that pre-formulated nootropic stack (which I’ll tell you

<!-- chunk -->

### about in a minute). My current daily nootropic stack is constantly evolving

<!-- chunk -->

### the more I learn.

# The Most Effective Nootropic Stack for You

<!-- chunk -->

### So what’s your story? What are you trying to do with nootropics?

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are a university student, an entrepreneur, a business executive, a

<!-- chunk -->

### stay-at-home mom, or dad, or a senior – what are you trying to improve?

<!-- chunk -->

### It could be just one thing you want to work on. Like improving your

<!-- chunk -->

### memory. Maybe you have a difficult time focusing like I did. Or you find

<!-- chunk -->

### learning new material, a skill or language an insurmountable problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### You could have an issue with anxiety, or bouts of depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Procrastination could leave you feeling like a failure because of a lack of

<!-- chunk -->

### motivation.

<!-- chunk -->

### For many of us, it’s more than just one problem we’re trying to fix. In my

<!-- chunk -->

### case, the combination of ADD and hypothyroidism caused problems with

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, cognition, focus, memory, and depression. That’s a lot to deal with

<!-- chunk -->

### and a lot to fix.1409,

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is it’s entirely possible with the right combination of

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics to address each of these issues. My life is a good example of

<!-- chunk -->

### what’s possible with the right nootropic stack.

<!-- chunk -->

### I’m deeply grateful for doing extremely well in my career. My marriage is

<!-- chunk -->

### better than I ever dreamed possible. And my future looks amazing.

<!-- chunk -->

### But where do you start? If you’re trying to fix one thing, like memory or

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, it narrows the list of nootropics down to something more

<!-- chunk -->

### manageable.

<!-- chunk -->

### But to be perfectly honest with you, one nootropic that works for me, may

<!-- chunk -->

### not work as well for you. Each of us have unique brain “wiring”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our chemical makeup is different. And is affected by foods we eat, where

<!-- chunk -->

### we live, the air we breathe, the genes we inherited from our parents, and

<!-- chunk -->

### more.

<!-- chunk -->

### So experimentation is key. Pick your top choice of something you’d like to

<!-- chunk -->

### improve. Once you find something that works reasonably well, go to the

<!-- chunk -->

### next thing on your list.

<!-- chunk -->

### With time, effort, and diligent experimenting you’ll find the perfect

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic stack for you.

# Your First Nootropic Stack

<!-- chunk -->

### My recommendation is to create your own nootropic stack when starting

<!-- chunk -->

### out.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tailor your stack to each issue your trying to solve. It’ll likely be more

<!-- chunk -->

### expensive because you need to get each individual nootropic or


<!-- chunk -->

### The advantages at first outweigh the cost in my opinion. When you find

<!-- chunk -->

### something that works, you then need to figure out how much of that

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic works best with your brain and body.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you try something and it doesn’t work as well as expected, or what you

<!-- chunk -->

### were promised in the marketing hype, or what you read on the forums –

<!-- chunk -->

### pitch it.

<!-- chunk -->

### And try something else.

<!-- chunk -->

### Flexibility and experimentation is key when you’re getting started with

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics. A pre-formulated stack doesn’t allow that flexibility.

<!-- chunk -->

### Keep that option in reserve until you nail down what works best for you.

<!-- chunk -->

### Then look for a nootropic stack that fills all your requirements.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s briefly look at some of your options for major issues to get you

<!-- chunk -->

### started. This is by no means an exhaustive list but a way to point you in

<!-- chunk -->

### the right direction.

<!-- chunk -->

### Use the search function on NootropicsExpert.com to find every nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### that works for memory, or depression, or anxiety, or whatever it is you

<!-- chunk -->

### need to fix.

# Nootropics for Cognition, Thinking and Decision-

# Making

<!-- chunk -->

### Cognition is the mental action or process you go through when learning

<!-- chunk -->

### something new and understanding it through thought, experience, and your

<!-- chunk -->

### physical senses.1411

<!-- chunk -->

### Cognition includes thinking, knowing, short-, working-, and long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, decision-making and problem solving.

<!-- chunk -->

### That’s a tall order to cover and will likely take more than one nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can start with:


<!-- chunk -->

### brain. ACh is associated with memory and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR) 500 mg twice per day. ALCAR boosts

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine (ACh) and transports fatty acids through cell

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes into mitochondria for brain cell energy production. One

<!-- chunk -->

### of my favorite nootropics, ALCAR increases memory, mental

<!-- chunk -->

### alertness, fluid thought and is a powerful antioxidant. If you decide

<!-- chunk -->

### to try ALCAR, use it with Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline for best

<!-- chunk -->

### results.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Lion’s Mane Mushroom 1,000 mg twice per day. Lion’s Mane

<!-- chunk -->

### extract increases Brain Nerve Growth Factor or neurogenesis.

<!-- chunk -->

### Improving attention, focus, thinking, depression, anxiety, and helps

<!-- chunk -->

### repair damaged neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

## •L-Tyrosine 500 mg twice per day. L-Tyrosine is a precursor to the

<!-- chunk -->

### creation of dopamine in your brain. More dopamine helps improve

<!-- chunk -->

### alertness, focus, working memory and executive function (decision-

<!-- chunk -->

### making).

<!-- chunk -->

## •B-Complex. The B-Vitamins are required coenzymes for the

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis of all the major neurotransmitters in your brain. And help

<!-- chunk -->

### enhance alertness, cognition, energy, memory and mood.

# Nootropics for Memory

<!-- chunk -->

## We use several different types of memory every day. Short-term memory

<!-- chunk -->

### is also known as primary or active memory. And is limited to what you

<!-- chunk -->

### remember for 20 to 30 seconds.

<!-- chunk -->

## Long-term memory is the type of memory associated with an event or

<!-- chunk -->

### information you acquired long ago. This is a complicated form of memory

<!-- chunk -->

### influenced by your perception of an event or thing, conditioning, or any

<!-- chunk -->

### other input. And is encoded using long-term potentiation and

<!-- chunk -->

### strengthening neurons and synapses.

<!-- chunk -->

## Working memory is distinct from short-, and long-term memory. These

<!-- chunk -->

### are memories that are not only remembered, but simultaneously processed

<!-- chunk -->

### with information that is important to you. You remember the purpose of

<!-- chunk -->

### the information, and why you decided to remember it.1412

<!-- chunk -->

### Each type of memory can be assisted by different nootropics. Because

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters, cerebral blood flow, long-term potentiation, hormones

<!-- chunk -->

### and more all come into play for memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline. Both nootropics help boost

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine (ACh) in your brain. ACh is associated with memory

<!-- chunk -->

### and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

## •DHA (Omega 3). DHA makes up a large portion of your brain’s

<!-- chunk -->

### gray matter. This fatty acid helps form cell membranes, neurons,

<!-- chunk -->

### and synapses which are needed to form and encode memories.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Huperzine-A. Hup-A helps promote memory by increasing

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine levels.

<!-- chunk -->

## •L-Theanine. Found naturally in green tea and available as a

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic supplement, L-Theanine helps boost dopamine and

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin. Improving anxiety, focus, learning, and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Noopept. Noopept stimulates dopamine, nicotinic and serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors in your brain. Boosting cognition, memory, retention,

<!-- chunk -->

### logical thinking, improving your reflexes and mood.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Phosphatidylserine (PS). PS is vital for brain health. Highly

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrated in cell membranes, PS helps in the release, storage and

<!-- chunk -->

### activity of neurotransmitters and receptors. Boosting cognition,

<!-- chunk -->

### focus, memory and recall.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Piracetam. The original nootropic, Piracetam influences AMPA and

<!-- chunk -->

### NMDA receptors in your brain. Affecting learning and memory.

# Nootropics for Anxiety and Depression

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you remember what it used to be like to be in a ‘good mood’ all of the

<!-- chunk -->

### time? Anxiety and depression are something most of us have had to deal

<!-- chunk -->

### with at one time of another.

<!-- chunk -->

### For me, being ADD and hypothyroid was like a double whammy. And it

<!-- chunk -->

### took a while to dig out of the hole I was in.

<!-- chunk -->

### Anxiety1413 and depression1414 are often ‘grouped’ together both in

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic circles as well as in the psychiatric/medical world. But they are

<!-- chunk -->

### two distinctly different conditions. Even though the cause of anxiety and

<!-- chunk -->

### depression may overlap.

<!-- chunk -->

### All kinds of conditions can contribute to anxiety and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurotransmitter levels that are out of balance can cause severe

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. Illness and stress can cause anxiety and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Poor cerebral blood flow, a lack of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor

<!-- chunk -->

### (BDNF), mental fatigue from lack of cellular energy, Alzheimer’s,

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s, stroke and more can all cause anxiety and depression.’

<!-- chunk -->

### Here are a few nootropics that can help. This is by no means an exhaustive

<!-- chunk -->

### list.

<!-- chunk -->

### And if your depression or anxiety is severe, please, please seek

<!-- chunk -->

### professional help while you’re exploring your nootropic options.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Aniracetam 750 mg twice per day. This member of the racetam-

<!-- chunk -->

### family of nootropics, Aniracetam is very well known for helping

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety and depression. And one of my favorites. Aniracetam

<!-- chunk -->

### activates D


<!-- chunk -->

### and D


<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine receptors in your brain. Improving

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, cognition, learning, memory and mood.


<!-- chunk -->

### brain. ACh is associated with memory and learning. And requires

<!-- chunk -->

### the cofactor Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR) for acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR) 500 mg twice per day – a required

<!-- chunk -->

### cofactor for acetylcholine synthesis and works with Alpha GPC and

<!-- chunk -->

### CDP-Choline – helps transport of fatty acids into mitochondria to

<!-- chunk -->

### make ATP for more energy – it also boosts brain-derived

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotrophic factor (BDNF) needed for cell repair and neurogenesis

<!-- chunk -->

## •Ashwagandha 250 – 500 mg per day. Used for thousands of years in

<!-- chunk -->

### Ayurvedic medicine, Ashwagandha helps relieve stress, fatigue,

<!-- chunk -->

### restores energy and concentration, and normalizes blood sugar.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Bacopa Monnieri 45% bacosides is 450 mg twice per day. Bacopa

<!-- chunk -->

### Monnieri is believed by some to be the best nootropic available

<!-- chunk -->

### today. This adaptogen helps prevent chemical and physical stress

<!-- chunk -->

### instead of suppressing them like many modern antidepressants.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Lemon Balm 200 - 400 mg twice per day. This plant from the mint

<!-- chunk -->

### family, Lemon Balm inhibits the GABA transaminase enzyme.

<!-- chunk -->

### Which in turn helps maintain adequate levels of GABA in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resulting in a calming effect and relieving anxiety and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Rhodiola Rosea 150 - 200 mg per day. Rhodiola Rosea increases

<!-- chunk -->

### AMPK which helps decrease depression and stress-related mood

<!-- chunk -->

### swings, reduces fatigue, stimulates energy and alertness and boots


<!-- chunk -->

## •Sulbutiamine 400 mg twice per day. Synthesized in the lab from


<!-- chunk -->

### (thiamine), Sulbutiamine is another favorite of mine

<!-- chunk -->

### because it boosts memory, motivation and is a heck of an

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant.

<!-- chunk -->

## •B-Complex. The B-Vitamins are required coenzymes for the

<!-- chunk -->

### synthesis of all your major neurotransmitters. And helps enhance

<!-- chunk -->

### alertness, cognition, energy, memory and mood.

# Nootropics for Energy and Motivation

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’ve ever felt mentally drained after writing an exam, an intense

<!-- chunk -->

### study session, a misunderstanding with your partner, or working out a

<!-- chunk -->

### business problem -- nootropics can help.

<!-- chunk -->

### Energy and motivation kinda’ go hand-in-hand in my book.

<!-- chunk -->

### When I’m energized, it usually translates into motivation to get things

<!-- chunk -->

### done. When energy stores are depleted in my brain and body, I’m burned

<!-- chunk -->

### out and nothing much is going to happen.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mental fatigue has a variety of causes. Depleted neurotransmitters can

<!-- chunk -->

### cause fatigue as well as a host of other issues. A lack of Adenosine

<!-- chunk -->

### Triphosphate (ATP) which is the energy source for brain cells is another

<!-- chunk -->

### cause of mental fatigue. And leads to neurodegenerative disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hormones that are out of balance can cause fatigue. And poor cerebral

<!-- chunk -->

### blood flow which provides oxygen and nutrients to brain cells can result in

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

### The amount of available mental energy has a direct influence on cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### and mental performance. Let’s look at the nootropics that can fix mental

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue and boost motivation.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR) 500 mg twice per day. ALCAR boosts

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine (ACh) and transports fatty acids through cell

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes into mitochondria for brain cell energy production. One

<!-- chunk -->

### of my favorite nootropics, ALCAR increases memory, mental

<!-- chunk -->

### alertness, fluid thought and is a powerful antioxidant. If you decide

<!-- chunk -->

### to try ALCAR, use it with Alpha GPC or CDP-Choline for best

<!-- chunk -->

### results.

<!-- chunk -->

## •CoQ10 & Ubiquinol 200 mg per day. CoQ10 is essential for

<!-- chunk -->

### producing Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) which is made within

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria in brain cells. Improving athletic performance, works

<!-- chunk -->

### as an antioxidant, and battles fatigue and depression. Ubiquinol

<!-- chunk -->

### should be part of every nootropic stack. Particularly if you’re over

<!-- chunk -->

### 40.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Alpha Lipoic Acid 100 mg twice per day. The natural form R-

<!-- chunk -->

### Lipoic Acid functions as a co-factor for mitochondrial enzymes

<!-- chunk -->

### involved in energy production.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Creatine up to 5 grams per day. Creatine acts as fuel for cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Including your brain cells. And provides ‘energy on demand’ when

<!-- chunk -->

### you need it. Creatine is a favorite of nootropic users because of the

<!-- chunk -->

### fuel demanded by brain cells especially under physical or mental

<!-- chunk -->

### stress. After crossing your blood-brain barrier, creatine binds to

<!-- chunk -->

### phosphate. Creatine phosphate in turn fuels energy production for


<!-- chunk -->

## •NADH 5 – 20 mg per day. NADH is a coenzyme used in the

<!-- chunk -->

### formation of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the energy source

<!-- chunk -->

### produced within mitochondria in your brain cells. NADH boosts

<!-- chunk -->

### alertness, mental performance, energy, and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

## •PQQ 10 – 20 mg per day. PQQ helps create mitochondria in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells. When cellular energy gets a boost, you can experience

<!-- chunk -->

### better and faster thinking, learning is easier, recall is faster, and

<!-- chunk -->

### you’ll be more resistant to fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Rhodiola Rosea 150 - 200 mg per day. Rhodiola Rosea increases

<!-- chunk -->

### AMPK which triggers the use of stored energy from fats in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells. Boosting alertness, energy and cognition while

<!-- chunk -->

### decreasing depression and stress-related mood swings.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Ginseng 500 mg twice per day. Ginseng boosts ATP production

<!-- chunk -->

### within mitochondria for more energy. It helps improve mood and

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce stress. Ginseng works as an adaptogen, reduces adrenal

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue, and boosts GABA use for an anti-stress benefit.

<!-- chunk -->

### For a pure, clean energy boost try combining R-Lipoic Acid, ALCAR,

<!-- chunk -->

### CoQ10 and PQQ twice per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Experiment and find out what works best for you to raise your energy and

<!-- chunk -->

### motivation levels.

# Nootropics for Brain Repair and Maintenance

<!-- chunk -->

### According to the American Center for Disease Control (CDC) an

<!-- chunk -->

### estimated 1.7 million in the US suffer from Traumatic Brain Injury every

<!-- chunk -->

### year.1415

<!-- chunk -->

### And that’s just for the USA. This is clearly a world-wide problem for the

<!-- chunk -->

### human race.

<!-- chunk -->

### Brain injury covers a lot of territory and includes concussion, Post Stroke

<!-- chunk -->

### Syndrome, sports and athletic injuries, damage from pharmaceuticals,

<!-- chunk -->

### environmental toxins, bad food and water, polluted air and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### The mechanics of injury can affect cerebral blood flow, torn tissue,

<!-- chunk -->

### damage to neurons, altered brain waves and neurotransmitters, free radical

<!-- chunk -->

<!-- chunk -->

### Now the “official” line from the FDA and other governmental authorities

<!-- chunk -->

### in the USA and many countries world-wide, nootropic supplements and

<!-- chunk -->

### other ‘natural’ substances cannot repair brain injury.

<!-- chunk -->

### While this is certainly not medical advice, and you should absolutely seek

<!-- chunk -->

### professional medical help for brain injury, neurohackers have found relief

<!-- chunk -->

### on their own experimenting with nootropics. Here’s a small sample of

<!-- chunk -->

### what we’ve found useful:

<!-- chunk -->

## •CDP-Choline 300 mg twice per day. CDP-Choline provides your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain with choline which aids in the synthesis of acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### (ACh). And cytidine in CDP-Choline converts to uridine which is

<!-- chunk -->

### important for neural membrane synthesis.

<!-- chunk -->

## •DHA (Omega 3) 1,000 mg per day. DHA makes up a large portion

<!-- chunk -->

### of your brain’s gray matter. This fatty acid helps form cell

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes, neurons, and synapses which are needed to form and

<!-- chunk -->

### encode memories.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Phosphatidylserine (PS) – 100 mg 3-times per day – works with

<!-- chunk -->

### DHA for brain cell membrane repair and maintenance – some

<!-- chunk -->

### consider to be the most potent nootropic on the planet and if you

<!-- chunk -->

### read my review earlier in this book, you’ll see why

<!-- chunk -->

## •PQQ 10 mg twice per day. The enzyme cofactor PQQ facilitates the

<!-- chunk -->

### growth of new mitochondria in your brain cells. Boosting the

<!-- chunk -->

### production of nerve growth factors in cells that support creation of

<!-- chunk -->

### new neurons. And reduces inflammation and oxidative stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Pterostilbene 50 mg per day. Found in cranberries, blueberries, and

<!-- chunk -->

### grapes, Pterostilbene is a potent antioxidant, stimulates Brain-

<!-- chunk -->

### Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), and promotes neuroplasticity.

<!-- chunk -->

### By reducing oxidative stress, Pterostilbene helps prevent heart

<!-- chunk -->

### attacks and stroke.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Resveratrol 250 mg per day. This polyphenol antioxidant found in

<!-- chunk -->

### the skin of grapes, Resveratrol improves blood flow and reduces

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation. Improving cell survival and neurogenesis in the

<!-- chunk -->

### hippocampus, resulting in better memory and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

## •Turmeric. 650 mg (95% curcuminoids) 3-times per day. Turmeric is

<!-- chunk -->

### unique in its ability to reduce inflammation common to Parkinson’s,

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s and brain tumors. Boost it’s bioavailability by pairing

<!-- chunk -->

## this supplement with 10 mg BioPerine.

### So it can get very confusing and overwhelming. Especially if you’re just

<!-- chunk -->

### starting out with nootropics and brain optimization. My intention with

<!-- chunk -->

### NootropicsExpert.com, and for this book, was to collate as much good

<!-- chunk -->

### information in one place as I could find. To make it easier for anyone at

<!-- chunk -->

### any level of expertise.

<!-- chunk -->

### But one strong word of caution when experimenting with new nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements. For example, by no means should you include everything

<!-- chunk -->

### listed under “memory” in your stack. One or two options from each

<!-- chunk -->

### section can help you toward your ideal nootropic stack.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many nootropics work synergistically and together can make a more

<!-- chunk -->

### powerful solution than a single nootropic supplement on its own. When

<!-- chunk -->

### combining several nootropics into what we call a “stack” you’ll want to

<!-- chunk -->

### back off to the lowest recommended dose of each to start.

# My Nootropic Stack

<!-- chunk -->

### Early in this chapter I promised to reveal the pre-formulated stack that I

<!-- chunk -->

### used to replace prescription stimulants for Adult ADD.

<!-- chunk -->

### After experimenting with many of the well-known stacks, I settled on

<!-- chunk -->

### Mind Lab Pro®.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mind Lab Pro® contains therapeutic dosages of 11 top quality natural

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic ingredients I’ve included in this book. I’ve found it less

<!-- chunk -->

### expensive to use this stack than buying each nootropic on its own. All I’ve

<!-- chunk -->

### had to add is unrefined coconut oil, DHA, magnesium, Vitamin D,

<!-- chunk -->

### Aniracetam and Sulbutiamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have questions about building your perfect nootropic stack, I

<!-- chunk -->

### encourage you to post a question in the comments section on the relevant

<!-- chunk -->

### article or review at NootropicsExpert.com or in the comments section of

<!-- chunk -->

### my YouTube channel. I or another experienced neurohacker in our

### community will help you out.


# NOOTROPICS GLOSSARY

# Acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

## Acetylcholine (ACh) is the acetic ester of choline, and is a

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter. ACh is found throughout your body. But in nootropics

<!-- chunk -->

## we typically refer to acetylcholine function in the Central Nervous System

<!-- chunk -->

### and specifically the brain.1416

<!-- chunk -->

### Some nootropics upon entering your brain separate into compounds that

<!-- chunk -->

### can make acetylcholine. Others may increase the uptake of acetylcholine

<!-- chunk -->

### in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetylcholine’s function in the brain is critical for encoding new

<!-- chunk -->

### memories, reasoning, concentration, cognition, and growth of new

<!-- chunk -->

### synapses (neuroplasticity). Lack of acetylcholine can result in diseases

<!-- chunk -->

### like ADD, ADHD and Alzheimer’s.

# Adaptogen

<!-- chunk -->

## Adaptogens are a class of herbs that help the body adapt to stress, and

<!-- chunk -->

### exert a normalizing effect in your body. As a nootropic, adaptogens can

<!-- chunk -->

### help strengthen mental fortitude, and can help maintain active, energized

<!-- chunk -->

### thinking in response to the brain-dulling effects of prolonged stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Adaptogens are valued for their ability to boost endurance and physical

<!-- chunk -->

### performance. Examples of adaptogens popular in the nootropic community

<!-- chunk -->

### include Rhodiola and Ashwagandha.

# Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)

<!-- chunk -->

## Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) is the “energy currency of life”. ATP is a

<!-- chunk -->

### coenzyme that is synthesized in the energy factories called mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### within each of your brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Adequate levels of ATP are crucial for peak brain performance. As we age,

<!-- chunk -->

### blood flow to the brain decreases and ATP production declines. If your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells don’t have an adequate supply of ATP, they die.

# Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs)

<!-- chunk -->

## AGEs form in your body when proteins or fats combine with sugars

<!-- chunk -->

### (glycation). This can harm the normal function of cells, making them

<!-- chunk -->

### more susceptible to damage and premature aging.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body can naturally rid itself of harmful AGEs, but it doesn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminate them effectively when too many are ingested through food. The

<!-- chunk -->

### accumulation of AGEs has been linked to aging, chronic illness, and

<!-- chunk -->

### cardiovascular, liver and Alzheimer’s disease.

# Age-Related Cognitive Decline

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have shown the aging brain undergoes a loss of grey and white

<!-- chunk -->

### matter volumes in the brain.1417 This has become one of the biggest health

<!-- chunk -->

### threats of this century. And it’s primarily because we’re living longer.

<!-- chunk -->

### It manifests as brain fog, memory problems, verbal communication

<!-- chunk -->

### declines, cognition slows down, and eventually could develop into

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia or Alzheimer’s Disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## Many nootropics help prevent and often reverse the effects of Age-Related

<!-- chunk -->

## Cognitive Decline.

# Agonist

<!-- chunk -->

## An agonist is a chemical substance in your body that is capable of

<!-- chunk -->

### activating a neuroreceptor to induce a full or partial response.

# Alkaloid

<!-- chunk -->

## An alkaloid is typically of plant origin. It contains nitrogen which gives an

<!-- chunk -->

### alkaline (pH value greater than 7.0) reaction when mixed with a solution

<!-- chunk -->

### such as water. Many alkaloids cause pharmacological effects in humans.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alkaloid substance names generally end in “-ine”. Examples are caffeine,

<!-- chunk -->

### morphine, quinine and nicotine.

# Amino Acids

<!-- chunk -->

## Amino acids are used in every cell of your body and are used to form

<!-- chunk -->

### proteins.

<!-- chunk -->

### Amino acids give cells their structure, transport and store nutrients, and

<!-- chunk -->

### influence the function of arteries, glands, organs and tendons. They repair

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue and remove waste from cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists have discovered about 50 amino acids. Only 20 are used to make

<!-- chunk -->

### proteins in your body. Of those 20, 9 are defined as essential. Meaning

<!-- chunk -->

### your body needs to get them from sources outside the body like food. The

<!-- chunk -->

### other 11 can be synthesized within your body.

<!-- chunk -->

## Essential Amino Acids: Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine,

<!-- chunk -->

### Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, and Valine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nonessential Amino Acids: Alanine, Arginine, Asparagine, Aspartate,

<!-- chunk -->

### Cysteine, Glutamate, Glutamine, Glycine, Proline, Serine and Tyrosine.

# Amyloid Plaques & Neurofibrillary Tangles

<!-- chunk -->

## Amyloid Plaques are accumulations of protein fragments that have

<!-- chunk -->

### clumped together in the space between brain neurons. This prevents

<!-- chunk -->

### normal brain function. And is strongly indicated in the formation of


<!-- chunk -->

## Neurofibrillary Tangles are found within brain cells. In microtubules

<!-- chunk -->

### necessary for interaction with brain cells. When these microtubules

<!-- chunk -->

### collapse, twisted fibers of these proteins are called Neurofibrillary

<!-- chunk -->

### Tangles. And are also strongly indicated in the formation of dementia and


# Ampakines

<!-- chunk -->

## Ampakines are nootropics that modulate AMPA receptors in your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### These receptors work like control channels, overseeing and regulating

<!-- chunk -->

### synaptic transmissions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ampakines seem to adjust neuroreceptors in order to allow them to work

<!-- chunk -->

### as needed rather forcing them. The result of this action is a stimulant-like

<!-- chunk -->

### effect without any of the negative side effects associated with stimulants

<!-- chunk -->

### (i.e. nervousness, insomnia).

<!-- chunk -->

### Many racetams could be considered Ampakines.

# AMPA Receptors

<!-- chunk -->

## The AMPA receptor is paired with an ion channel so that when glutamate

<!-- chunk -->

### binds to this receptor, the channel lets sodium ions enter that neuron. This

<!-- chunk -->

### sodium causes the dendrite of that neuron to become locally depolarized.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once this depolarization reaches a critical threshold, it triggers an action

<!-- chunk -->

### so this nerve impulse is transmitted to the next neuron.

# Antagonist

<!-- chunk -->

## An antagonist is a chemical substance in your body which counteracts or

<!-- chunk -->

### blocks the effects of another substance. For example, an antagonist at a

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroreceptor blocks or lowers the activity of that receptor.

# Anxiolytics

<!-- chunk -->

## Anxiolytics are anti-anxiety natural nootropic supplements, or prescription

<!-- chunk -->

### drugs used to prevent anxiety.

# Apoptosis

<!-- chunk -->

## Apoptosis is ‘programmed cell death’ in your body and brain. If cells are

<!-- chunk -->

### no longer needed, they commit suicide. In a healthy adult human, billions

<!-- chunk -->

### of cells die in various parts of your body every hour for different reasons.

<!-- chunk -->

### But mainly to maintain homeostasis within that organ or body tissue.

<!-- chunk -->

### When apoptosis is disrupted, disease happens. Cancer is a classic example

<!-- chunk -->

### of cell proliferation gone awry.

# Attention Deficit Disorder

<!-- chunk -->

## ADD is officially called Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, or

<!-- chunk -->

### AD/HD (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). This disease is divided

<!-- chunk -->

### into three subtypes; inattentiveness, impulsivity, and hyperactivity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientific evidence suggests that the disorder is genetically transmitted in

<!-- chunk -->

### many cases. And results from a chemical imbalance or deficiency in

<!-- chunk -->

### certain neurotransmitters.1418

<!-- chunk -->

### ADD is characterized by a person’s inability to complete tasks and process

<!-- chunk -->

### information at normal rates. The abnormal function of the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter dopamine is usually implicated in this disease.

# Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

<!-- chunk -->

## See Attention Deficit Disorder.

# Axons

<!-- chunk -->

### Each neuron in your brain can have thousands of dendrites, but only one

<!-- chunk -->

## axon. The neuron uses its axon to transmit an action potential

<!-- chunk -->

### (electrochemical signal) down the length of the axon. With the intent of

<!-- chunk -->

### finding neighboring neuron’s dendrites to communicate with.

# Ayurveda

<!-- chunk -->

## Ayurveda is the traditional Hindu system of medicine practiced for

<!-- chunk -->

### thousands of years in India. It is based on the ideal balance of bodily

<!-- chunk -->

### systems and uses diet, herbal treatments and yoga.

# Benzodiazepines

<!-- chunk -->

## Benzodiazepines are a class of psychoactive drugs used to treat anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### insomnia, panic attacks, and other conditions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Benzodiazepines work by enhancing the effect of the neurotransmitter

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA which is responsible for governing the activity of neurons related

<!-- chunk -->

### to stress and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### Well known benzodiazepines include Valium, Klonopin and Xanax.

# Bioavailability

<!-- chunk -->

## Bioavailability is the proportion of the nootropic or other substance that

<!-- chunk -->

### once it enters your body’s circulation, is able to have an effect. And is not

<!-- chunk -->

### just eliminated as waste.

# Blood-brain Barrier

<!-- chunk -->

## The blood-brain barrier is made up of a layer of endothelial cells that

<!-- chunk -->

### when functioning properly, allows precise control over the substances that

<!-- chunk -->

### enter or leave the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The blood-brain barrier’s main function is to protect the brain from things

<!-- chunk -->

### that may injure it. In the world of nootropics, we’re interested in

<!-- chunk -->

### substances and compounds that easily cross the blood-brain barrier. Or

<!-- chunk -->

### what needs to be added to help it cross.

# Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurotrophic factors are a family of proteins that are responsible for the

<!-- chunk -->

## growth and survival of nerve cells. In the brain they’re called brain-

<!-- chunk -->

## derived neurotrophic factor and the brain nerve cells are called neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the brain, BDNF is released by either a nerve cell or a support cell, such

<!-- chunk -->

### as an astrocyte, and then binds to a receptor on a nearby nerve cell. This

<!-- chunk -->

### binding results in the production of a signal which can be transported to

<!-- chunk -->

### the nucleus of the receiving nerve cell. There, it prompts the increased

<!-- chunk -->

### production of proteins associated with nerve cell survival and function.1419

# Brain waves

<!-- chunk -->

### The brain is an electrochemical organ. Researchers speculate that a fully

<!-- chunk -->

### functioning brain can generate as much as 10 watts of electrical power. So

<!-- chunk -->

## brain waves are an electrical impulse in the brain.1420

<!-- chunk -->

### Brain waves occur when neurons send signals between each other. There

<!-- chunk -->

## are several different types of brain waves. But the main ones are Beta,

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha, Theta, and Delta.

<!-- chunk -->

## Beta waves are the most rapid pattern. And are associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration, arousal, alertness and cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

## You experience Alpha waves as you become more relaxed. The brain

<!-- chunk -->

### waves slow into an Alpha wave pattern. Associated with super-learning,

<!-- chunk -->

### flow states and joy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Still slower brain wave patterns are Theta waves. Often experienced by

<!-- chunk -->

### meditators. When you’re dreaming at night, you’re making Theta waves.

<!-- chunk -->

### Theta waves are associated with creativity, “integrative experiences” and

<!-- chunk -->

### relief from trauma. An “ah-ha moment” is a burst of Theta waves in your


<!-- chunk -->

## The slowest of all brain wave patterns are Delta Waves. They are generally

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with dreamless sleep. Very advanced meditators are able to

<!-- chunk -->

### remain alert in this deep, trance-like state. Delta waves are associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### leadership, persuasion, achievement and Oneness.

# Catecholamines

<!-- chunk -->

## Catecholamines are amines derived from the amino acid tyrosine. In

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics we focus mostly on dopamine, epinephrine (adrenaline), and

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine which act as hormones or neurotransmitters.

# Central Nervous System

<!-- chunk -->

## The central nervous system is the entire accumulation of nerves in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain and spinal cord.

<!-- chunk -->

### This nerve “highway” uses neurons to send and receive information

<!-- chunk -->

## throughout your body. And is protected by cerebrospinal fluid (CFS).

# Cerebral

<!-- chunk -->

## The word “cerebral” gets its meaning from cerebrum, which is Latin for


# Cerebral Circulation

<!-- chunk -->

## Cerebral Circulation refers to the way blood flows, or circulates, in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. Cerebral circulation is your brain’s source for the healthy exchange

<!-- chunk -->

### of oxygen and nutrients needed to function properly.

# Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)

<!-- chunk -->

## Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a disorder that causes extreme

<!-- chunk -->

### ongoing fatigue. Not the kind of fatigue that goes away after you rest.

<!-- chunk -->

### Symptoms last for 6 months or more. And is characterized by a general

<!-- chunk -->

### feeling of being unwell, muscle pain, memory problems, pain in multiple

<!-- chunk -->

### joints, headaches and sleep problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### CFS is often treated medically with stimulants like Adderall.

# Circadian Rhythm

<!-- chunk -->

## Circadian rhythm is your 24-hour built-in body clock. It can be affected

<!-- chunk -->

### by external cues like light and temperature.

<!-- chunk -->

### Circadian rhythms are critical in determining your sleeping and eating

<!-- chunk -->

### patterns. Patterns in brain wave activity, hormone production and other

<!-- chunk -->

### biological processes in your body are linked to this daily cycle.

# Cognition

<!-- chunk -->

## Cognition is the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and

<!-- chunk -->

### understanding through thought, experience and the senses. Cognition

<!-- chunk -->

### includes thinking, knowing, memory, decision-making and problem

<!-- chunk -->

### solving.

# Concentration

<!-- chunk -->

## Concentration is defined as the action or power of focusing your attention

<!-- chunk -->

### or mental effort. Without distractions or interference.

<!-- chunk -->

### Certain nootropics can help to bolster your enthusiasm, skill and

<!-- chunk -->

### commitment towards your desired goal.

# Coenzyme

<!-- chunk -->

## A coenzyme is an organic molecule (nonprotein) that binds with a protein

<!-- chunk -->

### to form an active enzyme. By themselves, coenzymes cannot catalyze a

<!-- chunk -->

### reaction, but can help enzymes to. Vitamins B


<!-- chunk -->

### , B


<!-- chunk -->

### can serve as

<!-- chunk -->

### coenzymes.

# Cortex

<!-- chunk -->

## In your brain, the cortex is the outer layer of gray matter covering the

<!-- chunk -->

### cerebral hemispheres. It is understood to be the area of higher mental

<!-- chunk -->

### functions such as cognition, intellect, and volition.

# Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP)

<!-- chunk -->

## Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) is a derivative of adenosine

<!-- chunk -->

### triphosphate (ATP) and is used for intracellular signaling. In the brain,

<!-- chunk -->

### cAMP affects the function of higher-order thinking in the prefrontal

<!-- chunk -->

### cortex.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is thought to play an important role in the formation of memories. In

<!-- chunk -->

### theory, by boosting cAMP, you can increase memory function and

<!-- chunk -->

### optimize overall brain performance.

# Cycling

<!-- chunk -->

### Tolerance is a problem with some nootropics. Consistent non-stop use can

<!-- chunk -->

### cause their effectiveness to diminish over time.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is also possible for some nootropic users to develop a psychological

<!-- chunk -->

### dependence (addiction) to compounds from prolonged use. Even though

<!-- chunk -->

### there is no physical addiction or withdrawal symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

## One way to circumvent or avoid tolerance or dependence is to “cycle” the

<!-- chunk -->

### use of certain nootropics. Find out what the tolerance characteristics (if

<!-- chunk -->

### any) are for each of the nootropics you are using. And develop a schedule

<!-- chunk -->

### to stop their use for a short period of time.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, you could use Huperzine-A for 5 days at the recommended

<!-- chunk -->

### dose and take a break for 2 days.

# DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)

<!-- chunk -->

## DNA is located in each of your cell’s nucleus (cellular DNA). A small

<!-- chunk -->

### amount of DNA is also found in the mitochondria within each cell (called

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA). And is stored as code made up of four

<!-- chunk -->

### chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T).

<!-- chunk -->

### Human DNA consists of about 3 billion bases, and more than 99 percent of

<!-- chunk -->

### those bases are the same in all people.

<!-- chunk -->

### The order, or sequence, of these bases determines the information

<!-- chunk -->

### available for building and maintaining an organism. DNA bases pair up

<!-- chunk -->

### with each other, A with T and C with G, to form units called base pairs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Each base is also attached to a sugar molecule and a phosphate molecule.

<!-- chunk -->

### Together, a base, sugar, and phosphate are called a nucleotide. Nucleotides

<!-- chunk -->

### are arranged in two long strands that form a spiral called a double helix.

<!-- chunk -->

### The structure of the double helix is kind of like a ladder, with the base

<!-- chunk -->

### pairs forming the ladder’s rungs and the sugar and phosphate molecules

<!-- chunk -->

### forming the vertical sidepieces of the ladder.

<!-- chunk -->

### An important property of DNA is that it can replicate, or make copies of

<!-- chunk -->

### itself. Each strand of DNA in the double helix can serve as a pattern for

<!-- chunk -->

### duplicating the sequence of bases. This is critical when cells divide

<!-- chunk -->

### because each new cell needs to have an exact copy of the DNA present in

<!-- chunk -->

### the old cell.

# Demethylation

<!-- chunk -->

## Demethylation is the removal of a methyl group from a molecule.

# Dendrites

<!-- chunk -->

## Dendrites are like branches projecting out of neurons that act like an

<!-- chunk -->

### antenna. Dendrites receive electrical signals sent by the synapses of

<!-- chunk -->

### neighboring neuron axons.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can have as many as 15,000 dendrites projecting from a single neuron.

<!-- chunk -->

### When you experience incoming stimuli from your senses, neuron activity

<!-- chunk -->

### increases. And dendritic spines change size, shape and conduction leading

<!-- chunk -->

## to long-term potentiation (LTP).

<!-- chunk -->

### This change in dendritic spines (neuroplasticity) and long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### potentiation plays a fundamental role in learning and memory.

# Dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

## Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that serves as a chemical signal or

<!-- chunk -->

### messenger between neurons (brain nerves). When it’s released from the

<!-- chunk -->

### first neuron, it travels into the space (synapse) between the two neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### And bumps up against receptors on the second neuron.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dopamine has five receptor types it interacts with. But is mostly

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with “feel good” or reward behavior life sex, drugs and rock

<!-- chunk -->

### and roll.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dopamine also aids in memory formation, learning and retention,

<!-- chunk -->

### attention and focus, cognition, and sleep. Insufficient levels of dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### are associated with anxiety, Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s Disease.

# Downregulation

<!-- chunk -->

## Downregulation is a process in your brain where the amount of activity in

<!-- chunk -->

### a particular neuron receptor decreases. This typically happens in response

<!-- chunk -->

### to abnormally high activity in response to one particular drug or nootropic.

<!-- chunk -->

### In other words, too much of one nootropic all at once. Or for an extended

<!-- chunk -->

### period of time.

# Encoding

<!-- chunk -->

### Before information can be stored as memories, it first needs to be

<!-- chunk -->

## encoded. Encoding is the conversion of information into a form the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### can use.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are 3 types of encoding:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Acoustic encoding is when you use sound to record information.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Visual encoding is when a person uses mental images to remember

<!-- chunk -->

### something.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3.Semantic encoding is when you remember the actual meaning or

<!-- chunk -->

### significance of information. Semantic encoding is the most

<!-- chunk -->

### important part of long term memory encoding.

# Epinephrine

<!-- chunk -->

## Epinephrine is also called adrenaline. Epinephrine is typically released in

<!-- chunk -->

### response to acute stress (fight or flight response).

<!-- chunk -->

### This hormone is secreted mainly by the adrenal glands. In the medulla

<!-- chunk -->

## region of the adrenals, the amino acid tyrosine is transformed into

<!-- chunk -->

## norepinephrine. Through a complex process involving an enzyme and

<!-- chunk -->

## cells in the adrenal medulla, norepinephrine is turned into epinephrine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Epinephrine increases cardiac output and raises glucose levels in the

<!-- chunk -->

### blood. In the brain, surges of epinephrine can negatively affect memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Epinephrine plays an important role in regulating arousal, reward and

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitivity to our environment.1421

# Executive Function

<!-- chunk -->

## Executive function is a set of mental skills including working memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### mental flexibility and self-control that help you get things done.

<!-- chunk -->

### These skills are controlled in the frontal lobe of your brain. They help you

<!-- chunk -->

### pay attention, manage time, switch focus, plan and organize, remember

<!-- chunk -->

### details, and avoid saying the wrong thing.

<!-- chunk -->

### When executive function isn’t working well, your behavior is less

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled. Executive function is often related to ADHD.

# Fat Soluble

<!-- chunk -->

## There are two varieties of supplements; water soluble and fat soluble.

<!-- chunk -->

### Water soluble supplements like any of the B Vitamins and Vitamin C

<!-- chunk -->

### dissolve in water. And excess amounts are excreted through your kidneys

<!-- chunk -->

### if you have excess amounts in your system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fat soluble supplements including vitamins A, D, E, K and most of the

<!-- chunk -->

### racetams dissolve in fat. And are stored in fat in your body (your brain is

<!-- chunk -->

### 60% fat).

<!-- chunk -->

### For fat soluble nootropics to be more effective they need to be taken with

<!-- chunk -->

### some type of fat. Examples are a tablespoon of coconut or extra virgin

<!-- chunk -->

### olive oil.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unlike water soluble supplements which go directly into your

<!-- chunk -->

### bloodstream, fat-soluble nootropics are absorbed through your intestinal

<!-- chunk -->

### wall and into your lymph system. Once in your lymph system, the

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics are sent to your bloodstream where they are available for use

<!-- chunk -->

### by your brain.

# Focus

<!-- chunk -->

## Focus is the act of directing your total attention towards a specific task.

<!-- chunk -->

### Successful focus is achieved with a singular presence of mind when

<!-- chunk -->

### completing a task.

<!-- chunk -->

### Conversely, multi-tasking is not focus. Focus is simply the act of

<!-- chunk -->

### undergoing only one task.

# Free Radicals

<!-- chunk -->

## Free radicals, reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species are

<!-- chunk -->

### generated by your body by various natural systems, exposure to different

<!-- chunk -->

### natural chemical conditions or pathological states. A balance between free

<!-- chunk -->

## radicals and antioxidants to counteract them is necessary for healthy cell


<!-- chunk -->

### Free radicals cause problems for lipids, proteins and DNA and can trigger

<!-- chunk -->

### a number of human diseases. Antioxidants can assist in coping with this

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidative stress.

# Glial Cells

<!-- chunk -->

## Glial cells or glia are distinct from neurons (nerve cells). Types of glial

<!-- chunk -->

### cells include astrocytes, ependymal cells, microglia, Schwann cells, and

<!-- chunk -->

### oligodendrocytes. And make up the white matter in your brain which

<!-- chunk -->

### accounts for about 90% of your brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Astrocytes help provide nutrients to neurons. And oligodendrocytes help

<!-- chunk -->

### produce the myelin sheath coating protecting the axons protruding from


# Glutamate

<!-- chunk -->

## Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that is responsible for sending signals

<!-- chunk -->

### between neurons in the brain. This plays an important role in learning and

<!-- chunk -->

### forming memories.

# Gray Matter

<!-- chunk -->

## Gray matter in the brain is packed with billions of neurons. Because there

<!-- chunk -->

### are so many of them it’s tempting to think of neurons as very tiny. In

<!-- chunk -->

## reality, some neurons have axons (nerve fibers) that are very long.

<!-- chunk -->

## When many axons are grouped together, they appear as white matter.

<!-- chunk -->

### White matter is a collection of long, insulated axons which are the

<!-- chunk -->

### outgoing branches of neurons that connect various parts of the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### together.

<!-- chunk -->

## The white color comes from myelin, which is the lipid, insulating material

<!-- chunk -->

### wrapped around those long axons.

# Hippocampus

<!-- chunk -->

## The hippocampus is a small region of your brain associated with long-

<!-- chunk -->

### term memory and spatial navigation. In disease such as Alzheimer’s, the

<!-- chunk -->

### hippocampus is one of the first areas of the brain to become damaged.

<!-- chunk -->

### This leads to memory loss and disorientation.

# Histamine

<!-- chunk -->

## Histamine is a type of biogenic amine neurotransmitter that is responsible

<!-- chunk -->

### for behavior like wakefulness and arousal. It also plays an important part

<!-- chunk -->

### in motivation and reward-oriented behavior.

<!-- chunk -->

### Histamine is essential in the acquisition and storage of short and long-

<!-- chunk -->

### term memory. When histamine signaling goes wrong in the brain it can

<!-- chunk -->

### lead to addictive behavior and degenerative diseases like Parkinson’s and

<!-- chunk -->

### multiple sclerosis.1422

# Ion Channel

<!-- chunk -->

## An Ion Channel is a cell structure which lets ions enter or leave. Ion

<!-- chunk -->

### channels are sometimes associated with neuroreceptors which open or

<!-- chunk -->

### close a channel depending on the presence of a neurotransmitter.

# Krebs Cycle

<!-- chunk -->

## Krebs Cycle is also known as the “citric acid cycle”, or tricarboxylic acid

<!-- chunk -->

### (TCA) cycle. This cycle is at the center of cellular respiration in your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. And throughout the cells in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Krebs cycle is a series of chemical reactions used to release stored

<!-- chunk -->

### energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA (which is derived from

<!-- chunk -->

### carbohydrates, fats and proteins). It releases this energy in the form of

<!-- chunk -->

### adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

<!-- chunk -->

### This metabolic pathway is derived from citric acid (tricarboxylic acid)

<!-- chunk -->

### that is consumed and regenerated by this sequence of events to complete

<!-- chunk -->

### the cycle. This cycle consumes acetate (acetyl-CoA) and water, and

<!-- chunk -->

### reduces NAD+ to NADH. Which produces carbon dioxide as a waste

<!-- chunk -->

### byproduct.

<!-- chunk -->

### The NADH generated by the Krebs cycle is fed into the oxidative

<!-- chunk -->

### phosphorylation (electron transport) pathway. The net result of these two

<!-- chunk -->

### closely linked pathways is the oxidation of nutrients needed as chemical

<!-- chunk -->

### energy to form ATP. The primary source of fuel created within your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cell’s mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can maintain and boost the health of your cellular Krebs cycle by

<!-- chunk -->

### using the nootropics Alpha-Lipoic Acid, Choline Citrate, Ginseng,

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium, NADH and Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (Pantothenic Acid).

# Long-Term Memory

<!-- chunk -->

## Long-Term Memory describes the type of memory associated with an

<!-- chunk -->

### event or information acquired by the mind long ago.

<!-- chunk -->

### These memories are often pieced together by the brain with inaccurate or

<!-- chunk -->

### imagined information. This inaccurate memory storage can come from

<!-- chunk -->

### your perception of an event or thing, conditioning, or any other faulty

<!-- chunk -->

### input.

<!-- chunk -->

### Healthy, psychologically sound individuals have access to an impressive

<!-- chunk -->

### information storage system to draw from. On the other hand, unhealthy

<!-- chunk -->

### and psychologically messed-up people can also access this storage system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Both groups can boost access to this long-term memory with the use of

<!-- chunk -->

### certain Nootropics.

# Long-Term Potentiation

<!-- chunk -->

## Long-Term Potentiation is the term used to describe a strengthening of

<!-- chunk -->

### synapses needed to create long-term memory. “Neurons that fire together,

<!-- chunk -->

### wire together”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Transcription factors such as cAMP responsive element binding protein

<!-- chunk -->

### (CREB), once a phosphate group is added, leads to gene expression. Which

<!-- chunk -->

### leads to changes in expression of proteins needed for producing and

<!-- chunk -->

### maintaining changes in synaptic strength. And long-term memory.

# Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)

<!-- chunk -->

## Mild Cognitive Impairment is characterized by cognitive impairment

<!-- chunk -->

## outside of the expected decline caused by aging. Unchecked, MCI can

<!-- chunk -->

## eventually lead to dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Those suffering mild cognitive impairment begin to notice difficulty with

<!-- chunk -->

### memory and cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Amyloid Plaques & Neurofibrillary Tangles, poor blood flow, and strokes

<!-- chunk -->

### all contribute to MCI. There is no known single cause of mild cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### impairment. MCI is likely caused by a combination of factors. And is

<!-- chunk -->

### often prevented or reversed through the use of nootropics.

# MAOI

<!-- chunk -->

## Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) is a substance which inhibits

<!-- chunk -->

### naturally occurring enzymes in your brain. This inhibition helps increase

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Be cautious about using nootropics that boost neurotransmitters like

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin or dopamine combined with MAOI’s. Too much serotonin or

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine can cause serious problems in the brain including “serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### syndrome”.

# Mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

## Mitochondria are organelles within each of your cells responsible for

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolizing or breaking down carbohydrates and fatty acids used to

<!-- chunk -->

### generate cellular energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### This cellular energy is in the form of a chemical molecule called

<!-- chunk -->

### adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which is generated within the mitochondria.

# Myelin

<!-- chunk -->

## Myelin sheaths are a combination of proteins and phospholipids that form

<!-- chunk -->

### an insulating-like sheath around axons in your brain. And are what give

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain’s white matter its white color.

<!-- chunk -->

### Myelin helps insulate and protect axons much like electrical tape wrapped

<!-- chunk -->

### around a bunch of wires. Myelin also assists optimal action potential

<!-- chunk -->

### (electrical signaling) through the axon.

<!-- chunk -->

### Insufficient or damaged myelin is linked to neurodegeneration and

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis. SAM-e, Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (Thiamine),


<!-- chunk -->

### , Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (folate), and Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### are critical for normal

<!-- chunk -->

### myelin formation.

# Naturopath

<!-- chunk -->

### A Naturopath is a health care practitioner who uses natural systems of

<!-- chunk -->

### healing including the use of supplements instead of prescription drugs.

# NDMA Receptors

<!-- chunk -->

## Similar to the AMPA receptor, the NMDA receptor is also paired with an

<!-- chunk -->

### ion channel. But this channel lets calcium ions rather than sodium ions

<!-- chunk -->

### into the neuron.

<!-- chunk -->

### When this cell is at resting potential, the calcium channel is blocked by

<!-- chunk -->

## magnesium ions (Mg2+), so that even if glutamate binds to the receptor,

<!-- chunk -->

### calcium cannot enter that neuron.

<!-- chunk -->

### For these magnesium ions to leave that channel, the neuron’s dendrites

<!-- chunk -->

### must be depolarized. This happens through the sustained action of the

<!-- chunk -->

### AMPA receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once the magnesium leaves the NDMA receptors, large numbers of

<!-- chunk -->

### calcium ions enter that cell. This sets off several biochemical reactions

<!-- chunk -->

### that make this synapse more efficient for an extended period of time.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is called Long-Term Potentiation, and is associated with the plasticity

<!-- chunk -->

### that allows long-term memories to form.

# Nerve Growth Factor

<!-- chunk -->

## Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is a group of small biomolecules

<!-- chunk -->

### (neurotrophic factors) and small protein-like molecules (neuropeptides)

<!-- chunk -->

### involved in the regulation of growth, maintenance, neurogenesis and

<!-- chunk -->

### survival of neurons.

# Neurons

<!-- chunk -->

## Neurons are nerve cells in your brain. They function as conduits of

<!-- chunk -->

### information from one neuron to another neuron. This signaling between

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons are actually chemically-produced electrical signals.

<!-- chunk -->

### As the human brain ages, the production of new neurons begins to slow.

<!-- chunk -->

### Old neurons begin to die. And age-related disease begins to set in.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurogenesis, or the birth of new neurons can be initiated with the use of

<!-- chunk -->

### certain nootropics.

# Neurogenesis

<!-- chunk -->

## Neurogenesis is defined as the birth and growth of new neurons. The

<!-- chunk -->

### science on neurogenesis is fairly new but this much we know –

<!-- chunk -->

### neurogenesis plays a major role in learning, memory formation and recall.

# Neuroplasticity

<!-- chunk -->

## Neuroplasticity is the ability of your brain to change structure. This

<!-- chunk -->

### includes the internal structure of neurons, and an increase in the number

<!-- chunk -->

### synapses between neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some evidence indicates that short-term memory depends on electrical

<!-- chunk -->

### and chemical events in the neurons rather than changes in structure. Long-

<!-- chunk -->

### term memory may be dependent on changes in brain structure including

<!-- chunk -->

### neurogenesis, and increases in synapses between neurons.

# Neuroreceptor

<!-- chunk -->

## A neurotransmitter receptor, or neuroreceptor are typically proteins on

<!-- chunk -->

### the surface of cells that recognize and bind to specific neurotransmitters.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neuroreceptors allow cells to communicate with one another through

<!-- chunk -->

### chemical signaling. Once bound, the receptor can change shape, and cause

<!-- chunk -->

### a cascade of chemical events within the cell.

<!-- chunk -->

### These events can alter which genes are turned on or off and can make the

<!-- chunk -->

### cell more or less likely to release its own neurotransmitters.

<!-- chunk -->

### Each type of neurotransmitter can have multiple receptors each with a

<!-- chunk -->

### different role to play in the brain.

# Neurotransmitter

<!-- chunk -->

## A Neurotransmitter is a broad term that refers to chemicals that act as

<!-- chunk -->

### communicators of information. Thus relaying signals in the brain to other

<!-- chunk -->

### parts of the brain. And throughout the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### To be considered a neurotransmitter, a molecule must;

<!-- chunk -->

### •be produced inside a neuron, found in the neuron’s terminal button,

<!-- chunk -->

### and released into the synaptic gap upon the arrival of an action

<!-- chunk -->

### potential.

<!-- chunk -->

### •produce an effect on the postsynaptic neuron.

<!-- chunk -->

### •after it has transmitted its signal to this neuron, it must be

<!-- chunk -->

### deactivated rapidly.

<!-- chunk -->

### •have the same effect on the postsynaptic neuron when applied

<!-- chunk -->

### experimentally as it does when secreted by a presynaptic neuron.1423

<!-- chunk -->

## Examples of neurotransmitters are acetylcholine, dopamine, GABA,

<!-- chunk -->

## glutamate, norepinephrine and serotonin.

# Nootropic

<!-- chunk -->

## A nootropic is a substance capable of enhancing brain or mental function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nootropics can help you boost memory, learning and overall brain


<!-- chunk -->

### The term “nootropic” is relatively new. Romanian psychologist and

<!-- chunk -->

## chemist Dr. Corneliu Giurgea synthesized Piracetam in 1963. And coined

<!-- chunk -->

### the term “nootropic” in 1972.1424 It is derived from the Greek nous

<!-- chunk -->

### (“mind”) and trepein (to bend).

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Giurgea described a nootropic as having the characteristics of

<!-- chunk -->

## enhancing learning and memory. It should protect the brain while

<!-- chunk -->

## increasing natural cognitive processes. And should not be toxic, nor

<!-- chunk -->

## stimulate or depress the brain.

# Nootropic Stack

<!-- chunk -->

## A nootropic stack refers to combining two or more nootropics to achieve a

<!-- chunk -->

### desired effect.

# Noradrenaline

<!-- chunk -->

## Noradrenaline is another name for norepinephrine.

# Norepinephrine

<!-- chunk -->

## Norepinephrine is a stress hormone. It affects parts of the brain where

<!-- chunk -->

### attention and responding actions are controlled.

<!-- chunk -->

### Along with epinephrine, norepinephrine underlies the fight-or-flight

<!-- chunk -->

### response. It increases heart rate, triggering the release of glucose from

<!-- chunk -->

### energy stores. And increases blood flow to skeletal muscle.

<!-- chunk -->

### Norepinephrine is synthesized from dopamine by dopamine β-

<!-- chunk -->

### hydroxylase. It is released from the adrenal medulla into the blood as a

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is also a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and sympathetic

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous system where it is released from noradrenergic neurons. The

<!-- chunk -->

### actions of norepinephrine are carried out by binding to adrenergic

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors.1425

# OTC

<!-- chunk -->

### OTC = Over-the-counter means substances like supplements which are

<!-- chunk -->

### available in online or brick & mortar stores without a prescription.

# Oxidative Stress

<!-- chunk -->

## Oxidative Stress often results from an imbalance between the production

<!-- chunk -->

### of free radical reactive oxygen species, and the antioxidants required to

<!-- chunk -->

### counteract them. Because your brain is the most energy-intensive organ in

<!-- chunk -->

### your body, it also hosts high free radical activity.

<!-- chunk -->

### If left unchecked, these free radicals can damage and even destroy

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons. This oxidative stress is linked to a host of neurodegenerative

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Several nootropics have been shown to combat oxidative stress including

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR), Alpha-Lipoic Acid, Coenzyme Q10, Ginkgo

<!-- chunk -->

### biloba, Gotu kola, L-Carnosine, N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC), Piperine,

<!-- chunk -->

### PQQ, Pterostilbene, Resveratrol, Rhodiola Rosea, St. John’s wort, and

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine.

# Peptide

<!-- chunk -->

## A peptide is a compound consisting of two or more amino acids linked in a

<!-- chunk -->

### chain. All humans have peptides in their body. You could consider peptides

<!-- chunk -->

### one of the building blocks of life.

<!-- chunk -->

### When a peptide chain gets especially long, it turns into a protein. The

<!-- chunk -->

### amino acid chain of peptides is called a covalent bond. A covalent bond

<!-- chunk -->

### occurs when atoms share electrons.

<!-- chunk -->

## This particular covalent bond is known as a peptide bond or amide bond. It

<!-- chunk -->

### forms when the carboxyl group of one amino acid attaches to another.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some peptides regulate hormones, while others can have an antibiotic


# pH

<!-- chunk -->

### pH is a measure of acidity or alkalinity of a substance.

# Phospholipids

<!-- chunk -->

## Phospholipids are a combination of lipids (fats) and phosphorus.

<!-- chunk -->

## Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS) are the two most

<!-- chunk -->

### important phospholipids in the cells of your body. Your body cannot

<!-- chunk -->

### function normally without them.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phospholipids are also critical for optimal brain health. They assist brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells in communicating. And influence how well neuroreceptors function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Phospholipids are found in many foods. But are in higher concentrations in

<!-- chunk -->

### soy, eggs and the brain tissue of animals.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taking supplemental phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine

<!-- chunk -->

### (PS) can lead to improved memory and learning.

# Potentiation

<!-- chunk -->

### Potentiation is the influence of a lesser active drug or substance on the

<!-- chunk -->

### effects realized from a drug already in your system.

# Precursor

<!-- chunk -->

## A precursor is a compound that participates in a chemical reaction that

<!-- chunk -->

### produces another compound. In your body and brain, the term “precursor”

<!-- chunk -->

### refers to a chemical compound preceding another in a metabolic pathway.

# Psychosis

<!-- chunk -->

### Psychosis is a person’s loss of ability to distinguish reality as perceived by

<!-- chunk -->

### others. It’s often seen as hallucinations, delusions and disturbances of

<!-- chunk -->

### thought and mood.

# Racetams

<!-- chunk -->

## Racetams all stem from the original “nootropic” called piracetam. Both

<!-- chunk -->

### piracetam and nootropic were named by the inventor of piracetam, the

<!-- chunk -->

## Romanian psychologist and chemist Dr. Corneliu Giurgea.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most common racetams are Aniracetam, Piracetam, Pramiracetam,

<!-- chunk -->

### and Oxiracetam. They all share a 2-pyrrolidone nucleus made up of

<!-- chunk -->

### oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen.

<!-- chunk -->

### Racetams are known for boosting energy, focus, learning, memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### mood. Racetams can also help increase neuroplasticity, making it easier to

<!-- chunk -->

### learn, absorb and memorize new concepts.

# Recall

<!-- chunk -->

### Recall is one of the three major components of memory. The others are

<!-- chunk -->

### encoding and storage. Think of the human brain like an organic computer.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recall is the process of retrieving a memory that has been encoded and

<!-- chunk -->

### stored in the brain’s supercomputer.

# Receptor

<!-- chunk -->

### A receptor is a structure on or inside a cell which receives a chemical

<!-- chunk -->

### signal.

# Reuptake

<!-- chunk -->

### Reuptake is the process by which used neurotransmitters are taken back

<!-- chunk -->

### into cells to be recycled or destroyed.

# Serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

## Serotonin is a neurotransmitter made from the amino acid tryptophan. The

<!-- chunk -->

### human body cannot make tryptophan so you must get it from the food you

<!-- chunk -->

### eat. Tryptophan is most abundant in meat and fowl.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once you eat food containing tryptophan, your digestion grabs the proteins

<!-- chunk -->

### in your gut. Which is transported by your blood to your brain. And then

<!-- chunk -->

### converted to serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin is an inhibitory neurotransmitter which means it governs

<!-- chunk -->

### excessive stimulating hormones like dopamine from firing in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin is present throughout the entire brain, from bottom to top.

<!-- chunk -->

### When you have adequate serotonin levels in your brain and it’s working

<!-- chunk -->

### properly, you’ll be confident, easy-going, flexible, happy, and positive.

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin deficiency can result in you becoming depressed, irritable,

<!-- chunk -->

### obsessive, negative and worried.

# Serotonin Syndrome

<!-- chunk -->

## Serotonin Syndrome symptoms usually occur within several hours of

<!-- chunk -->

### taking a new drug or nootropic. Or increasing the dose of the drug or

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic you’re already using.

<!-- chunk -->

### Symptoms can include agitation, confusion, rapid heart rate, dilated

<!-- chunk -->

### pupils, loss of muscle coordination, muscle rigidity, heavy sweating,

<!-- chunk -->

### diarrhea, headache, and shivering.

<!-- chunk -->

### Severe serotonin syndrome can be life-threatening. Signs include high

<!-- chunk -->

### fever, seizures, irregular heartbeat and unconsciousness.

<!-- chunk -->

## Caution is strongly advised when using any nootropic that boosts

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin uptake in your brain. Especially when combining them with any

<!-- chunk -->

### drug or nootropic that is already boosting serotonin.

# Short-term Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Short-term Memory is also known as primary or active memory. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### characterized as being very brief (i.e. seconds), and is limited to what you

<!-- chunk -->

### can remember and retain for 20 to 30 seconds.

<!-- chunk -->

### The human brain can only retain new information to a certain extant

<!-- chunk -->

### (chunk capacity) and only temporarily (temporal capacity).

<!-- chunk -->

### Short-term memory can be boosted using certain nootropics.

# Stimulant

<!-- chunk -->

### A stimulant is any substance that increases activity in the central nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### system. Stimulants can cause wakefulness, alertness, and often feelings of

<!-- chunk -->

### well-being. An overdose of stimulants can cause anxiety, jitteriness, and

<!-- chunk -->

### insomnia. Examples of stimulants include the prescription drugs Adderall

<!-- chunk -->

### and Ritalin.

# Sublingual

<!-- chunk -->

## Sublingual refers to taking a nootropic or other supplement by placing it

<!-- chunk -->

### under your tongue. Dissolving a substance under your tongue allows for

<!-- chunk -->

### better bioavailability because it’s absorbed directly into your bloodstream

<!-- chunk -->

### through the tissues in your mouth.

# Synapses

<!-- chunk -->

## Synapses are the empty spaces between neurons (brain nerve cells). When

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons fire, they send electrical signals across the synaptic cleft to the

<!-- chunk -->

### neuron next door.

<!-- chunk -->

### Healthy brain activity is dependent on the proper function of synaptic

<!-- chunk -->

### activity. Obstructions like Amyloid Plaques can block synapses and cause

<!-- chunk -->

### serious problems with many brain functions including cognition, learning

<!-- chunk -->

### and memory.

# Tolerance

<!-- chunk -->

## In pharmacology, tolerance describes the decrease or loss of effectiveness

<!-- chunk -->

### or response to a drug or nootropic. Typically, due to recent or prolonged

<!-- chunk -->

### exposure to that substance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tolerance also includes the need for increasing doses of a drug or

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic over time to maintain the same effect.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cycling is often used by nootropic users to counteract tolerance. An

<!-- chunk -->

### example of cycling is using a nootropic for 5 days, taking a 2-day break

<!-- chunk -->

### from using the nootropic and resuming use for another 5 days.

# Upregulation

<!-- chunk -->

## Upregulation is a process in which the number or activity of receptors

<!-- chunk -->

### increases, typically in response to abnormally low activity.

# White Matter

<!-- chunk -->

## See definition of Gray Matter to get an understanding of brain White

<!-- chunk -->

## Matter.

# Uptake

<!-- chunk -->

## Uptake is the absorption by your body, and in the case of nootropics, by

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain, of a substance like a nootropic.

# Working Memory

<!-- chunk -->

## Working memory is distinct from short and long-term memory. These are

<!-- chunk -->

### memories that are not only remembered, but simultaneously processed.

<!-- chunk -->

### You not only remember information that is important to you, you also

<!-- chunk -->

### remember the purpose of the information, and why you decided to

<!-- chunk -->

### remember it.

# YMMV

<!-- chunk -->

## YMMV = Your Mileage May Vary is a term commonly used in the

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropic community. Meaning people experience reactions to certain

<!-- chunk -->

### nootropics very differently. Always remember that when someone

<!-- chunk -->

### describes their experience with a nootropic, you are unlikely to have the

<!-- chunk -->

### exact same experience.
