## The Call for More Clinical Herbalists

Herbal healing is one of the oldest practices on the planet, yet one of the newest up-and-coming professions. Reliance on healing botanicals has gone in and out of fashion and acceptance over its long history. The good news for present day herbalists is that there is an increased interest in wellness and willingness to modify lifestyle for the sake of health.

Although herbalism is not listed as one of the top ten career paths on popular websites or in the press, health care professions certainly are. There is a reported growing shortage of nurses, doctors, and home health aides as more people, especially the elderly, get sicker and sicker. Modern medicine keeps them alive longer, but quality of life decreases with chronic illnesses, dementias, Alzheimer’s disease, and depression. Furthermore, diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and hyperactivity disorders are creeping into our children’s lives due to poor dietary and lifestyle choices and peer pressure, among other factors.

An herbalist’s intention has historically been to keep people healthy, to use preventative measures, and to be proactive. Maintaining optimum health is our mantra, rather than chasing symptoms and diseases around later. So, who says that herbalism is not, once again, a legitimate up-and-coming profession? If you are trying to become a millionaire, this isn’t it. But if looking for a rewarding career, with a chance to heal yourself and others while helping the planet survive, then proceed full speed ahead.

## Intentions of the Text

This herbal textbook is the one I always wished for. It is meant to be a practical and understandable user-friendly tool for solo seekers, formal students, educators, herb schools, and colleges. I set out to provide the foundations needed for the modern herbalist and to explain things step by step in a clear and understandable manner. It is meant to help launch into whatever next step appears along the herbal journey. If starting from scratch, welcome. This guide, along with a good teacher or herb school, is a way to go. At the other end, schools will find this a useful text to augment their programs. Perhaps you have already taken herbal classes, gone to a school, found a mentor, or studied on your own. Then this text is aimed at being a good reference to fill in a blank spot or help with memory. Say you forgot the proportions for putting up a tincture or are wondering, “What was that herb, again, for menstrual cramps?” Just flip open this reference to find the answer.

A message to educators: for the all the wonderful herb schools, trainings, and teachers already out there, I know from experience that finding a good text to augment existing curriculums is a challenge. Most herb schools are small, and they typically piece together handouts from their own experience, past classes, and other sources. The volume of herbal information is daunting. A college program, especially, needs a good solid text.

I thought it would be lovely to present what is needed under one tree, so to speak. I certainly would have loved it, had this resource been available for me, way back when. Therefore, I provide what I believe is a beginning and not so beginning guide for school use. In that vein, an Instructor’s Manual containing suggested lab activities and pop quizzes with answers is available online for instructors. Selections for the hands-on lab sections actually work. I have successfully used those very formulas, gathered from all over, and tested out the activities in my own school. Every class needs some breakout lab time to provide hands-on time—to mix up the medicine and to smell, taste, and experience the plants. Otherwise all you get are a lot of glazed-over eyeballs.

This text is very thorough. My intention is to take nothing for granted and to cover all bases. My hope is that at the end of the day, those with a passion can go out there with enough confidence to carry on as a competent clinical herbalist. This textbook will always be around in a pinch, an old familiar friend. It is a reference to return to for reminders, review, and support when faced with the sometimes scary task of devising a challenging formula and health plan for a complicated client. Nobody is an expert right away, if ever.

Every herbal program or class needs the personal take and touch of its instructor. Exposure to different points of view is enriching, much more interesting, and fun. I believe we all bring our own wisdom and life experiences into the mix of whatever endeavor we embrace. I respect that and you.

## The East-West Format

One of the pitfalls of a lot of Western herbal programs and books is that there is really no method provided to make a good assessment of a client’s individual condition, nor to determine the best herbal choices from a laundry list of possibilities. It embraces a take this for that approach or, one could say, a cookbook mentality.

Other ancient herbal traditions such as Ayurvedic, Unani-Tibb, and Traditional Chinese Medicine have honed assessment skills for patients that are elegant and earth-based. These are incredibly successful in a clinical sense, having evolved over thousands of years. They provide a holistic approach that includes the planet we live on, its elements, the weather, seasons, plants, and animals. These ancient healing traditions appreciated what is referred to as the qualities of a plant, its energetics. They include qualities such as heat, cold, dry, or damp, or some version thereof.

In turn, determinations were made about patients by examining aspects such as the tongue, urine, pulse, personality, or body type, which were then matched up with remedies to heal a given condition. Later, the American Eclectics borrowed from these various systems to develop their unique energetic format.

The modern Western medical approach has pretty much abandoned all this wisdom in favor of a single-minded obsession with science and technology. When this works, it is lifesaving. But it often doesn’t work, especially with chronic illness. Throughout history, Western herbalism has always been entangled, often at odds, with the prevailing and dominant medical philosophy of the times. In the modern era, Western herbalists have tended to follow the allopathic lead, perhaps in an attempt to appear more credible and respected.

Western herbalism has now come full circle. We are getting back to our roots. It makes for a more successful practice and healing system. Therefore, I have chosen to combine Chinese botanicals with traditional and beloved Western herbs. This is how I learned. I have included Chinese syndromes or disease patterns with a close-as-possible comparison to Western disease names. I am a nurse, after all. I have included Chinese assessment methods of pulse and tongue examination, along with tools that a Westerner might use, such as how to take a blood pressure.

This provides the best of both worlds. It is not the easiest route, because there is a great deal to learn. For a Westerner not trained in Chinese Medicine, it’s like learning another language. Even Chinese organs have different meanings than their corresponding Western anatomical parts. But in the end, it’s worth it.

<!-- chunk -->

## Overall Organization

A huge amount of material is organized in what I deem a logical sequence, one that actually makes sense. Any way material is juggled, there is arguably a better order. I placed this material in a sequence that worked for myself and my classes, but as I went along, I would switch things around in real time to fit a unique classroom need. So, I recommend that any school or individual looking to create their own curriculum start here, and then expand, mix or match, and reorganize as needed.

For instance, at first I put the medicine-making segment near the end, but I later discovered that students wanted to get their hands into the nitty gritty of remedy-making much earlier. If it was late spring, a logical time for an herb walk, everyone itching to be in the great outdoors with the baby plants popping up, what good would botany, plant families, and proper identification be tucked in at the end of the program, not yet covered? With these considerations, the text is divided into five parts.

<!-- chunk -->

### Part I The Basics

This comprises the basics of herbal medicine complete with history, botany, wildcrafting, herbal preparations, and instructions on medicine-making. Chemical constituents come next, providing a scientific segue into traditional plant energetics. Then comes what seems the most challenging topic for Westerners untrained in Chinese Medicine: namely the foundational elements of Western and Chinese Medicine, how they mesh, how they don’t, and why this understanding is essential to obtaining good results as an herbalist. For example, a lot of practice time and class labs must be devoted to Chinese pulse and tongue assessment, so it may be used effectively in clinic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Part II Materia Medica

The all-important Materia Medica, the basic plant information section, is divided into two chapters—the first being a well-rounded selection of individual herbs, and the second comprising groups of similarly acting botanicals, such as a group of cooling demulcents with the nuances between them. Each botanical follows the same format, making the information consistent. I have chosen twenty-five basic herbs that I think all herbalists must know. Then come a few important groupings. The Materia Medica includes Western and Chinese botanical selections.

Choosing a good basic Materia Medica always boils down to personal favorites. There are some indisputables, such as the need for Licorice root and at least one berberine, such as Western Oregon Grape root or Chinese Coptis Huang Lian (Goldthread root). But after that, possibilities abound, with what has worked either historically or from personal experience. A beginning Materia Medica should be chosen from common plants that are readily available and not too expensive. There should not be too many. It is best to include a couple of versatile representatives of each body system or energetic quality. For example, a good warming or neutral anti-infective, such as Osha root or Echinacea root, and a cooling antibiotic or antiviral, like Usnea thallus or Andrographis Chuan Xin Lian (Heart-Thread Lotus leaf).

<!-- chunk -->

### Part III The Herbalist in Action

This is the practical preparation for student clinic. Here we stop being theoretical or intellectual. Instead it’s what is needed to know in real time, in a real live clinic setting. A chapter is involved with herbal safety and herb-drug interactions—important information, not necessarily requiring memorization, but still essential. Above all, do no harm. Then comes how to put any given formula together, proportioning out each herb—called dispensing. Proper dosing is an essential aspect.

Finally, comes the interview—taking a health history, making an accurate assessment using all described tools, and devising a feasible, effective plan. At the end comes documentation. Health forms are provided to copy and use at will. These appear in the text and in Appendix A.

<!-- chunk -->

### Part IV Case Histories: Therapeutics and Formulations

This is approached in Western style by body systems. General information is presented about each system. Included are functional medicine concepts, with basic understandings that help herbalists get to the root of chronic health problems, including gut health, inflammation, oxidative stress, and liver detoxification. Chinese syndromes or disease patterns with typical pulse and tongue examples are given and are correlated as much as possible with Western diseases.

A small list of important Chinese and Western herbs not previously mentioned in the original Materia Medica section is highlighted here because they are pertinent, a must for that body system. Herbal categories are given along with numerous tables to help in creating a personalized formula.

Finally come various case histories showcasing conditions that an herbalist is most likely to encounter, complete with sample formulas and their rationales. The Western disease is explained, and its most likely Chinese syndrome given. The presentation is given in S.O.A.P. format (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), a standard method of charting and organizing a treatment strategy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Part V Getting Out There

The final but highly important chapters include current entities and herbal organizations, such as Germany’s Commission E, the American Botanical Council, and the American Herbalists Guild. Included are the legal aspects of herbal medicine and herbs. Where do we stand and what are the issues? How are legalities handled in other countries? The debate still rages about herbal standardization, an issue enmeshed in politics, the American Medical Association (AMA), the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), and among herbalists themselves. A discussion is included about Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and what that means for us. If being a clinician isn’t your bag, mention is made of the various and potentially lucrative other areas an herbalist might explore while still using their skills and love of healing plants.

### Chapter Organization

Chapters begin with Chapter Review, a brief, bulleted outline of the contents therein to determine if that is the needed one. Key Terms list the important words presented. They are highlighted in the text, appearing again in the Glossary. Then come a few introductory paragraphs to further detail contents. The previewed information follows, concluded by a Summary. Sometimes just reading the summary alone can help jog the memory. The final section is a Review portion to help determine if the material was understood and retained or if reviewing a particular section might be in order. Fill in the Blanks follow, with answers in Appendix B. Finally come Critical Concept Questions, a group of open-ended queries with answers for the reader to decide.

### The Back of the Book Is a Treasure Trove

So now with the game plan laid out, the time has come to delve into the specifics of becoming a credible and informed herbalist. Enjoy the ride.

# Acknowledgments

It really does take a village. This book could never have existed without my many circles, the herbal community, family, friends, and the star attractions, the plants. At times these circles overlap and intermingle, blurring together into a holistic whole—and at other times, one sphere is singled out, depending on the moment. Thus, my thank you note.

Herbalist Joan Zinn, this text’s illustrious illustrator and Western herbal reviewer, has been my faithful backup on Western herbal accuracy, contributing amazing illustrations, photography, computer expertise, copyediting, and attention to detail—endless spelling and punctuation corrections (even when I secretly didn’t want to hear it). Her many talents and countless hours glued to the computer go beyond thanks. And, as if her editing expertise wasn’t enough, Joan has been my wildcrafting mentor for years, introducing me to plants in the wild through countless herb walks in all kinds of weather, involving plant identification, foraging, and adventuring. She is truly a remarkable teacher and Wise Woman.

Acupuncturist Matthew Berk, Chinese Medicine reviewer, came through brilliantly with his expertise on Chinese herbal medicine and his very gentle corrections to an occasional pulse or tongue faux pas on my part.

Photographer and herbalist Jennifer Ann Tucker and husband, professor and photographer Gerald Lang, came along quite serendipitously at the perfect moment. Their magnificent creative collaborations and copyrighted photos, The Botanical Series, are loaned with permission from the Studio at Hill Crystal Farm. They are scattered throughout, particularly in the botany chapter.

Herbalist and writer Mary Maruca was there from the start with her encouragement and knowledge about the world of publishing and her valuable advice on approaching that daunting area. Which segues to Elsevier, this text’s publisher, having the vision and confidence in me to accept this manuscript. My gratitude is heartfelt.

Technical support has come from my loving husband, Mark Felton, who was always there when I panicked about a computer crisis, not to mention his constant encouragement and patience through a very lengthy process that left us little time to enjoy other activities together.

My children and extended family have always had my back. Their unconditional love, support, and psychic energy (in this and a lifetime of undertakings) has been a constant. Soul sister Andrea Lord was always game, be it helping me wildcraft, hiking anywhere, or doing what she does best—listening.

The herbal community has given me nothing but good vibes and inspiration. I have learned from them all, whether they know it or not. And finally, my herbal allies have been important spiritual teachers and provided countless hours of communion, healing, and joy.

# Dedication

This book is dedicated to my special friend Joan Zinn—chief editor, illustrator, and consultant in all things herbal—who went above and beyond in her help and support.

And with love and gratitude to the plant spirits, and all my friends and relations.

# From the Heart

“It takes SEVEN lifetimes to become an herbalist.”

—Herbalist Susun Weed

## Your Stories

This textbook is for all those drawn to healing plants. We all have our stories or special people in our lives who opened doors. Perhaps a wise mother or grandmother brewed up a remedy from the garden when you were small. You always remembered the taste and smell of her elderberry honey elixir or her soothing peppermint-licorice tea. If herbal healing runs in the family and you are continuing that legacy, how fortunate.

Perhaps an inspirational teacher or mentor crossed your path at the right time and place. Maybe you apprenticed with a wise old soul, or a dear friend dragged you along on a hike, and in spite of yourself, you found yourself checking out every plant along the trail with her. Some people are gardeners who find joy in watching plants grow and love putting their hands in the dirt. Many grow ornamental flowers first, followed by a more practical vegetable garden. Next, they may add a few cooking herbs that are also medicinal, such as oregano, marjoram, or rosemary. One step leads to another.

Sometimes a nightmarish experience with an insurance company starts an herbal journey. You might have been rejected because of a preexisting condition or not have had the coverage needed to receive an expensive, but life-saving, cancer drug. Maybe you couldn’t afford any health insurance at all, leaving no choice but to find an alternative. Did you become disillusioned with the medical establishment because of a bad experience? There sure are plenty of horror stories out there of doctors who do not listen, misdiagnose, prescribe strong drugs with bad side effects, and perform botched or unnecessary surgeries.

There are also the seemingly impossible, too-good-to-be-true, real-life miracles that have changed many lives. Did an herbalist or alternative healer cure you of some serious chronic disease when traditional medicine utterly failed? Some variation of this story is often the inspiration for beginning holistic health studies, whether in herbalism, acupuncture, or massage therapy. The alternative-medicine list is huge. Perhaps you, like me, originally trained as a nurse but eventually sought out other modalities because so few of your patients were truly healed. There are many stories and reasons to turn to plant wisdom. The upshot is that here you are, seeking more.

## My Story

It took a long time for me to get to the point where I had the courage to write a textbook that I felt would actually provide useful information and serve as a go-to guide for others. I zigzagged around the signposts pointing me in that direction until finally I arrived.

I live in Colorado where the outdoors and the mountains are a way of life. In the old days, I was a tree checker-outer and a flower-picker. The flower-picking part was done in all innocence with no awareness that, just possibly, I was removing potential seeds that would ensure continuation of next year’s blooms. One day, to my embarrassment, I got busted. At Yosemite National Park, I was caught in the act. A park ranger put an end to my wild bouquet creativity.

Then came a July day in 1960s when I drifted by a street fair high up in Telluride, Colorado. One of the booths featured displays of dried herbs lovingly arranged in bundles and tied with natural jute and ribbons. Recycled gallon pickle jars contained mysterious dried plants. It was all very alluring. I asked the wise lady managing the booth about a jar of beautiful red berries. “Rosehips,” she replied. “They grow all through the mountains.” Wow. And thus it began.

Little did I know then that I would take a slight detour, becoming a nurse and entering the health field in a very conventional way. After nursing school, I worked in an intensive care unit (ICU) for many years, becoming a high-tech adrenaline junky. Working in the ICU is not for easygoing, mellow types. For a while, I found the work challenging and stimulating. I treated a lot of trauma patients, and the heroic saves that followed made me feel proud. Trouble was, very few of my patients with chronic illnesses actually got any better. In fact, they were readmitted multiple times for the exact same problem. We nurses joked that they were the “frequent fliers.” Looking back, I think that those comments were not too kind, perhaps, but still true.

During those years, my view of conventional allopathic medicine started to change. For trauma and emergencies, orthodox medicine saved lives, but for the rest, it provided no more than Band-Aid cures. Disillusioned, I reduced my hospital hours, eventually weaning myself out of the ICU and all the while taking courses in holistic health. (This, by the way, is a path many nurses took before me and likely will continue to follow.) After becoming a certified massage therapist and then a national board-certified reflexologist, I opened a private practice. I even taught at my former massage school for a while. Having a nursing background certainly didn’t hurt my credentials.

I went to every holistic, alternative medicine workshop I could find and afford, on all kinds of topics. Some were fabulous; some were just ok. My critical test was that the workshop had to be practical. I wanted to be sure I could turn around the next day and really start using what I had learned, both on myself and in my own practice. I had no time for what was intellectual and interesting; I sought the type of workshop that would leave me wondering, “Now what do I actually do with this?”

Later, the same criterion became the standard I aspired to attain in my herb school, Just for Health. I wanted graduating students to be able to take the plunge after attending classes and begin to use the herbs. I wanted them to feel comfortable going out into their communities as practicing herbalists, rather than putting their notes and handouts back on the shelf to collect dust, with the hope they would get back to them someday. So many folks are enthusiastic starters but poor finishers. They don’t use their education after shelling out a chunk of cash to learn a subject. I found the key to success for my students was to provide lots of hours of student clinic and practice with actual clients while they still had the safety net of the school and its instructors. A good long clinical experience can make it or break it for a budding herbalist.

So after sampling many holistic classes, I had found my passion and enrolled in a major herbal medicine training with Peter Holmes, licensed acupuncturist, master herbalist, and aromatherapist. I was officially hooked on herbs. Time flew by while I made herbal tinctures; before I knew it, dinner time was long gone. I was so engrossed in herbology that I developed a large apothecary containing both Western and Chinese herbs. Every time I learned about a fabulous new herb, I added it to my must-have list.

My herbal tincture collection grew far beyond the well-known, such as echinacea root and goldenseal root. I remember thinking, “I have to have Salvia Dan Shen” an exemplary Chinese herb for the heart. So I ordered a pound and made it up. Oh, yes, and then I had to gather some Western bilberry leaves in the mountains to help with blood sugar balance. Of course, I hunted out more and more must-have plants. Herbal medicine became an obsession, a dedication, a meditation, a new way of life. I spent my money on whatever next plant I couldn’t live without.

In 2003, I opened a Colorado state-approved school called Just for Health School of Reflexology and Healing Arts. When dreaming about how to establish the school and develop the herbal curriculum, I believed it had to include both Western and Chinese philosophies and botanicals to achieve true healing. That’s the way I was taught. After I enlisted the help of an acupuncturist to teach the Chinese aspects of the curriculum, we launched ourselves as a cross-cultural East–West herb school. Along the way, as we taught classes, I learned what was needed to help students develop the confidence to really make a go of an herbal practice. I discovered my program’s strong points, pitfalls, and holes. Because I could find no textbook in print that covered what I needed, this book organically evolved.

## Herbalism Is Community

Now here’s a bonus, something wonderful I discovered on my herbal journey. There is a whole tribe of kind-hearted, like-minded people who will embrace and support you on your herbal path and gather together in community with you—if you let them. Your only requirement is to adore and respect plant wisdom. If you do that, you’re in. Education or lack of credentials are not the defining criteria. You may have no credentials at all, and you will still be welcome if you love plants. In this community, students of all ages are accepted. Herbalist grandmothers tend to mentor and encourage the newbies. Supporting new herbalists is critical, because all who love plant medicine want the tradition to continue generation after generation—and to raise herbalism’s status in the 21st century and beyond.

Communities of supportive herb people are critical, because there always comes a time when the help of a practiced herbalist to save a plant or help with a medicine is needed. One such time came for me when I had the opportunity to acquire fresh Avena sativa (milky oat berry), a brain food and nervous system restorative extraordinaire. This is one of the herbs you must have when it is fresh. It is much less effective when dried. The milky stage of the berry is when the young, green immature oat seed is fresh and moist. It is available only about 2 weeks out of the year, so acquiring it at that time is a sensitive, challenging endeavor.

Fortunately, I’m part of an amazing community. So when milky oat berry became available, the Boulder-Denver herbal community pipeline was sent into operation, and a text went out. Pacific Botanicals, an Oregon herb company and farm, had just announced that milky oats would soon be harvested. The community asked if I wanted to go in on an order. Of course, I did! I took a pound.

Fresh herbs need to be sent out via overnight air so that they don’t get mildew and moldy in transit. They also have to be tinctured immediately on arrival. Well, time came for the herbal delivery, and just then I had to go out of town. So I asked a dear herbalist friend to pick up my order and tincture it for me right then and there. The oats were safely sitting in alcohol when I returned.

Then there are herbal gatherings. Sometimes we meet at the home of my friend and fellow herbalist Brigitte Mars every summer for a nerdy, annual herbalist potluck. The main topic is some plant or other. We geek out. Brigitte always blends up and serves a fresh Nettle smoothie, along with other veggies and fruits.

Numerous groups have periodic herbal symposia all over the country and abroad. I have found them well worth attending. They offer a wonderful learning, connecting, and joyous herbal ride. If you didn’t know anyone before you got there, you could be sure to have a bunch of herbal buddies and connections by the time you leave.

## Herbalism Is a Spiritual Journey

For me, botanical medicine is much more than a profession. Herbalism is a spiritual path, a mind-opening experience, an opportunity to explore other realms. Herbal wisdom comes from many sources. Books are one avenue. More esoteric sources of plant wisdom also exist, if you choose to travel there. They involve altered levels of consciousness, meditative and altered states that let you establish a relationship with a plant. Shamans, medicine men and women, curanderos, and the ancient goddess cultures have all known and practiced these forms of connection. Communing and sitting with a plant in the wild can be a mind-opening practice. The plant beings will convey secrets, tell you who they are, let you know who their medicine is for, and give other information—but only if they are treated with respect. And gratitude. And patience.

I have had the great fortune to be gifted with some fresh Cereus grandiflorus (Night-blooming cactus flower and stem) (Fig. 1.1) grown in a greenhouse. The fleeting cactus blossoms bloom for one night only, giving off a heavenly sweet scent. By morning, the flowers are folded and gone. This cactus flower is strong heart medicine, loved and revered by the famous American Eclectic herbalists of the 19th century.

While tincturing these gorgeously huge white flowers, I drifted into another dimension, complete with visions of a mysterious lady and connection to her spirit. We had never met before, but I now know she is one of my teachers who will instruct me in how to use Cereus carefully, with intuition, wisdom, and care. Books say Cereus is strong medicine, with a potential for toxicity. But as poet Bob Dylan sang, “You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.” I now know this herb and her personality from a personal space as a powerful and sometimes dangerous ally to be treated with respect.

Caution: Cereus is not a plant for beginners and is not recommended for a basic apothecary. Thus I have not detailed its use in our text. I mention it only as part of my own personal medicine journey. Your own allies will appear for you when you are ready—and when the time is right.

## Herbalists Are Stewards of the Earth

Being out in nature, going on foraging expeditions known as wildcrafting, or simply walking along and identifying plants up in the mountains is my idea of heaven. I might be alone or with a like-minded friend. Either way, I can think of no other place I’d rather be than in this primal, quiet, peaceful space outdoors. Even when I am not gathering herbs for my apothecary, I am always checking things out, field guide in hand. I’m generally going slowly, looking down, but sometimes up. Or sideways. I don’t cover much physical territory, but I do get lost in another world. I return home muddy and rejuvenated (Fig. 1.2).

Digging into the earth for a root or snipping off a flower must be done consciously. To do this, give thanks, ask permission, and if not forthcoming, move on to another spot. Always leave enough in a stand, a group, or plant family, for another day and another year. And then, please cover your tracks. Fill in the hole. Cover the spot with dried grass or branches. Leave no trace. And for heaven’s sake, be sure of correct identification.

The most obvious thing that draws most people to a new plant is its flower, which is usually seen in summer. A flower’s scent and texture are important. Next, we notice the leaves—their pattern, shape, and stem arrangement. Finally, as we become more sophisticated, we know the plant through the other seasons. We recognize her in the fall when she has gone to seed, and in the winter when brown and dry with only a couple of seeds, dried flowers, or crackly leaves still hanging on. Then comes spring, when baby leaves pop up fresh and new through the earth. I am not fully acquainted with a plant until I can recognize her in all guises and seasons. Meeting the botanical all chopped-up in a package bought from a store is never quite as powerful.

Whenever you have the opportunity to check out whole growing plants, wherever you live, seize the moment. I confess that herb walks and outings were the most popular part of my school, more so than any brilliant lecture I had ever prepared. Over the years, I added more and more walks to the program. The students could not get enough. Walking the earth awakens our primal connection to the plants and Earth. We remember who we are, who we were, where we come from.

The most ancient and the latest sources of wisdom say we are all connected. This includes the plants, people, animals, and even the rocks. Native Americans have always known and taught this. Now scientists say that the microflora in our gut and on our skin are similar to the underground fungal mycelium and bacteria connecting the roots of plants. Our bodies and the plants are all really one enormous organism. We are truly a hologram, part of a holistic whole. If this is so, how could we possibly disrespect and tear down nature, the planet, deplete our natural resources, destroy ourselves? This understanding and consciousness could be one important answer to saving our earth—stopping climate change and healing the planet. Plant people carry with them that grave responsibility for healing at all levels. Herbalists understand this communion with all that lives, and the resulting need to conserve and protect resources, to wildcraft responsibly, to take only what we need and leave enough to grow another day. In this way, acting as true stewards, we gift our children and others with this deep truth.

## Herbalism Is a Good Excuse to Travel

Herbalists, medicine men and women, and ethnic healers can be found all over the planet, each practicing their own healing wisdom. Certainly, there are plants indigenous to specific areas of the world that you’ve never heard of, seen, or met. Think of the Incas of South America who use the healing herbs from the Andes and Amazon rain forest. Daydream about native cultures from Central and North America, including Canada. Don’t forget the Hawaiian kahuna shaman, Australian aborigine wisdom, and African medicine women and men. The list is as long as those of plants and humans who love and learn from them.

Opportunities may present for herbal study, apprenticeships, workshops, or expeditions to other countries. Some herb schools offer these experiences as part of their curriculum. If you find one, consider yourself blessed. Dr. Rosita Arvigo knows the healing ways of the Maya in the rain forest of Belize. She offers American herbalists opportunities to study ethnobotany and Maya abdominal massage. I know more than one wise woman who has returned to Belize multiple times to learn and apprentice with beloved Rosita.

Various organizations offer special tours for herbalists also. I was fortunate enough to join a group of healers with Plants and Healers International, based in Asheville, North Carolina. We traveled to Peru’s magnificent Sacred Valley and enjoyed a 2-week herb walk, mixed in with visits to Machu Picchu and other spectacular Inca ruins. We learned a lot from our enthusiastic guides, who with much joy, song, and humor dispensed scientific knowledge coupled with deep spiritual understanding of the plants and culture.

Such trips are peak experiences that you’ll never forget and cherish forever. They can be enjoyed by visiting another country or by remaining in your own. Wise women and men are everywhere. Look and ask around, and I know yours will be the perfect expedition at the perfect moment.

## A Few Words of Wisdom

First. Appreciate the plants and their teachings. Herbalism, in its truest sense, is connecting with the earth and the Earth Mother. We are the stewards of the green. Respectful wildcrafting is very important so that our herbal legacy and our natural medicines will still be available for our children, their children, and future children through the seventh generation. We must protect our resources, learn from nature, and give thanks.

Second. The best way to know a plant is to sit with it where it lives and listen with all the senses. If this is impossible or if a particular herb doesn’t grow nearby, no worries. Feel, taste, and smell the bag of herbs you have and say, “Hello.” Try sitting with a common plant in your neighborhood. Lady dandelion grows all over the world, so she certainly grows near your house. Countless so-called medicinal weeds are adapted to city environments. Others adapt to specific countries on the map. Granted, you can’t find ginseng in a desert in the Southwest desert or osha root at sea level, but you can get to know plenty of plants who grow happily wherever you are. Order the ones that don’t grow nearby from a reputable, conscious, Earth-loving herb company.

Third. Herbal knowledge and healing is a health insurance policy. If we know about the healing plants and how to use them, we empower ourselves, our families, and our clients to heal and live up to their health potential under their own steam. What if the modern medical system were to crash? How probable is that scenario? Our backups and saving graces have always been our botanical bounty and the herbalists who know how to use medicinal plants. These gifts from nature grew on Earth before medical doctors, clinics, and hospitals arrived on the scene.

Fourth. Herbs may not do it all, but I for one avoid going to medical doctors as much as possible. Keep in mind that this statement is coming from a former nurse also, or especially, because I was one. I know firsthand how broken the medical system can be. Of course, we respect the modern medical establishment as a part of the whole, to be used when needed, but also to call on wisely. For instance, a few years ago, I had a bout of serious difficulty breathing—pneumonia. Then, 2 years later, I suffered a fractured hip. On those occasions, I wasted no time in getting to the nearest modern emergency room. But choosing a gentler healing method whenever possible and appropriate is what herbalism is about. I always turn to my own herbal formulas first.

And fifth. Positive energy and enthusiasm associated with your personal plant work will rub off on your children, friends, family, and community. So get involved. Pass on our precious legacy. Teach others when possible, and make sure the gifts and teachings from the plants are not lost. And please have fun with this never-ending journey. It’s like peeling the onion. Learning and understanding plant wisdom goes on and on. Just when you think, “I’ve finally got this down,” there’s more to learn, more to be discovered—as another botanical, a new healing plant emerges from the rain forest, desert, or to our consciousness. Or suddenly a new medical use for an old favorite comes along. Let the excitement shine, because you have a lifetime of adventures ahead. Did you have any idea what you were getting into?

Wise-Woman Tradition

This chapter looks at the history of herbalism and its turf wars with the medical establishment. The history of herbalism is interwoven with medicine and the status of women. The use of plants used to be the stand-alone healing way. Medicine and herbalism did not diverge until the last few hundred years of the Renaissance, when the scientific method began to dominate. Medical technology began to replace old plant wisdom, a rivalry still not resolved. Colorful individuals, historical events, and movements during these eras led us to our current position on the herb-drug continuum.

Key contributors to the history of herbalism were the Wise-Woman healers, whose status fluctuated from revered healer to witch, as trust in plant medicine gave way to support of what became the medical establishment. Women, originally respected as healers protecting the secrets of life and death, were transformed into evil witches and sorceresses influenced by the devil, as mainstream religious practices and organized medicine grew in Europe. Which version was accepted depended on the dogma of the times and political climate. As medicine became an increasingly male-dominated profession, women as healers were downgraded, dismissed, and sometimes persecuted.

So, in tracing the history of herbalism, we must consider two parallel timelines—one being plant medicine versus allopathic Western medicine, and the other the history of women as healers whose influence fluctuated according to their status in society.

## Prehistory

<!-- chunk -->

### How Did Healing Begin?

Humans and animals have always used plants for food and medicine. Often, human knowledge of plant wisdom came from watching animals select plants for their own healing. Overall, learning was undoubtedly intuitive and based on trial and error, with many of our ancestors discovering the hard way what would help or harm.

Archeological finds testify to this phenomenon. A 60,000-year-old grave site of a Neanderthal man located in a cave in Iraq had been scattered with the flower pollen of many medicinal plants still found and used in the area today. Marshmallow, yarrow, and ephedra were there.1 In addition, Sumerians left written cuneiform records of plants they used. Ancient Egyptians wrote down herbal remedies on papyri. Jars still retaining the aroma of essential oils have also been found in their tombs, a testament to the reverence the ancients had for healing oils and herbs.

The importance of plant remedies is evident in every civilization for which we have either archeological discoveries or written records. Common threads among these civilizations and fundamental principles indicate that plant discoveries and healing practices evolved simultaneously in many cultures and locations. For instance, dandelion grows just about everywhere on earth, an indication of its benefit to humans as a useful and universal remedy.

### Shamans, Witch Doctors, Priestesses, and Priests

Ancient communities invariably had wise, respected, and significant female and male healers. Depending on the culture and its deepest healing practices, people of one gender or the other would be respected as shamanic healers capable of reaching altered states of consciousness and bringing back information from unseen realms. These healers relied heavily on plants to achieve access, approaching healing in a ritualistic/talismanic manner. They treated illness holistically, tapping into the spiritual, emotional, and physical ailments of their clients. Frequently, dream work, trances, or exorcisms were used. Wellness could not occur without addressing all realms.

Although people of many cultures achieve altered states today, these practices, often based in herbology, are not recognized as part of the Western scientific medical model. Nevertheless, those who practice magical uses of plants or employ shamanism offer important contributions to their communities, where such beliefs are essential aspects of a cure. Native American traditional healers, Hispanic curanderas and curanderos, and modern wiccans are all present-day examples of those who carry on the old ways with much success. Many books include magical uses of herbs, but you will not find this information either in Western medical schools or medical libraries.

### Overview of the Wise-Woman Tradition

Once upon a time, as far back as human prehistory, the Wise-Woman Tradition offered ancient peoples healing. The Wise-Woman Tradition is the oldest type of healing known on our planet, yet one that is rarely identified, and rarely written or talked about.2 It is an oral tradition in which knowledge and use of local plants is passed down by women from generation to generation.

Archeological evidence suggests ancient health practitioners were likely women. Women have always been healers. It is their natural role, the role of the feminine. The Wise-Woman Tradition goes back through millennia, and women in ancient societies who practiced this intuitive knowledge traditionally tapped into the Divine Feminine, the Goddess. Women have long overseen the human process from birth to death, attempting to make the span of time between these two events as easy and comfortable as possible. But the role of woman as respected healer has cycled back and forth, depending on the time and culture in which she lived. Women have long been caregivers and collectors of healing herbs and plants, particularly in hunter-gatherer societies with a deep connection to the earth.

The Divine Feminine continues to be reflected in our knowledge of plants for healing. More than a thousand years of collective experience has taught us how to use herbs safely and effectively. As caregivers, midwives, wives, and mothers, many women naturally gravitate to the healing art and science of plants.

Unfortunately, hardly any Wise-Woman knowledge was written down, having been communicated orally during those distant eras. Much later, as medicine and writing became the purview of men, women were forbidden to speak and write in Latin, the language of physicians and scholars. If they were educated women and actually managed to record their ideas, authorship generally was attributed to a man.

As a result, women tended to pass on information orally from grandmother to mother to daughter—from woman to woman. This oral tradition produced respected rural herbology, the folk wisdom still practiced in small communities (Fig. 2.1). Sometimes women wrote herbal formulas down, using the form of household recipes, having long considered plants as food and as medicine. Many male counterparts, then and now, supported women in their roles as part of the larger herbal community.

As scientific inquiry advanced in Western societies during the Renaissance, older simpler ways lost popularity and eventually were shunned. Trained male physicians claimed the turf once managed by women. They used violent, dangerous, and dramatically heroic procedures, such as bloodletting, applying blood-sucking leeches to the skin, as well as purging, vomiting, and administering mercury. These techniques, so different from the gentler arts of the oral tradition and folk herbalism, led to the diminishment of women’s wisdom, which frequently became known as “old wives’ tales.” Women healers were mocked and given titles like midwives, old wives, crones, green women, nurses, nuns, and, most derisively, simple.

At its most extreme, women were accused of witchcraft. These horrific shameful chapters became part of the Inquisition in Europe and the Salem witch trials in America. Torture and murder were routine. Patriarchal religious doctrine became entangled with medicine. Its persuasive power won out for many centuries, forcing the Wise-Woman way to go underground.

Today Wise-Women and Wise-Men are on the rise. Before most of us venture to consult health care professionals, a large percentage consults a friend or family member with knowledge of herbs. These informal sources of information are overwhelmingly female, though they are joined by more men every day. The feminine principle is beginning to even things out.

## Ancient Times

Hippocrates of Greece (460–377 BCE) (Fig. 2.2) is known as the father of Western medicine. He borrowed and expanded on the Perso-Arabic Islamic traditional medicine that was being practiced in India and in Muslim cultures. Known as Unani-Tibb, it dates from 400 BCE. Unani is a Persian word meaning Greek and Tibb is an Arabic word meaning medicine.

Hippocrates’ medicine was a rational science that used a holistic approach to body type and personality, based on what he referred to as the four humors. Each humor indicated a particular human constitution and had a characteristic personality, temperature, degree of moisture, and a specific pulse and tongue to match—an approach that is similar to the energetics practiced by Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine. For instance, a person with a sanguine (blood) humor was considered happy and optimistic, with a warm and moist quality, an appreciation of the sweet tastes, a strong pulse, and a red tongue.1 The other humors—yellow bile, black bile, and white phlegm—all had to be in balance with the blood.

Hippocrates asked questions and conducted physical exams to ascertain which therapy, herbs, and foods patients needed. Signs and symptoms evolved from natural causes and the progression of a disease. Hippocrates was the first to classify illnesses according to their similarities and differences. He encouraged looking into natural causes for illness and restoring balance. Before this approach, at least in the West, and according to the information that has been uncovered to date, the causes of illness and disease were commonly based on superstition or the wrath of angry gods.

Hippocrates, and later Galen of Rome, elaborated on Unani-Tibb Islamic theories. Hippocrates is most remembered today for the Hippocratic Oath, which established high ethical standards for the practice of medicine. A famous and wise quote from one of its many translations is “First, do no harm”—a directive we would all do well to follow.

Another notable Greek physician, pharmacologist, and botanist was Pedianos Dioscorides, who lived c. CE 40–90. Dioscorides wrote De Materia Medica, a large encyclopedia of medicinal substances. The text listed and explained approximately 600 herbs and was widely read for the next 1500 years.3 Among its readers was the famous Islamic physician, Ibn Sina, who lived in the Middle Ages and is discussed later in this chapter.

Dioscorides’ De Materia Medica was a precursor to modern pharmacopeias. For this reason, Dioscorides is considered the founder of Western herbal medicine. The plant genus Dioscorea, which includes the medicinal Wild Yam rhizome, was later named after him by the taxonomist, Carl Linnaeus.

### Women Healers in Ancient Greece

Women healers in ancient Greece were few. By that time in history, their role in society had been minimized to that of servant and wife. The study of medicine was punishable by death.4 However, as hypocritical and contradictory as it sounds, the Greeks still respected women for their healing abilities. A Greek queen and healer named Artemisia discovered the medicinal uses of wormwood, causing the herb now to be included in the genus Artemisia. Furthermore, the Olympian goddess, Artemis, ruled the hunt, moon, and chastity and was later associated with childbirth and nature, all interesting connections.

Greek healing goddesses abound. Gaia, goddess of Earth, attests to women’s healing powers.5 The Greeks considered the goddess Hygeia, whose statues include the snake-entwined caduceus, to be one of the children of Asclepius, and today these statues appear in some hospitals (Fig. 2.3). The concept of hygiene, so basic to preventative medicine, derives from her name. Demeter, the matriarch who cared for the home, women, and children, made her contribution to the health field through the food she allowed to be raised from the soil, and her daughter, Persephone, cured teeth and eyes. There may well have been many mortal women who made original contributions to Greek medical texts and treatises, but their works have been obscured by centuries of plagiarism and confusion over authorship.5

### Galen of Rome, c. CE 130–210

Galen, a leading Roman physician, created a system of rules and classifications based on Greek Hippocratic medicine. He too emphasized balancing the four humors (red for blood, black for black bile, yellow for yellow bile, and white for phlegm). Unlike Hippocrates, however, he didn’t bother to examine the patient.

Galen had a rigid system of rules, as well as expensive, complex formulas. His system evaluated plants in terms of the humors and fit them in to a complicated arrangement that was difficult to learn. It ultimately separated the rich and educated from the uneducated and poor, creating an elitist understanding of healing that discounted folk medicine. Right or wrong, this system strictly controlled Western medical philosophy for the next 1500 years, and woe to any brave soul who disagreed, including a Wise-Woman here or there.

Galen’s influence managed to paralyze European medical thinking for 1500 years and dominate the doctoring practiced during the Middle Ages.6 It led to aggressive methods of bloodletting, purging, and use of exotic medications like toad tongues or red ox gall. The more abstruse and awful a remedy, the better. Nothing changed much until the 1860s when Pasteur’s scientific germ theory finally supplanted the Galen methods.

Overall, Galen is remembered for disempowering those who practiced individual and community healing. His principles separated and caused the removal of medical practice from the people who had trust in herbs and the healing power of nature. It caused individuals to give up their health care to others, rather than healing themselves. The idea of a single or simple, one-herb cure, as used by common folk, went out of fashion and was scorned. Hence, a simple changed meaning and came to indicate an inferior remedy possessing only one quality, such as heat or moisture, which was used by the uneducated or so-called “simpletons.” Instead, the Western medical establishment used the Galenic approach, combining many herbs into complex expensive formulas. Today the word simple has come full circle and is no longer considered derogatory. The use of a single herb, a simple, is a respected and useful healing protocol in many cases.

Galen and the practitioners of ancient Greece and Rome had such a tremendous influence on modern medicine today that two well-recognized symbols emerged from these traditions—the caduceus and the rod of Asclepius (Box 2.1).

Box 2.1

The Caduceus Versus the Rod of Asclepius: A Convoluted History

The caduceus is an ancient symbol representing the staff carried by Hermes, the winged messenger god in Greek mythology. His Roman counterpart was Mercury. The staff is short, entwined by two serpents ending with wings at the top. Sometimes the symbol is shown with one snake and no wings. This version stands for the rod of Asclepius, a famous ancient Greek physician. Historically, the symbols have been used to represent commerce, negotiation, science, mathematics, and medicine.

The symbols are ancient, however, predating Greek and Roman mythologies. They have had both esoteric and mundane meanings. From the 16th century onward, printers used both symbols as printers’ marks, particularly as frontispieces for pharmacopoeias in the 17th and 18th centuries. Printers saw themselves as diffusers of knowledge; hence, their choice of images.

Esoterically, the entwined serpents have represented positive and negative kundalini energy moving up through the chakras around the spine (the staff or rod and what is also referred to as the central channel or balancing midline of the body). Serpents have also depicted the evolution of human consciousness and serve as a model for the structure of the universe. When a snake sheds its skin, it symbolically represents a renewal of youth and health. The rod or staff also symbolizes a magical artifact, the wand. The wings are interpreted as swiftness and ascend upwards to the heavens. Both symbols have been used as magical power objects.

The medical link probably came from alchemy. Alchemists were referred to as the sons of Hermes, or Hermetists, practitioners of the hermetic arts. At the end of the 16th century, alchemy included medicine, pharmaceuticals, chemistry and metallurgy. The element called quicksilver was named mercury in honor of the Roman messenger god. Thus the scientific age of medicine has its roots in the mythological and esoteric past. Through these symbols, medicine retains its connection to the old ways, reminding us of the healing process and its work to combat disease.

Over time the caduceus and the rod of Asclepius emerged as symbols of medicine. The World Health Organization and the Medical Council of New Zealand adopted the Asclepius rod and single serpent as their logos.

In the United States the double-snaked caduceus became the insignia of the U.S. Army Medical Corps in 1902 and is the well-known symbol of physicians. The single-snake design appears on ambulance doors and medical products, and it is the American Medical Association insignia.7

### Woman Healers in Ancient Rome

Overall, women’s social status in ancient Rome proved better than that of Grecian women. They enjoyed more freedom and prestige, particularly those from aristocratic families. Such women acted as midwives, devised herbal formulas, and functioned as physicians. Octavia, Mark Antony’s wife, wrote a book of prescriptions. There was Margareta, an army surgeon, and Fabiola, who founded the first public hospital in history and took advantage of opportunities afforded Roman citizens to help improve human health. As time went on, however, increasing numbers of men became physicians, edging Roman women out of mainstream medicine and delegating them to more peripheral and less lucrative tasks.5

### Isolated Ancient Cultures Traded Spices: Similar Herbs Used Independently

As the ancients traded spices, exotic plants from foreign lands came into use. Sailors brought cloves and cardamom from the Middle East to Europe. Chocolate from South America was later brought to Europe in the 1500s and transformed from a sacred drink of the Andes into multiple secular uses, ranging from consumption as a delicious beverage to use in candies and liquors. Occasionally, use of similar herbal remedies sprang up independently. Because many of the same plants grow world-wide, their use evolved simultaneously and similarly in many places. Examples of this serendipity include:

In the 19th century, when science and chemistry became king, chemists homed in on herbal knowledge from around the world. Extracts of the plants in this list became some of the first pharmaceuticals. In fact, 75% of the pharmaceuticals that came to drug companies’ attention did so because of their traditional herbal medicine usage.

### Historic Ancient Materia Medicas from Around the World

A Materia Medica is an herbal list, literally meaning the materials of medicine. These collections serve as vehicles for transmitting plant knowledge, written in the language of the day and containing significant information on herbs and their prescriptions. Materia Medicas have been written and recorded throughout written history. They are found in ancient China, Babylon, Egypt, India, Greece, and other locations. Today, countless Materia Medicas exist, organizing plants by various categories, traditions, or nationalities. A few famous early ones listed here help us appreciate the cross-cultural influences on these important collections.1

## Western European Middle Ages

From the fall of Rome to about CE 1300 was a bleak time for medicine and women in general. Medicine had not advanced since Galen’s time. The Church, the plague, superstition, accusations and convictions of witchcraft, fear, and lack of common sense dominated everywhere. The number of ingredients in remedies grew to outrageous quantities, reaching into the hundreds.

Woman healers who did manage to practice during this period had to exercise extreme caution to remain safe and continue helping people. Regardless of social class, women served as midwives and healers of children, and even though they knew a lot about herbs and cures, they often had to dispense their remedies in secret. These were sane, practical, Wise-Women of the community who carried on the oral herbal traditions they had received from the mothers and grandmothers before them. These simple cures actually promoted health in times of public superstition, fear, and other practitioners’ frequent use of sometimes unpleasantly weird, disgusting remedies like the sexual organs of animals, tongue of eagles, saliva, blood, and various toxic minerals. Most prevailing so-called medicines were only remotely connected to simple, sensible botanics.5

### The European Apothecary of the 1100s, Alchemy, and Chemistry

European apothecaries became an independent profession from the practice of medicine, beginning in the 12th century. Originally an apothecary was a medical professional who formulated and dispensed herbs and remedies to physicians, patients, and surgeons. The word eventually evolved to denote a physical space that stored wine, spices, and herbs. Allopathic pharmacists in America and chemists in England have taken over the old apothecary designation as professionals who dispense drugs. Many modern herbalists have reverted to calling their herbal collections and herbal shops apothecaries.

New exotic herbs coming from Arabia and China turned up in European apothecaries. Apothecaries embraced the profitable new remedies made by Ibn Sina (Avicenna) from Arabia. Included were animal, mineral, and vegetable medicines. The medieval apothecary’s shop housed weird animal parts such as viper’s flesh, crab’s eyes, rhinoceros and unicorn horn, oil of earthworms, scorpions, swallows, moss from a dead man’s skull, and urine from a goat, as well as more appetizing items from the Plant Kingdom.

Apothecaries, alchemy, and chemistry have their roots in this period. Modern chemistry actually evolved from the study of alchemy, its medieval forerunner. Alchemy was a combined physical, metaphysical, and spiritual investigation into the transformation of matter, turning one substance into another. It had many goals, depending on who the practitioner was and how he or she practiced the art. Some aimed to convert ordinary metals into the purest form of matter, which was considered to be gold, to find a universal elixir called the Philosopher’s Stone—a way for immortality to be achieved. Others aimed to free and purify the spirit or soul. Alchemy ultimately morphed into the apothecaries and then into the science of chemistry.

### Ibn Sina, CE 980–1037, and the Invention of the Arab Pharmacy

The Arabs had a very advanced society, a bright spot in terms of healing. After Rome fell, this part of the world simplified Galen’s complicated medicines. Ibn Sina (anglicized as Avicenna) was a leading Islamic physician who developed the world’s first pharmacies—professional drug stores—as a field apart from medicine. He excelled in compounding remedies. He used herbs in new ways and developed techniques to produce syrups, ointments, tinctures, elixirs, pills, suppositories, and inhalations. He wrote extensively, leaving behind his encyclopedic five-volume Canon of Medicine, which influenced Western medicine throughout the Middle Ages. Some refer to Ibn Sina as the father of modern medicine, whereas Hippocrates holds the title of father of Western medicine. Then, of course, Dioscorides holds the title of founder of Western herbal medicine. Multiple titles, a lot of fathers—no mothers.

Surgeons on active duty during the Crusades used Ibn Sina’s new, practical formulations to help the wounded. Ibn Sina influenced European apothecaries, and his work set the standard throughout Europe. New Arabian herbs, such as Nutmeg seed, Clove bud, and Saffron stigma (the part of a flower’s ovary that catches the pollen), were introduced to Western practices.

### Trotula of Salerno, 11th Century

Trotula of Salerno, Italy, was a rare shining star who is sometimes regarded as the world’s first gynecologist. She was a leading physician at the famed Salerno learning center for training medical practitioners. Both men and women attended this center, which attracted Greeks, Arabs, Jews, and Latins among its faculty and students. Known for her wise diagnosis and management of women’s problems and diseases, she emphasized the need for hygiene, used opium for pain, and successfully used anesthetic inhalations of the poisonous Hemlock (any part of the plant) and Mandrake root,5 which could have been disastrous. Trotula’s use of these techniques was far ahead of her time and remarkably similar to modern medical practice.

### Hildegard von Bingen and the Wise-Woman Tradition, 12th Century

Another bright spot for medieval women healers was a notable German Benedictine nun named Hildegard von Bingen (1098–1179) (Fig. 2.5), remembered today because she was one of the very few known women of her time to record and write down her healing herbs and experiences.9

After Rome’s domination of the known world ended, the Church dominated European medieval medicine, preaching illness and disease as God’s punishment for sinning. Treatment of disease came in the form of prayer and penance. Fortunately, some of the nuns and monks in the monasteries preserved old Greco-Roman herbal knowledge by planting herb gardens and helping townsfolk in need.

As an herbalist, musical composer, and mystic, Hildegard did more than copy the work of the Greeks and Romans, as others were doing. She was one of the few medieval women to leave a written account of the Wise-Woman Tradition. Her Materia Medica, titled Physica, emerged from her own experience. She recorded long lists of herbs, 485 to be exact, still used today. She included Aloe leaf, Basil herb, Bayberry berry, Blackberry leaf, Caraway seed, Celery seed, Clove bud, Dill seed, Fennel seed, Garlic bulb, Hyssop herb, Licorice root, Marjoram herb, Myrrh resin, Nettle herb, Nutmeg seed, Onion bulb, Oregano leaf, Raspberry leaf, Rosemary leaf, Rue herb, Thyme herb, and Watercress leaf (Fig. 2.6). This large array is reminiscent of old European gardens and their nurturing plants. Hildegard von Bingen was a profound scientist of her time.10

### Black Plague or Bubonic Plague, 14th Century

The Black Plague was a horrific pandemic that began in China and eventually spread throughout the Middle East to parts of Africa and Europe, peaking in Europe in 1346–1353. The plague was caused by a bacterium carried by the oriental rat flea, Yersinia pestis, living on rats and other rodents.1 Hygiene, as we know it today, was not practiced until the 19th century. The streets of major cities flowed with raw sewage, dead animals, and garbage, allowing any transmissible disease to spread quickly.

People had no understanding of the cause or treatment for this highly contagious disease. Plague victims suffered from high fevers, sweating, shaking, terrible sores or buboes full of blood and pus, coughing, pneumonia, and pain followed quickly by death. Some blamed the plague on a wrathful, displeased God. Concepts of bacteria and bacterial infections were unknown. Some of the so-called cures involved ingesting mercury or arsenic, bloodletting, hanging pomanders (fragrant balls of flowers or herbs) around the patient’s neck, drinking wine, and wrapping the buboes in a live chicken, frog, or leech.

Eventually ships believed to carry the infection were required to stay in port for 40 days, the origin of the word quarantine.11 Terrified people fled the cities. At least one-third of the people in Europe died. Left untreated, 80% of those who contracted the plague succumbed within 8 days.

Because there was no effective treatment, this tragic event eventually necessitated changes in medical thought and discovery. Before an effective cure could be discovered, many useless and dangerous methods were attempted, and countless folks suffered greatly. It was not until 1928, when Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin after observing mold forming in a petri dish, did antibiotics become the recognized treatment for the Black Plague in the present day.

### Syphilis: End of the 15th Century

Approximately 150 years after the plague, the sexually transmitted disease syphilis became a major medical problem, with the use of mercury as the biggest medical hoax that promised to cure it. Mercury poisoning leads to tremors, seizures, and death (Fig. 2.7). However, alchemists introduced mercuric quicksilver, and it became the medicine of choice for over 450 years, paving the way for future drugs at the expense of herbal medicines. Today syphilis is cured with the antibiotic penicillin.

In the Americas, healers used the native Smilax aristolochia (Sarsaparilla root). Though not a syphilis cure, at least it did no harm. Healers also tried out Nicotiana tabacum (Tobacco leaf), Sassafras albidum (Sassafras root), and a purging herb called Ipomoea jalapa (Jalap root).1

Some of the dangerous and useless medieval remedies used by doctors to eradicate the plague, syphilis, and everyday ills caused poisoning—doing more harm than good. One response to this in England was The Herbalist's Charter, an Act of Parliament ordained and implemented by King Henry VIII, making it lawful for any English subject with the “Knowledge and Experience of the Nature of Herbs, Roots, and Waters…” to practice their art. This law allowed lay people to use their own herbal cures and folk medicine, despite doctors and the medical establishment who wanted a monopoly on this right. (Box 2.2).

Box 2.2

The Herbalist’s Charter of 1543

King Henry VIII of England (1491–1547) had a keen interest in medicine and dabbled in cures for his well-known painful ulcers and leg sores caused by gout. Many of the remedies he tried were well-known herbal plants and flowers known since the time of Dioscorides, such as plantain, mallow, fenugreek, linseed, and “Oyle of Roses” (Rose water).

At that time, doctors used expensive, complicated, and dangerous remedies, and they were outraged that Henry was embracing simple cures. In 1518, as a way to respond to the king, they established the Royal College of Physicians in London (the oldest medical college in England). The College influenced Parliament to pass laws to protect their province of complex medications and mineral cures, and to give them control of both surgeons and apothecaries.

This stratagem backfired, however. Physicians enraged local unlicensed practitioners, one being the brewer, who apparently had friends in high places. He managed to get Parliament to pass a new law allowing laypeople to practice herbal medicine and healing. The final words of the Act warned physicians not to meddle with the newly legalized herbalists.1

Outraged doctors called it “the Quack’s Charter.” But modern herbalists refer to this victory as the “Herbalist’s Charter.” It ensured the survival of their profession and empowered knowledgeable men and women to administer much needed medical services to the poor.

### The Inquisition: The Wise-Woman Tradition Hits Bottom

Dark, dark times accompanied by the rise of the witch hunts and revival of the Inquisition occurred in various countries at different times until about 1693, the end of the Salem witch trials in America. After the 1300s, the image of the kindly female folk herbalist changed from helpful Wise-Woman to an evil, devil-possessed witch. Women were accused of conjuring up all kinds of black magic potions with assistance from the devil. Notable witch trials occurred in Germany, France, and, later, in Salem, Massachusetts, in the U.S. Literature and theater reflected fascination with poisonings. Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth threw the roots of mandrake and belladonna into a bubbling cauldron. Grimm’s Fairy Tales depicted Snow White killed by a poisoned apple prepared by her evil stepmother, whose true identity was a witch. The exact plant was not specified in the original tale.

So what happened? Some of the thinking during this time may have followed traditions from the Greek and Roman days of herbal assassinations. Remember Socrates, the Greek philosopher and teacher who drank the poison hemlock? Many theories and possible reasons have been offered for the witch hunts and the Inquisition. The climate was right for a blame game. Women as healers bore the brunt, especially because they were not allowed to formally study medicine, and any plant knowledge they had was considered to be channeled from the devil. Possible explanations for these twisted thoughts include:

These elements forced women’s practice of herbology and folk medicine to go quietly under cover. Those who practiced openly would have feared for their lives.

### Doctrine of Signatures, 15th Century Italy

In the CE 1st century, Dioscorides described healing plants according to divine intention. It was one of the cultural assumptions of the Galenic era. Dioscorides believed that God marked objects with signs or signatures of their purpose. This belief persisted throughout the Middle Ages after the appearance in 1621 of a book by the German mystic, Jakob Boehme, called The Signature of All Things, which defined the principle we have come to know as the doctrine of signatures. An herbalist could find in a plant’s appearance a clue as to its medicinal use, which had been designed by the creator for this purpose. A plant’s overall shape, smell, or characteristic could reveal its healing abilities.1 Occasionally, this happened to be true but sometimes not.

Examples of plants that do adhere to these observations and support the doctrine of signatures are Panax ginseng (Ginseng root), which is shaped like a human male and is a renowned men’s tonic; Caulophyllum thalictroides (Blue Cohosh root), which branches like contorted limbs and relaxes muscles in muscular spasms; and Sanguinaria canadensis (Blood root and sap), which has a beautiful blood-red color is therefore a blood purifier. Another such plant, Lobelia inflata (Lobelia herb), has flowers shaped like a stomach (if you have a good imagination) and is a good emetic when taken in large doses. Hydrastis canadensis (Goldenseal root) is a yellow-green root that might remind you of the colors of jaundice and pus and is successfully used for infection.

### Paracelsus—The Rebel Challenges Galenic Medicine, 1493–1541

A Swiss-German alchemist and considered a revolutionary in his time, Paracelsus is credited with being the founder of modern pharmaceutical medicine or chemical pharmacology. He wrote and spoke against the current Galenic practices, which took a lot of courage. He was challenged, ridiculed, and shunned by the medical establishment.

Although he embraced mineral poisons like mercury and antimony, he also appreciated the common folk herbs used in Swiss-German medicine. He tempered his use of poisonous quicksilver for syphilis patients with common healing plants; that approach was possibly why his patients survived.1 Working in his alchemical lab he developed addictive laudanum—tincture of opium—that later citizens of Victorian England and America abused.

### Nicholas Culpeper,1616–1664—Activist and Author of The English Physician

Nicholas Culpeper was a reformer who furthered the English tradition of domestic herbal medicine. The son of a rector, Culpeper became an educated English pharmacist, botanist, physician, and astrologer. He also published The English Physician, in which he recommended the gentler botanicals growing in one’s own backyard, rather than exotic plant medicines that were expensive, hard to obtain, and possibly useless.1

He also discouraged using purges and violent remedies, then so in vogue. Culpeper questioned traditional methods and knowledge and explored new solutions for healing, making them more accessible to lay people by educating them about maintaining their own health. The success of The English Physician both embarrassed and angered Culpeper’s medical contemporaries.

## America

### Native Americans

Native Americans contributed greatly to herbal knowledge. Compared to Europeans, the native people in the Americas generally enjoyed strong teeth and tremendous physical stamina. Their herbal wisdom was impressive, as was the vast array of native plants they relied on for healing. They appreciated and practiced personal hygiene and isolating the sick. Hot springs and smoke lodges were used for ritualistic and physical cleansing. In these communities, women often maintained knowledge of plant wisdom and practiced it for healing.

Stories exist of European trappers and settlers who had fallen ill being taken in by friendly natives who treated and cured them. Some of a long list of native herbs introduced to the Europeans were Actaea racemosa (Black Cohosh root), Viburnum prunifolium (Black Haw bark), Eupatorium perfoliatum (Boneset herb), Rhamnus purshiana (Cascara Sagrada bark), Echinacea spp. (Echinacea root), Larrea divaricata (Chaparral leaf), Hydrastis canadensis (Goldenseal root), Lobelia inflata (Lobelia herb), Mahonia repens (Oregon Grape root), Smilax glauca (Sarsaparilla root), Ulmus fulva (Slippery Elm bark), Prunus serotina (Wild Cherry bark), and Hamamelis virginiana (Witch Hazel herb).

### The Shakers, Early 1800s

The Shakers were a religious sect that broke off from the Quakers in the early 1800s and became America’s premier medicinal herb growers. They had beautiful herb gardens and prepared and sold herbs and seeds in America—a total of 142 herbs, roots, and barks. They developed a reputation for honesty and herbal purity and supplied the Union Army with its main supply of Opium Poppy latex during the American Civil War. They also sold herbs to hospitals and invented the modern pill form for medicines. When patent medicines became popular after the Civil War, they marketed several. Their biggest seller was Dr. Corbett’s Shaker Sarsaparilla Syrup, consisting of Sarsaparilla root, Dandelion root, Black Cohosh root, Yellow Dock root, Juniper berries, and others. The Shaker’s herb business died after World War I but has since revived, starting in the 1960s.

### Thomsonian Movement, Early 1800s

Samuel Thomson helped return herbal medicine to sanity and place it again in the hands of the people when he started the Popular Health Movement or the Thomsonian movement. Introduced to herbs by an American Wise-Woman named Mrs. Bento, he found himself impressed by her herbal knowledge, writing in 1834, “We cannot deny that women possess superior capacities for the science of medicine.”4 That said, no other credit was given to Mrs. Bento ever again. Thomson rebelled against the regular medicine of the time, such as the practice of bloodletting, use of violent laxatives called cathartics, and use of the toxic minerals like mercury, arsenic, antimony, and sulfur. Over half the population of Ohio adored him, and he was considered throughout the Midwest as a voice of reason.

Thomson was a mixed bag, however, and was part sensible, part extreme in his practices. Although he discounted bloodletting, he advocated harsh treatments, such as purging, vomiting, and sweating. Thomson’s two main radical tenets were to raise the body temperature, particularly with Capsicum annuum (Cayenne pepper), and to clear it of toxins with high doses of Lobelia inflata (Lobelia herb), commonly called Pukeweed (with good reason). For the record, lower doses of Lobelia herb are a good relaxant for stress, anxiety, pain, and seizures without causing vomiting.

To his credit, Thomson often promoted an essential feature of the herbal tradition, supporting the body’s own recuperative efforts—everything else being secondary. His more conservative approach prompted scorn, indignation, and resentment in the average North American doctor who was still deep into dramatic, heroic cures like bloodletting. All in all, the Thomsonian approach paved the way for two new important movements—the Physiomedicalists and the Eclectics.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Physiomedicalists and William Cook’s Physio-Medical Dispensary, 1869

Physiomedicalism was an offshoot of the Thomsonian movement. A split occurred regarding the issue of medical education and whether licenses should be granted to its physicians. The Physiomedicalists advocated for a formal medical education and a larger Materia Medica, whereas Thomson was opposed to them.

William Cook, the most prominent of the Physiomedicalists, wrote The Physio-Medical Dispensatory in 1869, which became famous and is still quoted by herbalists today. It was the primary Materia Medica and pharmacy text for the sect until the last Physiomedicalist school closed in 1915. The book contains more than 440 plants and is considered to have the most complete descriptions of North American herbs in print. Cook was a hands-on clinical herbalist and herbal pharmacist, and the text carries the authority of firsthand knowledge in both arenas.

Physiomedicalism lasted until the early 20th century in North America, when politics intervened. This intervention occurred because of the combined opposition of the Eclectics, homeopaths, and regular establishment physicians. Those groups, along with the American Medical Association (AMA), formed an alliance to demand licensing laws for themselves, denying licensure to the Physiomedicalists who started the furor in the first place.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fate of the Physiomedicalists and Ties to Britain

Cook’s beloved Physiomedicalism survived because some of its followers jumped the Atlantic and traveled to England, strongly influencing British medical herbalism. The Physiomedicalists grouped together against the traditional British Medical Association of the time, whose doctors rarely cured anyone. The Physiomedicalists formed the National Institute of Medical Herbalists in 1864, which is still in existence today. This led to the birth of Anglo-American herbalism, the oldest body of herbalism in the Western world.13 When people talk about Western Herbalism, these are its roots.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rise and Fall of King’s Eclectic Movement and Medical Schools, 1840s–1939

The Eclectic movement, founded by John King, M.D., emerged as an extension of Native American herbal traditions and a reaction against the purges, bloodletting, and violent treatments being used by the medical establishment of the day. The Eclectics gained popularity because they provided treatments that did not kill their patients. Eclecticism can be defined as borrowing ideas and theories from multiple sources, which they did.

The Eclectics integrated whatever worked, and they borrowed from Native American healers, Samuel Thomson’s natural theories, homeopathy, Asian medicine, and African slave herbology. They also promoted scientific herbalism, employing chemical analysis and extraction of active ingredients. This approach greatly influenced the early pharmaceutical industry which, by that time, was extracting drugs from herbal sources. The first pharmaceutical drug developed was morphine, derived from the Opium Poppy in 1805 by a German chemist.

The Eclectic movement is entwined with the turbulent early history of medical schools in the United States, at first extremely influential but ultimately forced to close down. At their high point, Eclectic schools trained nearly one-sixth of the medical students in America, using an all-encompassing curriculum that included herbalism and homeopathy and more orthodox medical training.14 John King founded the Eclectic Medical Institute, the first medical school to admit women and black students. It opened in 1840 in Cincinnati, Ohio, and graduated more than 4,000 physicians over the next 100 years. Sadly, the school closed its doors in 1939 because of political infighting regarding medical philosophies and a declining quality of teaching.

The U.S. federal government’s Flexner Report of 1920 exposed the alleged shortcomings of the Eclectic Institute. Supported by the powerful AMA and the Carnegie Foundation, it helped shutter the Eclectic schools and led to a new gold standard for the training of physicians. Herbalism’s role as part of the medical school curriculum came to an end with the Flexner Report. The Eclectics faded away. All things herbal never again blossomed at such a national level. Notable Eclectic herbalists follow.

### Women Join the Popular Health Movement in America

During the pioneer push west, women became active community healers by necessity. With male doctors in short supply, pioneer women reemerged with a do-it-yourself attitude. They delivered babies, served as doctors and midwives and did anything that was needed. Some brought herbs and remedies from Europe and planted medicinal gardens. They learned from the Native Americans.

During the Industrial Revolution, a women’s place still may have been in the home, but there they ruled. Men were increasingly away working long hours, giving women ample unchallenged authority at home. They extended their talents as caregivers and herbalists. Hydrotherapy, the use of baths and water cures, homeopathy, and Thomson’s botanical remedies proved to be the popular practices of the day.5

The Thomsonian Popular Health Movement of the 1830s and 1840s gave women new opportunities and empowered them even more. Boston Women’s Medical College opened in 1848 and was the first contemporary medical school for the training of female physicians. Restricted from working in male-run hospitals, women founded their own, employing doctors and nurses of both sexes.

Eventually, after her applications to other medical schools had been rejected, Elizabeth Blackwell was accepted into the all-male Geneva Medical College in upstate New York. Blackwell became the first woman to be awarded a medical degree in America. In spite of extreme obstacles, she broke through the barriers established to prevent female medical achievements. She famously noted, “Methods and conclusions formed by half of the race only must necessarily require revision as the other half of humanity rises into conscious responsibility.”5

Some women educated communities of ladies about their bodies’ health and hygiene. They advocated healthy lifestyles, good nutrition, diet, and exercise, and they pushed for elimination of Gone with the Wind–style constricting corsets. Mary Gove Nichols was a noted reformer in the Popular Health Movement who contributed to the Water Cure Journal and empowered women to take health and healing into their own hands. She wrote about the need for women to embrace their sexuality and not to be repressed or ashamed. She was not afraid to address taboo topics such as birth control, childhood problems, bathing, or teething.5

Later, birth control and contraception became an issue during the Progressive Era of the early 1900s. Activist Margaret Sanger’s work in New York led to legalization of contraception. Better prenatal care, maternal health care, and childcare increased the health and safety of women and children.

### Lydia Pinkham, 1819–1883

Lydia Pinkham was an entrepreneur, a colorful addition to the patent medicine furor of the 1800s. In her home kitchen, she concocted and marketed Lydia E. Pinkham’s Vegetable Tonic in 1875 for $1.00 a bottle. It was a wildly popular women’s formula that reportedly helped with menstrual symptoms or “female complaints.” Her face appeared on medicine bottles everywhere (Box 2.4). Apparently, she derived her formulating information from sources such as Eclectic John King’s American Dispensary, which she is known to have owned and used.

Box 2.4

Lydia Pinkham’s Vegetable Tonic of 1875

This tonic is still on sale today at major drugstores and online, although the formula has changed a bit over the years. It was identified for menstrual cramps and other complaints.

A pamphlet inside her tonic bottle packaging encouraged women to write to her with their questions. At that time, standards of modesty kept women woefully ignorant about their bodies and how it functioned. Pinkham’s work encouraged the ladies to ask uncomfortable questions about menses, menopause, and reproduction. Pinkham answered their queries, dispensing information along with the tonic, and provided forthright talk and advice about women’s medical issues.16 This private and discrete question–answer opportunity empowered women to take charge of their own health, an unheard of and revolutionary concept at that time.

### Rene Caisse’s Essiac, 1888–1978

Caisse was a Canadian nurse-pioneer who challenged the establishment by creating a cancer-curing tea called Essiac, her name spelled backward (Box 2.5). Living in Bracebridge, Ontario, she treated people for 60 years, making and using her tea to cure cancer and promote general health. She ran her cancer clinic from 1932 to 1942, taking no money. She once wrote a series of articles titled, “I Was Canada’s Cancer Nurse.”

Box 2.5

Essiac Tea Formula by Rene Caisse

The original four herbs in combination actually prevent tumor growth and cancer cell reproduction and cut down on oxidative stress and tissue inflammation. The formula can well be used today as an adjunct supportive tea, along with other therapies for cancer.

Caisse learned about the formula in 1922 from a patient, a prospector’s wife, who had breast cancer. The formula had originally come from an Ojibway traditional healer. The patient’s cancer never came back.17 Nurse Caisse wrote down the herbs and began to use them on hopeless cases with much success. No conclusive studies ever proved that the tea worked. Caisse met with resistance from the government and medical associations and spent much of her life in back-and-forth hassles, threat of arrest, and being scammed out of legalizing the cure.

### Colleges and Medical Schools with New Requirements

The medical schools and the doctors they produced in the late 1800s had terrible reputations; too many poorly trained doctors were graduating from low grade schools. In 1902 the AMA formed a council to investigate medical training in the United States. They found faculty, equipment, and standards lacking. The Eclectic schools fared no better.

As a result, Johns Hopkins Medical School, which opened in 1873, fashioned itself on German-style training and required that applicants have a college degree to qualify for admission. Harvard University put together an undergraduate medical training referred to as pre-med. However, some of these improvements backfired on the sound practice of herbalism, and herbal preparations were replaced by drugs. Eclectics Scudder and King, who simply wanted to improve the Eclectic Institute but not close it down, got more than they bargained for.

<!-- chunk -->

### United States Pharmacopeia and National Formulary, 1820

The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and National Formulary (NF) was formed in 1820 in response to a lack of uniformity of standards regarding medical practice and the compounding of drugs and herbal formulas. Because of bitter disagreement between establishment doctors and the Thomsonians and Physiomedicalists, the USP was established as a self-sustaining, independent, science-based, nonprofit, public health organization.

By law, all prescription and over-the-counter medicines and herbs available in the United States were to meet USP quality control and public standards, if such exist, for the product being marketed. Then and now, the USP became identified as the official public standards-setting authority for all dietary supplements (including herbs), prescription and over-the-counter medicines, and other health care products manufactured and sold in America. Manufacturers and regulators in more than 140 countries refer to and use USP standards.

Approximately 100 herbs were originally included in the pharmacopeia. Today it publishes countless herbal monographs in the Herbal Medicines Compendium that is freely available online. Each monograph contains standards for ingredients used in herbal medicines and follows with specifications for analytical testing to assure quality and lack of contaminants. A large listing of herbs is included, and more are reviewed and added periodically.

### Landmark Flexner Report on Medical Education Eliminated Herbal Healing, 1920

In 1920, the wealthy Carnegie Foundation financed and appointed Abraham Flexner to carry out a report on the training of doctors. The report changed the direction of medical practice. It surveyed the quality of the nation’s medical schools, praising the Hopkins-Harvard model and condemning all others. The widely circulated Flexner Report, along with the previous AMA recommendations, spelled doom for the Eclectics. Seven of the eight medical schools they ran closed down, as did many others.18

In addition, standard medical schools flourished with the help of the Carnegie Foundation. Their scientific, drug-oriented, nonherbal approach promoted the growth of the modern pharmaceutical industry with its now-current near monopoly of the medical profession. By 1940, every surviving U.S. medical school’s curriculum was based on the Hopkins-Harvard model. Botany was no longer considered necessary because schools did not provide training in herbal healing. Today, no U.S. medical school can exist without AMA approval1 and all that approval entails.

### A Few Herbal Die-Hards, Despite the Flexner Report

We leave off here, with herbalism being abandoned in medical schools and replaced with what is now termed modern medicine (Table 2.1). What goes around comes around. Herbalism has survived many a defeat, only to become a resource for those interested in more natural and often more reliable treatments to promote human health.

Table 2.1

The latest evolution of herbalism involves legislation of various sorts, another paradigm shift. This tale will show up later (Chapter 29). There, we sort through the ins and outs of modern legislation and discuss where herbalists stand and what may come next.


This chapter showed that the history of herbal medicine and the Wise-Woman way is an integral part of human history. The story is linked with the history of medicine, women’s status and is intertwined with politics, religion, medical schools, and the male versus female principle.

In the Middle Ages and beyond, competition ensued between Galen’s complex four humors system versus simpler cures. Dangerous practices competed with safer botanicals, compliments of the Wise-Woman way. Benedictine nun, Hildegard von Bingen became the first woman to record herbal knowledge, moving forward from the exclusively oral tradition. The Renaissance and the rise of science brought discoveries in anatomy and chemistry leading to the eventual development of the pharmaceuticals industry. Botanical medicine was scorned as old-fashioned.

America had numerous medical movements. The Thomsonians advocated medical and herbal reform. William Cook’s American Physiomedicalists formed the basis for Anglo American Western herbalism. The Eclectics rebelled against the prevailing medical establishment, borrowing from many cultures. The Popular Health Movement included Lydia Pinkham and Rene Caisse. Margaret Sanger pushed for birth control.

The USP of 1820 set standards for herbs and medications. The Flexner Report of 1929 forced the closing of the Eclectic Institute and all U.S. medical schools dropped botanical medicine from their curriculums.

Vitalistic/vitalism

Herbalism is ancient, and it is good to know its roots (Fig. 3.1). Botanical healing knowledge has been passed along since the beginning. The four main herbal traditions are Ethnic, Ayurvedic, Western European, and Chinese Medicine. Others that may seem to be left out are grouped within these four main headings. For instance, Kampo is the Japanese adaptation of Chinese Medicine, so it is included in that tradition. Egyptian and Islamic herbal knowledge evolved into Western European, and Ethnic includes cultures from all over the world.

The vitalistic versus the analytic approaches to healing are basic. They represent two opposing philosophies. The Seven Steps of Healing help us see how people go back and forth between vitalistic and analytic thinking to arrive at personal decisions about their own healing process.

Certain herbal terms appear repeatedly throughout the book. To an herbalist, an herb is a plant used for medicinal purposes. Herbalism is the study or practice of the medicinal and therapeutic use of plants, using natural plants or plant extracts that are taken internally or applied to the skin. Herbology is the study of herbs. Pharmacognosy is the study of plants as a natural source of drugs and the science of plant chemistry.

## Main Herbal Traditions

The main herbal traditions—Ethnic, Ayurvedic, Chinese, and Western European—sprung from our worldwide need for healing and represent systems from various continents. As people traveled for trading, exploration, or war, they learned from one another. For instance, the Greek-born botanist and surgeon, Dioscorides, traveled with the Roman army and was introduced to new techniques and plants wherever he went.

During the European Age of Discovery, sailors learned new medicines and healing methods from the Caribbean and the Americas, relaying this often lifesaving information back to France, England, Spain, or their place of origin. Generally, the newer traditions borrowed from the older ones and added to or modified their own systems as years went on. Many are blended combinations. Modern herbalists often use a combination of these traditions for their assessment techniques.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ethnic, Traditional, or Cultural Healing

One could call this the oldest and most basic form of structured medicine ever practiced, before anything had a name (Fig. 3.2). It is the one from which all later forms of medicine developed, including Chinese, Greco-Arabic, and Western. Traditional healing was part of seminomadic and agricultural tribal societies from prehistoric times, probably predating the last Ice Age.

These healers include traditional healers; shamans; healers from Africa and from North, Central, and South America; Australian aborigines; South Sea Islanders; Nordic healers; and many others. The traditions use tribal herbal wisdom, and sometimes include magic and ceremony, dreams, emotions, prayer, and intention. They comprise knowledge that has been accumulated over thousands of years, based on personal experience and connection with the natural world, using different levels of consciousness within the human psyche.

In most tribal groups, there were usually one or two people who stood out as the wise ones or the one most connected to how natural laws influence living things. They became highly respected, sought-out healers of the community. Much of this wisdom has been abandoned and brushed aside in favor of modern medicine.

Today there has been a revival and renewed appreciation of what was lost. Cold, scientific-based Western medicine is, for many, missing something important. In the holistic sense, we must consider more than the physical body. Many modern thinkers and practitioners have written and practiced a more mind-body approach. Examples are found in the works and practices of Deepak Chopra, M.D., Christiane Northrup, M.D., and Louise Hay, medical intuitive. In the West, we are beginning to appreciate and realize that for real healing to occur, we must use the entire human experience.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ayurveda from India, 5000 Years Old

Ayurveda comes from the Sanskrit words: ayur (life) and veda (knowledge) (Fig. 3.3). Called “the Science of Life,” Tibetan Medicine and Chinese Medicine both have their roots in Ayurveda. Early Greek Medicine also embraced many concepts originally described in the classical Ayurvedic medical texts dating back thousands of years.

Ayurvedic medicine is based on the holistic concept of keeping the body in health and balance first and treating disease second. It provides guidelines on seasonal routines, diet and exercise, behavior, and use of our senses. It takes into account body, mind, and spirit and recognizes that, to be in health, we must integrate these three elements.

The tradition recognizes three doshas or body types. These are Vata (wind), Pitta (fire), and Kapha (earth). Each of us has a unique proportion of these three forces that shapes our nature. If Vata is dominant in our system, we tend to be thin, light, enthusiastic, energetic, and changeable. If Pitta predominates, we tend to be intense, intelligent, and goal-oriented, and we have a strong appetite for life. When Kapha prevails, we tend to be easygoing, methodical, and nurturing. Although each of us has all three forces, most people have one or two elements that predominate.1

### Western European Herbalism with Egyptian and Unani Roots

In ancient Egypt around 525 BCE, medical practice was highly advanced for its time (Fig. 3.4). It included simple noninvasive surgery, bone setting, and an extensive pharmacopeia, titled the Ebers Papyrus. Egyptian medical thought influenced later traditions, including that of the Greeks.

Greek Unani-tibb (tibb means medicine in Arabic) is sometimes called Unani. It is a form of traditional medicine practiced in the Middle East and South Asia. It is based on the teachings of Hippocrates and Galen, who had been influenced by the Egyptians.2 Hippocrates and Galen had a great influence on the medical system of the European Middle Ages that continued to be based on the four humors of phlegm, blood, yellow bile, and black bile (Chapter 2). Unani herbalism eventually evolved into what we now call Western herbalism and medicine from its Greek and Roman roots.

According to Unani medicine, management of any disease depends on the diagnosis. In the diagnosis, clinical features, such as signs, symptoms, laboratory features, and temperament are important. Western European medicine grew from this. It is based on old wisdom, experimentation, and modern use of herbs. Later, pharmaceuticals entered the mix. Because we are Westerners, we are likely most familiar with this method and grew up with it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chinese Medicine, 2800 BCE

This ancient tradition uses concepts of qi, yin and yang, plant energetics of taste, moisture, temperature, and conditions such as hot and cold, dry and damp, and strong and weak (Fig. 3.5). Chinese medicine dates back to around 2800 BCE. Its main tenet or objective is to maintain the qi or life force and energy. Good health depends on the balanced flow of this energy, which circulates through pathways called meridians. Maintaining good righteous qi is managed through acupuncture, which is the insertion of hair-thin needles in key points along the meridians and by the use of herbal medicine. Certain classic Chinese herbal formulas have been in use for thousands of years and, when selected properly, are incredibly effective.

The intention of Chinese Medicine is to keep the body in balance, strengthen its defenses, and treat any illness that occurs. It is very holistic and takes into account mind, body, and spirit. It is concerned with seasons, weather, time of day when symptoms occur, emotions involved, colors, tastes, and all the senses.

Chinese medicine uses herbs, acupuncture, a type of massage called tuina, and a form of energy movement therapy called qigong. Practice of qigong enhances the flow of qi in the body by integrating posture, body movements, breathing, and focused intention. Tuina incorporates many massage techniques, such as kneading, rolling, and range of motion.

## Vitalistic Versus Analytic Approaches to Herbalism and Medicine

One of the main differences in the way medicine is practiced allopathically or holistically involves the concepts of vitalism versus analytic. These are two opposing ways of looking at the body and understanding how it heals. Vitalism means seeing the body as a whole unit that works together. The analytic approach views the body as a machine made up of various parts—fix or replace the damaged part, and the whole will work again.3

Chinese practitioners talk about identifying and treating the root, not the branch of a problem, meaning find the cause, don’t just chase symptoms. Good herbalists do this if they can. For instance, the general fix for a headache could be to stop pain and treat the symptom with aspirin-like Willow bark. The deeper fix for that headache is to find and treat the cause. The headache could arise from liver congestion, in which case you might select Dandelion root; if from a stomach upset, specify Catnip herb; if from tension, choose Valerian root; if from weakness, opt for Cinnamon bark.

<!-- chunk -->

### Analytic Approach

Conventional Western medicine sees the body in separate boxes analytically. Other words to describe this are reductionist, scientific, materialistic, objective, or left-brain linear thinking. This is the way anatomy and physiology are taught in nursing and medical schools. An enormous amount of information is put into boxes to make it more manageable. The body systems and their organs are the parts. There is the digestive system, the respiratory system, and the cardiovascular system, etc. We have gastroenterologists, pulmonologists, and cardiologists, each concentrating in one area. When I worked as a nurse in a modern hospital intensive care unit, these specialists would visit patients and prescribe only for that body system or part. Rarely did they look at the whole person and see more than a heart or a lung with “tunnel vision.” It was the nurse’s job to look at the whole patient and try to coordinate the treatments to ensure that the whole person’s needs were addressed.

Analytic traditions stem from Hippocrates, Aristotle, Newton, and Descartes. They saw the body as a machine made up of organs and chemicals. The whole was understood by reducing things to their parts. This sometimes works well. The periodic table of elements or classifications of body systems are examples. With this reductionist thinking, everyone who has the same diagnosis receives essentially the same treatment.

Herbal medicine can also use the analytic approach. When herbs are classified under categories such as diuretics, demulcents, astringents, or emmenagogues, this is analytical thinking. It can be useful information, as long as one does not become trapped into only chasing symptoms and ignoring the cause. A good herbal formula will have components to help symptoms (the branch), but it also needs to contain herbs that treat the cause (the root).

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitalistic Approach

Vitalism sees the body as a dynamic, ever-changing organism, adapting to its needs and desires. Other words to describe this approach are holistic, energy-based, right-brain, feeling, balancing, restoring, and mind-body. Vitalism assumes that that there is an intelligence and order in the organism that is designed to heal. Body systems coordinate functions with each other. Hearts do not work without lungs. One example of this intelligence is healing after a cut in the skin. The body knows, without any input from the individual, to send certain inflammatory factors to kill off any bacteria, activate clotting factors to stop the bleeding, and initiate tissue growth to heal the wound.4

If an herbalist were to use a vitalistic approach, she would look at herbs as energetics. This is the viewpoint taken in books such as Peter Holmes’ Energetics of Western Herbs. Here, Western herbs are approached from a vitalistic perspective. Is the herb hot or cold, dry or damp, sweet or bitter? What is its overall effect on the individual? Is the person’s constitution hot and dry? Then the herbalist cools her down with something cooling and moist. This approach treats the root and considers healing from an energetic level.

<!-- chunk -->

### Blending the Two Approaches

Of course, the vitalistic and analytic approaches are not mutually exclusive. In reality, herbalists use both. Sometimes one is preferred over the other. If someone comes into a clinic with horrible stomach pain, cramping, and diarrhea, you would best begin by relieving their symptoms (analytic). It would be handy to know that maybe some Peppermint herb to relieve pain and Cranesbill herb to ease diarrhea could be starters. Then, when immediate symptoms are addressed, you would follow with a vitalistic-based gut restorative plan to fix the cause.

Herbalists tend to look at the body as nonlinear. At best, the herbalist’s goal is to build up the constitution, strengthen immunity, and maintain health. Medical herbalism is concerned more with overall effects on the individual than with treating symptoms. If you have an irritable bowel, see a vitalistic herbalist for plants and dietary suggestions. But if you fall off a roof or are in a car accident, your best bet is to get to a modern science-based emergency room and see a good trauma doctor.

The majority of diseases affecting Americans today are chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, dementia, or obesity, often caused by poor health choices. They are governed by lifestyle, diet, and psychological issues, which are better treated with a vitalistic approach. This process is how Chinese, Native American, Ayurvedic, Shamanistic, and Wise-Women and Wise-Men, also called Traditional Healers, approach healing. They see the body as more than the sum of its parts; they see it as a holism. Healing becomes intuitive and spiritually oriented. It requires looking within and finding causes. The practice of herbalism is a juggling act. Sometimes we are on the vitalistic side, sometimes the analytic, and sometimes a little of each (Table 3.1).

## Seven Steps of Healing

We all get sick from time to time. Wellness follows a continuum from feeling vibrant and healthy to being deathly ill. Some days are better than other days. These seven steps are adapted from herbalist Susun Weed’s Six Steps of Healing.6 They describe the process one might go through to handle a situation and figure out the best approach. The steps can easily be placed into the paradigm of the vitalistic versus analytic approaches just discussed.

The steps are guidelines followed by many, but not always in the given order. There is no right way or one way, just as there are many paths to healing. The trick is to choose well and match yourself or your client to the method that fits or resonates. Timing is important. If you wait too long to seek help, things could escalate, and the problem could become more serious.

Knowing whether to approach the problem on the physical, emotional, mental, or vibrational level is helpful. Some people see it one way only. Either it’s all vitalistic or all analytic. But if one always goes holistic, shunning Western medicine, or always rushes to a doctor at the first sign of illness, she is cheating herself out of a range of possibilities. It is often a bit frightening to try out an unfamiliar approach. Leaving your comfort zone is not easy, nor is admitting you were wrong.

Sometimes we become fixated at one step and cannot move on to the next. This circumstance could happen from fear or denial. If stuck at a level, it usually helps to go down to the step before for clarity. The healing journey is not always linear. At times we jump around, using the steps out of order, or even take two at a time. Steps one, two, and three are the Wise-Woman or Taoist Way. Four and five are mainstream Chinese, Greek, and Ayurvedic approaches. Steps six and seven refer to the Western, allopathic route.

<!-- chunk -->

### Step One: Do Nothing

Here we are looking within (Fig. 3.6). This might sound simple, but there is a lot going on. When we don’t rush to do or ingest something, we are allowing our inner wisdom to give us a clue. It assumes we are taking time out to rest, meditate, sleep, or fast. We are allowing answers to come.

Doing nothing can be empowering and Zen-like and implies we are letting our guides speak. This process, of course, takes time. Patience is a must. Or doing nothing can mean we are in denial and have decided to ignore any messages. We just keep going blindly, hoping it will go away. We decide to tough it out because there is no time to be sick.

<!-- chunk -->

### Step Two: Collecting Information

At this point, we are not doing anything physically, but we are looking within and also seeking wise council (Fig. 3.7). We want to know what is going on and why. Let’s call it “low-tech diagnosis.” We are conferring with ourself, our higher self, or other wise men or women we trust. We might fast or dream the answer, channel, or use hypnotherapy. We could consult the internet, use a support group, or look up possibilities in a book, evaluating this information on a psychic level. We may be seeking a message. Why did this happen to me? What is the lesson? We could see illness as an opportunity to slow down, rest, stay home. We might say, “Now I have a good excuse to take a day off.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Step Three: Engaging the Energy

At this point we try mind medicine. We use prayer. We use other energy medicines (Fig. 3.8). These include homeopathy, visualization, ritual, laughter, chakra balancing, therapeutic touch, and Reiki. All are energy based. Homeopathy uses the energetic template of a highly diluted substance with none of its original matter. Reiki and therapeutic touch channel energy. Chakra balancing is from the Hindu tradition and connects the spinning vortexes of energy residing in our bodies.

We could use journaling, qigong, acupuncture, or past-life regression. In some of these, we are not trying to manifest an outcome. Reiki allows the energy to connect and the body to heal. The practitioner is a channel. There is no ego involved and no expectations other than allowing the process to unfold. In other techniques, such as visualization, we are picturing a result through focus and concentration. In acupuncture and qigong, we are opening up energy pathways in the body to allow the smooth flow of qi.

A word of caution here. Energy methods aren’t for everybody. They are far over on the vitalistic side. If these methods don’t fit into a person’s life view and belief system, then leave them alone. As we said earlier, steps can be skipped, and order can be interchanged. If the shoe fits, wear it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Step Four: Supporting and Nourishing

Now we begin to do something (Fig. 3.9). Call it lifestyle medicine. It’s chicken soup time. We try nourishing, tonifying, or strengthening with herbal infusions, hot lemon, and honey or a hot toddy. We choose wild foods like dandelion greens or use mustard plasters on painful muscles. We attempt yoga, tai chi, walking. We take a hot bath containing essential oils and place candles all around. We obtain physical and spiritual nourishment with physical, mental, and emotional support from others.

Spiritual nourishment comes in friendships, family, children, laughter, crying, or playing. We allow someone to bring us a cup of tea. Maybe we watch a silly TV show or movie. We stay at home to heal. We cocoon ourselves and feel loved. We love ourselves.

We do what we need. Maybe we take a little trip to the hot springs, a Turkish bath, steam room, sauna, or sweat lodge. Maybe walk around the block. We pursue a change of scene.

<!-- chunk -->

### Step Five: Altering Energy

This step is when we try alternative medicine and actually make an appointment (Fig. 3.10). Something is done to someone else. The energy becomes goal oriented with an outcome in mind. The therapy will alter the energy, we hope, for the better. It is getting more specific. Ideally, we have figured out what we need and which modality to try. That is important. There is so much out there. A Wise-Woman friend from the collecting information step may have guided the decision.

We could go natural with herbal medicine or Bach flower remedies. We might try a hands-on type of bodywork such as massage, reflexology, or Rolfing. We could alter our thoughts with the mental approach and consult a psychotherapist. The key is that we are doing something about it—taking action.

<!-- chunk -->

### Step Six: Going to the Doctor

With this step, we are definitely on the invasive, analytic side (Fig. 3.11). We are going to a doctor and entering pharmaceutical realms. We have given up on the gentler approaches and are hoping for fast action. This is the world of allopathic medicine. It disregards life force or the natural progression of things, but it is quick. It uses active ingredients, supplements, and strong medicine.

The downsides of this route are the side effects of drugs and their interactions with other substances. Drugs are easy to misuse. Dependency or addictions are possible and common. Are the side effects worth the cure? Is chemotherapy or radiation worth it? Sometimes we must be thankful that this aggressive medicine exists. It is lifesaving in the right situations.

Examples of this step are drugs, casts for fractures, dentures, glasses, hearing aids, organ transplants, hip and knee replacements, and blood transfusions. This is hard-core stuff. Addictions to sleeping pills, psychoactive drugs, and pain pills abound. Leading causes of death are through misuse of prescribed drugs, overdoses, hospital drug errors, or addiction from illegal drug use.

<!-- chunk -->

### Step Seven: Breaking and Entering

With Step Seven, we are invading a person’s natural barrier or boundary of skin or soul. It disregards natural life force, although the intent is to heal (Fig. 3.12). Here we have high-tech, heroic, Western medicine. This is the world of surgery, MRIs, CAT scans, X-rays, and invasive diagnostic tests like spinal taps. It involves specialized techniques that are done to you. They are goal oriented but have high potential to hurt and harm.

Breaking and entering are acute, intensive, and aggressive approaches. Results can be miraculous or disastrous. As a former intensive care nurse, I’ve seen real-time side effects of diagnostic tests go bad. For instance, in a cardiac catheterization, a catheter is threaded all the way up from the femoral artery or vein in the groin to a coronary artery surrounding the heart. It is easy to pierce the heart or artery or have a patient bleed to death from this diagnostic procedure. On the positive side, it shows where heart blockages occur so that a stint can be placed to open up the artery, thus saving a life. Quite a range. Don’t take it lightly.

Please be very cautious with steps six and seven, Going to the Doctor and Breaking and Entering. Many folks use these last two as their first resort rather than the last. If you need them, be thankful they’re there. But don’t abuse them.

<!-- chunk -->

### How to Use the Seven Steps of Healing

Putting the steps to practical application can be done in three ways. We can take a linear approach, working our way up from steps one to seven systematically. We might take a more global approach, using many steps simultaneously. Or we could skip around.

For instance, if we had undiagnosed back pain, we could do research on the internet, go to the doctor for a pain prescription, and get a massage. If we find a breast lump and are scared, we might get an MRI, see a psychic, and ask for herbs at the health food store, all on the very same day.


An herbal remedy is a plant or plants used for medicinal purposes. Herbalists practice using these plants for healing. Herbology is the study of plants. Herbalism is a medical model or system that uses natural plants or plant extracts for internal and external use. Pharmacognosy is the study of plants as a natural source of drugs and the science of plant chemistry.

Different cultures have had different approaches to herbalism, medicine, and healing. There are four basic herbal traditions into which most systems fit: Ethnic, Ayurvedic, Western European, and Chinese Medicine. There are two basic approaches to healing: vitalistic and analytic. The vitalistic approach is the holistic method. The analytic approach is more scientific. Vitalism views the body as a dynamic, ever-changing organism, adapting to its needs and desires. The analytic approach can be described as more scientific and objective. The analytic approach is the dominant way medicine is practiced in the West. Both approaches would do well to adopt a little of the other for a more balanced outlook.

The Seven Steps of Healing are the thought processes many use to confront illness. Most people go through some or all of these steps, not necessarily in order. Understanding them is useful for an herbalist who works in a clinical setting.

Taxonomy involves the organizing, classifying, and naming of living things. As far as plants are concerned, this process involves a familiarity with the work of renowned naturalist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus, who lived in Sweden in the 1700s. A degree in botany is not necessary, but some basic information is.

An important aspect of herbalism is the question of plant names. Many plants have more than one common name, and some common names are duplicated for other botanicals. There are also Latin names, pharmaceutical names, and Chinese anglicized pinyin names. This chapter sorts them out. If herbalists know the Latin name of a plant, they are in a safe zone, because Latin is the official designated worldwide naming system. Latin names require an understanding of Linnaeus’s binomial system.

To identify plants that are growing in the field with any degree of safety, assurance, and accuracy, we need to have a familiarity with common medicinal plant families and how they fit into the overall scheme. When out wildcrafting, accurate plant identification is vital.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taxonomy and Carl Linnaeus, 1707–1778

Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus is considered the father of modern taxonomy. Taxonomy is the science of identifying, naming, and classifying living organisms based on their structure and evolutionary history. Linnaeus focused on the plant kingdom and classified plants based on structure. Taxonomy is a way to categorize extinct and living species. Herbalists would be well-served to know how the plants they use for healing fit into the big picture. Linnaeus organized it into a seven-tiered classification system. Whenever there is a large amount of puzzling information, we tend to arrange it into understandable boxes and categories. The field of taxonomy takes this on.

Before Linnaeus, various systems had been toyed with. Aristotle in ancient Greece was the first to attempt classification of living things 2000 years ago. He divided them into plants or animals based on appearance. The Romans were more specific and added types of organisms, for example, a flower or a dog. As more flora and fauna were discovered, the need arose for further breakdown (e.g., the many types of flowers or dogs). As new organisms were classified, lengthy and cumbersome descriptions were added, such as the plant with the tall yellow flower and pointy leaves or the brown and white, shaggy-haired dog with long legs that could run fast.

As we gain new information about a plant or animal, classifications can and do change. Taxonomy is not static—it’s a living, changing entity that is debated and amended. With genetic research now going on, taxonomic reclassifications are occurring at a rapid pace.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Linnaean Seven-Tiered System of Plant Classification

This system begins with the broadest designation and works its way down to the smallest, most specific, detailed group (Box 4.1). The classification for Salvia divinorum (Divine Sage) is shown, but any botanical could have been used as an example. From an herbalist’s perspective, pertinent information begins on the last three rungs of the hierarchy: the family, the genus, and the species.

Box 4.1

Linnaeus’s Seven-Tiered Classification System

Salvia divinorum (Divine Sage)

Kingdom: Plant

Division: Angiosperm or Magnoliophyta.

Class: Magnoliopsida (dicotyledons). Class names end in opsida.

Subclass: Asteridae. Subclass names end in idae.

Order: Lamiales. Order names end in ales.

Family: Lamiaceae. Family names end in aceae. Sometimes subdivided into Subfamilies and Tribes, which end in eae.

Genus: Salvia. Genus names are italicized or underlined.

Species: divinorum. Follows genus name, lowercase, italicized or underlined.1

<!-- chunk -->

### Kingdom

Kingdom is the broadest and top level. Aristotle designated two kingdoms: plant and animal. At this writing, it’s up to six kingdoms and will most likely keep climbing as we discover more.

<!-- chunk -->

#### Division

The next Linnaean plant category is the division (Table 4.1). Plants are placed into divisions based on whether they reproduce by seeds or spores, and whether they are vascular. Seed-bearing plants are further divided into gymnosperms (naked seeds) and angiosperms (seeds enclosed in an ovary).

Table 4.1

<!-- chunk -->

### Class

Class comes next, under division. The two plant classes under the angiosperm division are the monocots and dicots. Monocots have one seed leaf and parallel leaf veins; they are vascular and have flower parts in multiples of three (examples are iris, lilies, orchids, and yuccas). Dicots have two seed leaves and netted leaf veins; they are vascular and have floral parts in multiples of four or five.3 More on this topic in the “Botany” section of this chapter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Order

Order is used to group similar families. Various scientific organizations differ regarding where a plant belongs. As far as plant identification goes, the order level contains plants that are so varied and different from one another that there are few useful structural patterns to work with. A new taxonomic cataloging system by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) uses evolutionary history and genetics, phylogeny, instead of the older structural system used by Linnaeus (Box 4.2).

Box 4.2

The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG)

Phylogeny is the use of evolutionary history and genetic relationships to classify plants. Linnaeus didn’t know about DNA and based his plant filing system on what was known at the time: structure (morphology) and chemistry.

The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) is an international team of taxonomists who have been gaining clout and prestige in the world of taxonomy since 1998, when they broke away from the traditional Linnaean system. The APG came together to establish a consensus on the taxonomy of flowering plants (angiosperms) that would reflect new genetic knowledge, rather than relying on the older method of hit-or-miss observation, which had many exceptions to patterns.4

Linnaeus divided flowering plants into monocots and dicots. The APG does not support the classification of monocots as a distinct group. It recognizes monocots as a clade (a species or group of species) and their most recent common ancestor, the plant’s lineage to date. Angiosperm classification begins with the descendants of a particular clade or monocot group, and formal scientific names are not used above that level.

The APG shows this information on a branching diagram or a family tree and depicts a plant’s common evolutionary relatives. Common genetic descendants of a particular group branch off on the tree.5 From order on down the hierarchy, the APG follows Linnaeus’s system. Order, family, genus, and species are retained. A limited number of orders (narrowed down to 40 from 232) are considered more useful, and orders containing only a single family are avoided when possible. There are still 25 families of uncertain position. Expect more changes.

The APG is attempting to revamp the Linnaean scheme. Taxonomy is not dead.

### Family, Subfamily, and Tribe

Plants with similar flower, fruit, and seed structures are placed into a family.3 Recognizing plant families is extremely useful for field identification, because if we can learn a distinctive family pattern, we will already narrow down the possibilities for knowing a plant’s identity, its genus, and its species. You will automatically know if it is likely poisonous or edible and will know some of its medicinal aspects. Major families for an herbalist to recognize are the Mint, Parsley, Mustard, Pea, Lily, Grass, Rose, and Aster families. There are about 45,000 species in these 8 families alone.2 That’s a lot of plants.

A subfamily is a designation below a family and a tribe is a subgroup under a subfamily. Each group has smaller botanical differences than the one above, but each level usually comprises many different plants.

An example of this arrangement is the Pea family name Fabaceae, a subfamily within it being Faboideae (plants with flowers having a banner, wings, and keel structure) and under that, the Clover tribe, Trifolieae with three-parted leaves. Notice that family names end in ceae, subfamilies end in deae, and tribes end in eae. The Pea family (Fabaceae) and the Sunflower family (Asteraceae) have many tribes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Genus

A genus is a group of plants within a family that has more traits in common with each other than with any other plants in that family.3 It is basically the surname of a plant, like Smith. Many plants can have the same genus name (the entire related Smith family), but they have to be botanically similar and genetically connected. It is the first listing in the binomial designation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Species

The species is the second listing in the binomial designation and the most individual, identifying the specific plant. A species is a group of organisms that resemble each other more closely than those of any other group and are capable of reproducing with one another to produce fertile offspring.1 There can only be one plant per species. If the genus is the surname Smith, then the species is the first name, Mary. These last three groups—family, genus, and species—are the most important for an herbalist to know (Box 4.3).

## Naming Plants

<!-- chunk -->

### What’s in a Name?

How do you know which plant is which? How are identifications made and herbs acquired? Will you refer to an herb catalog where herbs are already named, or will you go foraging or wildcrafting? How can a plant that is growing in a field or backyard be accurately identified? This information is pretty basic stuff. The best way to know a plant is to sit with it as it is growing in the ground. Before that, learn her name and something about her.

There are two related aspects and answers to these questions. One involves taxonomy, the science of classifying plants into ordered categories and related groups based on some factor common to each, such as structure, embryology, or biochemistry. The other is botany, the science of plants and the branch of biology that deals with plant life and plant structure.

<!-- chunk -->

## Common Names

When using plants as medicine, it is essential to ensure we have the correct plant and its correct name. This process can be confusing. A single plant often has many nicknames or common names, which may be what it is called in a certain location or region based on common usage. Plantain leaf has been called Ribwort, Lamb’s Tongue, Dog’s Ribs, Ripple Grass, Leechwort, and Windles, to name a few. Echinacea spp. is also known as Purple Coneflower, Red Sunflower, Comb flower, Hedgehog, Scurvy root, and Indian Head.7 Different countries, towns, and locales have their own preferred names. For good communication, herbalists use the Latin name that is recognized worldwide by all.

If out wildcrafting, where does one start? It is extremely difficult to tell what something is by comparing it to a picture or a sketch in a book. Pictures and the real plant don’t always match. Even photos are not always clear. And what if the field guide is organized by flower color and the flowers are long gone, because they died in mid-July, and you are out identifying plants in late August? What if the field guide organizes plants into families, but you haven’t a clue which family your plant is in? What if the guide is organized alphabetically? Then you have to rifle through the entire book and hope you are lucky enough to find a picture that remotely matches.

## The Botanical Name, Based on the Binomial System

Linnaeus proposed a binomial system or two-name system of classification for all living things. The first name is the general name, the genus, and the second name is the specific name, the species. This binomial system streamlined and revolutionized botany. The binomial name is considered the scientific name, Latin name, or botanical name of a plant. There are certain recognized rules to follow when writing botanical names.

Box 4.4

Derivations of Botanical Names

<!-- chunk -->

### The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants

The International Code of Binomial Nomenclature (ICBN) determines and governs the naming of plants. This is a different group from the APG, which deals with phylogeny. The ICBN publishes the set of rules and recommendations that govern the formal botanical names given to algae, fungi, and plants. The International Botanical Congress (IBC) meets every few years in different countries to revise, reclassify, or add names as more is learned or discovered. The original meeting to decide all this was held in Paris in 1867 about a century after Linnaeus. The words algae, fungi, and plants were in added in July 2011.

As more information is collected on plants, their family, genus, or species may change. Some plants have gone through many name changes and reversals. Roman Chamomile was once in the genus Anthemis but is now a member of the genus Chamaemelum. Family names have also changed. Major groups have gone from general names to those representing an important genus of the family. The Compositae family is now Asteraceae, named after the common Aster genus. The Mint family used to be called Labiatae for its two-lipped upper petals but is now Lamiaceae. The old Cruciferous family is now the Brassicaceae.2 It’s not all that clear cut. The ICBN publishes updates each time it meets and after all the botanists reconsider plants’ botanical names, characteristics, and origins.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Basic Principles of the ICBN

Box 4.5

Black Cohosh Botanical Name Reverts Back and Forth

(Make up your mind, already!)

A recent botanical name change was for Black Cohosh. Linnaeus originally listed it in his Species Plantarum (1753) under the genus Actaea (Actaea racemosa, L.) based on its morphological characteristics of inflorescence (flowers) and seeds. Later, Thomas Nuttall had its genus changed in 1818 because of the dry follicles it produced, typical of the species Cimicifuga (Cimicifuga racemosa, Nutt). However, in 1999, based on new morphological and DNA sequence studies by James Compton of the University of Reading, UK, Black Cohosh has been switched back again into Linnaeus’s original genus, Actaea.9

## The Pharmaceutical Name

The binomial name of a plant is considered its botanical or scientific name. We have also discussed a plant’s common name. To further complicate the name issue, in Chinese Medicine, plants are often named another way, by their pharmaceutical name. The name is composed of the plant part used in Latin, such as radix for root, fructus for fruit, flos for flower (Table 4.2). The plant part is followed by the genus, and occasionally the species. Examples are Licorice root (Radix Glycyrrhizae), Green tea leaf (Folium Camelliae sinensis), Chrysanthemum flower (Flos Chrysanthemi). The advantage of the pharmaceutical name is that you always know the plant part in question; the disadvantage is that you don’t always know the species, which is sometimes mentioned and sometimes not.10

Table 4.2

<!-- chunk -->

## The Pinyin Name

There is yet another name to be familiar with when considering herbs used in Chinese Medicine. This is the pinyin name, based on a system for transcribing the pronunciation of the Mandarin dialect with its Chinese letters into the Latin alphabet. It was adopted by the People’s Republic of China in 1979 and was used to teach standard Chinese and word pronunciation (Table 4.3).

Table 4.3

R as in ran with tongue curled back on palate,

I in Yi as in seem

In most books on Chinese herbs and in Chinese herb catalogs, the pinyin name is given along with some combination of the common, botanical, or pharmaceutical name. Pinyin is the Chinese pronunciation of the herb in English. If you shop for herbs in a city’s area of predominantly Chinese residents and businesses, the pinyin name is often the only name the Chinese shopkeeper knows. If you can’t request your herb and can’t pronounce it correctly in pinyin, you may have difficulty buying the herb you seek. If unsure of pronunciation, write down the pinyin name before you go, just in case. For example, Bupleurum root is Chi Hu; Astragalus root is Huang Qi. Examples of the four types of names just discussed are provided (Table 4.4).

## Botany

Botany is the study of plant structure: flowers and their parts, leaf structures, and plant families. The ability to name and recognize basic plant structures is needed to identify plants actually growing in the ground. The capacity to pinpoint a few plant families will provide clues about a plant's probable medicinal properties. What follows is basic botanical information for herbalists, but by no means an exhaustive investigation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons

Flowering plants are angiosperms. Their seeds are enclosed in an ovary and are divided into two major groups: the monocotyledons (monocots) and the dicotyledons (dicots). A cotyledon is a seed leaf, the first leaf that sprouts from the seed. Monocots (one) have one seed leaf because the seed is all once piece (e.g., a corn kernel). Dicots (two) have two seed leaves because one leaf sprouts from each half of the seed (e.g., a bean). Beyond observing seed leaves, there are other ways to recognize them, in case you see the plant long after its seed leaf has died.3 Recognizing whether a plant is a monocot or a dicot is the first step in its identification.

Be aware that like everything in the plant world, there are exceptions. Some monocots have netted veins. Some dicots have parallel veins. Sometimes the flower parts vary from threes, to fours and fives. To know for sure, one has to key out a plant by using a flow chart technique where characteristics are ruled out one by one through the process of elimination. More on this in the “Keying Out a Plant” section later in this chapter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Flowers

Flowers have evolved over time as a result of modifications from a structurally simple magnolia flower to the complex flower heads of the Aster family (Fig. 4.4). Leaves transitioned into sepals, then to petals, then to stamens. This change is revealed in the plant’s structure. Sometimes it is hard to determine whether the colored part commonly called a flower is a petal, a sepal, or a combination of the two.

Flowers vary in shape. Some are symmetrical and regular, with the parts of a set all identical in size; others are irregular, with parts of the set different (Fig. 4.5). Asters have symmetrical daisy-like shapes, and Pea flowers are asymmetrical. Sepals, petals, and stamens can be above, below, or in the middle of the ovary. The parts of a flower follow (see Fig. 4.4).

<!-- chunk -->

### Leaves

Leaves come in many sizes and shapes. Leaves last much longer than flowers and are a major way to identify plants when sorting out families. Some leaves are actually many leaflets arranged in a group (Fig. 4.8).

<!-- chunk -->

## Plant Families for Herbalists

Now we get into the fun of identifying plant families using our powers of observation, the senses. This skill is essential for any wildcrafter. I can testify that wildcrafting and walking among the plants is one of life’s greatest joys. We will consider a few major families that contain many medicinal herbs.

Observing patterns helps place a plant in a family and knowing the characteristics of a family allows us to make an educated guess as to the plant’s properties. We use information about leaf structure and flower parts to decide. We count stamens and observe their length. We decide if flowers are symmetrical or irregular and whether the petals are united or separate. We look at the stem to see if it’s round, square, rough, or hollow, and if there is juice inside. What shape and pattern do the leaves have, and do they grow on the stem in an alternate, opposite, or whorled position? How does the leaf or flower smell? Are there aromatic oils? Is the texture rough or smooth?

Families are presented with key words to help you remember. Major families are listed here with descriptions, examples, and general characteristics. If you can identify these few families, you already have the potential to know about 45,000 species worldwide!2

<!-- chunk -->

### Mint Family (Lamiaceae)

Stems are square (Box 4.6). The leaves are opposite one another on the stem. If you crush or rub a leaf between your fingers, the leaf and your fingers will usually smell strongly aromatic. This scent will quickly distinguish it from other plants. Mint flowers are very tiny and irregular, two-lipped with two lobes above and three lobes below, all united. The flowers have four stamens, two long and two short. You might need a magnifying glass to see them. Other flowers with square stems and opposite leaves are found in the Verbena, Stinging Nettle, and Loosestrife families. Those plants are not aromatic, however. The two-chambered ovary matures into a capsule containing four nutlets. The Mint family has about 3500 species worldwide (Fig. 4.12).2

Box 4.6

MINT FAMILY. KEY WORDS: * Square stalks * Opposite leaves * Irregular flowers * Usually aromatic *

Some Mint family plants are rich in the volatile oil called menthol, which provides the traditional minty smell to Peppermint, Spearmint, Paleo Mint, Wintergreen, Eucalyptus, and Pennyroyal herbs. Rub one of these leaves between your fingers and smell it. Menthol acts medicinally to open the airways, stop pain and inflammation, help digestion, and stop stomachaches. One or two drops of Peppermint essential oil rubbed on the abdomen is a great nausea remedy.

The Mint family tends to be a very safe, nontoxic group and is one of the easiest families to become acquainted with. Many of our seasonings, culinary spices, and aromatic essential oils abound in components of this family, such as the leaves of Marjoram, Oregano, Basil, Garden Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme. Other Lamiaceae family members are Horehound herb for any kind of cough; Motherwort herb, a woman’s ally; Catnip herb for stomachaches; Skullcap and Lemon Balm herbs for sleep and relaxation; and Hyssop herb for opening the airway. Monarda spp. (Wild Bergamot, Wild Oregano, Bee Balm) attract bees like crazy, and grow abundantly in the Rocky Mountains. It is a great wild food to spice up camp meals. A little goes a long way.

### Parsley or Carrot Family (Apiaceae)

The Apiaceae family used to be called the Umbelliferae because of its umbel-shaped flowers reminiscent of umbrellas (Box 4.7, Fig. 4.13). The umbels are compound, meaning that the stems of each flower cluster radiate from a single stalk. That stalk in turn meets other stalks at a single point, making it compound or an umbel within an umbel. Each flower is very tiny and has five sepals, five petals, and five stamens that you might need a magnifying glass to see and count (Fig. 4.14). The leaves are usually fernlike, pinnate shaped. Stems are generally hollow. The ovary has two chambers or carpels.2

Box 4.7

PARSLEY FAMILY. KEY WORDS: * Compound umbels * Usually hollow flower stalks *

Wild Carrot, commonly known as Queen Anne’s Lace, and Parsley are well-known Apiaceae members, as are spicy Fennel, Celery, Dill, and Caraway seed. All of these plants contain volatile oils that are stimulating, warm, and diaphoretic. They are also digestion-helping carminatives. Candy-coated Fennel seeds are often offered in a basket after East Indian meals for that reason. Other medicinal members are the Parsnip, Water Parsnip (roots can be poisonous to livestock), and Cow Parsnip root, whose seeds are carminative and also a tooth and gum analgesic. Then there are the pungent, spicy celery-smelling Ligusticum plants, such as L. porteri (Osha root) for colds and flu, and the closely related Levisticum officinale (Lovage root), a draining diuretic. Also, the Angelica genus, such as A. archangelica (Angelica root) from the West, for digestion and expectoration, and the famous A. sinensis Dang Gui (Dong Quai root) from China, known for helping with women’s reproductive problems.

Last but not least are the dangerous and poisonous Apiaceae family members. Cicuta maculata (Water Hemlock) is considered the deadliest plant in North America. It can cause seizures and quick death in 15 minutes. Conium maculatum (Poison Hemlock), often mistaken for Wild Carrot because of leaf similarity, causes paralysis and death but not seizures, and famously was fatal to Socrates in 399 BCE.11 Both Hemlocks grow in the Rockies, as do Osha and Wild Carrot. Hemlocks have very stinky, mouse-smelling roots and smell nothing like pungent, celery-like Osha root or carroty Wild Carrot. Although Parsley members are very valuable medicinally, it is imperative that you make a positive identification before using. Always go out walking with an expert before any wildcrafting, root chewing, or tasting is attempted.

### Mustard Family (Brassicaceae)

The Mustards are numerous, easy to recognize, safe to eat, and they have a spicy flavor. The Radish is the best known. Mustards grow prolifically and bloom early. In early spring, they are visible in fields all over. They like disturbed soil and barren ground (Box 4.8). Mustard family flowers have six stamens, four tall and two short. The flowers grow in an H or X shape (Fig. 4.15). The ovary is superior to the petals, with two united carpels in a single chamber. The seed pods are distinctive and grow in many shapes. They will split open to reveal a clear middle membrane. The pods hang by short stems and spiral up the stem at equal distances in a radial pattern, forming a raceme (Fig. 4.16).

Box 4.8

MUSTARD FAMILY. KEY WORDS: * Four petals * Six stamens, four tall and two short *

Mustards contain acrid sulfur glycosides, which are irritants. They help digestion in small amounts and cause heartburn in large amounts.2 A mustard poultice or plaster is very hot and irritating to sensitive skin but can open up the airway and relieve sore muscles. Some well-known medicinal mustards are Capsella bursa-pastoris (Shepherd’s Purse herb), used as an astringent vasoconstrictor to slow bleeding, and water-loving Nasturtium officinale (Water Cress leaf), which is filled with vitamin C and chlorophyll and is a pleasure to munch on in the wild.

Commercially, the Brassicaceae family, formerly known as the Cruciferae, gives us many well-known antioxidant-rich cruciferous vegetables, such as cauliflower, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts. Other vegetables in the family are cabbage, kohlrabi, and kale. All of these were bred from a single species, Brassica oleracea. The condiment called mustard is made from B. nigra (Black Mustard seed). Grey Poupon anyone?

<!-- chunk -->

### Pea Family (Fabaceae)

The entire Pea family is third largest, after the Aster and Orchid families, with 18,000 species worldwide (Box 4.9). The Pea family is divided into many subfamilies, many of which contain individual tribes. Our northern hemisphere U.S. Pea subfamily (Faboideae) has a distinctive irregular banner, wings, and keel flower formation, but not all Pea family members have that flower shape. The Mimosa (Mimosoideae) subfamily has a five-separate-petaled flower arrangement. The Bird-of-Paradise subfamily (Caesalpinia) has showy, irregular flowers. These flowers get bigger and brighter as they work their way south of the U.S. border. Although the flowers of these last two subfamilies do not have the typical banner, wings, and keel shape, they still have pealike pods opening down two seams and pinnate leaves.2

Box 4.9

PEA FAMILY. KEY WORDS: * Banner, wings and keel * Pea-like pods * Often pinnate leaves *

Many Pea family members are also legumes. The former name for the entire family was once Leguminosae. These tribes include beans, peas, lentils, and peanuts. Legumes have a cooperative, symbiotic relationship with the nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil. The bacteria absorb nitrogen from the atmosphere and feed it to the plants. As the plants decompose, they feed the nitrogen back into the soil.

In the Pea subfamily is a variety of tribes. The most well-known are the Pea, Licorice, Clover, and Bean tribes.

<!-- chunk -->

#### Pea Subfamily/Pea Tribe (Fabeae)

We are familiar with this subfamily in the northern hemisphere. The flowers have a characteristic five-petal arrangement of a top-lobed and fused banner, two wings, and one bottom keel shape (fused). There is one carpal and five to ten stamens. The carpal becomes a pea pod that opens along two seams with several seeds (peas or beans) inside. A peanut is an underground pod with seeds/legumes inside. They are not actually nuts in the botanical sense but mistakenly have that name. Pea subfamily leaves are pinnately divided and have tendrils, specialized curly vinelike stems that react to touch and climb whatever is near.

Plants in the Pea subfamily/Pea tribe include the familiar Pisum sativum (Garden Sweet Peas), Lens culinaris (Lentils), and Vida americana (American Vetch). Some can be toxic to humans and grazing animals. For instance, common sweet garden peas can cause nervous disorders if eaten in large amounts and over extended periods of time. This effect is particularly true of those growing in hot climates.2

<!-- chunk -->

#### Pea Subfamily/Licorice Tribe (Galegeae)

This tribe has pinnately divided leaves, banner, wings, and keel flowers, but no tendrils. The Licorice family contains Glycyrrhiza lepidota (Wild Licorice) (Fig. 4.17). It is found in North America west of the Mississippi River and is not as strong or sweet as European G. glabra or the Chinese G. sinensis Gan Cao. But, in larger amounts, the root can substitute. Sweet-tasting Licorice is a main player in Western and Chinese herbalism. It is used as a demulcent and antiinflammatory in throat and cough formulas, a healer of the gut in ulcers, and an endocrine immune stimulant. It also adds a sweet taste to balance out a bitter formula and lessens any possible toxicity of other herbs.

Another important Licorice herb tribe is the vetches, the Astragalus genus. A. Huang Qi (Astragalus root) is an important Chinese adaptogen. The dried root is often broken up and added to soups and broths for an immune-boosting tonic, along with some Shitake and Reishi mushroom pieces.

<!-- chunk -->

#### Pea Subfamily/Clover Tribe (Trifolieae)

Clovers have distinctive trifoliate leaves, divided into three leaflets. (If you find one with four leaflets, it’s lucky, but unusual.) The flowers have the typical banner, wings, and keel arrangement, but each is quite small. The flower looks like a cluster of many tiny flowers appearing as one large flower ball unless you look closely. Clovers are particularly important in Western herbalism. Trifolium pratense (Red Clover flower) is known as a detoxifying herb that is cooling and astringent, and it can dry up wet conditions. Melilotus officinalis (Sweet Clover herb) is calming and clears heat, and it is full of sweet-smelling coumarin, which if spoiled and fermented, has a blood-thinning action (Chapter 8). Medicago sativa (Alfalfa herb) is a safe, nutritive herb, containing vitamins, minerals, trace minerals, amino acids, and protein. It makes a good tonic for nourishing the liver and relieving fatigue.7

<!-- chunk -->

#### Pea Subfamily/Bean Tribe (Phaseoleae)

The familiar bean plants are often seen climbing up a trellis, pole, or fence. They are clinging vines with three-parted leaves. This group includes Phaseolus spp. (Common Bean), Glycine max. (Soybean), and Vigna unguiculata (Black-Eyed Pea).

Pueraria montana (Kudzu vine), which grows all over the southern United States, was introduced in the late 1800s as an ornamental shrub to control erosion. It has taken over and crowds out native species by climbing up and all over them, depriving them of light.12 In Chinese Medicine, P. lobata Ge Gen (Kudzu root) is used to treat symptoms of high blood pressure, such as headache and dizziness, as a moisturizing demulcent for dry coughs, and is taken internally for cold sores, shingles, and genital herpes. The plant has many redeeming qualities as a medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lily Family (Liliaceae)

Liliaceae plants have three sepals and three petals (Box 4.10) (Fig. 4.18). Although obvious structures in the Mariposa Lily, often these parts are undifferentiated, identical in size and color, and hard to distinguish. The sepal-petal designation has been lumped together into the word tepal. There are six stamens. The ovary is superior, with three united carpals with partitioned walls. The pistil is three-parted. Leaf veins are parallel. Many species grow from bulbs (garlic, onions, and tulips); some have rhizomes. Chives, scallions, and leeks are part of this family. Lilies are ancient plants, having evolved approximately 52 million years ago.

Box 4.10

LILY FAMILY. KEY WORDS: * Monocot flowers with parts in threes * Sepals and petals usually identical * Parallel veins *

Historically, there has been controversy among taxonomists as to how to divide up and assign plants to this family. The Lily family used to be a catch-all group for plants that did not fit elsewhere. Mountain and Meadow Death Camases, often confused with wild onions, are examples (Box 4.11). Now many former Lily plants have been reidentified and reassigned to other homes. (They sound like orphans.) Presently, there are close to 640 species and 16 genera.2

Box 4.11

Mountain and Meadow Death Camases

These two Camases were once classified in the Liliaceae (Lily) family but have been reclassified to the Melanthiaceae (Bunchflower) family. They have been confused with wild onions but don’t smell like onions. Their toxic alkaloids are more poisonous than strychnine. The bulbs of both species can be fatal, and people who ingest them present with, dry, burning mouth, nausea, vomiting, headaches, cardiac irregularities, loss of muscle control, coma, and death. The plants are toxic to humans, livestock, and honeybees.

If it looks but doesn’t smell like an onion, it isn’t an onion!

The two fake onions are Anticlea elegans (Mountain Death Camas), formerly Zigadenus elegans, and Toxicoscordion venenosum (Meadow Death Camas), formerly Zigadenus venenosus. They both grow in the Rockies from Canada to Mexico. The mountain variety grows in subalpine and moist tundra areas. The Meadow Death Camas grows in lower meadows and sagebrush areas of the foothills and montane areas. They have narrow grass-shaped, mostly basal leaves with parallel veins, and white flowers arranged in racemes. Mountain Death Camas has nodding buds that are erect when open and stamens in a funnel near the center. Meadow Death Camas flower buds do not nod. The stamens are spread away from the ovary.11

<!-- chunk -->

#### Lily Subfamily (Lilioideae)

This Lily subfamily has very showy flowers, more so than others. They grow from bulbs or corms, which are sometimes edible but not always. So, be careful. Tulips belong here and have edible flowers and bulbs, but their bulbs are usually coated commercially with a toxic fungicide to prevent rotting (Fig. 4.19). Fritillaria thunbergii Zhe Bei Mu (Fritillaria bulb) from this subfamily is used in Chinese Medicine. It’s especially important as a respiratory sedative and mucolytic expectorant for stubborn, sticky sputum-type coughs with yellow phlegm.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Grass Family (Poaceae, formerly Gramineae)

Grasses are everywhere (Box 4.12). Worldwide, we find 650 genera and nearly 10,000 species in the Poaceae family. Grasses are monocots, just like the Lily family. They have hollow stems with knee-like nodes or joints and parallel veins on the leaves. The flowers of grasses are contained in modified leaves called bracts. Not too impressive looking alone, but they are a beautiful filler in dried arrangements and winter bouquets, and they are spectacular in fields of grasslands when blowing in the wind. When grass seeds are harvested, the bracts (chaff) must be separated from the seeds (grain). This ancient process is called winnowing. It removes the lighter chaff after it is broken away from the grain. Once the seeds are separated, they can be ground into flour for baking or cooked down into a cereal.

Box 4.12

GRASS FAMILY. KEY WORDS: * Grassy hollow flower stems * Knee-like joints or nodes *

Grasses play a large part in our economy and food supply. Triticum repens (Couch Grass root) has been used since ancient Greek and Roman times to treat kidney problems. Many grasses are our cereal grains. We have Secale cereale (Rye), Triticum aestivum (Wheat), Oryza sativa (Wild Rice), Hordeum vulgare (Barley), Zia mays (Corn), Avena sativa (Oats), and others (Fig. 4.20). Sugar cane, corn, and sorghum are processed for sugar. High fructose corn syrup is a sweetener in many of our foods, including soda pop, dairy products, and canned fruits, all of which can contribute to type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance, and it is more dangerous than table sugar. Fast-growing Bamboo, with its characteristic grass-family notches, is used for cloth and flooring. Buffalo grass, Fescue grass, and Kentucky blue grass are used for lawns and landscaping. Crab grass is often an unwanted weed dug up by gardeners. Sweet grass is a lovely sugary-smelling grass, made into baskets and often braided and used as a ceremonial smudge by Native Americans.

Grasses are easily confused with rushes and sedges, which are in their own families. (Heed the quotation under this chapter’s title.) Grasses have unimpressive wind-pollinated flowers that don’t need to be colorful and showy to attract insects. The flowers usually have three stamens. The ovary has three united carpals that form one chamber. The ovary matures as a single seed that we call a grain.

Claviceps purpurea or C. paspali (Ergot fungus) can form a blackish or purplish powder on most grasses, particularly wheat, rye, barley, and oats. The alkaloid it contains can be very poisonous. Symptoms of ergot poisoning include painful seizures, spasms, diarrhea, mania, psychosis, delirium, hallucinations with effects like those of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and even gangrene. Epidemics have occurred throughout history, and bizarre behavior observed from poisonings has been blamed as a cause of bewitchment, both by the accusers and the condemned. This played a part in the Salem witch trials.8

Ergot has been used historically to induce abortions because it causes strong uterine contractions. The drug ergotamine is now used in controlled doses to induce labor in hospitals. It is also used to treat migraine headaches. Dr. Albert Hofmann, the so-called father of LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), discovered the mind-altering drug when experimenting with ergot (although there is no LSD in ergot).13 Today the ergot content of grains is regulated to 0.3% of weight. This regulation has been in effect since 1916. However, if you pick grass in the wild, be sure there is no blackish or purplish powder on it. This fungus is most likely to occur if the climate is wet and damp.

### The Rose Family (Rosaceae)

We are surrounded by the Rose family (Box 4.13). Roses are the subject of poetry and symbols of love, friendship, kings, and the Rosicrucians. The Rosaceae family ranges from plants found in beautiful cultivated rose gardens to all kinds of luscious foods, including strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, cherries, apples, plums, apricots, peaches, pears, and almonds. Many have thorns, which aid in their defense. One of the main chemical constituents of the Rose family is tannic acid, an important astringent used medicinally for discharges, diarrhea, bleeding. This characteristic is good to know about, even if you can’t identify the exact plant. You can always make a first-aid tea or poultice to stop those annoying symptoms.

Box 4.13

ROSE FAMILY. KEY WORDS: * Five sepals * Five petals * Numerous stamens (usually) * * Oval, serrated leaves *

The signature of the Rose family is five. There are five petals, five sepals, and a minimum of five stamens, and usually many more in multiples of five. The center of the flower looks fuzzy, with numerous styles surrounded by countless stamen. A wild rose has five lovely petals. Cultivated garden roses with their numerous folded petals have been hybridized for that layered look. Rose family leaves are alternate and can be simple, trifoliate, palmate, or pinnate. The single leaves or leaflets are generally serrated and oval in shape. They have stipules, which are leaflike appendages on the base of the leafstalk (with the exception of the genus Spiraea).

#### Rose Family/Rose Subfamily (Rosideae)

This family is where you find the Rosa spp. (Wild Rose) (Fig. 4.21) of high-vitamin C rose hip tea fame, Agrimonia eupatoria (Agrimony herb) used for stopping discharges, and Alchemilla vulgaris (Lady’s Mantle herb), a very important herb for control of heavy menstrual bleeding and cervical discharges. You also find the Rubus genus here, with its raspberries, salmonberries, thimbleberries, and blackberries.

Rose subfamily flowers have a domed receptacle beneath the pistils. They also have stipules, which are leaflike growths beneath the leaf stem. They have multiple pistils, each one theoretically or botanically forming its own separate fruit or seed. A raspberry is an example, being an aggregate of many tiny fleshy fruits that cover a domed receptacle. However, the wild rose has many pistils, each producing a seed enclosed in a fleshy fruit known as the hip. This is considered a false fruit. Regardless of name, rose hips are best picked and chewed on after the first frost, when they are the sweetest.

#### Rose Family/Almond Subfamily (Plums–Amygdaloideae)

The Almond subfamily, plums, includes the genus Prunus. Most produce luscious fleshy summer fruits with drupes, large throwaway pits containing a hard seed. Included are plums, cherries, apricots, peaches, and nectarines. However, the subfamily’s namesake, Almond, has a throwaway fleshy fruit and a hard pit, better known as the nut, that we open and eat. All the seeds of drupes have an almond-like shape.

Prunus has two distinguishing characteristics. One is a noticeable seam, evidence of its one chambered carpal, down one side of the fruit. The other is the source of the subfamily’s name. Prunus contains amygdalin, which breaks down into benzaldehyde (the bitter almond flavor used in cooking) and cyanide, a poison in large doses. The Sweet Almonds we eat contain very little cyanide, but Bitter Wild Almonds are quite poisonous when raw.2

<!-- chunk -->

#### Rose Family/Almond Subfamily (Apples–Amygdaloideae)

Apple subfamily members have a signature five-pointed star on the bottom of the fleshy fruit. (Rose hips have this also.) Apple-type flowers have inferior ovaries. Some are sweet; some are very sour and astringent, making you pucker up. Cultivated members are pears, apples, quinces, and loquats. The most important apple subfamily member for the herbalist to know is Crataegus spp. (Hawthorn berry, leaf, and flower), in the form of (usually) thorny bushes and trees. Hawthorn is the most used cardiac tonic herb in the West, being restorative, nourishing, and strengthening. Hawthorn belongs in almost any heart formula and is useful for treating essential hypertension, after heart attacks, reduced circulation, and arrhythmias.7 The berries are full of Vitamin C and antioxidant bioflavonoids.

### Aster or Sunflower, Daisy Family (Asteraceae)

Aster means star in Greek and is the second largest of the flowering plant families, the Orchid family having the most species of all (Box 4.14). From an evolutionary standpoint, Asters were the most recent family to develop. Worldwide, there are 920 genera and 19,000 species. Because there are so many, there is great variety in their structure. The former name for the Aster family was actually Compositae. Aster plants can be trees, shrubs, vines, or herbaceous plants. They can have tap roots or fibrous roots, be fleshy or woody, and leaves can be alternate, opposite, or whorled.

Box 4.14

ASTER or SUNFLOWER FAMILY. KEY WORDS: * Composite flowerheads * Ray and disk flowers *

The flowers are all complex, but these can be deceptive, because they do not all look like your typical daisy. Some have hundreds of flowers in what appears, superficially, to be a single flower. It took a long time for this arrangement to evolve. When we identify flowers, we generally proceed from the outside in, going from sepal to petal to stamen to pistil. For Asters, this process of identification doesn’t work. What look like normal sepals on the outside are actually bracts or modified leaves that occur in many layers under the flower heads (Fig. 4.22). These bracts have sometimes been reduced to small scales. The petals or outside colorful rays are each an entire individual flower with their own stamen and pistil. The multiple disk flowers in the middle (within the flower head) have their own individual petals, stamens, and pistils as well. They are tiny, sometimes requiring magnification to see. The sepals on these disk flowers have been reduced to a hairy pappus. Sometimes they are not even there (Fig. 4.23).

A few important herbal members of this family include Echinacea spp., Calendula officinale (Calendula flower), Achillea millefolium (Yarrow herb), Taraxacum officinalis (Dandelion root and leaf), Grindelia squarrosa (Gumweed flower), Silybum marianum (Milk Thistle seed), Solidago spp. (Goldenrod herb), Matricaria spp. (Chamomile flower), Arctium lappa (Burdock root), and Chrysanthemum Ju Hua (Chrysanthemum flower).14 Because of its diversity, the Aster family is subdivided into Chicory, Dandelion, Thistle, and Aster subfamilies, among others. Some of the subfamilies are further divided into tribes. We will address a few that are most interesting to herbalists.

<!-- chunk -->

#### Aster Family Chicory/Dandelion Subfamily (Cichorioideae)

This subfamily is characterized by strap-shaped ray petals, meaning flat, not pointed or tapered, tips. There are no disk flowers. The ray petals go to the center. The stems contain milky juice that is often bitter but edible. Herbally speaking, this subfamily gifts us with Chicory, Wild Lettuce, and Dandelion.

Cichorium intybus (Chicory root) (Fig. 4.24) is a woody herb that has hairy, alternate, lance-shaped leaves and lovely sky-blue strap-shaped ray flowers (no disks), stalkless along the stem.2 The roasted and ground roots are best known as a coffee substitute, if you have a good imagination. It is a liver-friendly digestive bitter, and the latex in the stems reputedly destroys warts.

Lactuca serriola (Wild Lettuce leaf) is sometimes called opium lettuce because of the milky white latex from the stems and is found in disturbed ground. It can grow up to 3 feet tall. The undersides of the deeply lobed leaves have a characteristic prickly spine (allowing for a telltale method of identification).11 The yellow ray flowers are small. Prickly Lettuce is a mild child-friendly sedative and analgesic often used to encourage sleep.

Last is Taraxacum officinale (Dandelion root), which is so important herbally that it will be addressed in detail in the basic Materia Medica (Chapter 11). As most gardeners will testify, it has a long, stubborn, thick tap root (best to gather in the early spring before flowers come, or in late fall). The root is a great liver stimulant, diuretic, and because it increases bile flow, mildly laxative. The leaves are long and slender, simple, lobed—usually with teeth—and grow in basal rosettes. They are diuretic, make a great spring tonic in tea or salads, are perfect for a liver cleanse, and its bitterness makes it an effective digestive stimulant. Dandelion’s signature yellow rays (no disk flowers) eventually become the white wind-carried puff balls/umbrellas we all know and love. The stems are hollow.2

<!-- chunk -->

#### Aster Family/Thistle or Artichoke Subfamily (Carduoideae)

This subfamily has plants with the flower heads inside a tight wrapping of bracts. Much of the plant is prickly, especially around the flower heads and bracts. Most are edible. Artichokes are a notable example where the edible portion is the end of the modified leaf (bract) that leads to the delicious fleshy heart inside. Some thistles such as the Musk, Scotch, Bull, and Plumeless are considered invasive species in the American Southwest.6

Herbally speaking, Burdock root and seed and Milk Thistle seed are important medicines. Arctium lappa (Burdock root) promotes detoxification and is used in the Western sense as a lymphatic mover; for skin problems, such as eczema and psoriasis; and as a kidney diuretic and stone dissolvent. In Chinese Medicine, the seeds of the same plant, Arctium Niu Bang Zi (Burdock seed) are used as an upper respiratory sedative and demulcent. Silybum marianum (Milk Thistle seed) is considered a prime liver decongestant and restorative, and a digestive bitter.

<!-- chunk -->

#### Aster Subfamily/Chamomile Tribe (Anthemideae)

This one is an important Aster subfamily tribe for herbalists. The plants here are mostly aromatic, and the bracts surrounding the flower head are thin, dry, and translucent. Herbal medicinals from this group include Matricaria recutita (Chamomile flower), Achillea millefolium (Yarrow herb), Artemisia dracunculus (Tarragon herb), Artemisia absinthium (Wormwood herb), Tanacetum vulgare (Tansy herb), and Chrysanthemum spp.

Matricaria recutita (German Chamomile flower) and Anthemis nobilis (Roman Chamomile flower) are used interchangeably. Chamomiles contain a huge list of chemical constituents that provide it with many uses. First and foremost, Chamomile flower is a nervine, a relaxant used in sleep teas for adults and children. It helps stomachaches and seizures and is a muscle relaxant and analgesic, making it good for headaches and muscle pains.

Achillea millefolium (Yarrow herb) looks like an umbel at first glance, so don’t be fooled. Its many tiny individual flowers have white rays with a yellowish disk that make up a flat-topped cluster, a composite. Yarrow has been horticulturally bred to have pink or yellow flowers, but those lack the strong aromatic medicinal oils contained the wild, white-flowered variety. Wild Yarrow grows all through the Rockies and has many chemical constituents (just like Chamomile), so is extremely versatile from a healing standpoint. Yarrow is foremost an astringent (one of its common names is Nosebleed Plant), but it is also cool, dry, and bitter. Its many uses are as a cold and flu diaphoretic, an antiseptic, and a styptic (it stops bleeding from wounds, bruises, and hemorrhoids).

Artemisia spp. comprise the prairie and mountains sages. (Do not confuse this genus with Garden Sage, which is a Salvia). Artemisia spp. are highly aromatic, often burned as a cleansing spiritual smudge and used as an insect repellant. There are many species with gray-green fringelike leaves, including Mugwort, Fringed Sage, Prairie Sage, Alpine Sage, and Sweet Annie. Most are antibacterial, antifungal, and antiparasitical, and all are very bitter.

<!-- chunk -->

#### Aster Subfamily/Sunflower Tribe (Heliantheae)

The flowers of this tribe generally have small bracts attached to the base of each disk flower, which you will see if you pull apart a whole disk. They smell and taste resinous. The dramatic huge Sunflower bears the tribal name Helianthus giganteus.

Echinacea purpurea (Purple Coneflower), Rudbeckia hirta (Black-eyed Susan), Arnica montana (Arnica flower), Ambrosia spp. (Ragweed herb), and Xanthium Cang Er Zi (Cocklebur) are members. So is the inulin-rich sweet Helianthus tuberosus (Jerusalem Artichoke, Sun Choke tuber) of gut-healing fame, which stimulates the growth of a healthy intestinal microbiome. This is a different plant from the common Artichoke of the Aster/Thistle subfamily already discussed.

Echinacea angustifolia, E. purpurea, and E. pallida roots are so well known, they are now endangered, having been picked almost to death. They are used as an immune stimulant to boost white blood cell count and help treat the common cold and other viral infections. They reduce inflammation and can also give relief from allergies. There are few left in the wild, so it is best to use the cultivated varieties, or substitute with other effective herbs like Rudbeckia laciniata or R. ampla.11

Arnica spp. is a cheerful daisy-looking plant with yellow rays and yellow disks. It has heart-shaped (cordate) basal leaves (A. cordifolia) and a few opposite leaves growing on the stem. The leaves are noteworthy because they smell like Juicy Fruit gum. Arnica is classic in first-aid creams. It increases circulation, decreases inflammation, and helps heal injuries. It is best used externally for bruises, strains, and muscle pain, and it is considered poisonous when taken internally. It can cause gastroenteritis unless used in homeopathic doses for shock, trauma, and sprains.1

## Keying Out Plants

After perusing major medicinal herb families, we are at the stage where we can identify a plant with reasonable certainty. A useful method is to key it out. Keys are sometimes found in field guides, and they help identify a plant. A key is a systematic method of proceeding from general to more detailed observations, using the process of elimination. It is a flow chart method that asks you to follow the dots. If it’s not this, then it’s that, so go down that path. This chapter has provided the botanical foundation for this skill of keying out a plant. To use any key (they are not all the same), you must be able to recognize basic botanical structures and make decisions. Is a plant a monocot or a dicot? What type of leaves does it have, and what is their arrangement? What type of stem? What type of flower, and how many petals? How many stamens, and what type of ovary? Knowledge of the basics of botany are necessary for this keying out process.

Different authors have their own ways to key out a plant. One relatively stress-free approach is to use plant family recognition. Narrowing a plant down to its correct family makes sense for beginners. Once a family is determined, almost any field guide can be consulted to arrive at the genus and species. Think of it as a treasure hunt. Sometimes a magnifying glass is helpful. An example of the procedure follows and is explained in greater detail in Botany in a Day by Thomas J. Elpel.

<!-- chunk -->

### A Keying-Out Process for Flowering Plants


Taxonomy refers to plant organization, Linnaeus’s seven-tiered plant classification system. The broadest grouping comes at the top of the hierarchy, and each consecutive category becomes more detailed. For an herbalist, families, genus, and species are the most important. Families are plants with similar physical characteristics. A genus consists of two or more closely related plants. The species is the specific plant name.

Common names vary from place to place, and different plants may have the same name. The Latin/botanical/scientific name is based on the binomial system. Pharmaceutical names are arranged according to anatomical features, such as fruit, leaf, or root. Chinese pinyin names transcribe plant pronunciation of the Mandarin dialect with its Chinese letters into the Latin alphabet.

Botany refers to the structural arrangements of flowers, leaves, and stems. Important plant families were described using Thomas J. Elpel’s pattern-recognition method from Botany in a Day. This knowledge helps us identify a plant and determine its medicinal characteristics. Keying out is a plant identification technique that uses the process of elimination to narrow down a vast array of plants to the correct one.

# Wildcrafting, Preparation, Storage, and Purchasing

“In some mysterious way woods have never seemed to me to be static things. In physical terms, I move through them; yet in metaphysical ones, they seem to move through me.”

—John Robert Fowles, Writer and Teacher 1926–2005

Wildcrafting

What does it mean to get out there, search, identify, wildcraft, forage, collect, gather, and procure our own medicinal plants? We will consider the proper attitude for this endeavor, where to go, when to go, and how to go. The tools of the trade, methods, and times of year to collect roots, herbs, and barks are important. We’ll look into the drying and storage of herbs and their shelf life. The importance of conserving our resources and conscious gathering is crucial. We’ll investigate herbal commerce, ways to procure herbs commercially, and how to judge quality from stores, companies, and growers.

<!-- chunk -->

## Out in the Wild

It is one thing to know about herbs on an intellectual basis by reading about them in books. It is quite another type of knowing when we get out in nature and meet the plants, take a few home, and do something with them. Preparing a remedy, smelling and tasting the finished product, and having it actually help or cure someone is very exciting, the ultimate herbalist’s experience. Both kinds of knowledge are important, and well-rounded herbalists learn with their heads, hands, and hearts.

Before you make any type of herbal preparation, you need to have the herb, of course. Herbs are our allies, our healing friends. Herbs can be bought from herb companies, a sometimes-frustrating endeavor, unless you like going through lists and wondering about the freshness of the Raspberry leaf listed in a catalog. How long has it been sitting in a warehouse? What is the quality? It is much more fun to go out in the wild and meet the plants when you can. Sit with them. Meditate. Ask its name, its song, its healing energies. Is it male or female or both? Ask what it can do for you. What can you do for it? Is this the time to gather? Should I wait till fall? Will midsummer do? Do I have permission? Perhaps not.

We are visitors in the Green House and must enter and leave with respect and gratitude. An offering of tobacco or a prayer of thanks is the respectful way of native cultures. We are the guests of the Green Man, an ancient pagan symbol and nature spirit personified as a man. He is often seen on medieval churches in the British Isles and throughout Europe depicted with sprigs of leaves and acorns forming his hair. His earliest images date back thousands of years, well before the Roman empire (Fig. 5.1).

<!-- chunk -->

### Conscious Wildcrafting

Wildcrafting is the mindful gathering of wild plants, the ultimate field trip. It implies going out into the backyard, the empty lot, the woods, the mountains, the fields, the creek-side, or the riverbank with intention.

What to wear and/or bring in your car:

You will accumulate your favorite implements as you go along. Mine is a Japanese hori-hori, which means dig, dig. It is strong-handled and multipurpose. The handle won’t bend, as has happened to many a spade (Fig. 5.2). It is great for digging, cutting, scooping, and measuring dirt depth. It means I don’t have to drag along a whole arsenal of tools when one does so many jobs. In addition to these tools, don’t forget a camera. Take pictures of the precious plants and label your pictures for later reminders.

Wildcrafting means being conscious and practicing sustainable wild collection. It means gathering only what you need. A year’s worth is reasonable. It means leaving the large grandparent plants and the children alone and taking only some of the healthy, mature adults so the stand will propagate and thrive next year. Leave the children to grow and the grandmothers to take care of them. James Green says 10% to 20% of a native plant community is the limit.1 Michael Moore says one-third.2 It means going to different places each year and not depleting a stand on your favorite hill, so the plants have a chance to regenerate. It means that after you’ve finished, all holes are filled in, branches and ground cover are replaced, and your tracks and traces are invisible. Leave a good number of leaves, fruit, or seeds on the plant and ground for next year’s growth. It means leaving a site in better condition than when you came. If there is trash, pick it up. Be a steward of the earth. Tread lightly. Wildcrafting consciousness entails looking ahead to the seventh generation to ensure a continuation of our botanical gifts for our children and theirs.

Plant identification (Chapter 4) is of course a must. If you are planning to make medicine, please ensure you actually have what you hope you have. Know your basic plant families. Bring along a field guide, a person who knows, or, preferably, both. (Field guides are listed in the Bibliography.) Put all anticipated tools in your car and carry only what you think you need down the trail (Fig. 5.3). When gathering specimens, paper recycled bags or cloth bags are better than plastic. The plants need to breathe and not sweat and rot before you arrive home. Baskets with handles are lovely.

<!-- chunk -->

## Harvesting

Be mindful. Harvest in unpolluted areas only, and at least 50 to 100 yards or more away from a road. That’s about a football field length. No car fumes allowed. Do not harvest downstream or downwind from polluted areas. Stay clear of areas sprayed with pesticides. Stay away from parking lots, public parks, fertilized lawns, high-tension electric wires, and high-voltage power lines. Those places and structures are bad energy. (Also, avoid putting chemicals on your own lawn.) Always obtain permission before helping yourself to plants on privately owned land. Most owners are more than happy for you to remove so-called noxious, invasive plants, such as St. John’s wort or various thistles, but maybe not others. If you want to harvest from Bureau of Land Management (BLM) areas, you are required to obtain a free use permit. The BLM and U.S. Forest Service also prohibit harvesting from campsites, picnic areas, and roadsides. (These areas are probably polluted anyway.)

<!-- chunk -->

### When to Harvest Various Plant Parts

In general, it is best to gather plant medicine when the energy peaks in the part you need. This timing varies. The herb, meaning the upper aerial aboveground parts like the leaves, stems, and flowers, are best collected in late spring and summer when their plant energy is traveling upward to nourish the upper parts. Roots mature in the fall after the flowers and leaves have died off. The energy is then going downward to nourish the grounding roots, so that’s their time. Seeds also are gathered in the fall when they are fully formed and dry.

Moon phases can also be considered. During the waxing moon between new and full, the moon appears larger, tides are high, and the gravitational pull is going up and away from Earth. Plant energy, too, is moving toward the top of the plant. Consequently, this is an ideal time to harvest aboveground aerial parts. Conversely, between the full and new moon as the moon wanes and appears smaller, the tide is low, and the Earth energies are moving downward and inward. This is the time to harvest underground parts, such as roots and rhizomes.3 The Old Farmer’s Almanac is published every year and provides extensive detail on the why’s, when’s, and where’s of this type of planning and planting.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fresh Herbs

Fresh herbs are lovely and vibrant, and they can be potent medicine. St. John’s Wort is one of those for which, when tinctured fresh, there’s no comparison. It should turn the alcohol or the oil a deep beautiful mahogany red color, which is caused by the hypericin and pseudohypericin content leeching out into the alcohol.4 That’s how you know its good medicine. If possible, put fresh herbs up for tincture right away out in the field. The famous late herbalist and teacher Michael Moore used to take his students on 2-week camping/wildcrafting excursions. He always kept a supply of alcohol and jars in the back of his truck, so herbs could be prepared and tinctured fresh on the spot. For each of his listed herbs, his field guides have a collecting section that gives explicit, useful gathering tips.

If you’re not a Michael Moore type and can’t tincture herbs in the field, it’s time to get on it as soon as you bring them home. A fresh herb sitting around in a plastic bag, even overnight, starts to spoil. If you can’t get to it that same day or evening and want it to stay fresh, put it in the fridge overnight in a paper bag and process the herb the next morning. Fresh herbs are always tinctured in a 1:2 proportion (Chapter 7). This means one-part herb to two-parts 95% to 100% alcohol. No water is added because fresh, undehydrated herbs are already filled with water. In my experience, if you are lucky enough to have a freshly tinctured, wildcrafted herb, it makes superior medicine over the store-bought variety. The plant is bursting with life, and it is imbued with your personal vibes, joy, communion, knowing, and sweat. You know her, and she knows you. That is powerful medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Preparing and Drying

You now know when to go out there and find the plant, but then what? Either you consume it right then or not. Consumables could be a raw nibble or a cooked edible. Possibilities for on the spot consumable wild foods are a salad with Miner’s Lettuce leaf, Wild Onion bulb, Wild Oregano, Watercress leaf, and (well-washed) Yucca flowers. Purslane can be cooked as a potherb; berries can be picked or gobbled up. A fresh Peppermint or Nettle leaf tea could be brewed over a fire.

The herb might be used for field first-aid purposes, such as a Plantain leaf poultice to stop an itchy bite or staunch bleeding, or Yarrow herb to disinfect and also stop a bleeding wound. The herb could be tinctured immediately at the back of your car or on a picnic table. Alternatively, you might choose to dry it and prepare it later.

If the plan is to dry the plant for later, the goal is to dry a freshly harvested plant in such a way that it will closely resemble its living component in color, texture, taste, and smell. This implies beginning the process as soon as possible. If they are dried too fast or with too much heat, herbs start to cook and lose potency due to breakdown of enzymes. The leaves turn brown, and flower colors become dull. Sunny yellow Calendula blossoms should still look sunny and yellow when dried. If they stay closed up in a bag for too long, the plant will cook, rot, mold, wilt, or lose its vitamins.

<!-- chunk -->

### Shelf Life

If dried too slowly, a plant could deteriorate. Even when properly dried and stored, herbs last about a year before the essential oils dissipate, and they lose their potency. Denser roots and barks have a longer shelf life—a year or two, sometimes more—and retain their zest and aroma longer than delicate leaves and flowers do. If you purchase dried herbs commercially from a health-food store or herb shop, open the jar and smell and taste a sample before you buy. You must sort through your own personally dried stash periodically as well, to assess potency, using all your senses and intuition. If the herb has lost its vitality, put it in the compost container. That’s why you shouldn’t harvest more than needed for about a year. Tossing out those herbs you worked so hard to gather can be wasteful and painful, for you and for the plants and their relatives.

Furthermore, check your herb jars routinely to ascertain freshness, and ensure no moisture has been reabsorbed. The same goes for culinary spices in the kitchen. A rule of thumb for dried herb longevity: leaves, greens, and flowers generally keep for a year; roots, seeds, and barks, 2 to 3 years. Broken, powdered, and crushed herbs lose potency much faster than whole, uncut herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Drying Methods

Drying methods include hanging a small herb bundle upside down, using a flat basket, a drying rack, a dehydrator, an old ladder, a plastic screen, or anything you can dream up that will allow the air to circulate all around the plants. Herbs can look lovely while drying, and it is hard to resist taking a picture or two (Fig. 5.5). The parts shouldn’t touch, or the herbs can get mold, bugs, or rot.

<!-- chunk -->

### Garbling

Make sure the plant is completely dry. Leaves and flowers should crackle and crumble beneath your fingers; twigs and stems should snap, just as you might have learned in your early fire-building attempts. Roots are dry if you can slice through a thick one and find no moisture. I have been fooled with Rose hips. They seemed shriveled, hard, and dry when I bottled them. Two weeks later, said hips were covered in mold. Obviously, they were not dry enough. Some of this process is trial and error.

Once a plant is dry or during the drying process, the plant is then garbled. This means sorting out and inspecting the dried plant material to remove what shouldn’t be there. It includes removing twigs, stray grasses, bugs (dead or alive), and decayed parts of the plant (look for browns, blacks, mold, and moist areas). Everything goes except the beautiful dried plant of the appropriate color.

<!-- chunk -->

### Storage

Keep herbs out of heat, light, and moisture, because heat and light cause the breakdown of oils and constituents, and moisture can cause mold and rotting. Plastic jars are not the optimal choice; some of the chemicals can leech out into the plant material. So very clean, clear, or better yet, brown glass jars with tight lids are ideal. These containers can be recycled or new. Save canning jars, jelly jars, fancy Italian glass jars, or old mayonnaise jars. Clean coffee cans with plastic lids are ok. If you don’t want the herbs on display, keep in a brown bag or zip-lock bag in a dark (not clear), plastic storage bin. I’ve had dried herbs keep very successfully in the latter, out in a cool, dark garage.

Labeling the jars, bags, or other containers is paramount. Always list the collection date, botanical name, common name, and place of origin. “Place of origin” means, if wildcrafted, include where collected. If purchased commercially, include company name and lot number. It is a good idea to put the label on the jar, not on the lid. This might seem obvious, but it is easy to mix up lids when opening a few jars at a time.

<!-- chunk -->

## Buying Herbs Commercially

We should be just as picky about the dried herbs we purchase from an herb company or health-food store as we are about our own personally harvested plants. Ideally, they should first look green and fresh in the jar. If that jar of Hyssop herb looks like chopped up little pieces of ancient uniform brown matter, what viability could be left in the plant? If the jars are clear glass sitting on sunlit shelves, I would question the freshness, unless that store has a frequent turnover of products. Check the date on the herb jar. Dated products are ideal. If a flower has been sitting there for a year, it’s too old. Ask to see a sample. Rub some leaves together, smell them, and then taste a little. There should be a distinctly herbal scent, and the taste should be distinct and strong—maybe not delicious, but present.

Similarly, follow much of this process if ordering from herb companies. If you do not know the reputation of the company, start with a very small order. Look online for reviews. Ideally, you want to order from a reputable firm, such as Mountain Rose Herbs or Starwest Botanicals, or, for Chinese herbs, the importer Mayway. When you receive the herbs, examine them carefully. The herbs, when received, should have good color, correct taste, and be marked with the date received or harvested and lot number. Obviously, it’s best to get the current year’s crop, which likely hasn’t been sitting around too long. Consider the place of origin. Frontier Herbs, for instance, offers Wormwood from Bulgaria and organic Wormwood from the United States. Which do you think is fresher? Compare notes with other herbalists. Herb companies usually sell by the quarter pound, half pound, pound, or greater. The more you buy, the cheaper it is. Try not to purchase more than you can use up in a year or so, or split a bag with an herbalist friend. Otherwise the unused herbs will lose potency.

### Herb Farms and Cultivation

As herbals become more and more popular and the number of herbalists grows, it is increasingly important to obtain plants from herb farms and herb companies that cultivate their own. Our wild plants are not in unlimited supply, and sustainability is important. We must become stewards of the Earth. Frontier Herbs in Iowa cultivates Echinacea root and American ginseng root, among others. Limited availability has already happened with Echinacea, Goldenseal, Ginseng, Black Cohosh, Lady’s Slipper, and Pipsissewa. Every year, more plants become endangered. Now, even the common Dandelion (Taraxacum officinalis) is being cultivated and coming to market from well-established certified organic farms in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.5 If you stop using weed killers on your own yard, after 3 years you can count on your own unlimited crop of organic Dandelion.

It is always lovely to support local growers in your area. Perhaps you can visit and inspect their crops! That can become an adventure in itself. Perhaps you would like to become an herb cultivator. What a joy to grow some of your own herbs if that is your bent. Even a little pot of Peppermint for tea and spice is worth having on a balcony or kitchen windowsill. At least you will know where it came from and how it was grown.

The best way to be successful when growing herbs is to duplicate their favorite environments as much as possible. This environmental compatibility includes soil type, climate, shade or sun, water requirements, how and when to plant, and how well the plants take to being cultivated. Obviously, you’ll have more success with a plant that grows naturally where you live than trying for a moisture-loving woodland plant if you live in Arizona. Ligusticum porterii (Osha root), for instance, likes to grow in the Rockies at around 8,000 feet in montane to subalpine elevations. Attempts to grow it in Denver are most often unsuccessful. On the other hand, endangered American ginseng root, which grows naturally in moist Eastern forests, has been cultivated successfully by Frontier Co-Op, a Midwestern herbal company in Norway, Iowa. If you are not experienced, start with a candidate that enjoys your home conditions.

Horizon Herbs is a seed catalog company that sells non-GMO organic medicinal seeds and plants, including hard-to-find Chinese Ephedra Ma Huang (Ephedra stem), Arnica montana (Arnica flower), Sambucus nigra (Elderberry berry), and Actaea racemosa (Black Cohosh root). The company has a catalog with very cheerful and helpful growing tips, phone support, and an extensive website.6 Common and very unusual Western, Chinese, and Ayurveda herbal seeds are available. Not hybrids, but the real thing. Just looking through the catalog will make you dream of spring.

If you must have a fresh herb and it’s not in your backyard or the back forty, there are herb companies that will ship fresh herbs overnight from their own farms. One such company is Pacific Botanicals in Oregon. You have to order in advance, well before planting and when their crop is harvested (a variable date). They immediately notify you and ship it out. Just don’t be out of town and return to find a carton on your porch containing a bunch of melted ice, rotting plants, and soggy plastic! There are many possibilities. The quest for high-quality herbs can get very interesting.

## Wildcrafter’s Information Sheet

Table 5.1 shows a sample sheet that you are free to copy and use for your wildcrafting records. This form may be modified in any way to accommodate need. It is very good to keep track of where you found plants. It is surprisingly easy to forget which trail, Arnica hill, or Aspen grove you visited or become confused about where the Hops or the Vervain that you saw last month (not to mention last year) originated. Occasionally, give an area a rest and find a new place to go the next time, so one spot is not wildcrafted and loved to death. Keeping records helps you to remember these details. It is also helpful to go back in your notes to see how you processed a given herb and whether it worked out well. No use reinventing the wheel. In addition, if last time was not very successful, you won’t repeat the process. Do some research. Try something new.

## Herb Walks, No Collecting

There is great joy in walking, exploring, and being, with no taking involved. A walk through the fields or woods with your trusty camera or herb pal is uplifting and educational. A pocket guide for your area, or a good herb plant identification app is a plus. Recall your basic herb families and how to key out a plant (Chapter 4). If you’re not sure of a plant, take a picture, and look it up later. Label the picture as soon as you know. I personally have certain plants that I see again and again and just draw a blank every time. Sometimes your friends can jog your memory and you theirs. Another tactic is to visit a local botanical garden if you are lucky enough to have one close by. The plants there are often labeled with common and botanical names, so you can quiz and check yourself. It is a wonderful way to conduct a self-guided tour. Also, check out the same plants at different times of the year, and learn to recognize their early spring leaves, summer flowers, and fall seeds or pods.


Gathering herbs in the wild is called wildcrafting. Proper attitude and respect must be given to the plant, the environment, and the ecosystem. Collect only what you will use, doing so consciously. Tools needed in a seasoned herbalist’s car could include a small shovel, hori-hori, collecting bags, and a good knife. Keep what you need in the car because you never know when you may find herbs, but don’t carry all your tools down the trail. A few good field identification guides should always be handy, to make sure you have what you intend.

Knowing the proper time of year and season to collect assures good quality. Generally, herbs and flowers are gathered in early spring and summer; root and seeds are gathered in the fall. The moon phases and time of day are factors. There are pros and cons of fresh versus dried plant preparations. Fresh is generally best. Always follow recommended methods for drying and safekeeping.

Purchasing our herbs is perfectly acceptable and becoming more and more necessary as availability of wild stands decline along with our other natural resources. How do we judge quality when purchasing botanicals? Consider their source, when, where, and how collected, any cultivation methods, and the reputation of the company. The best judge is your senses. Smell and taste a sample, if possible, to evaluate freshness and vitality. Herbs should be stored in cool, dark places for best shelf life. A quality product will result in a good remedy. Have fun discovering new and reputable herb sources and support your local growers.

# Types of Herbal Remedies

“This large and expensive stock of drugs will be unnecessary … the common resources of the lancet, a garden, a kitchen, fresh air, cool water, exercise, will be sufficient to cure all the diseases that are at present under the power of medicine.”

The numerous and varied herbal preparations are identified and explained with their pros and cons, along with guidance for how to choose among them. Some types, like vinegars or electuaries, have gone in and out of fashion, but tinctures and creams are very important for the modern herbalist.

The hope is that experimentation with basic herbal medicinal teas will begin early on in your studies. Teas should first be made as simples (one plant only), and then in blends. Teas are a good way discover a plant’s properties and to discover how it tastes and reacts in the body.

It is also hoped that other easy preparations will be tried—external applications like poultices, compresses, steams, baths, and gargles. Complex herbal medicine-making appears in Chapter 7.

<!-- chunk -->

## Types and Uses of Various Herbal Preparations

Countless types of preparations can be made with any given plant. Proper choices depend on therapeutic intention, what a client is willing or able to actually ingest, and the extraction method appropriate for a specific plant. For example, very mucilaginous plants, such as Marshmallow root or Slippery Elm bark, are best extracted by cold water. A plant high in volatile oils might also do best in a cool oil extraction form, because heat breaks down the aromatic quality. Plant proteins (albumen) also like cold water better because heat makes them coagulate, just like an egg white. Hot water preparations are best for herbs containing starch. Others do better with alcohol, and some need both. Gums and sugars do well in either.1

Types of preparations might include a sweet syrup for a child, a syrup to soothe a cough, a strong alcoholic tincture for a bad infection, a hot tea to sip (infusion or decoction), a topical first aid cream, a glycerite (a sweet viscous fat extracted from plant oils) for someone who cannot ingest alcohol, or an herbal vinegar to give away at the holidays. Herbs can be dispensed to be used topically, internally as tinctures, in glycerites or capsules, in baths as hand or foot soaks, as an anal suppository, or for inhalation as steams. It is very useful for herbalists to learn the art of herbal preparations and to recognize situations where one particular type of remedy is appropriate over another. Ready-mades can be quite expensive, and the quality could be, perhaps, lacking. It all depends on your time, desire, and budget.

### Considerations for Preparation Choice

<!-- chunk -->

## Infusions and Preparation Instructions

An infusion is a preparation of a plant part steeped in hot water and the most basic way of brewing a tea. It is standard for preparing lightweight plant parts, such as dried leaves, seeds, flowers, and stems, by letting them stand in hot water for 10 to 20 minutes. A ready-made tea bag immersed in a cup of boiling water creates an infusion. The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) has its own particular proportions and infusion methods, and the British Pharmacopeia (BP) has its own versions. There are various folk ways and variations among them, including the elaborate tea-making rituals in Japanese tea ceremonies. Learn to prepare teas first as simples, then in blends. It’s a good way to discover a plant’s properties and how it tastes and reacts in the body.

Infusions are used for water-soluble herbs. The plant material can be dry or fresh. If dry, less herb is needed by weight because its dehydration makes it stronger. If fresh, more plant is required by weight because of its higher water content. For fresh herbs, generally use twice the weight of the dried form of the same plant. Medicinal teas are stronger-tasting than a standard commercial tea bag because more plant material is required for a therapeutic effect. If an herb (like Goldenseal root) is very bitter, use less. If strong and intense, like Cayenne fruit, use only a pinch. Mild-tasting, light, and fluffy plants, like Raspberry leaves, require more plant material.

## Decoctions and Preparation Instructions

A decoction is a standard method for preparing hard plant parts, such as dried roots, barks, twigs, and some seeds, using prolonged simmering for 10 to 20 minutes. This method is good for the tougher constituents found in roots, such as resins and tannins.2 Rather than steeping, the herb is simmered in water to draw out constituents that would not be coaxed out by infusion.

To decoct means to boil down or boil away, so it is the chosen method used for extracting herbals that are then used in fomentations, syrups, and enemas. Decoctions would not be used for mucilaginous herbs, such as Slippery Elm bark and Marshmallow root, or for herbs with delicate volatile oils, such as Mint herb, Hyssop herb, or Fennel seed. Decoctions are not for resinous plants, such as Gumweed flower or Yerba Santa herb, or for delicate flowers like Rose buds or Elder flowers.1 Save decoctions for plants not easily injured by heat, like Wild Cherry bark, Fenugreek seed, Licorice root, Astragalus Huang Qin (Astragalus root), or Sarsaparilla root.

Decoctions are traditional preparations in Chinese Medicine. Oriental medical doctors give their patients strong raw and dried herbal mixtures in paper bags so they can prepare them at home. The instructions are very specific, often complicated. One should use enamel, crockery, or glass pots, not metal; metal can adversely affect the herbal ingredients. Decoction time and methods used are important. Patients can spend an hour or so cooking up a tea, smelling it, and then sipping it, all part of the healing experience. Decoctions are often prescribed for long-term therapy for chronic illnesses lasting a few months.4 In many Chinese hospitals, a daily decoction is prepared each morning and delivered to the patient’s bedside in a thermos.

<!-- chunk -->

### Decoction Directions

All the above tea preparations—hot herbal drinks infused in just boiled or boiling water in one way or another—are classic ways to make medicine, probably the most ancient herbal delivery system of them all. For more information on tea, refer to Box 6.1.

Box 6.1

Tips for Herbal Teatime

If you are making a tea with roots and flowers, do you infuse or decoct? Do both. First simmer the roots separately for 10–15 minutes, remove from heat, cover, and then add the leaves to steep for about 10 minutes more. At the end, strain it all.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tea and Honey

The World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics say not to give raw or unpasteurized honey to children under 1 year old because of rarely occurring infant botulism toxicity. Botulism is caused by botulinum toxin, a natural poison produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. Honey is almost always raw and seldom, if ever, heated or pasteurized. Doing so would destroy all its healthy vitamins and enzymes. The reason for caution is the concern about botulism spores being present in some soils in which bee-attracting plants grow. If the bee pollinates those infected flowers, they could carry the botulism spores to their hives, thus contaminating their honey.6

Older children and adults can tolerate the small amount that may be present due to having more mature, acidic stomachs that counteract the botulinum toxins. Babies haven’t matured to this point, so for them, botulism toxicity could be serious. Signs of botulism in babies include lethargy, poor feeding, constipation, weak cry, floppy muscle tone, facial weakness, and impaired gag reflex. Therefore, it is best to err on safety’s side. Substitute sweeteners for the little ones are maple syrup, rice syrup, or vegetable glycerin. Of course, many cultures past and present have fed and do feed their babies honey from birth with no ill effects. Perhaps this toxicity is a result of our more polluted soils.

## Mouthwashes, Gargles, and Preparation

For mouthwashes and gargles, use double-strength herbal infusions or decoctions and rinse mouth and/or gargle the back of the throat. Sometimes a gargle is used for bad breath caused by eating garlic or onions, but if a person has persistent, chronic halitosis, she or he should see a dentist or doctor. Reasons for bad breath include local tooth or gum infections, dry mouth, poor oral hygiene, or systemic problems, such as kidney or liver problems, acid reflux, or chronic respiratory conditions, like bronchitis, pneumonia, and postnasal drip. Many excellent uses for gargles are listed below and are mainly used for acute conditions.2

<!-- chunk -->

## Steams, Smokes, Baths, and Preparation

<!-- chunk -->

### Steams

A steam refers to breathing in the vapors of an herbal infusion high in essential oils. As the medicated steam is inhaled, it coats the mucous membranes of the upper and lower respiratory passages. Steams are simple to make. Boil water in a small stainless-steel saucepan and remove from heat. Then add 4 to 6 drops of essential oil. Alternately, make an infusion with the herbs. Set the pan on table with a hotplate underneath, sit down, and cover your head and the pan with a towel and inhale the volatile oils for 10 to 15 minutes, 2 to 3 times daily or more, as needed.

A vaginal steam is a partner of the steam inhalation. Here a bowl of relatively hot, steamy, medicated water is placed on the floor, and the client squats over it for a few minutes, allowing the volatile oils to medicate the perineum. This treatment can soften and relax the pelvis and cervix during the last 2 or 3 weeks of pregnancy, relieve spasms from kidney stones, or relax and relieve menstrual cramping.

There are many situations and signs and symptoms in which steams would be a wise remedy choice. This list provides a few ideas to add to your arsenal with appropriate herbs and essential oils for each case:

<!-- chunk -->

### Smokes

Smokes are the therapeutic smoking of dried, relaxing herbs and blends. They can provide immediate temporary relief from tight respiratory conditions. Indulging in herbal smokes every day can be hot and irritating to the lungs, but occasionally, about 6 to 10 puffs from a pipe will relieve tightness. Although smoking may seem counterintuitive to lung relief, the herbs used here have a relaxing effect.

Make a blend. Mix chopped herbs with some honey and water, lay out to dry, and then store in a beautiful airtight tin. Adding at least 10% Coltsfoot herb ensures a good burn.2 Herbs that work well for coughs, bronchial congestion, and asthmatic breathing are Coltsfoot herb, Mullein leaf, Lobelia herb, Nettle herb, Lavender herb, and Elecampane flower. For wheezing, try Catnip herb, Mullein leaf, Hyssop herb, and Lavender herb.

<!-- chunk -->

### Baths

Therapeutic baths are the immersion of the body or a body part in hot, warm, tepid, or cold water with or without the addition of herbs. Therapeutic use of water is called hydrotherapy and has been used for centuries. Hot mineral springs were considered sacred sites, where American Indian tribes would gather in peace, regardless of politics or states of war. The Baths of Caracalla were public baths used in ancient Rome. Scandinavian saunas employ moist or dry heat followed by plunges into cold water. Simple baths are, first of all, cleansing and relaxing. A plain un-medicated bath following a long, stressful day is therapeutic in itself. Other functions of bathing are to draw out toxins; restore and revive; relieve tension from the head, the emotions, and the muscles; reduce fever; and relieve skin burns, bites, and itches. Essential oils may be added to a medium such as Epsom salt, dry milk, or unscented bath gel before being added to the water. Otherwise, the oil will just float on the surface of the water.

Bathing in various water temperatures have different therapeutic effects, ranging from invigorating and cooling to hot and relaxing soaks.1

Baths can be used for various therapeutic outcomes and do not always refer to submersion of the whole body. Specialized types are hand and foot soaks, eye washes, and douches. Whole herbs and essential oils (or both) can be added for different therapeutic outcomes.1

## Capsules and Suppositories

<!-- chunk -->

### Capsules

Capsules or gelcaps are containers for filling and administration of dry, powdered herbs. They are usually made of vegetable gelatin. They come in two sizes: small 0 caps and larger double 00 caps. Small 0 caps are good for children if they will or can swallow one and for administering strong herbs when you need only small amounts, such as Goldenseal root, Lobelia herb, Wormwood herb, or Cayenne pepper. Large double 00 caps are better for use by adults. For amounts of dried powered herb needed for a 1- or 2-week supply of capsules, see Box 6.2.

Box 6.2

Capsule Making Machine and Amount of Dried Herb Needed to Fit in Capsules

Dose: Average adult dose is 2 double 00 caps 2-3 times daily. For children: one double 00 cap, or 2 single 0 caps 2-3 times daily. Take with juice or water, as you would any pill.

Capsules can be filled by hand. First, powder the herb finely. Mix the simple herb or the various powdered herbs of the formula together well. Take apart the capsule. Fill the bottom portion and push top half down over bottom. Alternately, there are little capsule-making machines available from herb catalogs, which are basically two flat pieces with 12 to 24 holes (see Figs. 6.1 and 6.2). Place bottom half of the capsules in the holes of one piece and the top half of the capsule in the holes of the other flat piece. After filling, the top and bottom pieces are tamped down, fitted together, and voilà, you have many filled capsules (Fig. 6.3).

Like anything else, there are benefits and drawbacks with capsule administration. From an apothecary standpoint, capsule-making can be rather time-consuming. If the adult dose is 2 capsules 3 times daily, that’s 6 a day, or 84 capsules needed for a 2-week supply.

<!-- chunk -->

### Suppositories

A suppository, or a bolus, is a single-dose preparation inserted into the rectum or vagina. Suppositories can be effectively used locally for rectal hemorrhoids or for vaginal infections. Because these orifices are quite vascular, the herb will affect the tissues it touches and also enter the systemic circulation through the capillaries to affect related parts. This is the principle of the allopathic rectal suppository Phenergan, which is used for nausea when a pill taken by mouth would cause emesis. Rectal suppositories, the best route for systemic relief from pain or fever, are easy to administer to infants and children.

To make suppositories, ground herbal material is mixed in a melted cocoa butter base to form a paste and then molded into the appropriate shape. Molds can be purchased or made from a simple foil tube. Store suppositories in the refrigerator because cocoa butter easily melts when inserted. They’re messy, but effective. Have clients wear old underwear or have them apply menstrual pads to recover leakage and protect bedding and clothing. Put a towel on the sheet. For hemorrhoids, use tightening astringent herbs, such as White Oak bark or Witch Hazel leaf. For vaginal yeast infections, use antifungals, like Pau d’arco bark, Oregon Grape root, or Creosote herb. Saw Palmetto berry and Echinacea root work for prostatitis.

## External Plasters, Poultices, Compresses, and Preparation

<!-- chunk -->

### Plasters

A plaster is a long-lasting oil-based or wax-based medication applied topically. It allows for continuous, slow absorption through the skin and is combined with internal remedies. The end product is supposed to be thick, soft, and waxy, so it will adhere to the skin. In general, a plaster base is made of beeswax, paraffin, lanolin, or castor oil that is melted together and cooled while being mixed constantly. Essential oils or powdered herbs are then added. If the herbs in the plaster are hot and irritating, oil should be rubbed on the skin before applying. A famous hot plaster is the Mustard seed plaster. Mustard is very hot and irritates the skin, acting as a counterirritant. It must be mixed with cool (not hot) water, so the enzymes stay activated. It is then diluted with cornmeal, flaxseed, or flour, so it does not blister the skin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Poultices

A poultice is a relative of the plaster. It is a soft, mushy, external application of herbs made into a paste using hot water, spread thickly on or in a cloth and applied hot to the skin. For a cooling poultice, use cool water. A poultice must be changed often and can be used repeatedly if reheated each time. Moist heat drives the medicinal properties into the skin, so they must be kept warm and damp. Herbs (best fresh) are chopped, mashed, or bruised, mixed with hot water or hot apple cider vinegar (ACV). Once it has become soft, warm, and moist, the poultice is applied to the skin. The major three herbs for poultices are Calendula flower, Comfrey root and leaf, and Plantain leaf.1 Calendula officinalis is for cleansing and healing wounds, and it is antibacterial and antiinflammatory. Symphytum officinale (Comfrey root and leaf) is the ultimate healer for wounds, ligaments, tendons, and bones. Plantago spp. (Plantain leaf) removes pain, draws out toxins from stings, and staunches bleeding.

Other than water or ACV, bentonite clay can be added to a poultice for thickening. Two parts tincture to one-part water are added to the clay to make a paste of a peanut butter consistency. Poultices may be used on the mouth, teeth, and gums to reduce inflammation, for drawing out splinters, to bring pimples to a head, and for infected sores (Box 6.3).

Box 6.3

Poultice Ideas

To Avoid the “Messy Poultice” Problem, use Two Tube Socks

Put powdered or chopped fresh herbal materials into two clean, white, cotton socks tied shut at the top. Alternate use. Place sock in bowl and pour hot water over prefilled sock to soak the dry herb or heat up the fresh herb. Knead sock until herbs are mixed and hot. Apply to affected area until poultice is cool. Repeat with the other sock, back and forth. Maintain hot applications.

Eye Poultice

The above sock method is used, substituting two small muslin tea bags. (These are available in herbal catalogs and health food stores.) Chamomile herb, Eyebright herb, Fennel seed, and Red Raspberry leaf are some eye disinfectants. Good for styes, pink eye, and irritations.

Plantain Poultice

The ultimate first aid poultice when out on the land. Boil water. Wet some broad- or narrow-leaf Plantain leaves (Plantago spp.). They grow all over the planet in wet areas. Apply and tie with bandanna or Ace wrap or gauze pad or plastic bag and tape. Plantain draws out splinters, toxins from wounds and bites. Stops pain from stings, bug bites, spider bites, dog bites, and snake bites; and soothes inflammation; and staunches bleeding. If you don’t have tape or gauze available, crush the leaves with a tiny bit of water until wet and plop on area. Messy, but it works. In the case of tick bites, pull tick straight out first. For bee stings, remove stinger by sliding edge of credit card or equivalent along skin up to stinger and nudging it out.

Honey Poultice

Put honey on a minor burn after the burn has been rinsed with cold water. Honey soothes, cools, and moistens; is antiseptic; pulls water from a wound (hygroscopic); and seals off burns from air. Alternately for burns, apply a split-open Aloe Vera leaf, gel side down, if you have one.

<!-- chunk -->

### Compresses

A compress or fomentation is composed of hot or cold water-soaked herbs applied externally with a cloth. Make a strong or double-strength tea and soak a piece of white flannel, absorbent sock, or cloth into the hot or cold-water solution. Wring out and apply lightly over the body part. Air must be allowed to circulate through the cloth, which helps retain heat. Keep moist. You may cover it with a heating pad or ice pack as indicated. Keep compress moist and change often, just like a poultice. Cold compresses clear heat, edema, and inflammation. Arnica flower would be a good choice. Warm compresses restore heat in cold conditions, such as weakness, fatigue, cramps, muscles spasms, or pain. Alternating hot and cold compresses helps bruising, sprains, edema, menstrual cramps (pelvic congestion), engorged breasts, and tumors.2

## External Salves, Creams, and Lotions Differentiated

<!-- chunk -->

### Salves

Salves are also called ointments and unguents. Salves are a semisolid, fatty herbal mixture prepared for external use and made from a wax and oil base. They are prepared over low heat and then poured into individual containers to cool (Chapter 7). The average herbal salve uses a fixed oil, such as sesame, olive, or almond, in combination with a wax, such as beeswax, which is responsible for the thickening, hardening element. The herbal component comes from essential oils or previously prepared fresh or dried macerated oils like Arnica flower, Calendula flower, or Chickweed herb.1 A balm is a salve that contains a lot of volatile oils. Examples are various lip balms that use Peppermint, Camphor, or Tea Tree essential oils for their refreshing and stimulating effects.

Body heat melts the wax in a salve, and the oil provides quick absorption through the skin. Salves melt quickly in hot cars and keep best in cooler locations. Salves do not appreciate constant alternating cooling and reheating. Medicinally, salves can cool and soothe skin inflammations such as sores, cuts, and fungal infections. Marshmallow root, Slippery Elm bark, Selfheal herb, and Chickweed herb do well for these purposes. For damp heat skin conditions, such as eczema or boils, use Calendula flower, Mugwort herb, Chickweed, and Comfrey leaf. For psoriasis, use Nettle herb or Cleavers herb. To protect and heal wounds from cuts, sprains, or abrasions, use Calendula flower, Arnica flower, and Selfheal herb. For varicose veins, use astringents, such as Calendula flower, Horse Chestnut seed, or Witch Hazel leaf.

<!-- chunk -->

### Creams and Lotions

Creams and lotions are both moisturizers that are combinations of fat and water, which will separate, so consequently need to be stabilized or emulsified. This can be done by carefully pouring the oil into the water in a thin constant stream while agitating (Chapter 7). A cream is a light oil preparation emulsified with a medicated liquid. A lotion is just a thinner, more liquid cream. In comparison with salves, lotions and creams are a bit more challenging to make because you are combining oil and water. Salves do not contain water, just fat.

Creams and lotions are used extensively in the cosmetics industry but can be herbally medicated for healthier skin care. Herb-wise, the same medicinals for salves are used in creams and lotions. Herbs can be added in tincture, hydrosol, or essential oil form. Emulsifiers may be lanolin derived from sheep’s wool, vegetable glycerin, or lecithin—fatty substances in plants and animals. Beeswax used alone is not a true emulsifier and may be used as a thickener and hardener that holds the oil-water emulsion in suspension (unless it’s left in the sun and melts in the heat).

<!-- chunk -->

## Tinctures

A tincture is an alcohol or alcohol and water preparation suitable for roots, seeds, fruits, or herbs. They are macerations (soaks) that are then strained or pressed. Like capsules or teas, there are always advantages and disadvantages. When deciding whether a tincture is the best delivery system for a client, consider the following points.

## Types of Menstruum Used as Tincture Solvents

In a tincture, the liquid solvent is called the menstruum, and the solid plant part is the marc. The word marc comes from the French marcher (to trample, as on grapes). After the marc is trampled or pressed, the final result is a tincture. Tinctures have to macerate (soak) for about 2 weeks to 1 month and be shaken daily before pressing. They are very easy and foolproof to make and turn out consistently well (Chapter 7).

A tincture’s solvent breaks down the plant cell wall by varying degrees, allowing its medicinal constituents to be released into the menstruum. Another solvent function is to act as a preservative. Solvents can be water, pure alcohol, vinegar, wine, brandy, vodka, gin, rum, or glycerin. Various solvents are discussed.

Fixed oils are nonvolatile oils of plant or animal origin. They do not contain alcohol. They are not used in tinctures but appear in medicated oils. Herbalists commonly use olive, almond, avocado, and grapeseed fixed oils to extract ingredients from a plant. The plant material is eventually pressed out, leaving behind a medicated oil that can be used by itself for compresses, dropped warm into the ears, or added to other ingredients in lotions, salves, and creams.

### Other Types of Tinctures

An extract or concentrate is a very strong tincture. An extract can be twice as strong as a tincture. An equivalent dose would be smaller, so less alcohol would be ingested. An extract is a very efficient way to administer herbs. One problem with an extract is that it is hard to make with very fluffy or high-volume herbs. Some plants, like Red Clover flower or White Horehound herb, are extremely light and absorbent and will soak up menstruum like a sponge, requiring much more liquid than would be used for an extract. The proportions sound good on paper, but don’t work in a practical herb-making setting for all herbs.

A percolation is another type of tincture. In the percolation method, the soluble constituents of an herb are extracted by slow passage of the solvent through a column or cone of dried, powdered plant that has been packed in a percolator. A favorite low tech, low investment percolator cone is an upside-down Perrier or sparkling water glass bottle with the bottom cut off. Expensive, more impressive-looking glass cones are also available from scientific supply stores. The menstruum flows down by gravity through the herb in the cone and into a collecting jar (Chapter 7). Percs, as they’re affectionately called, make very concentrated, strong medicine. They can be made quickly in 24 hours or less, whereas the standard macerated tincture needs to sit for 2 weeks to a month. Percolations do not work with resinous plants such as Gumweed flower or Myrrh resin or with fresh plants that are gummy or mucilaginous. Resins clog the cone, and the menstruum will not flow through them. Fresh plants have too much water and volume. Percs work best with finely and evenly ground, dried plant material that doesn’t expand much when moistened.

A liniment is an external, thin, medicated tincture that is rubbed or massaged into the skin. The menstruum, the liquid portion, can be vinegar, ethyl alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol. Liniments used for muscular-skeletal pain usually have a warming effect and are used for myalgia, neuralgia, numbness, soreness, sciatic pain, or muscle spasm (Box 24.4). Likely muscle pain herbal candidates are Panax San Qi (Notoginseng root), Cayenne fruit, Prickly Ash bark, Ginger root, and essential oils of Marjoram, Peppermint, Birch, Wintergreen, or Ginger. For closed injuries, swelling, and contusions, use Arnica flower, St. John’s Wort, Tansy herb, or Marigold flower. For insect repellents, use Pennyroyal or Citronella essential oil.

## Essential Oils

Essential oils are steam or water distillations of aromatic plants that are extremely concentrated and strong. Distillation refers to converting a liquid into a vapor and then condensing it back into a liquid form. Examples of plants used for steam or water distillations or cold pressing of peels include aromatic Peppermint and Eucalyptus leaf, Lemon and Tangerine peel, Hyssop herb, Rose petal, Lavender herb, Cinnamon bark, and Myrrh and Frankincense resins. Aromatherapy is the use of essential oils for healing and is a subspecialty of clinical herbalism. It can constitute an entire study on its own. An excellent reference is by Australian aromatherapist, Salvatore Battaglia.7

The distillation process for essential oils requires a lot of expensive equipment, time, and skill and is not in the realm of simple homemade tinctures and ointments. Medicated oils made in the kitchen by most herbalists are different and were described earlier. They are macerations, not distillations. Do not confuse the two. Most herbalists and aromatherapists purchase essential oils from suppliers or distilleries that do the actual production and have all the equipment for production and quality testing. Essential oils are very strong medicinally and may be used externally or topically—even internally, as long as they’re of high food-grade quality. They are also added to creams and salves in drop-by-drop amounts.

Essential oils contain potent constituents of the plants and can be highly effective physiologically as antiinfectives, antiseptics, and relaxants and for healing skin conditions. They have powerful psychological and emotional effects and are used to treat depression, anxiety, memory issues, and emotional issues. The nose leads to the olfactory bulb and the limbic system in the brain, which houses the amygdala where emotional memories are stored. When we inhale an aroma through the nose, these brain areas are stimulated.

Because essential oils are so strong, only tiny doses are needed: 1 to 2 drops at a time is a approximate amount. This dosage of course varies, depending on the particular oil, its potency, and its recommended use. For instance, Lavender is a mild one, generally safe for babies, whereas Oregano is much stronger and could burn the skin unless mixed and diluted with an inert vegetable carrier oil, such as olive oil or grape-seed oil. No matter which is chosen, it is always recommended to test a drop in a small spot (as on the back of the hand) to determine whether there are any reactions like redness, burning, or allergy. Redheads, fair-skinned individuals, babies, and elders tend to be more sensitive than others. It is best to dilute essential oils for use on babies, children younger than 12 years old, our elders, and those on heavy medication. Controversy exists on safe usage by pregnant women.

### Quality Control of Essential Oils

Quality control is an important factor when using essential oils. The cheap versions are just that, often adulterated and of bad quality, filled with artificial additives, common in the fragrance industry. This is notoriously true of Lavender, which is not always what it seems. Lavender essential oil must contain a certain percentage of the terpene linalool to be of good quality. Reliable and effective therapeutic results can be obtained only if essential oils are pure and contain the correct chemical substances in proper amounts to provide healing results. These pure varieties are often much more expensive than cheaper, contaminated versions. You get what you pay for.

The most reliable standards of essential oil quality have either an Association French Normalization Organization Regulation (AFNOR) certification from the French Standardization Association or an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) designation. These entities perform chemical analysis of essential oils and report what a given batch contains. If an oil passes AFNOR or ISO standards, it contains the correct chemical constituents at therapeutic levels. The best we have in the United States is a Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) status that comes from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Chapter 29). It issues a long list of oils considered safe as food additives and that can thus be ingested without harm.8 However, GRAS does not provide chemical breakdowns, whereas companies that use AFNOR or IOS standards can provide certificates of analysis (Box 6.4).

### Hydrosols

Hydrosols are an offspring of steam distillations of aromatic plants, the essential oils. They are an aromatic water and volatile oil combination. In a hydrosol, the process of distillation is used to separate the liquid parts (the water and volatile oils) from the solid parts of the plant. The result is a gentle aromatic water combined with a volatile oil. The smell is fragrant and delectable. Because it has a water base, it is not nearly as strong as an essential oil.

The method of making a hydrosol involves the setting up a primitive home still (Figs. 6.5 and 6.6).1 The still consists of an enameled canning pot into which the plant material is simmered; the condenser is the lid of the canning pot placed upside-down on the pot with ice on top; the receiver is a bowl placed inside the pot on a stainless-steel folding steamer-basket insert with the handle removed. This ingenious setup is easily created at home.

Hydrosols are safe to drink and may be taken internally. Incidentally, they are the best choice for use on animals; pure essential oils are too strong. They also make excellent water bases for making creams, lotions, syrups, and fomentations. Store hydrosols in the refrigerator in tightly sealed sterilized bottles. A Lavender hydrosol in a pretty spray bottle would make a glorious gift.

## Syrups

A syrup is a thick, sweet liquid that is a saturated solution of sugar in pure water or other aqueous liquid. The sugar (sucrose) acts as a preservative but must be used in adequate concentrations. If not enough is used in the syrup, the mixture attracts bacteria. If used near saturation point, the sugar in a water solution acts as a preservative, stopping the growth of microorganisms, especially yeasts and molds.1 If the sugar content reaches concentration, the sugar can crystallize as it cools, which is then very difficult to redissolve. In the days before refrigeration, this preservative quality of sugar was greatly valued. If a syrup is refrigerated, it will last longer, maybe 1 to 2 years. Syrups can ferment and spoil if the glass containers used are not perfectly clean, preferably sterilized by boiling.

Syrups are used for soothing irritated lungs, throats, stomachs, and intestines. Their absorption is gentle and gradual—good for children, elders, and individuals who are weak. They are beneficial for any inflamed conditions that reflect as dryness—dry coughs, constipation, and sore throats. Common types are herbal cough syrups (often with brandy) with wild cherry concentrate added. Elderberry syrup is classic for early-onset colds and fever. Garlic syrup is good for coughs and lung congestion. The herbs chosen for a syrup should reflect the therapeutic intention. Dose is typically 1 teaspoon as needed.


The more you try out various types of herbal preparations, the more comfortable you will become at making them for yourself and others. The best way to fully understand a preparation method is to make it yourself a few times and then to teach someone else. If you recommend that your client prepare a decoction at home, be able to provide clear directions.

Determining the type of remedy to use is based on the condition and age of your client, route of administration, intention, and degree of compliance. Often a combination of remedies works best. The most basic ones are water-based teas—infusions and decoctions.

Essential oils are highly concentrated steam or water distillations that require specialized equipment to produce. Safe usage and the need for unadulterated, high-quality products are important. Essential oils are different from simple medicated oils that are macerated at home by most herbalists. A tincture is an herb that is soaked in some type of menstruum (various solvents) and then pressed to obtain the liquid remedy. Menstruums may be alcohol, water, glycerin, wine, brandy, vinegar, fixed oil, or combinations. They extract different constituents and have varying preservative abilities. A syrup is a thick, sweet, saturated solution of sugar in pure water or other aqueous liquid. Sweet syrup bases can be made into medicated syrups, oxymels, cordials, and electuaries.

This chapter covers the basics, the nitty-gritty how-to of making advanced herbal preparations. The list includes various types of tinctures, glycerites, infused oil preparations, salves, creams, lotions, and syrups—a large project. Try them little by little, and you’ll soon have your own apothecary in the works. Refer further to The Herbal Medicine-Maker’s Handbook by James Green, a classic, practical reference for the ins and outs and pitfalls of making herbal remedies.1

Before beginning, please review the definitions and general information already covered. (Chapter 6). The steps in the present chapter can be viewed as a practical, hands-on lab. The content provides the benefits of my practical experience and that of others, complete with worksheets and record-keeping methods, so you can always refer to it and look back to see how a remedy turned out and what might be done next time to improve results.

## Apothecary Equipment

Most herbalists begin their medicine-making experiences in their school labs or at home in their kitchens, where we have traditionally worked. Eventually, this endeavor could extend into an industrial kitchen that meets health department regulations for food preparation. But first things first. Begin low tech with a few well-chosen utensils; many are already in most kitchens. If possible, reserve a separate cabinet or area dedicated to medicine-making equipment. Choose natural materials of glass and stainless steel, ceramic, unchipped enamel, and wood—no plastic. Plastic stains can leech into the herbs. As you proceed, you will accumulate a variety of favorite utensils to make your processes fun and easier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Jar Assortments

Jars and bottles are basic. They are needed to store tinctures, put up macerations, dispense remedies to clients, and hold herbs. A good place to start is the hardware store for the purchase of various sizes of wide-mouth Mason or Ball canning jars with two-part lids that have seals. Most useful are pint, quart, and half-gallon sizes. Get a case of pints (12), a case of quarts (12), and a case of half-gallons (4). All canning jars can handle boiling water. To obtain half-gallon sizes with extremely wide mouths that are useful for tincture maceration, access a commercial bottling company and order a case of six. Save and recycle other jars. Collect them in all shapes and sizes, which look very artsy, eclectic, and fun on a shelf. Just be sure they’re made of glass.

When you are ready to get a little more professional, turn to container companies. Amber glass Boston rounds that keep out light are the best options (Fig. 7.1). These come in 1- to 32-oz sizes. The 1-, 2-, and 4-oz bottles have matching droppers and are good for dispensing. The other sizes only come with lids.

Wide-mouth half-gallons with plastic lids are perfect for macerating and shaking tinctures and for storing and displaying dried herbs (Fig. 7.2). (Metal lids tend to rust.) They are generally available commercially in cases of six. Sometimes lids cost extra.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other Tools

Measuring items are necessary. Glass Pyrex measuring cups with lips come in 1-, 2-, 4-, and 8-cup sizes. Get used to metric conversions (Appendix A). The measuring cups have a side showing measurements in ounces and the other side in milliliters. This design is helpful to get a sense of equivalents. Graduated milliliter cylinders from scientific supply companies are necessary for measuring out formulas. They come in a large range of sizes and are available in glass and plastic (Fig. 7.3). The glass ones are very esthetic but break easily. While you’re still at the scientific supply store, purchase a 500-mL beaker, which comes in very handy. Add a set of stainless-steel measuring spoons.

Other practical tools are mixing spoons, choppers, strainers, stainless-steel funnels, graters, knives, cutting boards, bowls of many sizes, saucepans for salves and oils, a turkey baster, muslin cloth, rags, sponges, a box of latex or vinyl gloves, and a nice supply of zip-lock plastic bags and aluminum foil. In addition, an assortment of long-handled wooden stirring spoons is useful, and they feel good in the hands and work well (Fig. 7.4). Also helpful are large and small metal spoons. A fun place to visit is a restaurant supply store for ideas and good-quality utensils. Get a large package of a dozen chopsticks. I love chopsticks. These are invaluable for poking, coaxing, and stirring. Strainers of many sizes and meshes, from fine to large holes are invaluable. A few decent knives are important. Get a set of nested stainless funnels, small to large.

You can’t have too many stainless-steel mixing bowls of many sizes. Unbleached, natural muslin from the fabric store that you can cut to size, or white unbleached cotton dish rags, are necessary for wrapping herbs and pressing out the marc in an herb press or for twisting them out by hand. Wash the muslin or any new cloth before using to eliminate any starch or chemicals. Consider acquiring nut milk bags, which are easy to clean and nifty for pressing herbs.

Finally, purchase a sensitive scale that will accurately weigh small to large amounts. Small means a few grams. Large is 1 pound or 2. One ounce is equal to about 30 g. It is helpful to get a metric scale that converts alternately from ounces to g, and avoirdupois to metric. Make sure the scale has a container large enough to keep a pound of fluffy Calendula flowers from spilling or overflowing. That way the plant material will not fall all over the counter and floor, necessitating multiple steps of weighing, clean up, and waste.

Another necessity is a grinder. Blenders can be used to grind and blend herbs. Regular commercial blenders are marginal: the blades break, and the motor burns out with rough use and repeated attempts to grind hard roots or blend herbal oils. The recommended grinder is the tried-and-true, sturdy and unbreakable Vitamix 3600 or Vitamix Maxi 4000 commercial juicer, preferably with a stainless-steel container. The company has now replaced its stainless container with a new and improved plastic one. That’s progress. However, if you are lucky, you might locate an older gently used stainless model. If not, get a new one with the plastic container. Herb grinding may scar the plastic over time, but these plastic containers are replaceable and of food-grade quality. Also available are some grinders from China, which are available from Mayway Herbs and other Chinese companies. They are very durable and pulverize hard roots into fine powder. However, the motor has gone out on one of mine with continual use.

The largest apothecary item is the herb press. After you have laboriously hand-squeezed out a few dozen tinctures, you’ll be ready to invest. Most presses are a few hundred dollars but well worth it. There are electric ones, cheesemaker types, and other models. The one I love is pictured here and was specially designed and fabricated for making herbal medicines (Fig. 7.5).2 It is basically an indestructible hydraulic car jack that is cranked up against a stainless-steel plate until it presses out the menstruum, which then flows down a tube into a waiting half-gallon jar. This press squeezes out every last drop and works well. It also provides a little exercise.

More and more companies now offer presses. Make sure the press you purchase will hold the quantity of menstruum you generally use so you won’t have to go through repeated pressings due to small capacity. The yield of my personal home tinctures average about 750 to 1000 mL per batch (a little over 4 cups, or 1 liter). This amount fits nicely into the half gallon collecting jar.

<!-- chunk -->

### Labels

Don’t forget labels. They are a challenging project. Labels can be store-bought stick-ons, computer generated, or hand printed and cut. Some herbalists have labels made up by outside companies with pretty pictures and their logos. Whatever your source, make sure indelible ink is used, unless you think smeared writing increases the esthetic value.

Paper labels that get wet are a useless mess. When any labeled concoction is used up, the bottles and jars must be washed. The catch is that before this happens, the label must be removed. It can be a true hassle and sometimes impossible to wash and scrape off any glue that invariably sticks to the glass. One solution is not to use any glue in the first place. After much trial and error, I now center a paper label on the jar and adhere a strip of clear, heavy-duty shipping tape over it and the bottle. This makes a waterproof label that is easy to peel off when done, and no glue is involved.

When you need a temporary label during production, masking tape and a felt-tip indelible marker are very convenient options. All herb jars must be labeled (even if only used temporarily), or you will soon forget what you have in which jar.

## Tincture Preparation: Folk and Weight-to-Volume

A tincture is an alcohol or alcohol and water preparation suitable for roots, seeds, fruits, or herbs. Technically, a tincture is an alcoholic maceration. The medicinal plant is macerated, (slowly soaked or steeped) in a liquid solvent, the menstruum, for a few weeks, and then pressed out. The leftover plant material is the marc, and the tincture is the finished product. Various types of menstruums and their extraction and preservative qualities were previously discussed (Chapter 6). Menstruums are usually a combination of alcohol and water, but glycerin, vinegar, or wine may also be used. In a tincture, the job of a menstruum is to break down the cell walls of a whole plant. It then extracts, coaxes, and conjures out the chemical constituents.

<!-- chunk -->

### Wise Woman/Folk Method to Prepare a Tincture

The Wise Woman or folk method is ancient and requires no weighing and measuring. It involves putting your dried or fresh herb in a jar and covering it with menstruum so that about 1/4 inch of menstruum comes above the top of the herb. The maceration sits for 2 weeks or so, and the liquid menstruum is then pressed out. The resulting folk tincture makes good medicine, and this technique has been used quite successfully for hundreds of years.

The downside is that you really don’t know what your proportions are. If vodka containing 40% alcohol was used as the total menstruum, it implies that the tincture (if made from a totally dried herb) contains 40% alcohol: no more, no less. The remaining 60% of menstruum out of that bottle of vodka is water. You know you have a menstruum containing 40% alcohol, but there is no way to know the proportion of herb to alcohol, because nothing was weighed or measured.

Because the proportion of menstruum to herbal material in the folk method is so vague, or hit or miss, it is difficult if not impossible to duplicate or control the tincture from one batch to another. The strength of the tincture or the proportion of herb to menstruum is unknown. In these days of the FDA-mandated Good Manufacturing Process (GMP) requirements (Chapter 30), which is an attempt towards herbal standardization, the folk method is not accurate enough. When we enter into commerce, the picture changes, the plot thickens, and more accuracy is required. But for home use or in situations where precision doesn’t matter—the folk method will suffice.

### Instructions for Making Tinctures Using the Folk Method

<!-- chunk -->

### The Weight-to-Volume Method

The weight-to-volume method (w/v) is where precise amounts of herb, alcohol, and water are calculated and measured out to produce a specific tincture strength. Weight-to-volume implies that 1 cubic centimeter (cc) of water weighs 1 g. This is a 1-to-1 equality between the weight or mass of a solid (the marc) and the volume of a liquid (the menstruum). When making tinctures, this convenient fact applies to any menstruum or combination thereof, including water, alcohol, wine, vinegar, or glycerin (Fig. 7.6). The w/v method is preferred over the folk method because a precise ratio of herb to menstruum can be calculated, as can the percentage of alcohol within the menstruum.

The relationship, proportion, or ratio of the plant material to the menstruum is expressed as the weight of the herb to the volume of menstruum.1 Common ratios are 1 part dried herb to 5 parts menstruum written as 1:5 (pronounced “one to five”); or 1 part herb to 3 parts menstruum, written as 1:3 (pronounced “one to three”); or as in fresh herbs, 1 part herb to 2 parts menstruum written as 1:2. There can be other ratios. Determining the correct ratios for a given tincture depends on convention, the plant constituents, and the ratio necessary to extract the active ingredients out of the plant. The smaller the second number (volume or part of menstruum), the stronger the tincture. Generally speaking, denser plants and roots require larger percentages of alcohol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alcohol

For tincture making, use alcohol that is 95% to 99% pure ingestible ethyl alcohol. Ethyl alcohol is also referred to as ethanol, grain alcohol, or EtOH. It is not chemically possible to get every drop, all 100% of the water out of the alcohol, but distilleries come close. If pure alcohol is exposed to the air, it will absorb moisture from the atmosphere and self-dilute down to about 95%. Herbalists use 95% to 99% alcohol but round it up to 100% for calculation’s sake.

Always use the highest alcohol percent possible—that way there is no water content to worry about or factor in. Less than 95% alcohol literally waters down or dilutes the menstruum. Commercial Everclear (grain alcohol), in states where this concentration is available, is 95% alcohol—190 proof. Most vodkas are about 50% alcohol, or 100 proof. When you get into tincture making in any quantity, it is most economical to purchase 95% to 100% ethyl alcohol or ethanol directly from a distillery in a 5-gallon container. This quantity of alcohol is more than enough to get started. Don’t worry, it won’t spoil if it isn’t used up right away. Alcohol is the best preservative known.

Isopropol alcohol, known as rubbing alcohol, contains propane and is highly toxic and not ingestible. It is a good disinfectant and will extract alcohol-soluble constituents. Use this type only for external remedies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Solubility: Determining Alcohol to Water Percentages in a Menstruum

Solubility refers to the ability of a given substance to dissolve in a particular solvent. From a practical standpoint, plants with predominately water-soluble constituents need a higher percentage of water; plants with predominantly alcohol-soluble constituents need more alcohol in the maceration. For instance, plants high in tannins and mucilages do better with a lot of water, and plants high in alkaloids and resins require higher alcohol concentrations.

Solubility is influenced by heat, pH, concentration, and presence of various constituents. In general, solubility runs on a continuum.3 No plant is all water or all alcohol soluble. Plants contain many different chemical constituents, so sometimes decisions must be made as to which chemical needs to be extracted the most.

A molecule that has an uneven distribution of electrical charges is polar. It has areas of partial positive charge and areas of partial negative charge. As far as herbal menstruums are concerned, water is the most polar and is known as the universal solvent. Then comes vinegar, glycerol, and finally, ethanol, the least polar.

Substances of similar polarities will dissolve in one another. Plant constituents that are very polar dissolve well in water. Carbohydrates are highly polar and hence are very water soluble. Plant constituents that are least polar dissolve in solvents that are also least polar, in our case ethanol. Turmeric root and Ginger root have low polarity and therefore dissolve well in high-percentage ethanol mixtures (Box 7.1).

Box 7.1

Solubility of Various Constituents

Carbohydrates, polysaccharides

Tannins

Mucilages

Some flavonoids

Saponins

PA alkaloids, as in Comfrey root

Alkaloids

Volatile oils (terpenoids)

Lipids

Resins, oleoresins

Gums

Steroids4

Obviously, a plant contains more than one biochemical. To obtain the synergy of all the chemicals working together, it’s wise to extract as many chemicals as possible. For this reason, we generalize as to proportions of solvents. Alcohol and water together will extract quite a few. Therefore, we need to use both to cover our bases. The proportion of alcohol to water depends on what needs to be extracted the most and on what is needed to break down plant cell walls. Sometimes water temperature is an additional factor. Hot water or prolonged simmering heats dried plants and breaks down tough cell walls of certain plants that room temperature water cannot. Other considerations as to how much alcohol versus amount of water to use in w/v tinctures follow.

## Percolation Preparation

A percolation (perc) is another type of tincture. It is a method in which the soluble constituents of an herb are extracted by the slow passage of a solvent through a column of dried, powdered plant.1 This happens mostly by the pull of gravity. The plant is packed in a special apparatus known as a percolator (cone). A percolator can be made from an upside-down glass sparkling water bottle with the bottom cut off, or a fancy readymade cone can be purchased from a scientific supply store (Fig. 7.7).

There is debate in the herbal community as to which is better, a macerated tincture or a percolation. In my experience, percolations taste stronger, and the menstruum appears darker in comparison with the same weight of plant material in a w/v maceration. They can be made quickly in 24 hours or less, whereas the standard tincture needs to sit for 2 weeks to a month.

Percs work best with finely and evenly ground plant material that neither swells much when moistened, nor takes up too much cone room. That’s a lot of plants. Percolations sometimes require no pressing, and the marc that’s left in the cone can be discarded or composted.

Percolations do not work with resinous plants, such as Gumweed flower or Myrrh resin, because resins clog the cone, and the menstruum will not flow through. They do not work with glycerites because sticky glycerin can prevent the flow of menstruum through the cone. Fresh plants contain too much water and have a volume too large for the cone. In the end, percolations work better for certain plants, and old-fashioned macerations are better for others. Know both methods. The trend in tincture concentrations among present-day herbalists seems to be calling for stronger and stronger extracts, such as 1:3 or 1:2. Percs certainly work better for those kinds of preparations.

At first, percolation making is ideally done with a mentor or in a class setting. It is a delicate, tricky process. If the cone or upside-down bottle is packed too tightly with herb, nothing will drip through. If it is too loose, the menstruum will flow through too quickly. If there are holes or air pockets or uneven packing, the menstruum can redistribute itself, creating little streaks or rivulets without soaking through the entire herbal material. Proper and even cone packing is key. Some herbalists put a paper coffee filter inside the bottle. I prefer not. Either way, the intent is to get the menstruum to drip slowly through the plant material, dissolving out and taking the constituents along for the ride, just like a coffee percolator. The bottle is placed neck-down into a gallon or half-gallon jar (Fig. 7.8). The screw top can be adjusted tighter or looser to control drip rate. They say about 1 drip per 3 seconds is about right, to the tune and rhythm of the American song “Battle Hymn of the Republic.” Sing it slowly.

## Dual Extraction Preparation

A dual extraction, also called a double extraction, is an advanced method of making a tincture, in which a simmered water decoction and ethanol are both used as solvents. This is done because certain herbs are chemically complex and require both extraction methods to release a full-spectrum of their precious water-soluble and alcohol-soluble ingredients.

One notable herbal category that provides exemplary therapeutic results when the dual extraction method is used are the immunomodulating adaptogens that help the body deal with stressors that make us sick. Examples are Ganoderma Ling Zhi (Reishi mushroom) and other medicinal mushrooms, Echinacea angustifolia (Echinacea root), Glycyrrhiza spp (Licorice root), Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha root), Schisandra Wu Wei Zi (Five Taste berry), Astragalus Huang Qi (Astragalus root), and others.

In the herbal world, there is a bit of controversy over which step is done first—the decoction or the maceration. Recommended decoction time varies from an hour to a few days in a slow cooker. One method described by herbalist Stephen Harrod Buhner for Reishi mushroom is to make the water decoction first; next, press, reserve, and then soak the marc in an alcohol maceration. The alcoholic tincture and the water decoction are eventually combined.9

Another method recommends the reverse: first making the alcoholic maceration, pressing and reserving the tincture, and then decocting the pressed marc, which had been previously soaked in alcohol.10 Some research suggests that having a little alcohol left in the marc may partially break down the water-soluble polysaccharides that are being extracted from the decoction.

A method given by herbalist Guido Masé for Ganoderma Ling Zhi (Reishi mushroom) is a compromise. Masé suggests dividing the plant material in half. One half is decocted, the other half is macerated, and then the two are combined.13

A fourth even more complicated method is a percolating-steeping-decocting procedure that herbalist Michael Moore described for an Echinacea dual extraction. The plant is first percolated with alcohol and a portion of the total water. The pressed marc and water are then steeped for 2 hours, the marc pressed and removed, and the decoction (minus the plant) simmered down until it evaporates to the calculated amount. The completed decoction and percolation are combined.16

To determine which method is best, a chemical analysis would be required for the same herb batch with the same proportions prepared in all the various ways. In lieu of this, the subjective inspection, taste, and smell test (organoleptics) should be used so you can reach your own conclusions. In my experience, the decoction-first and the maceration-first techniques work equally well and make excellent medicine. The only drawback to either is a rather large buildup of precipitation, herbal material that sinks to the bottom of the jar of completed extraction, despite repeated straining. I have chosen to present the version in which the alcoholic maceration is done first, and decoction method is second.

## Glycerite Preparation

Glycerin is the sweet faction of a fixed oil. (Fixed oils are nonvolatile, nonevaporating fats found in plants and animals, such as olive, almond, or fish oil.) Glycerin is a class of alcohol, but nonalcoholic. Even though it tastes sweet, it is not a carbohydrate and contains no sugar. It is slowly absorbed into the bloodstream and slowly metabolized by the liver without causing any blood sugar imbalances.1 Therefore a glycerin maceration, called a glycerite, is an alternative for diabetics who cannot tolerate sugar and a treat for those who prefer it sweet. Glycerites are also good options for children’s health care, because compliance with this sweet substance is high. Sounds too good to be true.

Glycerites mix with both water and alcohol, so they may be added to finished water/alcohol extractions. Glycerin can be used in a menstruum containing water, alcohol, vinegar, or any combination of the three. If alcohol is added, less glycerin is required, because it is a weaker preservative and extractor. It does not extract volatile oils very well, as with those present in Peppermint herb or Lavender flower, and preserves them for only a short time. In such a case, more alcohol is required. Vinegar can be used in a glycerite if alcohol is not a good option. Vinegar extracts some alkaloids and water-soluble compounds, has some antiseptic properties, but is a weak preservative.

Glycerin also binds to or absorbs tannins really well. This information is useful because when a plant high in tannins (such as White Oak bark and other barks, or Rose family herbs, such as Raspberry leaf or Hawthorn berry) is combined with any alkaloid (present in countless plants), precipitation occurs, and the alkaloid is rendered inactive. A bit of glycerin included in small proportions in any formula containing tannic acid allows the alkaloids and tannins to separately do their medicinal duties.1

The downside of glycerin is that it is only a fair preservative and does better with refrigeration. When kept cool, a glycerin tincture without alcohol has a shelf life of about 2 years. (An alcoholic w/v tincture lasts for many years.) As a solvent, it works best for primarily water-soluble compounds and does not generally dissolve alkaloids. It is slightly antiseptic but less so than alcohol.1 Call it “a middle of the roader.”

Glycerin absorbs water readily from the air. Because of this, commercial glycerin already contains 5% water by volume before the bottle is ever opened. If using glycerin as the sole preservative in a menstruum, use 60% glycerin by volume to account for this.1 Remember that at least 30% alcohol (190 proof) alone is needed to preserve a tincture. So, if you use less than 60% glycerin, there needs to be some preservative-acting alcohol added to make up the difference. If alcohol isn’t an issue, some herbalists make a traditional w/v alcohol and water maceration with a little glycerin added for the flavor factor. I have noticed this combination appearing in health food stores.

Glycerite/water menstruums for fresh plants do not work very well and are a special consideration. Fresh plants already contain 50% water, and they are made in a 1:2 ratio of plant material to ethyl alcohol. Therefore, a lot of glycerin, 80% to 90% by volume, is needed to preserve the menstruum with only 10% to 20% water. That will taste sickeningly sweet for most people. It is probably best to make glycerites out of dried plants for this reason. However, an exception is a fresh Ginger glycerite mixed up in a Vitamix. It is excellent, a beneficial and delicious remedy for digestion and respiratory problems.

<!-- chunk -->

#### Directions for w/v Glycerites

Vegetable glycerin already contains about 5% water by volume. To allow for the 5% of water already in the glycerin, we need to use a minimum of 60% glycerin by volume. This provides the right amount of pure glycerin for the menstruum to maintain proper shelf life/stability and is necessary if glycerin is the only preservative solvent. If 95%-100% grain alcohol is also added to the glycerite, the total volume of glycerin can be less, since the grain alcohol makes up the difference in preservative action required.

Definitions.

Vegetable glycerin. The commercial product purchased that contains pure glycerin with 5% water.

Glycerite. The finished preparation that includes glycerin as a solvent. This is also called the yield or menstruum. It is expressed as the percentage of glycerin used: such as a 40% or a 60% glycerite.

Ratio (1:4). The weight of herb (grams) to the volume of total fluid or menstruum (mL).

Percent glycerin. The percentage of commercial glycerin to glycerite (for example 60% glycerin and 40% added water).

Box 7.5

Practice Calculations for Vegetable Glycerin Menstruums


EXAMPLE: Calculate a 1:4 60% glycerite with 300 grams dried Ginger root.

Glycerin must be 60% by volume of menstruum to maintain shelf life, since there is no other preservative.

EXAMPLE: Calculate a 1:5 60% glycerite that includes 5% vinegar with 250 grams dried Skullcap herb.

Glycerin must be 60% by volume of menstruum to assure stability, even though a little vinegar is added. Apple cider vinegar has very little to no alcohol and is a poor preservative, so we calculate as if glycerin were the only preservative.

EXAMPLE: Calculate a 1:3 40% glycerite that includes 20% ethanol with 6 ounces dried Chamomile flower.

Ninety-five to one hundred percent grain alcohol provides 20% of total menstruum’s alcohol requirement. Glycerin must provide the remaining 40% to total the 60% required preservative. The rest of the menstruum is water.

## Worksheets for Internal Preparations

The following worksheets are very useful guides for calculating and recording the internal preparations presented in this chapter. Please make copies (Appendix A). They can be placed in a three-ring binder to keep records of your tinctures, percolations, dual extractions, and glycerites. Taking notes is also useful, so each succeeding preparation can either be made the same or modified and improved on as to taste, strength, proportions, and technique. It is helpful to refer later to these sheets to see which company the herbs were obtained from and your impression of the quality and freshness. If and when you undertake GMP certification (Chapter 30), these worksheets will provide invaluable information and give you a head start recording lot and batch numbers (Tables 7.2–7.6).

## Preparing Infused Oils: Solar, Double Boiler, Accelerated Blender

These three approaches for preparing an infused oil are done by macerating or steeping fresh or dried herbs in a fixed oil menstruum, where the oil is the solvent. They are folk methods requiring no measuring. Preparation of infused oils is the first step in making many other remedies. Infused oils can be prepared into salves with a thickening element such as beeswax or be used in creams and lotions with the aid of an emulsifier such as lanolin, glycerin, or lecithin. They may be used topically as a massage oil, wound/scar healer, or moisturizer. Infused oils are not essential oils. They are much simpler to prepare. All that is needed is the sun, an herb, a jar, and a previously prepared fixed oil.

Common fixed oils used for macerations include olive, almond, grape-seed, sunflower seed, or combinations. Oils can become rancid if not stored properly. Rancidity means that the oil or fat has become spoiled or degraded due to combining with oxygen in the atmosphere, causing oxidation.11 Rancidity produces a distinctively nasty odor and taste, making it unfit for consumption. To avoid this, oils should be stored in tightly sealed amber bottles away from air, heat, light, and moisture. In other words, keep the macerated oil in the refrigerator or freezer with the jar filled to the top to eliminate contact with oxygen in the air and to minimize any condensation in the bottle. As the oil is used and the level goes down, switch to a smaller container.

There are three basic ways to macerate an oil, and all utilize a very low heat.12

All three work. I prefer the sun oil method, if time is not an issue, because it looks beautiful sitting on a windowsill or outside in the summer taking its jolly time. All of the methods utilize low heat for maceration. It is essential that the heat stays low and does not cook the herbs. Natural solar heat will be just right; the double-boiler method must be carefully monitored so as not to become too hot; the blending method warms it slightly but takes a while to build up heat. The challenge with a blender is to get the oil heated before the motor overheats or blows out. For this reason, an old sturdy Vitamix is your best bet. Heat must be present, or the oil will not macerate.

## Preparing a Salve

Salves are semisolid fatty preparations applied externally. They are also known as ointments, unguents, or balms. They can vary in consistency from thick and hard to greasy and soft, depending on the amount of thickener used. Salves are combinations of a medicated fixed oil and a wax to make them thick. The most common wax is beeswax. Often volatile essential oils are added, which contribute further medicinal action and have preservative value.

Salves can be made starting with a previously made herbal oil infusion or with a dried herb and plain unmedicated fixed oil. Oils and wax are both measured out and heated. The correct amount of beeswax must be added to a set quantity of oil to obtain desired thickness as it cools and hardens. The more wax, the harder it will be. One method to test hardening is to dip a metal spoon into the warm oil and place the spoon in a freezer. When it hardens, test consistency. If too soft, add a little more wax; if too hard, add a little more oil infusion. Basic proportions are 1 cup of infused oil to 1/2 to 1 oz of beeswax.

## Preparing Lotions and Creams

Lotions and creams are moisturizers that are combinations of water and fat. A cream is simply a thicker lotion. Because water and fat don’t mix, they must be emulsified with substances that can combine them, such as lecithin, glycerin, or lanolin, or blended together properly so they stabilize. Beeswax can be added to thicken and harden a properly emulsified cream made without an emulsifier. Making a nice lotion takes a little practice, as does making a fine mayonnaise. The water content of a lotion may be in the form of distilled water, an infusion, decoction, tincture, vinegar, hydrosol, or witch hazel. The oil or fat content may be a plain fixed oil such as olive, almond, jojoba, avocado, or grape; an infused medicated oil; a butter such as cocoa or shea; or any combination of oils or butters. A preservative is frequently added.

Lotions and creams allow the skin to breathe and don’t clog the pores. Lotions penetrate the skin faster than creams, but they need to be applied more frequently. Lotions, because of their soft, easy spread are nice for the delicate, sensitive skin of elders, infants, and children. Creams and lotions can be cleansing, softening, soothing, astringing, toning, or pain relieving.7 In general, the same herbs used for salves are also used in creams and lotions. The choice depends on the therapeutic intention.

You can preserve creams and lotions for about 4 to 6 weeks to 6 months without refrigeration, by using clean utensils, by keeping fingers out of jars, and by taking advantage of the naturally occurring bacterial and mold- and fungus-fighting qualities of the ingredients. Jojoba, avocado, and olive fixed oils, Aloe Vera gel, Tea tree essential oil, vitamin E oil, and honey already have these attributes. Other preservatives include citric acid powder, Geranium and Rosemary essential oils, Grapefruit seed extract, and Green Tea extract.

The proportions of water, oil, and emulsifier vary in lotions, depending on the specific ingredients chosen. Follow a proven recipe for starters. Then branch out. General proportions are as follows:

## Making Syrups

A syrup is a thick, sweet liquid that is a saturated solution of sugar in pure water or other aqueous liquid. It is traditionally used for sore throats and in cough mixtures, and it tastes good. Hiding the medicinal taste in a syrup helps the medicine go down. Kids love them. Syrups act as a preservative and can take the place of alcohol or refrigeration in that regard. Only permanent simple syrups can remain unrefrigerated. Syrups containing vinegar, honey, etc., are not permanent and require refrigeration.

Syrups may also contain vinegar, honey, glycerin, or small amounts of alcohol or brandy. A simple syrup is a saturated sugar solution. A flavored syrup contains pleasant, aromatic substances, such as cherry, peppermint, or blackberry. A medicated syrup contains soluble principles from various medicinal plants, such as Marshmallow root, Garlic bulb, Elderberry berry, Horehound herb, Black Cohosh root, and many others. Some syrups start from a simple syrup and are further flavored and medicated. In medicated syrups, a decoction is concentrated, simmered down to a half or a third of its original volume, and used as the aqueous element, replacing the pure water. Essential oils may also be added for therapeutic effect.1

A little sugar diluted in water spoils quickly and is a magnet for yeasts, molds, and other microorganisms. However, as the saturation of sucrose increases, the chance for these growths decreases. Simple sugars need to approach saturation but not quite reach it. If a syrup is fully saturated, meaning no more sugar can enter solution, chances for crystallization increase as it cools. The resulting crystals or precipitates are difficult to redissolve, and what’s left is a solution with insufficient sugar. This again encourages microorganism growth. Vicious circle. To avoid these pitfalls, check Box 7.8.

Box 7.8

Syrup-Making Clinical Pearls

Syrups can be made with sweeteners other than sugar. Honey, brown sugar, vegetable glycerin, maple syrup, or rice syrup may be used. Honey has antibiotic and enzymatic properties that will break down under high heat. It is a preservative as well. Generally, syrups made with these other sweeteners require refrigeration after a short time.

Advanced herbal remedy making was presented in the form of a hands-on lab. Materials and equipment needed to equip an apothecary were described.

Making tinctures includes the folk method that does not require calculations and more precise w/v techniques that do. Weight-to-volume is based on the fact that 1 cubic centimeter (cc) of water weighs 1 g. Precise amounts of herb, alcohol, and water are calculated to produce a specific tincture strength. Instructions and worksheets were provided for simple macerations, percolations, dual extractions, and glycerites. A factor in determining alcohol percentages requires knowledge of which plant constituents are water soluble and which are ethanol soluble. A handy table for this is provided.

There are three kinds of infused oils: the slow solar method, double boiler, and blender methods. They all require heat. Directions and pitfalls of making salves, lotions, creams, and syrups were provided in detail with tips for successful results.

The archetypal constituents consist of the primary metabolites that keep a plant alive. These are carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, enzymes, and chlorophyll. A plant’s secondary metabolites are not necessary to sustain plant life, but they increase its survival in the natural environment. Examples are alkaloids, which play a defensive role against pathogens and herbivores (plant eating animals), and tannins, which protect the wood in living trees from microbial decomposition and insects. Understanding the properties of these metabolites provide us with clues as to how a plant affects the body and its medicinal characteristics.

The intention is to introduce the herbalist to phytochemistry, the study of the major substances found in plants and the therapeutic properties that result. The six major categories for this understanding are carbohydrates, amino acid derivatives, lipids, phenolic compounds, terpenes, and alkaloids. Basic nutritional information becomes a natural part of the discussion.

Chemicals in plants affect the energetics of taste (Chapter 10). Carbohydrates are sweet. Tannins are astringent. Organic acids are sour. Glucosinolates are pungent. Alkaloids are bitter. Plant chemical constituents also affect the therapeutic actions a plant has on the body. Included here are the major herbal phytochemicals.

## Plant Chemistry Overview

Plants are chemically complex. There can be hundreds of constituents in a single one. Phyto means related to plants. Close to 45% of modern pharmaceuticals contain chemicals originally found in herbs. Herbs can be active medicine for the body. By understanding the basic plant chemicals, we can see how a given herb affects the body without having to memorize what does what.

Phytochemicals are compounds that occur naturally in plants (Table 8.1). They can be thought of as the active ingredients. They have specific tastes and other properties. They are responsible for plants having a mild gentle tonic effect (e.g., Nettle herb), strong therapeutic properties (Lily of the Valley herb), or deadly poisonous elements (Water Hemlock root).

## Synergy

Any given plant has numerous components, not all of which are considered active ingredients. Some work in harmony in a single plant or even in a formula to balance and modulate one another for a particular therapeutic effect. This characteristic explains why a whole herb can be safer or more effective than an isolated constituent or a single-molecule pharmaceutical or drug. There is synergy, implying that the whole herb is greater than the sum of the parts. It explains why a very mild constituent can be enhanced by other ingredients or why a strong, toxic substance is safer in the context of the whole plant than when in isolation.

Synergy is the interrelationship between constituents of a plant or formula. This coaction results in an altered therapeutic effect that we would not have had with a single substance. An example of this is the famous antidepressant herb, Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s Wort). The first ingredients ever isolated from this plant were hypericin and pseudohypericin. Later in other studies, hyperforin, hyperin, and melatonin were found to work synergistically with hypericin.1 They work better together than by themselves. Early extracts of H. perforatum had historically been standardized to a certain percentage of its assumed active ingredient hypericin—with much hype and little regard for the other ingredients. Now, the other coactive components are also included and standardized to provide a more effective antidepressant extract.

However, you can rest assured that a weight-to-volume tincture of St. John’s Wort made with the fresh flowering tops and no chemical alteration or standardization will also provide the active synergy to treat mild to moderate depression. And there may be many other substances in St. John’s Wort not yet analyzed that also add to its synergy. Many plants are far from having a complete chemical analysis of constituents.

## Definitions

<!-- chunk -->

## Phytochemistry

The elements common to all living things are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. Some plants have other elements too, such as calcium, magnesium, iron, copper, or selenium.

Single elements are atoms. These do not occur by themselves but are held together in molecules by various types of bonds. There are also functional groups, which are specific small groups of atoms that are the parts of a larger molecule. The groups are chemically active, and this is where most reactions and changes occur. Examples of these are an ester group, an amino group, or an ethanol group.

Furthermore, some or a series of atoms in a compound can be connected to form a ring. This happens most often with carbon. Carbon can form a frame or ring to which other groups of atoms are attached. Although these various molecules are really three dimensional, they are often represented graphically by two-dimensional lines or a line formula, with symbols of the atoms included. The phytochemical groups in this chapter’s figures are drawn in the two-dimensional fashion.

<!-- chunk -->

## Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are present in all living beings on the planet. Carbohydrates, a major phyto molecule, are any type of sugar made from carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (CHO). If you chew any carbohydrate long enough, you will taste the sweetness. Carbohydrates are the product of photosynthesis in plants and the building blocks of all other phytochemicals.3 In photosynthesis, plants use their light-absorbing green pigment—chlorophyll—to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose for their food. In the process, plants give off oxygen as a byproduct and thus are crucial in maintaining our atmosphere.

As herbalists, we are interested in the nutritional value of carbs and the types that pop up in herbal remedies. Humans use glucose, a simple sugar, to create ATP. This energy source keeps the heart beating, the muscles working, and the brain functioning. An adequate intake of carbs also spares proteins and helps with fat metabolism. Carbohydrates are generally water soluble—sugars and starches being examples. Dietary carbohydrates include glucose, fructose, starch, and cellulose.

Carbohydrates are classified into the number of sugars they contain. As they proceed from one sugar to many sugars, they get more and more complex and take longer for the body to break down and digest. From a nutritional standpoint, the more complex a carbohydrate, the slower the spikes in blood sugar and the healthier that carbohydrate is. Hyperglycemia, insulin and leptin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type II diabetes can result from excess carbohydrate intake, particularly from simple monosaccharides with one sugar, and disaccharides with two sugars (Chapter 27).

<!-- chunk -->

### Immunomodulating Polysaccharides (IPs)

Polysaccharides that modulate and balance the immune system—immunomodulating polysaccharides (IPs)—are a very important group of carbohydrates. These are present in most adaptogenic herbs and the medicinal mushrooms, such as Ganoderma Ling Zhi (Reishi mushroom) (Fig. 8.2). They are phytochemically complex and contain both water- and ethanol-soluble constituents, requiring dual extraction (Chapter 7) for best results.

<!-- chunk -->

#### Adaptogenic IPs

IPs help the body maintain vitality, health, and resistance to infection. Adaptogens occur all over the planet. Echinacea angustifolia is the most notable Western adaptogenic polysaccharide, Eleutherococcus Ci Wu Jia (Siberian ginseng root) is from Russia, and Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha root) is from India. Notable Chinese adaptogens, other than the mushrooms, are Lycium Gou Qi Zi (Goji berry or Wolfberry), Panax Ren Shen (Asian ginseng root) and Panax Xi Yang Shen (American ginseng root). IPs do the following in the body:

<!-- chunk -->

### Gums

A gum is a water-soluble polysaccharide secretion produced by algae and plants in response to trauma, insect attack, or infection.1 Gums are often found on the woody parts of a tree or on seed coatings in response to damage. They are thicker and stickier than a mucilage. Gums attract water molecules and become hydrated, viscous hydrocolloids. They stop other ingredients from separating out of a mixture and are therefore used as stabilizers in the cosmetic industry. Agar and carrageenan are seaweed gums used for these purposes. Gums are soluble dietary fiber that can bind to bile acids and help lower cholesterol, thereby lowering risk of colon cancer, coronary artery disease, and diabetes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mucilages

Mucilages are polysaccharides that form viscous solutions with water. The key action of mucilages occur on the surfaces with which they come in contact.5 They produce a slimy, cooling yin-generating effect that is soothing, cooling, and itch reducing. Mucilages are the demulcents of herbal fame. They act as emollients for the mucous membranes of the urinary, respiratory, reproductive, and digestive systems. They calm irritating coughs, help with urinary tract infections, and soothe stomach cramps, lesions, and ulcers. Demulcent herbs extract best in cold water. Examples are Marshmallow root and leaf, Flax seed, Purslane herb, Plantain herb, Slippery Elm bark, Comfrey root and leaf. Mucilaginous Psyllium seed husk is very fibrous and gelatinous and has a pulling and bulking action on the bowel.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pectins

Pectins are water-trapping colloidal polysaccharides found in the primary walls of most plant cells, especially fruit tissue. In solution, they create a gel and are used as a setting or thickening agent in jams and jellies. Pectins are usually found in the white material inside the rind of the fruit, notably apples, oranges, and grapefruits. Apple pectin and organic unfiltered apple juice are often used in bowel cleanses because they pull water and toxins into the bowel for elimination. Pectin has been used to lower high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels and for colon and prostate cancer prevention. It is also used in the treatment of diabetes and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and to prevent poisoning caused by lead, strontium, and other heavy metals.6 These uses are all because of pectin’s pulling action in the gut that helps with detoxification.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inulin

Inulin is an indigestible oligosaccharide. It is not insulin, so don’t confuse the two. Inulin provides soluble fiber for humans, although we lack the enzyme to digest it. However, our important intestinal microflora can and do metabolize it and use it for food. Inulin-rich gut foods are known as prebiotics. Healthy food for the gut microbiome translates into numerous happy gut flora. Maintaining gut flora is crucial in managing and/or eliminating irritable bowel disease (IBS), Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis. Many prebiotics are Lily family members, such as onion, garlic, leeks, scallions, and Blue Camus bulb.

Inulin has numerous other functions. It helps stabilize blood sugar by decreasing glucose absorption. It lowers fatty triglycerides in blood plasma by reducing synthesis in the liver, and it aids the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) by increasing immunoglobulins that boost the immune system (Chapter 18). Inula helenium (Elecampane root) is named after inulin. One of the best-known herbs containing inulin is Dandelion root.1 It helps absorption of calcium and magnesium and has anticancer properties.

<!-- chunk -->

### Organic Acids

Organic acids are derived from monosaccharides. There are many types, including the fruit acids of citric, malic, tartaric, and others such as formic acid, oxalic acid, and ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Organic acids supply the sour taste.

<!-- chunk -->

## Amino Acids

Proteins are made up of amino acids (AAs), which are one of the three macronutrients the body requires along with carbohydrates and fats. Amino acids are organic compounds that contain various numbers of amine and carboxylic acid functional groups. They are the building blocks of plant and animal proteins. In plants, amino acids are precursors, used and combined to form proteins, peptides, enzymes, amines, the sulfur allium compounds, and cyanogenic glycosides, which are alkaloids.1 In humans, proteins are needed primarily for tissue growth and repair. When proteins are digested, they are broken down into amino acids. There are 20 to 22 biogenic amino acids (biogenic means brought about by living organisms) (Fig. 8.4). The exact number is up for debate.

Essential amino acids cannot be made by the body yet are indispensable for health. As a result, they must come from food. There are nine essential amino acids: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. The other amino acids that the body does make are alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, arginine, cysteine, glutamine, tyrosine, glycine, ornithine, proline, and serine. AAs are water soluble, except the aromatic ones (phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine). Insufficient protein dietary intake leads to muscle wasting, weakness, fatigue, decreased immunity, and anxiety.

Animal sources of protein are numerous and include meats, eggs, dairy, and fish. An egg, considered a perfect food, contains all nine essential amino acids. For people on vegetarian or vegan diets, obtaining balanced protein sources is a little more challenging, particularly if no dairy is consumed. Plant sources of amino acids include whole grains, legumes, seeds, and nuts. Excellent high protein foods are soybeans, spirulina algae, and yogurt. The hulled seeds of Cannabis sativa (Hemp seed) contain all the essential amino acids and essential fatty acids (FAs) that our bodies need, making it a perfect protein supplement. Kelp contains over 12 vitamins, 20 major amino acids, and 60 chelated trace minerals.7

<!-- chunk -->

### Amines

Amines are small structures with one phenolic group or more. Histamine is an amine. It causes allergic symptoms and is found in Nettle herb stingers, discussed earlier. Another amine is ephedrine, similar to the human sympathetic hormone, adrenaline.1 Chinese Ephedra Ma Huang (Ephedra stem) is a fabulous herb that is warm, dry, and relaxing and has been used in Chinese Medicine for thousands of years to dry up mucous and to treat asthma, bronchitis, and hay fever.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sulfur Compounds and Allium Plants

Lily family plants of the Allium genus contain bioactive sulfur compounds derived from the amino acid, cysteine. We are speaking of Allium sativum (Garlic bulb), onions, and leeks. Fresh Garlic bulb contains alliin, a derivative of the amino acid cysteine. When a clove is crushed or chopped, the enzyme alliinase is released. The two interact to form allicin.1 Allicin is the pungent-smelling component in Garlic bulb that kills bacteria and fungus, and has cardiovascular and anticancer benefits. It will stay active at room temperature for about 12 to 16 hours. Most sources report that Garlic bulb is more beneficial raw than cooked; the reason is that when heated or microwaved, alliinase and its subsequent conversion into allicin cannot take place. It tastes good, but it is not as therapeutic. When using Garlic bulb in cooking, it is best to add it near the end.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glucosinolates

Glucosinolates are highly pungent-tasting compounds synthesized from amino acids, especially the sulfur-containing cysteine and methionine.1 Examples are the Mustards: Japanese Wasabi japonica and Horseradish root (Fig. 8.5). All are strong sinus openers that cause tearing and other extreme reactions. Sulfurous Mustard family foods like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts contain chemoprotective glucosinolates.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lipids

This is a complex group. Lipids are fatty, oily substances that are usually not water soluble. Some are liquid and some are solid. There are many subgroups in the lipid category: fats, triglycerides, phospholipids, steroids, and fatty acids.

Lipids provide energy, provide the building blocks for phospholipid cell membranes in plants and animals, and act as raw materials that can be converted to other substances, such as hormones. Examples of lipids include fats, oils, waxes, fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), cholesterol, steroids, and hormones. Olives, avocados, and palm berries are fatty fruits. Nuts and seeds, like flax, walnuts, and almonds, have a fatty component that provides energy storage for the plant and are healthy for humans. Note that essential oils are not lipids; they are terpenes (explained later in this chapter), but most of them will dissolve with plant oils.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fatty Acids (FAs)

The properties of fats and FAs depend on their degree of hydrogen saturation and the length of their molecules, or chain length. Chemically, a fatty acid is a chain of carbon atoms with pairs of hydrogen atoms attached and with an acid group attached to one end of the molecule (Fig. 8.6).

FAs have hydrocarbon tails that terminate with a carboxylic acid group. They are made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are many kinds of FAs. Some are healthy; some not. Research is constantly providing new information about good fats and bad fats (Table 8.2). The previously reviled saturated fats from animals and tropical oils have come back into favor with the Paleo diet (mainly meat and vegetables) and with information that coconut oil is the oil of choice for cooking, as it remains stable and does not oxidize and turn rancid under high temperatures. Olive oil is a smart fat to include in the diet in nonheated forms, such as for salad dressing; but it is not very stable when heated.

### Alkamides

Alkamides are a class of lipophilic (dissolving in fats) polyunsaturated fatty acid molecules found in Echinacea root, Prickly Ash bark, and several peppers, including Black Pepper and Long Peppercorns, among others. Some have a pungent taste and cause numbing and salivation. Notable herbs containing alkamides appear in the following list.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alkamides and the Endocannabinoid System

Discovery and research on the endocannabinoid system (ECS) began in the 1960s and is ongoing. The ECS is a system in our body, which naturally produces compounds or lignins that activate specific cell receptors and have numerous health benefits. Various alkamides interact with cannabinoid (CB) receptors. CB receptors were named after the plant that led to their discovery, Cannabis sativa (Marijuana). These receptor sites are located in cell membranes, particularly the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system, but also occur throughout the body in the organs, tissues, glands, and immune system cells.

CB receptors are ancient and evolved in primitive animals. The most well-known receptors are CB1 and CB2 found in mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. Endocannabinoids, made in fat cells, are the substances our bodies naturally make to stimulate these receptors. Phytocannabinoids are plant substances that stimulate human CB receptors. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is present in Cannabis spp. and is the most psychoactive and well-known of these substances, but other nonpsychoactive cannabinoids in the plant, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabinol (CBN), are constantly undergoing research due to a variety of healing properties, notably treatment for cancer and seizures (Chapter 24).

Dravet syndrome is a rare and severe type of epilepsy in children that is retractable or especially resistant to standard medications. An instance of the benefits of CBD treatment involved a little girl named Charlotte Figi, who was having up to 50 brain-damaging seizures a day (Fig. 8.7). At age 5 she was suffering severe cognitive decline, multiple cardiac arrests, and could no longer walk, talk, or eat (she had a feeding tube). Eventually her family heard of a particular hemp cultivar of Cannabis sativa, high in CBD and low in THC, that quiets the excessive electrical and chemical activity in the brain that causes seizures and had been found to work for Dravet syndrome.9

The family moved to Colorado, where CBD oil was legal, and she was admitted to the University of Colorado Children’s Hospital. Charlotte began taking the CBD oil there, in conjunction with some of her existing medications. Eventually (at age 6), the seizures decreased to two or three a month, mostly in her sleep, and she was weaned off the antiepileptic drugs.10 The strain was named Charlotte’s Web, after the little girl. To end this story, sadly Charlotte died in April 2020 at age 13 due to complications of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), as the pandemic was beginning to sweep the world.

Cannabis is not the only plant or substance that binds to CB receptors. Echinacea purpura has been found to contain nonpsychoactive cannabinoids. As more phytocannabinoids are identified and added to the list, the designation cannabinoid, referring to Cannabis spp., will probably create confusion. Additional suspected cannabinoids occur in broccoli of the Mustard family, Ruta graveolens (Rue herb) from the Rutaceae/Citrus family, and the substance falcarinol in carrots of the Apiaceae family.11 It would not be surprising if many more healthy fruits and vegetables join the phytocannabinoid group.

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenolic Compounds or Polyphenols

These are a huge and diverse group. There are close to 8000 naturally occurring plant phenolics, and about half of them are in the grouping of flavonoids. All phenolic compounds (polyphenols) have an aromatic benzene ring structure with two or more hydroxyl groups.1 They include coumarins, salicylic acids, flavonoids, lignins, and phytoestrogens (Fig. 8.8).

Polyphenols provide the flavors and colors of many herbs. Tastes can be bitter or sweet. Flavonoids provide yellows, blues, reds, golds of fruits and flowers, depending on the chemical makeup. Pharmacologically, polyphenols may be antiinflammatory, as in quercetin, liver-protecting as in silybin, or phytoestrogenic as in genistein and daidzein. Many are antioxidants that quench free radicals and guard against oxidative stress, as in resveratrol, found in the reddish-blue skins of grapes, blueberries, and raspberries. In general, many phenols are bactericidal, antiseptic, anthelmintic (eliminates or destroys gut parasites), and anesthetic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Salicylic Acid and Coagulation

Salicylic acid is a phenolic acid derived from the naturally occurring salicylic glycosides found in plants.1 In nature, it is the form called methyl salicylate. It is antiinflammatory, antipyretic (decreases fever), analgesic, and externally, a skin irritant/rubefacient, which can ease painful joints and even remove warts. The drug version known as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or aspirin, has an extra acetyl group added, which gives it its anticoagulant properties and consequent side effect of gastric or other types of bleeding in susceptible individuals. Its anticoagulant effect is used therapeutically to help prevent heart attacks and strokes.

Plants containing salicylic acid do not inhibit platelet aggregation, clotting, or blood thinning or cause gastric bleeds. This is an important distinction and one that creates much confusion, particularly in the medical community.

Naturally occurring methyl salicylic containing herbs are White Willow bark, Meadowsweet herb, Wintergreen leaf, Sweet Birch bark, Cramp bark, Black Haw bark, and the Poplars, including Aspen bark. Oil of Wintergreen is absorbed through the skin and is useful for arthritis. All are antiinflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic. They may be taken internally in tinctures and applied externally in ointment or liniments. Internal and external remedies used in tandem are effective for arthritic, joint, and muscle pain. Methyl salicylate is an ingredient in the external Chinese patents White Flower Analgesic Balm and Kwan Loong oil.

Salicylic acid in the form of aspirin is the basis for the enormous group of drugs that are used internally and externally, over the counter (OTC), and by prescription, some as additions to narcotic drugs. There are countless brands of plain aspirin. Other drugs in combination with aspirin include Aleve, Excedrin, Aspergum, Alka Seltzer, Percodan, Darvon, and many more. Aspirin has been in use for more than 100 years, and its exact mechanism of action is still not fully understood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Coumarins and the Clotting Issue

Coumarins are phenolic compounds that generally exist in the form of glycosides. Coumarins are found in the legume plants of the Fabaceae/Pea family, particularly Melilotus officinalis (Sweet Clover herb) and in the Poaceae/Grass family. When coumarin ferments, it becomes dicoumarol. Dicoumarol provides the sweetly fermented mowed-hay smell of cut grasses and is responsible for a strong anticoagulant effect.5 But unspoiled coumarin is not anticoagulant.

The drug Coumadin (generic name warfarin) is an anticoagulant/blood thinner used in the treatment of strokes, heart attacks, or deep vein thrombosis, conditions where blood clots are the issue. Dosage must be titrated and monitored to therapeutic levels and can cause dangerous hemorrhage in those with a history of bleeding ulcers, hemorrhagic stroke, or easy bruising. This has led to confusion among the medical establishment and herbalists. Coumadin thins the blood; but fresh, unspoiled, unfermented herbs containing coumarin are not blood thinners.

Newly mown grass or hay that has fermented in the field—and is no longer fresh—is sometimes eaten in large quantities by grazing animals. Veterinarians have reported delayed clotting times and even hemorrhaging in animals foraging large amounts of fresh legume plants and moldy Red Clover and grasses.1 Hence, the “bad rap,” overreaction, and fear associated with coumarin-containing herbs in the literature. This issue presents an excellent opportunity for herbalists to educate the public and medical establishment.

In general, herbs and plants containing derivatives of coumarin are antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and tonic to venous and lymphatic vessel walls. They are traditionally used for edema, varicose veins, and hemorrhoids. Aesculus hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut seed) is a classic treatment for varicose veins. Meadowsweet herb, Sweet Grass, Sweet Woodruff, Sweet Clover herb, and Tonka bean are other examples of plants containing coumarin.

### Lignins

Lignins are a class of polyphenols. They are a diverse group, high in fiber, which can contribute many actions. Various kinds of lignins are part of the active constituents in adaptogens, phytoestrogens, anticarcinogenics, and hepatoprotective herbs.1 Some big players are in the following list of herbs.

Box 8.1

Flax Seeds and Oil, an Herbalist’s Ally

### Flavonoids

Flavonoids are a large subclass of polyphenols that occur in plants as flavonoid glycosides. Flavonoids are powerful antioxidants known to be cancer preventing and health promoting. Being antioxidant, they protect plants against free-radical damage and oxidative stress. When we consume them, they do the same for us. Antioxidants are billed as major contributors to keeping us healthy and cancer free. Flavonoids are prevalent in flowers, fruits, and leaves. They appear in many fruits, vegetables, coffee, and even chocolate, and they provide the famous healthy rainbow diet of many colors that is rich in antioxidants of all kinds. Flavus means yellow, the first plant color where the chemical was discovered. Later flavonoids were found in reds, blues, purples, and colorless varieties. Flavonoid concentration is high in citrus fruits, buckwheat, and white and yellow flowers.

Many types of flavonoids sound alike with slightly different spellings because of their various molecular structures and substituents. Here is a list of a few flavonoids:

<!-- chunk -->

## Terpenoids or Terpenes

The first terpene to be isolated was turpentine, distilled from Pine oleoresin. Terpenes are the largest group of secondary plant metabolites. Their basic structure is a five-carbon precursor isoprene. These units can be assembled chemically in many different ways, accounting for their diversity. They differ in their functional groups and in their basic carbon skeletons. They are classified by molecular weight, increasing from light molecules with 5 carbon units to heavy molecules with 40 carbons. For example, monoterpenes have 10 carbon units, sesquiterpenes have 15 carbon units, diterpenes have 20, triterpenes have 30, and so on. Terpenes include essential oils, resins, steroids, carotenoids, and rubber.3

<!-- chunk -->

### Monoterpenes

Monoterpenes have 10 carbons. They are responsible for many diverse therapeutic actions of essential oils and whole herbs. Camphor, a local rubefacient, occurs naturally in Camphor Tree wood and is also in Rosemary leaf, Artemisia spp., and Chrysanthemum Ju Hua (Chrysanthemum flower). Camphor and menthol are paired in many external liniments and creams. Thujone from Salvia officinalis (Garden Sage) essential oil is antiseptic and carminative. Thymol in Thyme herb is fungicidal. Iridoids are a subclass of monoterpenes that give us the bitter principle. At least 500 various terpenes have been identified.1 They are responsible for the herbal category of digestive bitters, including Gentiana lutea (Yellow Gentian root). They also provide the cat psychotropic in Nepeta cataria (Catnip herb).5 Pulegone in Mentha poeciloides (Pennyroyal essential oil) repels mosquitoes and fleas.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sesquiterpenes

Sesquiterpenes have 15 carbons. Sesquiterpenes provide the volatile aspect of many essential oils. Chamazulene is found in Chamomile essential oil and Yarrow herb, humulene is found in Hops flower, and zingiberene is a carminative in Ginger and Turmeric root. A subclass called the sesquiterpene lactones are antiinflammatory, anticancer, antibacterial, antiparasitic, and antispasmodic; they also stimulate digestion.1

<!-- chunk -->

### Diterpenes

Diterpenes have 20 carbons. These molecules are too large to be volatile and many are oleoresins and resins. They require high percentages of alcohol as solvents. Diterpenes include grindelic acid in Grindelia squarrosa (Gumweed flower), carnosol in Rosemary leaf, and ginkgolides in Ginkgo leaf. Some diterpenes are toxic, notably a group called the grayanotoxins, which are present in Rhododendron spp. (the Mountain Laurels).1

<!-- chunk -->

### Triterpenes

Triterpenes have 30 carbons. This is the largest terpene subgroup. Ursolic acid appears in Olive leaf and essential oil, Privet berry, Agrimony herb, Rosemary leaf, Oregano herb, Thyme herb, Lavender flower, Peppermint herb, Pomegranate fruit and seed, and Hawthorn berry. Triterpenes are anticarcinogenic, chemo-protective, hepato-protective and antiinflammatory.1

### Cardiac Glycosides

Cardiac glycosides are terpenes, which can be toxic. One of them, digitalis, has been synthesized into a powerful heart drug used for congestive heart failure (CHF) and other cardiac problems. Cardiac glycosides are steroidal saponins with an additional lactone ring. The three herbal cardioactive herbs in order of toxicity from most to least are the famous Digitalis purpurea (Foxglove herb), Convallaria majalis (Lily of the Valley herb), and Drimia maritima (Squill bulb). Foxglove is toxic and dangerous for herbalists to use because the exact dose is critical and must be controlled precisely. All parts of the plant, sap, seeds, flowers, nectar, and especially the dried leaves contain poisonous digitoxin and other cardiac glycosides.

Cardiac glycosides are used allopathically in the form of digoxin, synthesized from Foxglove herb, for treating CHF and atrial fibrillation. Therapeutically, they increase cardiac output by making the heart pump harder and lowering heart rate. The downside of this is that serum blood levels must be carefully monitored to maintain therapeutic range and prevent a dangerously low heart rate and/or digitalis toxicity and possible death.

Foxglove’s cardiac affect has been known for centuries. In 1785, the English doctor William Withering studied Foxglove and published a paper on its properties. Its subsequent use in medicine is regarded as the beginning of modern pharmacology. Convallaria majalis (Lily of the Valley herb) is a safer and less powerful alternative to Foxglove and can be used for CHF, as a neurocardiac restorative and for treating arrhythmias and palpitations. If using Lily of the Valley as a simple, take a 10-day break after 10 days of continuous use.14 Be sure not to combine the herb with the drug Digoxin (digitalis). Leave at least four days between the two, with no overlap because the herb and the drug combined can lead to digitalis toxicity and cardiac arrest.

### Tetraterpenoids (Carotenoids)

This group of terpenoids are lipid-soluble antioxidants. There are over 600 types of carotenoids. Rich sources are yellow, orange, and red vegetables, fruits, and flowers. Lycopene occurs in tomatoes, watermelon, pink grapefruit, papaya, Calendula, Dandelion, and Nasturtium flower. Beta carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, helps maintain visual acuity, immunity and is cancer protective. It is present in Rose hip, carrot, oats, yams, and sweet red peppers. Lutein is in all green leaves and is also found in yellow-orange plants such as carrots, tomatoes, corn, and Calendula flower. Lutein is an important antioxidant that guards against macular degeneration.1

## Alkaloids

Bitter alkaloids are the “drama queens” of herbalism. They are the most potent of all the herbal constituents. Many have strong physiological, psychological, and therapeutic effects. Of all the categories, alkaloids have been the most investigated by modern science. This huge group displays much structural diversity, but all have at least one nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring, and classification is based on the type of ring system present.3 The pH of alkaloids is alkaline. It has been surmised that alkaloids play a protective function in plants by protecting them against insects. Alkaloid-containing plants are more common in hot climates than in cold ones. Many are named after the plant from which they were discovered. Alkaloids are mainly alcohol-soluble, not water-soluble, and require high ethanol percentages in tincture.

Alkaloids can cure or kill, depending on which plant is chosen. In herbology, this is not a tremendous problem because the synergy of plant chemicals tones down toxicity. Furthermore, vomiting and diarrhea tend to be warning signs that a therapeutic dose has been exceeded. This is not true in allopathic medicine, where plant alkaloids have been isolated and synthesized into potent and dangerous drugs. Often the drugs need to be titrated by microgram increments so as not to exceed therapeutic doses.

Plants containing alkaloids range from common foods and herbals in the Solanaceae/Nightshade family such as Ashwagandha root, the peppers, tomatoes, and potatoes, to the poisonous nightshades, Atropa belladonna (Deadly Nightshade herb), Hyoscyamus niger (Henbane herb), and Datura stramonium (Jimson Weed herb). Garlic bulb is another common and edible alkaloid from the Lily family.

Some alkaloids are addictive, such as nicotine from Nicotiana tabacum (Tobacco leaf). Others are both addictive and analgesic: heroin from Papaver somniferum (Opium Poppy seed pod) and cocaine from Erythroxylum coca (Coca leaf). Some alkaloids are psychoactive: mescaline from Lophophora williamsii (Peyote Cactus button) and psilocybin from many types of Psilocybe spp. (Psilocybin mushroom). The stimulating alkaloid, caffeine (Fig. 8.11), is found in coffee, black and green tea, maté, kola nut (the fruit/seed of Cola acuminata), and cocoa beans (chocolate). New alkaloids are constantly being discovered.

From a medicinal standpoint, the pharmacological actions of alkaloids are extensive. Therapeutic actions can be narcotic, analgesic, vasoconstricting, muscle relaxing, and antineoplastic, and they can provide local anesthesia, be hyper- or hypotensive, and function as cardiac and respiratory stimulants or relaxants.3 No wonder so many alkaloid pharmaceuticals are on the market. Many profitable drugs have been derived from these powerful substances.

### Allantoin, Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids (PAs), and Comfrey

The alkaloid allantoin is a constituent of Symphytum officinale (Comfrey leaf and root), which is known to stimulate wound healing, stop scarring, slough off dead skin cells, and enhance growth of healthy tissue. Comfrey is famous in healing salves and was used during the Civil War in poultices to wrap wounds and fractures because of healing allantoin.

Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are a group of alkaloids that are negatively associated with Comfrey root and leaf. Herbalists should be aware of the PAs because some forms can be toxic because of their metabolites that accumulate in the liver. There have been reports of livestock poisonings and problems with contaminated food crops from PAs. However, not all PAs have similar toxicity, nor are they all toxic.

Comfrey is sometimes cited as being hepatotoxic when taken internally because of the presence of PAs. This attribution is controversial. Nevertheless, caution should be taken when giving Comfrey in pregnancy, in individuals with liver disease and with elevated liver enzymes, or as a simple. Some herbalists recommend Comfrey for external use only, although it has been used safely internally in formula by many herbalists, including me. Symphytum officinale, found in most gardens, is much less toxic than other varieties. At any rate, to remain on the safe side, do not give for long-term internal use.

Other herbs containing PAs are Tussilago farfara (Coltsfoot herb), Petasites spp. (Butterbur root), Senecio spp. (Ragwort herb), and Agrimonia eupatoria (Agrimony herb). Remember that a plant’s toxicity is greatly lessened due to the synergy of many constituents. It is best for the herbalist to use judgment and caution with dosage in PA-containing botanicals.

<!-- chunk -->

### Protoberberines

Herbs that contain protoberberine alkaloids and their derivatives are extremely important to have in any herbal apothecary. Berberines are found in seven plant families and are a bright yellow, very bitter, water-soluble substance appearing on the inner bark. It is antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, antitumor, cytotoxic, and hepato-protective.3 Berberines serve as digestive stimulants and antidiabetics because of their bitter quality, as astringents for mucous membranes of the stomach and respiratory mucosa, as antiseptics in eyewashes, as wound creams and poultices, and as cholagogues that stimulate bile flow in the liver.

Berberine-containing herbs are dry, bitter, astringent, and cooling. Hydrastis canadensis (Goldenseal root), which contains hydrastis, is the best known, but it is also endangered and very expensive. A better choice is to use Mahonia aquifolium (Oregon Grape root) or Berberis vulgaris (Barberry root), both of which contain berberine, among other alkaloids. Chinese berberine-containing herbs are relatively inexpensive and include heat-clearing Coptis Huang Qi (Goldthread root) and Phellodendron Huang Bai (Siberian Cork Tree bark). Huang means yellow in pinyin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Purines

This alkaloid class is also designated as methylated purines. The chief alkaloids in this group are caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine.3 Caffeine-containing purines include black and green tea and kola nuts. Caffeine is a CNS, cardiac, and respiratory stimulant, a diuretic, and vasoconstrictor. Theophylline is used most as a bronchial smooth muscle relaxant in asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. Its drug form is Aminophylline.

Theobromine is found in Theobroma cacao (Cacao seed or bean). Cacao (or the chopped-up nibs) is the purest, most healthy form of chocolate, as long as no sugars, fats, or milk have been added. Pure, unprocessed dark chocolate is a CNS stimulant and contains the antioxidant flavanol. Consumption of 1 oz per day may lower bad LDL cholesterol, reduce blood clots, increase coronary artery blood flow, and lower blood pressure. It also enhances mood by increasing serotonin and endorphin levels in the brain.15 Did we really need an excuse to enjoy chocolate?

<!-- chunk -->

### Piperidines

This group of alkaloids, piperidines, is found in deadly Conium maculatum (Poison Hemlock) but more usably in Lobelia inflata (Lobelia herb) in the form of lobeline. In moderate dosage, Lobelia herb is famously used as an antispasmodic bronchodilator for asthma and bronchitis. Large doses are highly emetic and were used for purges by the Eclectics. Piperine is the main pungent constituent of Black Peppercorn.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sanguinarines

It is one of many alkaloids in the Papaveraceae/Poppy family, which includes Papaver somniferum (Opium Poppy) and medium-strength Sanguinaria canadensis (Bloodroot) (Fig. 8.12). Though pungent, hot, and dispersing, Bloodroot is also antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal. It has been used topically for cold, damp congestion and for removing warts, reducing tumors in breast cancer, and treating nasal polyps.


The six key chemical groups in plants, known as archetypal plant constituents, include carbohydrates, amino acid derivatives, lipids, phenolic compounds, terpenes, and alkaloids. Understanding these major categories helps the herbalist appreciate therapeutic actions, tastes, energetics, and which solvent proportions work best in tincture.

Dietary macronutrients include carbohydrates (sugars), lipids (fats), and amino acids (proteins). Important carbohydrates are the adaptogenic immunomodulating polysaccharides (IPs) present in Echinacea spp. and medicinal mushrooms. Another is inulin, present in prebiotic plants that feed gut flora. Healthy fats include olive fruit and oil, coconut oil, monounsaturated avocados, and omega-3 flax seed. Amino acids are the building blocks of plant and animal proteins.

Phenolic compounds can be bitter or sweet, antiinflammatory, phytoestrogenic, and antioxidant. Terpenes are a diverse phytochemical category, which includes volatile essential oils such as thymol in Thyme and humulene in Hops, the cardiac glycosides, and steroidal saponins.

Alkaloids are the most potent and diverse group of all the herbal constituents. Herbalists should be aware of the pyrrolizidine class of alkaloids (PAs), which are present in some plants, including Comfrey, and may be toxic to the liver. The antimicrobial, bitter protoberberines are important medicinally, and the purines are types of alkaloids that include caffeine, theobromine (found in chocolate), and bronchodilating theophylline.

The basic premises of Chinese Medicine will be examined from an herbal therapy perspective. The assumption is that you are primarily a Western herbalist with no or little background in Chinese Medicine. It is a beginning. If you have training already, please be tolerant. Important concepts include the principles of yin and yang; the Fundamental Substances of qi, blood, jing, shen, and fluids; the Five Element Theory and Correspondences; the Five Organ Network; the Five Element Cycles; the External Pernicious Influences; and the Eight Principle Patterns of Assessment. These concepts are so critical that they are traditionally capitalized.

From this basic theory emerges a diagnostic tool, namely pulse and tongue assessment, which will prove invaluable to the Western herbalist. If these assessment techniques are practiced and appreciated, and the theoretical principles and basics understood, we will be gifted with an important way to assess our clients and to choose superb herbal combinations to facilitate healing. This chapter is an overview and introduction and in no way goes into the detailed methods required of a skilled Chinese Medicine practitioner. It is meant to be a tool in our pocket, along with many others, to help us become expert herbalists.

## The Five Main Branches of Chinese Medicine

<!-- chunk -->

## The Principle of Yin and Yang

Yin and yang are a key concept in Chinese medicine. The principle represents the idea of dualism, or how forces that appear to be opposites actually complement one another. All is one in the universe. We are all one. Out of the one is the connected, intertwined opposites, or polarities of yin and yang (Fig. 9.1). Yin and yang encompass everything. The universe is always in motion, so yin and yang are always in motion, changing, and complementing one other. If you check out the yin-yang symbol, you will see that the dark, yin blends into the light yang. In the dark yin is a dot of light yang; in the light yang is a dot of dark yin. The feminine and masculine principles intertwine. A woman has female yin in her, but within that woman is a little yang maleness. A man has masculine in him, but within that man is bit of the feminine.1

Yin-yang is an interwoven relationship, never static. Yin and yang are in everything. Sometimes a thing is more yin; sometimes more yang. For there to be hot, there is cold; for heaven, there is earth; for masculine, there is feminine; for the light is the dark. Sometimes the very same thing is yang, and sometimes it is yin. Or it could be more yin than yang or more yang than yin. It depends on the point of view of the observer. Yin and yang are always in flux, cyclic, and a circle. As Donovan once sang in the song “Circular Motion,” “Everybody is a part of everything anyway…”

In general, yin is cool, dark, and moist. Yang is warm, light, and dry. Yin is female; yang is male. Yin is the moon; yang is the sun. Yin is the receptive; yang is the creative. As above, so below. Yin and yang are part of the conditions of human illness and wellness. We have the dualities of dry and damp, hot and cold, internal and external, weak and strong, and excess and deficient. When we investigate herbal qualities and human conditions, the concept of yin and yang are paramount.

## The Fundamental Substances: Qi, Blood, Jing, Shen, and Fluids

Qi is energy, the life force. It is the active principle that forms part of living things. Think of it as breath, air, gas, and energy. Qi is also the energy that flows through the body along pathways called meridians. When we think of an herbal qi tonic, we have an herbal mixture that helps us regain or maintain our energy. If qi is deficient, we are weak or tired.3

<!-- chunk -->

### Blood

The concept of blood in Chinese Medicine is different from the Western idea of blood. In the West, blood is a red liquid filled with cells, made in the marrow, that circulates throughout the body in definite anatomical pathways, the blood vessels. In Chinese Medicine, blood travels through the physical blood vessels but also goes through the energy meridians. In the Western sense, the vessel pathway is important; in the Chinese version, not so much. Blood’s function is more important, namely to nourish, maintain, and repair the entire body. Because it’s a liquid, blood is considered a yin substance.3

Chinese blood arises from food that has been transformed through digestion. Food goes to the Stomach and then ripens in the Spleen into a pure essence. The essence rises to the Lungs and becomes clear. Then nutritive qi turns it into blood. From there, the Heart circulates it, the Liver stores it, when necessary, and the Spleen keeps it in the blood vessels, its correct place. As the saying goes, “The Heart rules the blood; the Liver stores the blood; the Spleen governs the blood.” If something goes wrong, the blood has disharmonies.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Two Main Categories of Blood Disharmonies

<!-- chunk -->

### Jing

Jing is the substance that underlies life from birth to death. Jing is the basis of reproduction and development and part of our DNA. It is supportive and nutritive. We receive prenatal, original jing at conception. At birth, we acquire postnatal jing from our parents. As we grow and mature, our jing is dependent on our lifestyle choices, and it changes accordingly. All life cycles are considered jing. The triad of the Maiden, Mother, and Wise Woman (Chapter 28) is jing. Jing is the inner essence of growth, decline, and death. If there is disharmony with these life passages, we might have trouble conceiving a child, have sexual dysfunction, experience delayed puberty, or encounter premature aging. A Western concept of a jing disharmony might be a congenital defect.3

In Chinese Medicine, the Kidney holds the jing. The Kidney, being the most yin organ, holds our essence and the root of life. The Kidney is deep and watery and the source of life and development. Every part of the body needs Kidney jing to thrive and survive. From a Western perspective, the endocrine system, which manages hormonal growth and development, is part of Kidney jing. The adrenal glands, which anatomically sit atop the kidneys, are major players in Kidney jing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Shen or Spirit

Shen is spirit or essence. It is associated with the human personality and the ability to live life fully and happily. Healthy shen translates into a sparkle in the eyes. In Chinese Medicine, the Heart stores the shen. This action makes sense if we consider how often we describe our feelings in terms of the heart, as in, “My heart is soaring, My heart is broken, I am sick at heart, My heart aches for you.” Shen disharmonies can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental illnesses. From a Western perspective, we may see insomnia, excessive dreaming, forgetfulness, dementia, or irrational behavior. If the Heart’s blood and qi are in harmony, then all is well. We are content.3

<!-- chunk -->

### Fluids

The fluids consist of all bodily fluids, other than blood. Fluids include semen, urine, lymph, sweat, gastric juices, and mucous membrane linings. They moisten and sometimes nourish hair, skin, membranes, orifices, flesh, muscles, joints, marrow, and bones. Fluids come from ingested food and are absorbed and regulated by the qi of various organs. Fluids are yin. Therefore it is reasonable that a fluid disharmony is a yin disharmony and would result in dryness.3

<!-- chunk -->

## The Five Element Theory

The Five Element Theory is a world view in Chinese medicine, which includes our relationship with the earth and its natural cycles. It takes into account the five yin-yang organ pairs and their association with the five seasons, five elements, five tastes, five colors, five emotions, and the five sense organs. To this day, Chinese Medicine describes and defines the world and medicine using the influence of day and night, the seasons, and the elements—all circular.

<!-- chunk -->

### Correspondences

Five Element Theory is a tremendously holistic idea that takes into account the five yin-yang organ pairs and their associations or correspondences with the natural world. Collectively, this information is organized in a Table of Correspondences. It is a way to look at reality and organize what we see. The Five Element Theory includes our life cycle from birth to death, the cycle of a day from morning to night, the 24-hour clock, and the circulation of qi from hour to hour as it passes through each organ (Chapter 15). The five yin elements and their correspondences are the same for their partners, the yang elements (Table 9.2).

Table 9.2

<!-- chunk -->

### The Five Organ Network

Within the Five Element Theory is the Five Organ Network. In Chinese Medicine, the organs do not necessarily have the same functions that they have in the West. They are appreciated in reference to their given functions (physiological and psychological) and to their relationship to the substances and other parts of the body, a network. They occur in pairs; there are five yin organs and five yang organs. The yin organs are more internal and hollower, and the yang organs are more external and more solid. In terms of importance, the yin organs are more essential to life (Table 9.3).1

Table 9.3

In the Five Organ Network system, there are 5 paired yin-yang organs, equaling 10. In the Chinese acupuncture system, there are 6 paired yin-yang meridians, equaling 12. The two extra paired meridian organs are not actual visceral organs. They are concepts, called the Pericardium and the Triple Burner. The Triple Burner encompasses three areas: the upper (chest), middle (abdomen), and lower part (pelvis) of the torso, and their collective function is to tie together and harmonize the five organs of the network system. The Pericardium protects the heart and the active mechanism of the Heart.1 The protective Pericardium is yin, and the active, harmonizing Triple Burner is yang.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Five Element Cycles

The Five Element Cycles show how organs and their corresponding element interact and work with each other and/or against each other, resulting in health or disease. When in balance, they are drawn as an outside circle with arrows going clockwise. This image indicates them working together in harmony and is called the creation or supporting sequence. One organ gives birth to the next. Water nourishes wood by moistening it. Wood generates or feeds fire. Fire creates ash that covers earth to form soil. Earth supports metal by forming minerals and bringing them to the surface. Metal revitalizes water by giving it minerals, so it can nourish wood.

The five-pointed star inside the circle is a destruction or restraining sequence or cycle. It illustrates how organs can work against each other, causing illness or syndromes. Additionally, they work as a check-and-balance relationship, showing how one organ can stop another from getting out of hand, such as Kidney water cooling and preventing Heart fire from overheating the heart. Metaphorically, Wood inhibits earth by covering it, but also its roots help Earth by moving it around and preventing stagnation. Wood controls water by damming it up and absorbing it. Water controls fire by extinguishing it. Fire melts down metal. Metal chops wood and destroys it (Fig. 9.2).

We live on this earth in connection with the plants, the sky, the earth, the elements, the weather, the seasons, and the animals. The Chinese Five Element Cycle is reminiscent of the Native American Medicine Wheel, which is also circular and also includes an entire cosmology. The Medicine Wheel includes people, animals, plants, rocks, stars, seasons, and the life cycle. A main difference between the two is that the Chinese Five Element Theory includes a system of wellness and sickness in the human body and offers an intricate system of healing.

## The Five Yin Organs and Their Yang Partners

<!-- chunk -->

### Wood: The Liver (Yin) and Paired Organ, The Gallbladder (Yang)

The miraculous liver does so much, having over 100 functions. Almost everyone in the West would benefit from some liver herbals, because the liver is responsible for detoxification. From that standpoint alone, it is vital for health. The liver breaks down chemicals or deconjugates them. It takes apart used estrogen and other hormones, drugs, and toxins, so they can be excreted from the body through the bile and urine. The liver also stores glucose in the form of glycogen and regulates glucose metabolism. All diabetics need a nod from the Liver.1

<!-- chunk -->

#### Chinese Liver Functions

<!-- chunk -->

#### Chinese Gallbladder Functions

The yang Gallbladder is the organ paired with the yin Liver, making it part of the Liver network. Most of the correspondences of the yang organs match their partners. The Gallbladder makes and secretes bile (which used to be called gall). Bile stimulates peristalsis, breaks down fats, and helps assimilation and elimination. Many liver remedies, called cholagogues, stimulate the production and flow of bile and act as a laxative. The Gallbladder is associated with the powers of decision making, judgment, and clarity. If we make the wrong decision, or have trouble deciding, the universe often does it for us by default. If we can’t see (first, second, and third eye), our vision and understanding are cloudy, and action is not taken.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fire: The Heart (Yin) and Paired Organ, The Small Intestine (Yang)

Love resides in the heart. The heart is the place of healing, unconditional love, and compassion. It contains the shen, the spirit, the life force, and the personality. If shen is strong, there is mental balance, a healthy outlook, and a positive self-image. Life’s problems and dark moments still occur but can be dealt with. A carefree Heart equals a peaceful shen.

<!-- chunk -->

#### Chinese Heart Functions

<!-- chunk -->

#### Chinese Small Intestine Functions

The yang Small Intestine is the paired with the yin Heart, so it is part of the Heart network. The Small Intestine receives digestive enzymes from the pancreas and liver and separates out solids to the colon and liquid to the kidneys. The Small Intestine is paired with the Heart in communication, because it assists in sending purified food (absorption) to the Blood. The Small Intestine assists the Heart in caring for the spirit by filtering out negativity and what is not needed.

Heart illnesses can manifest as inflammatory (fire or heat) conditions in the Small Intestine. If we are anxious or stressed out from a shen disturbance of the Heart, we can talk too much, develop ulcers, inflammatory and irritable bowel diseases of the Small Intestine, or cystitis. Stress is a major player in many diseases, particularly of the gut. This manifestation is a perfect example of the mind-body or gut-to-brain connection.

<!-- chunk -->

### Earth: The Spleen (Yin) and Paired Organ, The Stomach (Yang)

The Spleen is like Mother Earth. The Earth holds, houses, and nourishes us, as does the Spleen. It holds us together, keeps us safe, and provides nourishment. The Chinese Spleen is similar to the Western stomach. It supplies nourishment, called nutritive essence, which is converted into qi and blood.

<!-- chunk -->

#### Chinese Spleen Functions

<!-- chunk -->

#### Chinese Stomach Function

The yang Stomach is paired with the yin Spleen, so it is part of the Spleen network. It holds and “ripens” or digests food. The Stomach is yang and dry and needs the moisture of the yin Spleen. The Spleen and Stomach work in opposite directions. Stomach qi is supposed to move food downward to the intestines. If it rebels and moves upward, we belch, hiccup, or have nausea and vomiting. Conversely, the Spleen should have upward energy. If its qi is deficient, we have downward prolapses of organs and veins.

<!-- chunk -->

### Metal: The Lungs (Yin) and Paired Organ, The Large Intestine (Yang)

<!-- chunk -->

#### Chinese Lung Functions

The Lung governs the relationship between the outside (exterior) and inside (interior) of the body. It puts up limits and boundaries and determines what comes in through the qi of heaven (breath) to join with the qi of earth (nutrition).1 This barrier protects us from the External Pernicious Influences of microorganisms. It sets up the rhythm of the organism through air exchange. Slow, measured breathing can be quieting, conscious, and meditative. The Lungs do this. Qi gong is a discipline that uses this truth for disease prevention.

<!-- chunk -->

#### Chinese Large Intestine Function

The yin Lung is paired with the yang Large Intestine, so it is part of the Lung network. The lungs filter out stale and unneeded air, and the Large Intestine separates food particles that are unneeded and could make us toxic if allowed to build up. This letting-go of what no longer serves relates to the Lung network’s emotion of grief. Appropriate grieving requires release of the old to keep us whole and let in the new. If the Lung and Large Intestine become stressed and restrained, tension arises and leads to stiff, tight muscles, constipation, spastic colon, or asthma. Asthma is when we cannot exhale, release, or let go of stale air.

<!-- chunk -->

### Water: The Kidneys (Yin) and Paired Organ, The Bladder (Yang)

The Kidney is the most yin organ because it generates, stores, and governs our deep essence, our genetic DNA information called jing. Kidney yin is moist and nourishing. It supports reproductive functions. But like all other organs, the Kidney has an active yang side. The Kidneys rule water and circulate fluids. This characteristic is an action-oriented yang function. All other organs are dependent on the yin and yang of the Kidneys. The Kidney has a long list of functions and is a very important organ.

<!-- chunk -->

#### Chinese Kidney Function

<!-- chunk -->

#### Chinese Bladder Functions

The yin Kidney is paired with the yang Bladder, so it is part of the Kidney network. The bladder holds and releases the urine. Because the paired Bladder meridian extends down the midback, back issues and spinal cord problems are related to this network. The Bladder controls the release of urine along with the lower sphincters.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Six External Pernicious Influences

The Six External Pernicious Influences that cause disease are wind, cold, heat, damp, dry, and summer heat. They are sometimes called The Six Evils. They are climatic influences that enter the environment externally and can penetrate the body.4

<!-- chunk -->

## Assessment: Tongue and Pulse

There are many ways to determine what is wrong. A Western doctor or nurse practitioner would take a verbal health history. They would also conduct a physical exam by listening to the heart, lungs, and bowel sounds with a stethoscope; take blood pressure with a sphygmomanometer; look in the ears with an otoscope; and look in the eyes with an ophthalmoscope. They would run a battery of lab tests of the blood, urine, and sputum. They might take an EKG or X-ray or order an MRI. They would then come up with a diagnosis or a name for that disease or problem, such as bronchitis, myocardial infarction, or pneumonia. The process is dependent on machines and technology and, in some cases, can be life-saving.

In Chinese Medicine, doctors depend on their senses, judgment, intuition, and experience, not technology. They begin with questions, obtain a very detailed health history regarding family and personal health, sleep patterns, elimination, menses, weight, food preferences, diet, and stress. They make observations regarding complexion, posture, gait, and nails. They use the senses: smelling for body odor, listening for the sound of voice, and using touch to determine muscle tone, flexibility, temperature, and texture.

Chinese Medicine doctors also use touch for a detailed method of pulse P and tongue T diagnosis or evaluations, which help arrive at a diagnosis, a syndrome, a disharmony, or pattern of disease. Examples of syndrome names could be Wind Damp Heat, Spleen Qi Deficiency, Excess Kidney Yang, or Yin Deficiency. A cough comes in many forms and could result from heat, cold, dry, damp, deficiency, or excess. These individual coughs are all different, and each would be treated differently, depending on the results of the pulse and tongue analysis, and other assessments. One universal bottle of cough syrup from the local drugstore does not fit and cure every kind of cough. An aspirin does not treat every kind of headache.

As herbalists, we understand that our assessments will include some of the Western techniques and some of the Chinese. What is optimal is that we begin to learn and use Eastern and some Western methods of assessment. Notice the word assessment was used. In the United States, herbalists are not legally allowed to diagnose, treat, or prescribe, and they are not allowed to use those words verbally or in writing. By using the Chinese methods, we can make assessments and come up with suggested remedies without making a formal Western diagnosis.

Assessment of pulse and tongue are skills which take time to develop; ideally with an experienced practitioner standing by, to provide a read or reality check for your findings. Just begin. Start to use pulse and tongue assessment and see if they match up with your other assessment modalities. The more tools pointing in one particular direction, the more likely you are to be on the correct assessment track.

### Tongue Assessment (Looking)

In Chinese Medicine, the tongue reflects the condition of the body (Fig. 9.3). We observe it for color, texture, moisture, size, and shape. A healthy tongue is smooth, moist, pale red, and firm. The tongue fits comfortably into the mouth and has a thin white coating, also called the fur or moss, on its upper surface. The body of the tongue underneath the fur is sometimes called the tongue material. Changes in the body of the tongue show long-term dysfunctions. Changes in the fur show short-term problems, such as changes in digestion, fluid balance, and heat regulation.1

#### Tongue Shape

If a tongue cannot be analyzed from the parameters in this list of tongue shape conditions, it helps to look at a five organ-tongue correspondence map. Sometimes these characteristics listed here are only seen in one portion of the tongue (Box 9.2). For instance, only the tip may be red; purple coloration might be present only on the edges. If either is the case, the map can be useful to identify the affected organ. This is helpful but not definitive.

Box 9.2

The Tongue Reflects a Reliable Assessment of the Body

### Pulse Assessment (Palpation)

Palpating (feeling) the pulse is partnered with a tongue assessment. In Chinese Medicine, a pulse reflects the blood and qi circulating through the vessels and tells the practitioner about the condition of each organ. Skilled practitioners can make amazingly correct assessments of current body imbalances, past diseases, and future predictions by taking a pulse. This ability is the result of information gathered over centuries of experimentation and effort, a true art that is not quickly mastered.

Each wrist has three positions to palpate along the radial artery. The three positions indicate a metabolic zone known as the Triple Burner or Jiao (rhymes with cow). The upper position, closest to the wrist, corresponds to the chest and upper body. The middle position corresponds to the middle body or upper abdomen, and the lower position corresponds to the lower abdomen or pelvis. The rate of speed, depth, degree of strength, and fullness of these pulses give important information about the integrity of the qi and blood and organs.2

#### How to Palpate Pulses

Box 9.3

Pulse Positions and Palpation Basics

To obtain a global analysis of the overall pulse, feel under the middle finger on both wrists. These may also be palpated at each individual pulse position.

FAST PULSE=Heat

SLOW PULSE=Cold

SUPERFICIAL PULSE=External Acute Condition

DEEP PULSE=Internal Chronic Condition

EMPTY OR THIN PULSE=Deficient

FULL PULSE=Excess

## The Eight Principle Patterns of Assessment: Cold-Heat, Deficiency-Excess, Interior-Exterior, and Yin-Yang

What does all the information just obtained through taking the patient’s health history, observation, and tongue and pulse assessment mean? How will you use it? What herbs should be chosen? The Eight Principle Patterns of Assessment refer to four sets of opposites that help interpret the data gathered through examination: cold-heat, deficiency-excess, interior-exterior, and yin-yang (Table 9.5). They reflect the overall quality and the location of the qi, moisture, and blood in the body and in the organs.

Table 9.5

P Slow or tense.

T White fur; pale or purple or blue body.

P Rapid or bounding.

T Yellow fur; red body.

P Weak or thin.

T Scanty or absent fur; pale, flabby, or scalloped body.

P Strong, large or tense, wiry, slippery.

T Thickened fur; red, swollen, stiff, or quivering body.

P Changes at deep level. Can be excess or deficient.

T Changes in tongue body, but also in the fur.

P Superficial or deep level, depending on the condition.

T Changes in fur. Color and shape may also be affected.

P Frail, thin, weak.

T Pale, puffy, moist, thin. Coat is white.

Includes hot, excess, and external processes.

Can also be deficient yang, which indicates cold, damp conditions.

In excess, shows heat conditions, such as red face, agitation, high blood pressure, talkative, constipation.

When deficient is cold, diarrhea, bloated, edema, often tired.

P Signs of excess, full, rapid, wiry, slippery.

T Red, yellow coat, if excess. Swollen, white coat, if yang deficient.

The information helps to figure out the therapeutic principles or objectives, according to the style of Chinese Medicine. Basically, a therapy that is the opposite of the assessment is used. If a person is already too warm, it would make no sense to add more warmth in the remedy; the person needs to be cooled down. Furthermore, this Chinese Medicine style of assessment will later be combined with the Western-type information that is also gathered (Chapter 15).


The basics of Chinese Medicine provide a time-tested, accurate way for us to categorize herbs, assess our clients, and devise herbal formulas. Grasping these fundamentals will help achieve successful clinical results and eliminate guesswork. The West really has no counterpart or organized system to accomplish this.

Yin and yang encompass everything and are relative to any situation. Generally, yin is cool, moist, inward, and feminine. Yang is hot, dry, outward, and male. However, within all yang is some yin; and within all yin is some yang. Bodily disharmonies (syndromes) or pathologies are excesses or deficiencies—too much of one over the other.

The Fundamental Substances are qi, blood, jing, shen, and fluids—and all can have disharmonies. Qi refers to the energy or life force in all living things. Blood arises from transformed food and nourishes the body. Jing is the basis of the life force from birth to death. Shen is the spirit and affects the psyche. Fluids refer to all liquids in the body.

The Five Element Theory is a world view that explains our relationship with natural cycles. External Pernicious Influences are conditions that arise from outside the body, causing imbalance. Two important Chinese Medicine assessment techniques are pulse and tongue analysis. These skills can be practiced and used to assess our clients. There are Eight Principle Patterns of Assessment organized into four opposite pairs: cold-heat, deficiency-excess, interior-exterior, and yin-yang. Once an assessment is made based on health history and analysis of pulse and tongue, a proper herbal remedy can be formulated.

# Energetics Related to Western Herbology

“We live in a world of energy. An important task at this time is to learn to sense or see the energy of everyone and everything—people, plants, animals.… Go to the sacred places of the Earth to pray for peace and have respect for the Earth which gives us our food, clothing, and shelter. We need to reactivate the energy of these sacred places. That is our work.”

—Carlos Barrios (Australian artist, born Carlos Manuel Barrios Rosa in 1966 in San Salvador, El Salvador, Central America)

This chapter organizes, classifies, categorizes, and arranges herbs based on their energetics from Chinese and Western standpoints, providing the best of both worlds. The terms are found in numerous herb books worldwide and give information about how herbs work.

The Three Primary Qualities or characteristics are taste, warmth, and moisture. These qualities give data about a plant’s effect on the body in relation to the senses, a plant’s energy, and the direction it moves the qi. The Six Secondary Qualities are specific actions arranged as opposites—stimulate-sedate, restore-relax, and moisten-decongest—indicating what an herb does to the body in very broad terms.

Descriptive qualities are categories traditionally used in Western herbalism. They tell us what an herb does on a tissue level. These groups are also opposites: astringe-eliminate, solidify-dissolve, and thicken-dilute.

Further breakdowns involve the countless descriptive terms used in Western herbalism. They are action words, such as diaphoretics that cause sweating, emmenagogues that bring on menses, or anxiolytics that curb anxiety. Many come from Western allopathic medicine and are intertwined with Western herbalism.

Organoleptics refers to judging the potency, quality, and phytochemical composition of an herb or preparation by using the senses. By attentively tasting, smelling, or feeling, we experience and reach our own conclusions about how an herb acts in the body.

<!-- chunk -->

## Energetics in Western Herbalism

<!-- chunk -->

### Rationale for the Energetic Approach

There are countless books about Western herbs with various organizational principles, some more useful than others. One type assigns a descriptive term to a plant that tells about one of its actions, such as demulcent or astringent, a method typically done in the West. Raspberry leaf is astringent, meaning it pulls in and tightens—therefore a good choice for diarrhea. But if Raspberry leaf were considered only as astringent, another important use is omitted: its nutritive quality. For pregnant women, Raspberry leaf is a prime reproductive nutritive tonic with an affinity for the uterus.

Some books give long laundry lists of actions, but they might leave you wondering which herb to choose. Say there are 20 different antimicrobials listed. Are they all equally effective? Popular magazines often extol the wonders of a popular “herb of the year,” such as Echinacea root. Pictures of Echinacea purpurea with its purple rays and yellow center appear all over the media. It is supposedly the herb to take for colds and infections. But is Echinacea the best selection for every single viral and bacterial illness that comes along?

Herbalism is complex. How do we know which remedies to choose? In my experience, the best way to choose is to use a combination of Western categories of action, property-based concepts (actions), combined with Chinese methods that consider energetics. Western labels tell you very quickly at least one action for an herb: diuretic, antiinflammatory, or demulcent. Chinese energetics take into account diagnostics, helping to fit the correct herb to the correct condition.

### Chinese Energetics in Western Herbalism

Energetics is a system used to organize herbs referring to its qualities, its nature or sensory characteristics, and the broad actions they have on the body. Quality refers to how an herb acts on contact with tissues like the mouth, skin, stomach, or sense organs. When we eat a lemon, its sour taste causes the lips to pucker and constrict, producing an energy that pulls inward. This is a very different action and direction from that of sweet-tasting Licorice root, which restores or builds up mucous membranes and moves energy outward in gentle waves. Hot and pungent Cayenne pepper moves energy forcefully outward to the extremities, working differently from cold, bitter Gentian root, which pulls energy inward and downward. Chinese Medicine often refers to this directional pull of plants.

Another category of energetics refers to actions, the properties of an herb and its potential for achieving a particular outcome. Ginger root is a stimulating herb that warms the body and helps blood circulate outward to the extremities. Lobelia is relaxing—it calms down the nervous system. Corn Silk restores, or builds up, the urinary system. White Horehound herb decongests, or breaks up mucus, in the lungs. Dandelion root does two seemingly contradictory things but they are actually not. It is both sedating and stimulating, in that it decreases heat (sedates warmth) and encourages the liver to work harder (stimulates).

Western and Chinese traditions both have their place. Use them both in describing, categorizing, and selecting herbs—and end up with an excellent system and great tools. It is beneficial to appreciate the two ways of thinking. Cross-cultural healing deepens our understanding and ability to assess conditions in a patient and to formulate wisely and effectively. Ayurvedic medicine from India also uses energetics, being an important part of that system, as well.

## The Three Primary Qualities: Taste, Warmth, Moisture

The three Primary Qualities of taste, warmth, and moisture provide information about a plant, helping us to choose wisely. They all have local and global effects on the body. We will go through the various tastes, the gradations of hot to cold, and the concept of moisture, ranging from dry to damp.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taste: Sweet, Sour, Bitter, Salty, Pungent

There are four types of taste buds or chemoreceptors mapped out on the tongue in anatomy and physiology texts. Those receptors are for sweet, sour, bitter, and salty. In Chinese Medicine, five tastes are described: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and pungent (sometimes called acrid or spicy).1 In Ayurveda, they speak of six tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, pungent, and astringent. Ayurvedic has added astringent to the mix (Box 10.1).

Box 10.1

Tastes from Different Traditions

We will select the five tastes of Chinese Medicine for the discussion of the energetics of taste. In Chinese Medicine, tastes are also assigned directions, part of the desired action in a formula, indicating where those herbs will travel in the body.

Herbs usually have two or more tastes in combination, although one generally predominates and is considered the main taste. If you put an herb on your tongue, there will be a taste that you become aware of first, but in a few seconds, you’ll probably detect others. Tastes derive from chemical properties in a substance (Chapter 8). Taste buds receive the chemicals, and the brain interprets them.

<!-- chunk -->

#### Sweet

The sweet taste is universally loved and pleasing to all people, regardless of age or culture. It is the first one babies experience with mother’s milk. The other tastes, particularly bitter, take some getting used to. Very few children like bitter foods. When experimenting with new plants, ancient tribes found that sweet tastes were generally not poisonous. The macronutrients—carbohydrates, proteins, and fats—are the major food groups necessary for good nutrition. Carbohydrates and proteins contain sweet tastes, and fats enhance the flavor of sugar.

Sugar is a water-soluble carbohydrate, has a crystalline shape, and tastes sweet. The more complex the sugar molecule, the longer it takes the body to digest and the less stress it puts on the pancreas. Simple sugars, such as found in donuts and bagels, cause frequent fluctuations in insulin production, whereas complex carbohydrates in whole grains and vegetables take longer to digest, causing fewer insulin swings. An interesting sweet tasting herb that is not a carbohydrate and that does not cause blood sugar swings is Glycyrrhiza Gan Cao (Licorice root; Box 10.2).

Box 10.2

Licorice: An Exception to Sweet

The glycyrrhizin in Glycyrrhiza glabra Gan Cao (Licorice root) is not a sugar or carbohydrate at all (it's a saponin in the terpene category), although if you chew on the yellow insides of its root or rhizome, it tastes 50 times as sweet as cane sugar. Licorice has many tastes, the dominant one being the taste of Anise. But it is also bitter. Raw Licorice root tastes sweet, but to make Licorice into a truly sweet tonic, the Chinese bake it with honey and sugar to neutralize some of the bitter, cooling, and antiinflammatory actions. It then becomes more tonifying.

In Chinese Medicine the sweet taste is calming and moist. One often sees honey or sugar being used as the base of cough syrups and other medicines. It is harmonizing. It soothes, coats, and calms irritated throat mucous membranes. It blends together all the herbs in the syrup. In the West, we are so accustomed to eating simple sugars in the form of candies, cakes, and ice cream, that sometimes we don’t appreciate the incredible sweetness of a carrot, a sweet potato, or a slice of bread (Fig. 10.1). The Chinese also consider grains, meats, beans, and nuts to be sweet.

Refined sugars in small amounts can be calming. However, if children overconsume sweets, they may become anything but. If sugar were an occasional treat, rather than a major part of the diet, the sugar would be in balance and thus not lead to hyperactivity. The energy of the sweet taste is comforting, with a smooth, soft, wavy feeling and direction. Think of how good an amazing chocolate bar or your favorite sweet makes you feel.

In Chinese Medicine, the sweet taste is considered tonic. Tonics build, nourish, energize. and treat deficiencies. If one is nourished, the body can make energy. If one has energy, the immune system benefits. If one is calm, there is balance and freedom from detrimental stress, a road toward optimal health. A class of herbs called adaptogens has these properties. They are building tonic herbs such as Astragalus Huang Qi (Astragalus root), or Ashwagandha root. These herbs tonify the Chinese Spleen, the organ of digestion and assimilation. According to the Five Element Theory of Correspondences, the sweet taste is attributed to the Spleen (Chapter 9). Examples of sweet herbs and foods appear in Table 10.1.

#### Sour

The sour taste is very common in foods, particularly fruits such as lemons, limes, and papayas. Because the sour taste is astringent in quality, it pulls tissue together and spirals energy inward. These actions translate into a tightening, astringent effect that reabsorbs escaping fluids, stopping discharges such as sputum, semen, vaginal fluids, and blood. It is drying to mucous membranes. It is anhidrotic (decreases sweating). It is cooling, so it can lower fevers. It is stimulating, meaning it increases the digestive enzymes of the liver, gallbladder, and small and large intestines.

Ayurvedic medicine uses sour tastes to stimulate digestion with foods such as tamarind or sour pickles. As part of the Five Element Correspondences, the sour taste is associated with the Liver. Wine (with tartaric acid) and vinegar (mainly acetic acid) are sometimes used to process herbs that are to be used as liver and blood tonics because of their herbal properties that are similar to those of other sour materials (Table 10.2).1

#### Bitter

Bitter is widely prevalent in medicinal plants, probably more so than any other taste. Although the sweet taste is universally loved, bitter takes some getting used to for the uninitiated. Do most kids like kale? Many poisonous, toxic plants have a bitter, unpleasant taste, and the tastes were probably warnings to the ancients to spit out or beware. For the same reason some plants are dangerous, they also make strong valuable medicine when used judiciously. Bitter herbs range from the mildly bitter tastes of Chamomile and Yarrow flower to the intensely bitter tastes of Gentian lutea Long Dan Cao (Gentian root) and Artemisia annua Qing Hao (Sweet Annie herb) used in the treatment of drug-resistant malaria (Box 10.3).

Box 10.3

Very Bitter Artemisia Annua and Malaria

Artemisia annua Qing Hao, commonly called Annual Wormwood or Sweet Annie, is one of the most bitter plants known. It has been used in Chinese Medicine for more than a thousand years to treat low-grade fevers, skin diseases, parasites, fungus, bacteria, protozoa, and infections of all types, including malaria.

The World Health Organization endorses A. annua as a first-line treatment for drug-resistant malaria. Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites carried by the Anopheles mosquito. If bitten, the parasites invade human red blood cells, causing fever and, in severe cases, brain damage and death, especially in children. It is a huge problem in developing countries.

Sweet Annie contains artemisinin. This component, and its derivatives, are powerful medicines known for their ability to swiftly reduce the number of Plasmodium parasites in malaria patients. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are recommended for first-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Chemically, it releases “deadly free radicals once it enters the plasmodia.”4 In 2015 the Nobel Prize in Physiology was awarded to a Chinese woman, Tu Youyou, who revisited the ancient literature and discovered clues that guided her to successfully extract the active component from A. annua. Her discovery resulted in the drug artemisinin.

Essential oils contain various kinds of volatile substances found in monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes (Chapter 8). They are found in the conifers, in Thyme leaf, Oregano herb, the Mints, Eucalyptus, White Sage leaf, and others. Citrus monoterpenes are bitter substances found in orange peels, especially the limonene component found in the white and the zest of the peels. They are rich in bioflavonoids, which fight cancer. Next time you eat an orange, be sure to eat some of the bitter peel and white membrane (Fig. 10.3).

The bitter taste has many uses and appears in healing plants used in most body systems. Because bitter is cold, it cools hot conditions and decreases fever, inflammation, and hot anger. Bitter is detoxifying and cleansing and works below the waist to pull off fluids, especially in the gut, kidney, and bladder, which is testament to their downward, grounding direction. They can help clear cholesterol from the liver, and some are laxative.

Because bitter is stimulating, it can decrease water retention and bloating, contributing to a drying action. An entire category of plants is called digestive bitters (Chapter 18). Examples are Gentian root, Yarrow herb, Dandelion root, Chicory root, Burdock root, and Chamomile flower. They stimulate the digestive system to secrete digestive enzymes and hormones, increase appetite, decrease sugar cravings, and aid the liver to increase its bile flow and detoxification.3 Because gastrointestinal (GI) bitters are so wonderful for digestion and glucose regulation, they play a major role in holistic herbal treatment and preventative medicine.

Bitter-tasting pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are found in Comfrey root, Coltsfoot leaf, and Echinacea root. Comfrey is a renowned wound healer, Coltsfoot an expectorant, and Echinacea an antimicrobial. Examples of antiinfectives and antiinflammatory bitter herbs are yellow-rooted, berberine-containing plants. These bitter alkaloids are found in Goldenseal, Oregon Grape, and Barberry root. Berberines are effective for deep, hot infections. Some notoriously poisonous plants, such as Datura stramonium (Jimsonweed), Conium maculatum (Poison Hemlock), Hyoscyamus niger (Henbane), and Atropa belladonna (Deadly Nightshade), contain strong bitter alkaloids.2 In Chinese Medicine, the bitter taste affects the Heart in the Correspondences. This is no coincidence, because many bitter heart herbs and allopathic drugs contain alkaloids. The Chinese Heart organ system corresponds to the nervous and circulatory systems of Western medicine, both strongly affected by the bitter taste. Bitter herbs and foods are listed in Table 10.3.

Table 10.3

<!-- chunk -->

#### Salty

The salty taste improves flavors of food, lubricates and moistens body tissues, helps retain body fluids, and stimulates digestion by promoting salivation. Salt can also act as a laxative as in Epsom Salts (magnesium sulfate). The ocean is salty, and some of our salty herbs come from the sea. Seaweeds or sea vegetables are great sources of trace minerals, especially iodine. Kelp thallus is type of red algae, or seaweed, that moistens the mucosa and relieves dryness. It contains macro minerals and trace minerals of iodine, potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, manganese, germanium, zinc, and bromium.4 Irish Moss, Kelp thallus, and Dulse are other examples of sea veggies. Nori is type of seaweed that is used to wrap sushi (Fig. 10.4).

Salt is dissolving and softening. Salty ocean water corrodes metals. Taking this further, substances that stick and harden in the body can be broken down by salt. Salty herbs soften tumors, stones, and chronic lymph gland hardness. Salt can break down calcium deposits in atherosclerosis, keeping vessels soft. Echinacea root is primarily considered a pungent herb but is also salty and can reduce tumors and prostate enlargement. Because of salt’s sinking, pulling-down action, it is diuretic and can decrease edema. This diuretic action is true of salty herbs, but not true of excess table salt, which can create an osmotic pull on water, causing fluid retention and edema.

A classification of herbs known as antilithics break down mineral deposits in kidney stones and gall stones. Examples of antilithic remedies include Gravel root, Horsetail herb, Cleavers herb, and Celery seed or root. They contain significant amounts of trace minerals or organic acids and have a salty taste.

In the Chinese correspondences, the salty taste is associated with the Kidneys and the Bladder. This association makes sense if you think about the organ’s relationship with water. The kidney’s physiological function is to balance out electrolytes in the blood. Chinese Medicine speaks of kidney essence, life force (jing) tonics with a salty taste. Examples here are animal products: deer antler, gecko, placenta, sea horse, turtle shell, tortoise shell, and mantis. The frequently used sour fruits of Cornus Shan Zhu Yu (Japanese Dogwood berry) and the adaptogen Schisandra Wu Wei Zi (Schisandra berry) also have a salty taste. They are used to nourish and astringe the essence.1 Examples of salty herbs and foods are listed in Table 10.4.

Table 10.4

<!-- chunk -->

#### Pungent (Acrid or Spicy)

The chemical constituents in pungent or acrid herbs are mainly glycosides and essential oils. Have you ever sniffed strong Tea Tree essential oil or put a Peppermint or Ginger Altoid candy on your tongue? These are pungent and very spicy. How about eating a bowl of hot chili or Japanese wasabi to open the sinuses? They can make your nose run. Essential oils are highly volatile, giving them a notable fragrance and a dispersing quality. They might feel warming and tingly. Other examples are Thyme, White Sage, and Lavender, which contain monoterpenes, and Chamomile, Ginger, and Turmeric, which contain sesquiterpenes.2

Pungent pushes outward. When energy pushes out to the extremities and the skin, it is not stuck or bound up inside the body. In the Chinese arena, energy or qi is supposed to flow easily and evenly throughout the 12 paired meridians, not too quickly and not too slowly. If qi becomes stopped up or blocked, pain results. So it makes perfect sense that an herb that pushes outward would relax and ease pain in the tissues, opening the qi. The Chinese refer to pungent herbs as those that regulate the qi and relieve pain. These pungent herbs tend to be warming and stimulating, like Juniper berry or Rosemary leaf (Fig. 10.5).

From a Western perspective, outward, dispersing energy increases and stimulates circulation. Healthy blood circulation removes toxins and brings nutrients into a sore muscle so that the muscle fibers can heal. It removes waste products produced from an inflammatory response, driving them out and away from an edematous injury and thereby relieving pressure and pain. Stimulating circulation enhances lymphatic flow. Lymph and blood circulation are connected and related. Improved lymphatic flow helps the body detoxify and enhances immunity.

Further, increased blood circulation causes the surface capillaries under the skin to dilate, resulting in sweating and warming of the hands and feet. Consequently, a pungent, acrid-tasting herb increases sweating (diaphoretic), becoming a major remedy for early-onset respiratory infections, such as colds and flu. Fresh Ginger root tea accomplishes this, as does a Mustard bath. Sweating removes toxins and cools down a fever. Some lovely immune soups include pungent Onion and Garlic for this reason. Try stimulating the airway with acrid, pungent herbs such as Eucalyptus or Peppermint herb, and feel the sinuses open, creating mucus flow from the lungs. If the sinuses are open and flowing, head pressure is relieved, headaches disappear, and you can relax. Pain causes stress; when pain is relieved, stress dissipates, and you can calm down.

According to the Chinese correspondences, the pungent taste relates to the Lungs (Chapter 9). This relationship exists because the body parts associated with the Chinese Lungs are the skin and sweat glands. Sweat glands are anatomically located in the skin and pungent diaphoretics that help us sweat are frequently used in treating early-onset respiratory infections. A caution using this type of remedy is that sweating can also lead to water loss and dryness. For this reason, a pungent tasting herb should not be used as a simple with someone who is already dry because it could make the dryness worse. Such a client might be dehydrated, elderly, or experiencing an already dry condition, such as eczema. In these cases, the formula should be balanced out with an appropriate cooling, moist herb, such as Marshmallow root, Comfrey root, Asparagus root, Chickweed herb, Iceland moss, or Slippery Elm bark. See Table 10.5 for pungent herbs and foods.

Table 10.5

#### Description of Oily

In addition to the previously described tastes, sometimes the herbal literature mentions bland and oily. I believe these are not really tastes but descriptions. They seldom appear in medicinal herbal plants or in foods.

Oily is nutritive. It nourishes glands. Fats are needed for energy storage and hormone production. The human body uses fats to absorb and transport vitamins A, D, E, K, and carotenoids. Fat is the slowest burning but most energy-dense macronutrient, supplying nine calories per gram. In contrast, each gram of carbohydrate or protein yields only four calories of energy. As a result, fats represent the body’s largest form of energy storage. It also forms the important lipid bilayer of cell membranes and is necessary for growth and development.

Fats move slowly. They are moistening to the skin. Very few herbs can be called fatty. Examples are Saw Palmetto berry, which is useful for underweight or depleted people; Heart of Palm; and Rehmannia Shu Di Huang (prepared Rehmannia root cooked in wine). Among the five tastes, sweet is the one closest to being oily. Fatty foods take a long time to digest, so they would not be recommended for weak digestion or overweight conditions.

However, some fats are necessary for good health. Examples are the monounsaturated fats in olives, almonds, peanuts, macadamias, hazelnuts, pecans, cashews, and avocados; the polyunsaturated fats in walnuts, sunflower, sesame and pumpkin seeds; and in cold-water marine fish, such as salmon, tuna, mackerel, herring, trout, and sardines (Chapter 8). These healthy fats are necessary for everyone in moderate amounts, and especially for individuals with weight problems.

#### Description of Bland

Bland is considered the absence of taste. The most important bland herbs are the medicinal mushrooms. Examples, such as Chinese Ganoderma Ling Zhi (Reishi mushroom) and Poria Fu Ling (Hoelen fungus), are described as bland with a slightly sweet taste. Other examples are Couch Grass root, Slippery Elm bark, Pearl Barley seed, and Water Plantain root. These foods and herbs are generally neutral, calming, and restorative.

### Warmth: Hot to Cold

When we speak of the warmth of an herb, we are considering the entire spectrum of gradations from hot to warm, to neutral, to cool, and to cold.5 Herbs are placed on this continuum for different reasons. Some herb books list temperature in their Materia Medicas; some don’t. It is helpful to understand what is meant by this designation. Warmth may be described by the following criteria:

The quality of warmth or cold on the skin occurs locally as a topical application. Have you ever used Bengay? This common over-the-counter ointment is used as an analgesic rub for muscle and joint pain, sprains, and strains. A commercial preparation called Muscle Pain/Ultra Strength contains 30% methyl salicylate, 10% menthol, and 4% camphor. At first it makes the skin feel warm and tingly, followed by a cooling effect. Similar qualities are found in the Chinese liniment Tiger Balm.

Peppermint and Camphor are warming, and then cooling. Menthol is an organic compound found naturally in Peppermint. Camphor comes from the resin of the Camphor tree. They both initially warm us up and then cause sweating, which cools us down. They are counterirritants. Counterirritants create reddening of the skin caused by vasodilation, raise body temperature, cause sweating, and produce a mild irritation to the skin that reduces hot inflammation deeper in the body.6 The addition of methyl salicylate, the active ingredient in Aspirin, decreases pain.

We can also think of warmth in relation to the environment. In a hot country such as Mexico, hot herbs and spices like Chili pepper are routinely eaten to cool one down. Chilies and Cinnamon increase blood circulation to the skin surface, creating sweating and subsequent cooling. However, in cold countries, hot drinks may be used to warm one up. Some hot drinks have cold energetics, such as coffee, which in Chinese Medicine is considered to scatter qi.

Another way to consider temperature is from the subjective taste of an herb. Pungent tastes feel warm on the tongue. Think of warm cooking spices like Oregano herb, Rosemary leaf, or Thyme herb. When we swallow a pungent spice, we can feel the warmth as it travels down to the stomach. Choosing Ginger tea on a cold winter’s day is warming. Conversely, a cucumber or watermelon eaten in the heat of summer is cooling. Salads are cooling. Spicy turkey stuffing with Sage and Pepper is warming.

We can further consider the hot-to-cold continuum based on a person’s condition or what is happening inside. When out of balance, heat leads to irritability, fever, and inflammatory conditions. By its nature, heat rises, appearing as a red face and eyes, sore throat, or dizziness. In Chinese Medicine, if heat affects Heart or Liver, anger may result. Excess heat dries out body fluids. Excess cold can create copious fluids: frequent urination, too much mucus, slow pulse, and pale face. In general, warm conditions are treated with cooling herbs, and cold conditions are treated with warming herbs. It makes sense. Herbs that give energy and strength and activate circulation are warming. Herbs that make us sweat, urinate, or feel calm are cooling (Table 10.6).

### Moisture: Wet to Dry

In the human body, the degree of moisture or dryness affects the tissues and our health. We contain about 60% water. How many times have you been told to drink more water? Water is held in the body in two main compartments: our intracellular fluids (ICF) within the cell and extracellular fluids (ECF) in fluid compartments outside the cells. The balance of ICF to ECF is very important in physiology. Normally, the kidneys do a brilliant and miraculous job of balancing fluids. When dehydrated, water is retained, urine becomes concentrated and dark, and there is thirst. As we hydrate, our urine becomes lighter and less concentrated, and there is less thirst. Lymphatic circulation, which begins at the capillary level, brings excess ECF back to the heart for recycling.

It is easy to get out of fluid balance. The external environment, weather, and humidity take its toll. We experience dry skin in the low humidity of Colorado or moist dewy skin in wet, humid New Jersey. Stress can make us dry. Infections, such as a flu virus, can make the mucous membranes secrete more than their share. The inflammatory cascade brings fluids to places of injury, causing painful ECF swelling as the blood receives toxins it must remove and replace with nutrients. Dryness can make us constipated. Damp can cause diarrhea. Menopause and aging cause drying when mucous membranes have fewer secretions. Infection with fluid build-up makes us damp. Intestinal permeability causes dampness in the gut, which is called Spleen damp.

Fortunately, we have an arsenal of herbs in various categories to regulate damp and dry conditions. For drier-uppers in the astringent or cell-tightening category, there are anhidrotics, like Garden Sage, which stop excess sweating; there are antidiarrheals like Oak bark for loose stools; stiptics like Cranesbill Geranium herb for excess bleeding; there are mucostatics like Goldenrod herb to dry respiratory secretions. Diuretics like Dandelion root and leaf help with edema by stimulating urination.

In the moistening category for dry conditions, an array of demulcents are sweet, moist, and nutritive. The classic Western moisturizer for all organ systems is Marshmallow root. There is also Iceland moss thallus or Slippery Elm bark for the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, Chickweed herb for reproductive dryness, or Comfrey root for wounds and wound healing.

If something is damp or wet, it gets soaked. If something is soaked, it gets heavy and bogged down and can take a long time to dry out. In Chinese Medicine, this dampness leads to a blockage called stagnation. Signs of dampness in the body are phlegm, edema, bloating, and discharges. Skin can ooze or crust, as in eczema. A person feels heavy and may become dizzy. As things become heavy, gravity pulls downward. If damp combines with heat, there is damp heat, indicated by dark, burning urine; thick, foul-smelling stools; yellow vaginal discharges; or jaundice. These symptoms occur in the lower part of the body. Causes can be cold, uncooked or greasy foods, and large amounts of dairy and ice cream, which can cause excess mucus.

If damp combines with cold, there is damp cold. In damp cold, we see pale, scanty urine; hard constipation with mucus; and clear discharges. Damp can also combine with external forces from outside the body, such as wind. If wind and damp affect the joints, there is wind damp joint pain, as in arthritis affected by barometric pressure. If wind and damp affect the respiratory system, there could be wind damp cold or even wind damp heat, as in a common cold.

One remedy for damp conditions in Chinese Medicine is to use bitter-tasting foods which have a draining property. Leafy green vegetables like kale, mustard greens, dandelion greens, parsley, and celery are good examples of bitter foods that drain damp. Citrus peels are bitter, so if they are added to meat dishes, they can help reduce dampness. Turnips, radish, kohlrabi, asparagus, and broccoli do this also. The Chinese also use pungent, stimulating, and aromatic herbs and diuretics, a favorite being the fungus Poria Fu Ling (Hoelen fungus), to dry up damp.

## The Six Secondary Energetic Qualities: Stimulate-Sedate, Restore-Relax, Moisten-Decongest

The six Secondary Qualities give the key to choosing herbs to treat basic conditions or problems in the body. This group gives a specific clue as to which remedy to use. Herbs with these secondary herbal qualities are used to treat a person having the opposite condition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Energetics of Stimulating: Dispersing, Circulating

To stimulate or disperse in herbalism means to create movement in the body because of cold conditions. As things become cold, they slow down, causing stagnation and lack of flow. We need to move things along. If blood needs moving, we would use arterial stimulants. If lymphatic fluid were sluggish, we would use lymph circulators. A person might feel sleepy or sluggish because of deficient qi and so would require nerve stimulation. An organ might slow down, becoming sluggish and deficient, as can occur when the liver’s detoxification processes need a boost, so liver stimulants would be used. The small intestine might require digestive enzyme stimulation. A muscle could slow down, be in spasm, and need a relaxant to disperse the tightness. A cough might be unproductive, requiring a stimulating decongestant. All of these examples require stimulating herbs.

Stimulants are warm and pungent. They have an outward energy. They loosen what is stuck, creating movement. The result is a warming effect as they relax, invigorate, and loosen what was sluggish and tight.7 From the Chinese Medicine standpoint, to stimulate is to tonify yang: warm the interior, transform damp, drain damp, and restore the Liver and Kidney.5

<!-- chunk -->

### Energetics of Sedating: Reduce Infection, Heat, or Hyperactivity

To sedate means to treat excessively hot conditions or hyperactivity. We want to reduce heat in the body and slow things down. We could cool down a very hot infection or calm a hyperactive person. For these purposes, we use cool or cold herbs. Please don’t get the quality of sedating mixed up with the quality of relaxing. In allopathic medicine, sedatives calm down the nervous system, but not here. Herbs that sedate are always cooling or cold. Relaxants treat tense conditions of the nervous system and can be either warming or cooling.

In Chinese Medicine, hot conditions are considered excess yang. Sedative herbs clear heat, damp heat, and toxic heat, and they calm the spirit.5

<!-- chunk -->

### Energetics of Restoring: Tonifying, Nourishing, Building

Restoratives are sweet. They build tissue bulk, nourish, strengthen, and treat weak conditions. This concept is paramount in all herbal medicine traditions. It sustains health and preserves life. All other therapies are dependent on this. Restoratives can treat cells in general, or they can be directed to specific organs for nutritional deficiencies.

The physio-medicalists, like William Cooke, called the nutritive remedies trophorestoratives, which are superlative remedies with an affinity for particular organs and tissues and targets them specifically. Burdock root and Horsetail herb have a tropism to the skin. The liver attracts Dandelion root and Milk Thistle seed. The nervous system leans toward Schisandra Wu Wei Zi (Five Taste berry) or Milky Oat berry. Kidneys go for Goldenrod or Parsley herb. The heart likes Hawthorn berry. Trophorestoratives help the body function and increase metabolism, absorption, and the body’s resistance to organisms. They help one overcome conditions that are weakening, such as anemia, chronic illness, malnutrition, dehydration, and fatigue.

Western herbalism claims countless restorative herbs (Tables 10.7 and 10.8). Some of these are general superfoods that nourish the entire body rather than having a particular tropism, such as Blue Green algae or Bee Pollen.

One can augment or tonify the qi, nourish the blood, and enrich yin or yang.5 They tend to be warming and nourishing. They can be used over long periods of time, and rather than treat an illness, they strengthen the body to keep us healthy. They are known as the imperial herbs, revered over the centuries and highly valued.

Qi tonics are energy tonics that increase physiological energy production, but they are not stimulants. Qi tonics help the body function optimally, increase vitality, help nutrient absorption, and oxygenate through the lungs. Energy in the form of oxygen then circulates through the meridian system, providing the basic energy needed to live well.7

Blood tonics nourish the blood, so the blood can bring nutrients to the cells. They help with anemia, particularly in menstruating women who lose blood monthly. Some blood tonics increase circulation.

Yin tonics nourish fluids and soft tissues, keeping them moist. Moisture is associated with the Chinese Kidney, and yin tonics are related to jing (essence), the energy stored in the Kidney. These tonics are important antiaging and longevity herbs, especially for women in menopause who need more moisture.

Yang tonics provide power and energy. They use the stored yin energy of the Chinese Kidneys and employ it to build will power and creativity, stimulate metabolism, and strengthen muscles and bones of the back, knees, and joints. Yang tonics are used by athletes. Some yang tonics are aphrodisiacs, and energetically they are considered warm or hot.

### Energetics of Relaxing: Relax Nervous System, Circulate Qi or Blood

Relaxants treat tense, restrained conditions in the body. Herbs that are spasmolytics, anticonvulsants, and muscle relaxants all have a relaxing action. Tense can manifest as pain caused by tight skeletal muscles, high blood pressure caused by smooth muscle constriction in arterial linings, menstrual cramps caused by smooth muscle constriction of the uterine linings, coughing caused by spasms of the bronchi, stomach aches from smooth muscle constriction of the gut, a tension headache from constricted blood flow to the head, or seizures. A person could be tense from stress, anxiety, fear, or worry, which could cause insomnia.

In the Chinese sense, by relaxing, we circulate the qi, subdue Liver yang, release the exterior, and extinguish internal wind.5 We treat excess conditions characterized by hyper-functioning and tension.

From the Western perspective, we might use the category of pungent spasmolytics to stop a cough or bronchodilators to relax the respiratory tree in a cough. A general Western classification, relaxing nervines refer to herbs that relax the nervous system. These herbs could be hot or cold in quality. If one were picking a good relaxing nervine, it would be best to choose a cooling one for a hot condition and vice versa. In general, nervines are a broad class of herbs that affect the nervous system in many ways: relaxing it, cooling it down, warming it up, strengthening, and harmonizing (Table 10.10).

### Energetics of Moistening: Soothing, Tonify Yin

In Western herbalism, herbs that moisturize and create wetness and lubrication treat dry conditions. They are known as demulcents; they taste sweet or bland; their warmth is neutral to cooling; and they are harmonizing, soothing, and antiinflammatory.5 A urinary tract infection is usually accompanied by pain on urination (dysuria). The formula would include a demulcent to relieve redness and burning, such as Marshmallow root or Slippery Elm bark. A dry cough makes the throat raw, dry, and sore. That cough formula needs herbs such as Comfrey root, Iceland Moss thallus, or Licorice root, all specific to relieving lung dryness and moistening the mucosa. For irritable bowel disease and inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, a GI demulcent would be in order. General considerations for demulcent usage are:

Often, demulcents are nourishing (or nutritive) and moistening. Nutritive demulcents promote secretion of fluids, moisten and nourish mucus membranes, and reduce low-level inflammation and fever. Iceland Moss and Irish Moss thallus nourish the lungs and gut and help heal damaged tissue. Licorice root restores the mucosal lining of the intestines and restores respiratory tract lining. Comfrey root and leaf restores lung tissue and is famous for wound repair, frequently found in first-aid creams.

In Chinese Medicine, moisturizing, demulcent herbs are said to tonify the yin and relieve dryness. The body’s fluids and moisture are part of the yin, so dry conditions are considered a yin deficiency. Demulcent lubricating herbs are used, such as Prunus Xing Ren (Apricot seed) or Perilla Zi Su Zi (Perilla seed) for the lungs, or Flax seed and Psyllium seed for the intestines. Western herbs that nourish the yin and moisten dryness are found chiefly in the Plantain family (Plantaginaceae), the Mallow family (Malvaceae), and the Grass family (Poaceae).

### Energetics of Decongesting: Breaking Up, Removing Stagnation

Decongestants break things up; therefore, they treat damp conditions where excessive fluid has built up in the body. Taste-wise, they tend to be pungent, bitter, or bland.5 Damp (either damp heat or damp cold) is resolved by using herbs that decongest wherever excess fluid has accumulated. This fluid can be in the form of blood and lymph, mucus, or discharges occurring in many body systems. It can occur in any system where mucous membranes exist: respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, or reproductive. In general, decongestants cover a range of herbal actions and cover an array of phytochemicals.

Astringent mucus decongestants work on loosening and diminishing lung or GI secretions, like Goldenrod herb, Thyme herb, and Sage leaf. Some are nonastringent plants high in essential oil glycosides, like Cayenne fruit and Yerba Mansa herb. Others are herbs with high polysaccharide content, such as Iceland Moss thallus or Lungwort lichen. Circulatory stimulants move blood away from the affected area, as in Prickly Ash bark or Tangerine peel. Intestinal mucus overproduction might occur in the stool, in abdominal distention, and in indigestion, possibly from enteritis, irritable bowel, colitis, ulcers, or the yeast infection Candida albicans.

Respiratory decongestants are used when mucus is seen in the respiratory tree and sinuses, as a result of inflammation and irritation from an infection or allergy, excess dairy consumption, drugs, stress, chronic illness, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and dysbiosis. The membranes lose normal tone and oversecrete sputum. In the old days it was called catarrh. Westerners call the condition congestion, and Chinese Medicine calls it phlegm damp.

Excess mucus in the urine or reproductive system could be from urinary tract infection, vaginal infections, and discharges. In these cases, primary herbs would be used to resolve the cause/root of the problem, such as antimicrobials or gut restoratives. Decongestants, diuretics, astringents, and lymphatic circulators would be added as secondary herbs to dry damp and heal and tighten tissue. An herb of particular interest is Ceanothus spp. (Red Root). It is a cooling astringent filled with alkaloids and acids that clears damp heat by tightening veins, capillaries, and lymphatics, particularly in the uterus and liver.4 By this action, lymph is moved (decongested) and returned to blood circulation, so excess dampness can be ultimately eliminated through the kidneys. In the same manner, Red Root can reduce nonfibrous ovarian and breast cysts by clearing lymphatic stagnation. It takes work to wildcraft, as evidenced in Table 10.12.

Blood decongestants are used when blood pools in the lower extremities, slows down, and eventually clots, causing varicose veins or deep vein thrombosis (phlebitis) in the legs or in the rectal area causing hemorrhoids. Blood can also pool in the pelvic basin from deficient venous flow or decreased lymph circulation, causing cramps. Blood decongestants are generally astringent, cool, and dry. They contain many tissue-tightening tannins, organic acids, and flavonoids and work in three ways:

Blood decongestants are called for when blood pools in the extremely vascular uterus, resulting in dysmenorrhea or menstrual pain. Bleeding increases, but if it moves slowly enough, clots form (stagnation). If the situation continues, there is danger of fibroid tumors, endometriosis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (Chapter 28). There are five herbal approaches in cases of menstrual pain that cover many of the herbal categories we have been discussing (Box 10.4).

Box 10.4

Five Herbal Actions for Treating Dysmenorrhea

When treating menstrual cramps, uterus blood congestion, and/or dysmenorrhea (all the same thing), five herbal actions that include three types of blood movers could be used. And all these for only one symptom.

Additionally, two more actions might be called upon:

Note: If blood were to become very thick or stagnate to the point of a clot, anticoagulant herbs would be required. Melilot herb, Cleavers herb, Ginger root, and Ligusticum Chuan Xiong (Sichuan Lovage root) are all anticoagulants, but none are decongestants.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue-Level Qualities or Descriptions: Astringing, Eliminating, Solidifying, Dissolving, Thickening, Diluting

The group of tissue-level qualities are Western descriptions of what herbs actually do to the tissues. In fact, these action words were used by the 19th-century Western physiomedicalists. Tissue-level qualities are really subdivisions of the Six Secondary Qualities, discussed earlier. Many Western herb books categorize in this manner, using allopathic-type expressions such as laxative or expectorant. These are helpful terms when choosing an herb needed for one specific action—and handy concepts to understand. Much of this material is presented in convenient herb chart format that can be referred to later when making up formulas. It will aid in finding a proper herb in the correct category.

In real life, most conditions require more than one category of herbs. Just because clients have a dry condition doesn’t mean they require only a moistener like Slippery Elm bark. Herbalists don’t just chase symptoms. The whole person must be considered, and the formula should include other herbs to balance it out and get to the root or cause. One might ask, “Why are they dry? Is it interior or exterior? What organ or tissue is dry?” A little detective work helps determine what else is needed in a formula.

Some herbs fit more than one quality. This versatility is because a plant contains many chemicals, each responsible for something different. Yarrow herb is a famous example, containing countless constituents and actions. The chemical listing takes up eight full lines in Holmes’ Energetics of Western Herbs4 and 46 lines, three columns for each line, in Stephen Buhner’s The Lost language of Plants.9 Buhner was referencing another renown herbalist, James Duke. All this was as of 1992! The qualities or actions of Yarrow are stimulating, decongesting, astringing, restoring, and relaxing. It dries mucus, stops discharges, restores kidneys, stops urinary incontinence, promotes sweating, and stops bleeding. This versatile herb can obviously be used for many functions. In terms of space, it is economical to select herbs in a formula that can address more than one need. Tissue-level qualities or actions are:

<!-- chunk -->

### Astringing

Astringents tighten tissue and mucous membranes and stop discharges, ultimately strengthening the tissue (Table 10.13). For this reason, they are drying. Anhidrotics limit sweating; antidiarrheals slow excess stool; mucostatics reduce mucous secretion; hemostatics stop bleeding (Table 10.14).

### Eliminating: Includes Expectorants, Diaphoretics, Emmenagogues, Diuretics, Laxatives

Herbs that eliminate work to break up, move, and remove several things. They are generally pungent and stimulating. They break up stasis of fluids causing edema, sweat, skin rashes, stasis of stool, bronchial sputum, and lack of menses.5 Mucolytics/mucostatics break up thick mucus. Expectorants move mucus up and out. Diaphoretics create sweating, thus removing water and wastes from the skin. Emmenagogues increase menstrual flow. Diuretics increase urine flow. Laxatives increase and move stool down.

<!-- chunk -->

### Expectorants

Expectorants break up mucus and stimulate it to be expelled from the lungs. They are used to treat congestion. Infectious mucus, containing toxins from bacteria and viruses, can make us septic if it remains in the lungs. We need to cough it up and get it out. Expectorants come in warm, cold, and mucolytic varieties (Table 10.15).

Sometimes the essential oils of Hyssop or Thyme and others are mixed with a neutral carrier oil, such as Olive or Almond oil, and rubbed onto the chest. Elecampane root, Horseradish root, or Fennel seed are other possibilities.

Cooling, stimulating expectorants are pungent, cool, and sedating. They are used for sputum with infection. They are used when heat is present, with fever, yellow-green sputum, chills, and muscle aches. Cooling expectorants disinfect and clear infection, stop inflammation, and break up mucus. Eucalyptus leaf, White Horehound herb, or Thyme herb are examples.

Mucolytic expectorants break up thick, viscous, and scanty sputum. In respiratory infections, the lungs naturally produce extra sputum because there is irritation on the membranes that creates coughing. This extra sputum must be eliminated. Mucolytic expectorants change a dry, hacky, unproductive cough into one that is wet and productive. They get out the gunk. This effect is because of their saponin content. Saponins act as emulsifiers, helping oily constituents dissolve in water, like soap. Soapwort root is named for this quality and contains both saponins and mucilage. It bubbles up and lathers when mixed in water, breaking up stubborn, thick mucus.2

### Diaphoretics to Dispel External Wind

Diaphoretics make us sweat, cool us down, and treat external wind conditions. They are spicy, pungent, stimulating, and vasodilating.4 Sudoriferous or sweat glands are located in the dermis and subcutaneous layers of the skin. Sweating occurs when the internal temperature becomes too hot. Blood vessels dilate, bringing more warm blood to the surface, causing the release of moisture. As heat is drawn from the skin, we are cooled down (Table 10.16).

Sweating has been used therapeutically in many cultures. Hydrotherapy (water) with the use of either dry or damp heat makes us sweat. The Native American tradition of a dry sweat lodge, Finnish and Swedish dry heat saunas, Turkish hot steam baths, mineral baths, and hot springs from many countries are all examples. The ancient Roman baths of Caracalla are famous.

Sweating cools us down and drives out toxins, and it is very healing. Think of colds, flus, sinusitis, laryngitis, and other respiratory conditions accompanied by chills, sneezing, sore throat, headache, and possibly a fever. Onset of these ills are initially treated by sweating it out, either by hydrotherapy or by herbs that do the trick (Chapter 20).

Pungent warm stimulating diaphoretics treat or dispel external wind cold conditions. As discussed earlier, external wind comes from the environment (exogenous) and invades our body. External wind cold comes in the form of acute infections, usually from bacteria or viruses. Wind cold produces no fever, very little inflammation, clear or white discharges, and little sweating. P is floating and tight, and T is normal or pale. For this cold situation, we need pungent, warm arterial stimulant diaphoretics like Garlic Bulb or Zingiber Sheng Jiang (Fresh Ginger rhizome) decocted in tea.

Pungent, cool relaxant diaphoretics treat external wind heat conditions. Wind heat has fever, sweating, inflammation, and yellow or greenish discharges, all indicating infection. These symptoms indicate inflammation. The suffix “itis” means “inflammation of” – examples being bronchitis, laryngitis, and sinusitis. P Fast, wiry. T Red. For this hot condition, we need cool, peripheral vasodilating diaphoretics to help us sweat, such as Catnip herb, Field Mint herb, Elder flower, or Yarrow herb.4

Fevers are not necessarily bad. They actually help the immune system fight infection by stimulating the production of leukocytes (a white blood cell), antibodies, cytokines (inflammation fighters), and a virus-fighting protein called interferon, all of which work to protect the body against harmful microorganisms. Germs have a hard time surviving with high core temperatures. As a fever increases, the body naturally sweats to cool us down. That natural process is augmented with herbs.

### Emmenagogues

Emmenagogues are uterine stimulants that increase uterine contractions and increase menstrual flow. They can bring on a period that is a few days late because of disruptions in lifestyle or travel. Emmenagogues come in varying strengths (Table 10.17). Some work through bitter stimulation, and others work through localized irritation.3 If a woman is pregnant, emmenagogues do not work. They will not cause miscarriages.

### Diuretics

The kidneys are amazing. They maintain proper fluid balance, which is essential for good health. Urine becomes dark and concentrated when the body is dehydrated. With more hydration, the urine becomes lighter and dilute. The kidneys maintain proper internal fluid balance without conscious thought. They work with the liver, lungs, skin, and bowels to maintain a nontoxic internal environment. The kidneys dispose of excess waste through the urine and help maintain the acid-base balance of the blood.

Herbs that promote urination are the diuretics. Whenever there is too much fluid in the body, the Chinese Medicine condition is damp. P Slippery. T Wet, scalloped or thick and greasy. Diuretics increase the flow and elimination of fluids through urination and therefore are one way to reduce watery damp. In general, the criteria listed here all are indications for the use of diuretics:

Diuretics may be put into various categories, depending on action desired (Table 10.18). Sometimes it is useful to combine diuretic herbs in a given formula from more than one category to assure that the bases are covered.

### Laxatives

Mild herbs that promote bowel movements are known as laxatives, whereas the very strong ones are known as purgatives. Galenic physicians misused purgatives in ancient Greece. Eclectic physicians such as Scudder and Webster of the 19th century followed suit and were known for heavy, dramatic purges and the use of calomel, the highly toxic mercurous chloride.

Herbalists today are much more careful and conservative. Stronger purgatives are only used in extreme cases, for short duration. Before any laxative is given, make sure clients are consuming adequate fluids, exercising, and eating a fiber-rich diet. Strong stimulant laxatives, like Senna leaf and pod, can be habit-forming and should be given only for short periods, in the lowest dose possible, for stubborn unresponsive cases. Laxative dependency is all too common. Laxatives work to increase peristalsis in a variety of ways (Table 10.19).4 Further details on laxatives are discussed in Chapter 18.

### Solidifying

Tissue that is weak or poorly toned needs to be more dense, solid, and strong. Solidifying herbs work primarily on all types of connective tissue, where many weaknesses can occur. The bones may become soft in the form of osteopenia and osteoporosis, gums may soften, and teeth loosen or fall out. Weak veins cause hemorrhoids or varicosities. The mitral valve in the heart can prolapse. Subluxations, misalignments of the vertebrae, occur because of ligament weakness. A weak anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the four main ligaments in the knee that connect the femur to the tibia; if it tears, it pushes the knee painfully out of alignment.

The uterus or bladder can prolapse, fall downward, and protrude into the vagina. It sags because of stretched-out ligaments that are normally tight and elastic. Western medicine attributes uterine prolapse to excessive pushing in labor, a history of having large babies, or being overweight. Allopathic treatment surgically tightens supporting ligaments. In Chinese Medicine, the Spleen holds tissues and organs in their correct place and is the organ responsible for giving strength and power to connective tissue. Therefore treatment for prolapse is to strengthen or tonify the Spleen. The syndrome is known as Spleen Qi Deficiency.

Other approaches to solidify tissue are with the use of nutritive herbs that provide the vitamins, minerals, and trace minerals needed to build connective tissue. The list in Table 10.20 divides herbs into categories for solidifying and strengthening various tissues of the body.

### Dissolving

Dissolvents soften hardened deposits or tissue. Many contain trace minerals to help this along. Gallstones require dissolvents that have an affinity for the liver. Kidney stones require those with a tropism to the kidneys. Some dissolvents work on fibrosis, which is scarring and thickening that can affect nerves, bones, or blood vessels. This condition could manifest as a thickening of the nerves in a Morton’s neuroma between the third and fourth metatarsal. Bones can fibrose and thicken into extra calcifications called bone spurs. Arterial walls can fibrose, becoming hard and nonelastic. Other conditions where dissolvents are important are fibroid tumors, cysts, and polyps. Mucolytic expectorants that break up mucus are actually dissolvents. Types of dissolvents are listed here, and herbs in those categories include (Table 10.21):

### Thickening

Nutritive restoratives thicken tissues and build them up by nourishing deficiencies. They are for conditions of malnutrition, malabsorption, degenerative diseases, alcohol abuse with malnutrition, chronic illness, and deficient dry conditions. Most of these herbs are sweet and healing and build up tissue.5 They were addressed earlier under the sweet taste and tonics but can be broken down into more specific tropisms (Table 10.22).

### Diluting

The diluting quality treats fluid hyperviscosity. Herbs that are diluting are used for thinning out thick, congealed, or fatty blood, or for lymph node swellings. They help Western maladies such as hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, swollen lymph glands, viscous sputum, menstrual clots, and intestinal mucus. They decrease blood clotting factors. Many of these herbs have a detoxifying effect as well and would be useful as a detoxicant assist in treating tumors (Table 10.23).

## An Experiment in Energetics: Organoleptic Evaluations

Have you ever wondered how herbalists over the centuries came up with the energetics of a plant? How did they figure this out long before we knew anything about chemistry and constituents? The fancy word for doing this is organoleptics, which means judging the potency, quality, and phytochemical composition of an herb or preparation by using the senses.

Obviously, energetic information had to come from frequent investigation and experimentation. Herbalists use their senses and instincts, just as animals do. It is a conscious act that takes learning and practice. A quiet, darkened room, with other sensory stimuli kept at a minimum, helps one focus in on the herb being evaluated. It is interesting to do this in a group and then compare notes on what each person determined.

Organoleptics is about our own experience with a plant or herb. If you truly sit with an herb, feel it, taste it, and learn its energy, you will know and understand that herb. When that happens, you will never forget the personality and properties of said plant and will not have to memorize anything. Over time, we have lost this ability but can regain the skill by relearning and training ourselves. Doing so can also help evaluate the quality of our own homemade remedies—or anyone else’s. Always give your product the smell and taste test.

It is very interesting to practice detecting an herb’s energetics before you are told what it is. Don’t read the label. Don’t check out your plant identification book. Don’t worry what the experts say. Above all, don’t be concerned if your evaluation doesn’t match the official opinion. Try putting a couple of drops of a tincture or tea on your tongue and sit and meditate with it in a quiet space. Give it some time. Allow the sensations to come to you. Herbalist Lisa Ganora suggests using the “wolf snort.” Ganora writes, “Rather than politely and delicately sniffing a plant or extract, smell it as a wolf or dog would: repeatedly puff air out of your nose (to vaporize the compounds with warmth) and draw the vapor cloud deeply back inside….”2 Similarly, when you taste a plant, chew the material thoroughly, moving it around in your mouth until you have fully experienced its character. Then just spit it out if you don’t want to ingest it.

Note: If you do taste testing in the field, please rule out anything poisonous first, such as: Poison Ivy, Poison Oak, all plant parts of Datura stramonium (Jimson Weed), Conium maculatum (Poison Hemlock), or Cicuta maculata (Water Hemlock). In fact, no taste testing allowed whatsoever unless you are positive of identification or if you are with a pal who is in the know. Always work with an accurately identified and safe plant.

By doing these taste and smell exercises, you are learning to feel and detect the energetics for yourself before any book or authority tells you the answer.


The way we classify, categorize, and arrange herbs is by their energetics. The Chinese speak of hot-cold, dry-damp, strong-weak, and their qualities, such as stimulating or relaxing. Westerners think more about actions—what an herb does. Understanding both will be helpful when building herbal formulas and making herbal choices.

The Three Primary Qualities or characteristics are taste, warmth, and moisture—basic concepts in Chinese and Ayurvedic systems. Sweet builds and restores. Sour draws inward and tightens. Bitter is cold, pulls down, and fights microorganisms. Salty dissolves lumps and drains downward. Pungent is warm, pushes outward, and can help circulation. A warm herb is used for cold; a cooling herb for warmth. Drying herbs dry damp conditions, and moisteners cool and lubricate a dry, hot condition.

The Six Secondary Qualities are stimulate-sedate, restore-relax, and moisten-decongest. They denote actions. Stimulating makes an organ work harder. Sedating herbs are cooling. Restoring herbs are nutritive. Relaxants calm the nervous system. Moisteners add wetness, and decongestants break up thicknesses.

Tissue-Level Qualities are subdivisions of the Secondary Qualities: astringing-eliminating, solidifying-dissolving, and thickening-diluting. These are active and descriptive terms, categories discussed in Western herbalism. Astringents tighten and slow discharges or bleeding. Eliminating herbs remove substances from the body, such as stool (laxatives), urine (diuretics), or mucus (mucolytic expectorants). Solidifiers strengthen and make something harder. Dissolvents soften deposits and break up stones (litholytics). Thickeners restore (nourish). Dilutants thin blood (anticoagulants) or mucus (mucolytics).

Organoleptics refers to judging the potency, quality, and phytochemical composition of an herb or preparation by using the senses. It is the primary way herbs were understood over the centuries. If we can learn to do this for ourselves, our understanding and true ownership of a plant will increase.

A Materia Medica is an herbal list of medicinal plants that literally means the materials of medicine. This chapter provides a minimal Materia Medica, a collection of plants important to have in any apothecary. Most are Western, and some come from the Chinese and Ayurvedic traditions. All are easily obtainable commercially. Some, like Ginger root and Licorice root, are cultural crossovers used all over the world. Others are specific to a certain place, probably because the plant originally grew and was used there. A precise format is followed, providing thorough information for each botanical. These formats are called monographs and reflect current herbal usage. Because medical herbalism is an ever-changing field, herbal indications, dosages, and drug interactions may change as new research dictates. Always check with the latest reliable sources.

Who are your herbal allies? Choosing a Materia Medica is very personal. It’s hard to leave favorites behind. Ask any herbalist, and you’ll get a different list, because we all have our go-to herbs and complain bitterly if a beloved plant is left out. In the school I ran, lively discussions arose on which to choose.

You can’t have them all. Through time and experience, you will begin to use certain herbs constantly, requiring frequent replacement, whereas others languish, forlorn and forgotten. That’s when your true allies reveal themselves. It is best to begin with a classic variety that can cover all body systems and treat many common conditions. We can get esoteric and fancy, but perhaps 50 or so tinctures with their dry herbal counterparts are a decent starting point. You can always expand later on.

### Tips for Learning Herbs

When learning about herbs, always give the part used along with its name. This information is important. Magnolia Xin Yi Hua, (Magnolia bud) is an upper respiratory nasal decongestant, whereas Magnolia Hou Po (Magnolia root) reduces colic and relaxes the middle burner in gastrointestinal (GI) conditions. Ginger is always used in root or root peel form, not leaf or flower. Also, say the botanical Latin name out loud, along with a plant’s common name to help jog the memory. In the case of Chinese herbs, speak and practice the pinyin name and its pronunciation.

### Materia Medica Format and Descriptions

The following provides an outline with their explanations of each aspect of our monographs.

## Monographs

<!-- chunk -->

### Actaea racemosa L. Sheng Ma (Black Cohosh root)

Trigger words. * Muscle/nervous relaxant * PMS * Estrogenic *

Botanical name. Actaea racemosa L. (formerly Cimicifuga racemosa L. Nutt) (Fig. 11.1)

Common name. Black Cohosh

Less common names. Black Snakeroot, Bugbane, Squawroot

Pinyin name. Sheng Ma

Family. Ranunculaceae (Buttercup)

Part used. Fresh or dried rhizome with attached roots

Editorial. Do not confuse Black Cohosh with Caulophyllum thalictroides (Blue Cohosh root), which is chiefly used for labor and delivery. Blue Cohosh is an indispensable go-to remedy for many women’s conditions, sometimes used to induce labor, if begun 2 to 3 weeks before due date. Black Cohosh has become one of the largest-selling herbal dietary supplements in the United States (and in Germany under the name Remifemin) for reducing menopausal symptoms. It’s especially nice for women who have accompanying cramps, muscle aches, and pains. Black Cohosh also combines well with St. John’s Wort in PMS, when accompanied by anxiety and depression.

Native American women used it for menstrual problems, pregnancy, and childbirth; Eclectic John King lauded its properties in the 1840s when it was used routinely among nurses, midwives, and doctors for women’s complaints and arthritic pain. The Eclectics also used it as a uterine tonic in the last few weeks of pregnancy, and it even turned up in Lydia Pinkham’s famous Vegetable Compound of the era for menstrual stress. In Chinese Medicine, it is used completely differently than in the West. Here, Actaea Sheng Ma is used to vent rashes, especially in measles (being cooling and drying), to help with head pain (analgesic property), and to help raise spleen qi (improve digestion) when combined with Astragalus Huang Qi.

### Achillea millefolium L. (Yarrow herb)

Trigger words. * Astringent * Diaphoretic * Antiseptic *

Botanical name. Achillea millefolium L. (Fig. 11.2)

Common name. Yarrow

Less common names. Milfoil, Thousand leaf, Nosebleed

Pinyin name. None.

Family. Asteraceae/Compositae/Daisy

Part used. Herb

Editorial. Yarrow is chemically rich with many uses. It got its name from the Greek hero, Achilles, who used it to treat his soldiers’ wounds in battle because it conveniently grows everywhere. Its astringency, because of the alkaloid achilleine, shortens bleeding time.8 Yarrow is a great addition to first-aid kits or to pick in the wild for use as a poultice. (If you can’t find Yarrow, you might find some Plantain leaves for the same purpose.) Yarrow leaves can be rubbed on the skin as an insect repellent or diffused in a tea to rinse your hair.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bupleurum chinensis de Candolle Chai Hu (Asian Buplever root)

Trigger words. * Liver Protective/Tonic * Muscle relaxant * Chills/fever * Antiviral *

Botanical name. Bupleurum chinensis de Candolle, B. falcatum L. (Fig. 11.3)

Common name. Asian Buplever root

Less Common name. Hare’s ear

Pinyin name. Chai Hu

Family. Umbelliferae

Part used. Root

Editorial. Bupleurum has many uses. A good go-to liver protective herb that nicely combines with Milk Thistle seed and Dandelion root. With regard to the liver, it can also be used as a protectant and antiviral in hepatitis. In that case, combine with Scutellaria Huang Qin (Baikal Skullcap root) and Turmeric root. For colds and flu, it not only fights infection and lowers fever but stimulates immune function. Last, it has the advantage of being a sedative-relaxant, helping muscle pain, spasms, inflammation, menstrual cramps, and headaches, and it is a nice choice in PMS for the woman who could always use some liver protection along with relief from her aches and pains.

One of the most widely researched Chinese herbal formulas is Minor Bupleurum, known in Japanese Kampo tradition as Sho-Saiko-To. This herbal combination has been used for over a thousand years and is probably the most popular herbal formula in Japan today. Although it contains herbs other than Bupleurum, it is used for many Chai Hu-sounding indications such as immune stimulation, treating acute and chronic hepatitis C, protection against radiation therapy, as an antiallergenic, for prolonged flu and colds, and for chronic digestive problems.

### Crataegus spp. L. Shan Zha (Hawthorn berry)

Trigger words. * Number one Western heart tonic *

Botanical name. Crataegus oxyacantha L., Crataegus pinnatifida Bunge and others (Fig. 11.4).

Common names. Hawthorn berry, Asian Hawthorn berry

Less common names. Hedgethorn, Maybush, Haw, Redhaw

Pinyin name. Shan Zha

Family. Rosaceae (Rose)

Part used. The berry, flower, and leaf

Editorial. Hawthorn is the Western heart tonic. Hawthorn berry’s actions, which increase force of heart contractions and decrease heart rate, are exactly what is needed for the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF). This is the exact action of the drug digitalis, but in a milder and safer form. Combine Hawthorn with the stronger medium-strength Lily of the Valley herb, and you have an excellent early-onset CHF remedy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Curcuma longa L. Jiang Huang (Turmeric root)

Trigger words. * Antiinflammatory * Digestion * Alzheimer’s * Insulin resistance * Bitter *

Botanical name. Curcuma longa L. (Fig. 11.5)

Common Name. Turmeric root

Less common names. Wild Zedoary, Constrained Gold, Indian Saffron

Pinyin name. Jiang Huang

Family. Zingiberaceae

Part used. Root

Editorial. Turmeric has long been used in Ayurvedic and Chinese Medicine, and it is now very popular in the West. It is classic in China for liver and gallbladder congestion and inflammation. Research has been done for its preventative action in Alzheimer’s and other dementias, as well as for insulin resistance, due to its bitter taste. It was shown to suppress inflammation and beta amyloid plaque accumulation in the brain, which builds up in Alzheimer’s.11 In India, incidence of that disease is low because of the prevalence of Turmeric in curry dishes, a dietary staple. Eat more curry.

<!-- chunk -->

### Echinacea spp. de Candolle (Echinacea root)

Trigger words. * Antiinfective/clears toxic heat * Immuno-stimulant * Vulnerary *

Botanical name. Echinacea angustifolia de Candolle, E. Purpurea Moench, E. pallida Nuttall (Figs. 11.6 and 11.7)

Common name. Purple Coneflower

Less common names. Comb Flower, Kansas Snake Root

Pinyin name. None.

Family. Asteraceae (Compositae or Daisy)

Part used. Usually the root, also the flower. (Root most common and considered stronger by many herbalists.)

Editorial. Echinacea was the most popular plant sold in the United States from 1995 to 1998. It is native to the Americas and was used by Native Americans and by Eclectic physicians in the late 1800s and early 1900s. There has been much debate in herbal circles as to which species, plant part, and preparation type does what, and which variety is best. The American Botanical Council (ABC) says there’s enough research to support the safety and effectiveness of preparations made from both the aerial parts of E. purpurea and the roots of E. pallida and E. purpurea, and possibly, E. angustifolia.12 The commercial price of E. angustifolia root far exceeds the cost of E. purpurea root. E. pallida is rarely offered in catalogs. Our precious Echinacea spp. is an endangered plant. Please use only cultivated varieties.

### Ginkgo biloba L. Yin Xing Ye (Ginkgo leaf)

Trigger words. * Neuroprotective * Enhances microcirculation * Alzheimer's/dementia *

Botanical name. Ginkgo biloba L.

Common name. Ginkgo (Figs. 11.8 and 11.9)

Less common names. Maidenhair tree

Pinyin name. Yin Xing Ye (leaf), Yin Gao (nut)

Family. Ginkgoaceae (Ginkgo)

Part used. The leaf. In Chinese Medicine, the leaf and nut.

Editorial. Ginkgo is an ancient 150-million-year-old tree that thrived with the dinosaurs. It hasn’t changed much. Darwin called it a living fossil. The Chinese revered the tree and planted it around their temples and tombs to honor their ancestors. Traditionally in Chinese Medicine, the nuts were used. (The nuts have a cumulative toxicity.) Now they use the leaves as well. The green leaf, or yellow fall leaf, not the odiferous nut, is used today by most herbalists. It’s an extremely versatile and useful plant in the modern Materia Medica.

### Glycyrrhiza glabra or G. uralensis L. Gan Cao (Licorice root)

Trigger words. * Ulcers * Adrenal/qi tonic * Expectorant * Hepatoprotective * Antiviral *

Botanical names. Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (Western), G. uralensis (Chinese), and G. inflata (All three medicinally interchangeable) (Figs. 11.10 and 11.11).

Common name. Licorice

Less common names. Sweet Root, Black Sugar, Grandfather herb, Great harmonizer

Pinyin name. Gan Cao

Family. Fabaceae (Pea, formerly Leguminosae)

Part used. Root

Editorial. The word Licorice is derived from the Greek, meaning sweet root, and is widely used in the West, Chinese Medicine, Ayurvedic, and Kampo traditions. In Chinese Medicine, Licorice enters all 12 meridians and is frequently used in formula for nutrient assimilation, sweetening, and harmonizing all the other herbs.

There has been extensive research into Licorice in the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers, especially in a concentrated extract with the constituent glycyrrhizin (GL) removed to 3%, because it was found to cause unwanted side effects. This modified form is known as DGL. It inhibits acid secretion and protects the mucosa against damage from gastric acid and bile. In addition, Licorice was found to inhibit 29 strains of H. pylori, the bacteria found to be the cause of 90% of duodenal and 80% of gastric ulcers.1–5

Most so-called Licorice candy in the United States is made with Anise essential oil, which smells and tastes like genuine Licorice extract. There is no therapeutic effect of Licorice candy in this form, just a lot of sugar. The genuine stuff comes from China and other countries. Licorice is a must-have in cough syrups and for laryngitis, because it moistens dry throat and bronchi.

### Hydrastis canadensis L. (Goldenseal root) and Coptis chinensis Franchet Huang Lian (Goldthread root)

Trigger words. * Antifungal *Antibacterial * Antiviral * Damp Heat * Cholagogue *

Botanical name. Hydrastis canadensis L., Coptis chinensis Franchet (Fig. 11.12).

Common name. Goldenseal and Coptis

Less common names. Yellow Root, Indian Dye (Hydrastis), Goldthread (Coptis)

Pinyin name. Huang Lian (Coptis)

Family. Ranunculaceae (Buttercup)

Part used. Root and rhizome

Editorial. There are at least five major plants from the East and West containing the cold, yellow berberine alkaloid. All are anti-infective. Medium strength Goldenseal root and Coptis Huang Lian (Goldthread root) belong to the Buttercup family. Phellodendron Huang Bai (Siberian Cork Tree bark) hails from the Rutaceae/Rue family. Oregon Grape root and Barberry root of the Berberidaceae family are milder remedies.

All of the mentioned berberines are very good for infection and are used to clear damp heat. Goldenseal is popular but is an endangered, overharvested, and expensive American plant, whereas Chinese Coptis Huang Lian (Goldthread root) is plentiful, much less costly, and easily available from Chinese pharmacies and herb companies. The two are therapeutically interchangeable, although Coptis contains slightly more berberine and is a bit stronger. Western Oregon Grape and Barberry are very effective, easy to purchase or harvest, and are not endangered. Of course, if you care to obtain cultivated Goldenseal for a high price, feel free.

### Hypericum perforatum L. (St. John’s Wort)

Trigger words. * Mild to moderate depression * Neuralgia *Anti-viral * Nervine *

Botanical name. Hypericum perforatum L. (Fig. 11.13)

Common name. St. John’s Wort, St. Joan's Wort

Less common names. Witches’ herb, Klamath weed

Pinyin name. None

Family. Hypericaceae

Part used. Herb, especially the aerial flowering parts

Editorial. Named for the fresh herb’s association with blood and the distinctive bright-red dye from the hypericum that appears on the knife and cutting board when chopping up or crushing the fresh plant. It’s gorgeous. Never mind that said blood refers to John the Baptist’s severed head (St. John). Wort is the Old English name for herb or plant. As far as I’m concerned, the fresh wort provides best results.

Shingles is a viral Herpes zoster infection that causes horrible numbness, tingling, and burning nerve pain affecting nerve roots. St. John’s Wort is the perfect remedy for this common affliction (Chapter 25). It’s a common, essential ingredient in first-aid creams and poultices for all damp heat conditions, especially viral.

St. John’s Wort takes 4 to 8 weeks to work for depression, so combine with fast-acting Rhodiola root plus other nervines such as Passionflower, Melissa, Milky Oat, or Skullcap herb. St. John's Wort has been described as “nature’s Prozac,” and is given allopathically as an adjunct to antidepressant drugs in stubborn cases. The old paranoia about combining the herb with antidepressant drugs no longer applies. However, if a client wants to stop use of selective SSRIs, wean off slowly with permission of a physician while gradually increasing the St. John’s Wort dosage.

### Mentha x piperita L. (Peppermint leaf) and M. arvensis L. Bo He (Field Mint herb)

Trigger words. * Wind Heat/Wind Cold * Carminative * Antimicrobial * Diaphoretic * Spasmolytic *

Botanical name. Mentha x piperita L., M. arvensis L. (Figs 11.14 and 11.15)

Common name. Peppermint, Field Mint, Poléo Mint

Less common names. Menthe

Pinyin name. Bo He Mentha arvensis L. (Asian Field Mint herb)

Family. Lamiaceae/Labiatae (Mint)

Part used. The leaf

Editorial. Peppermint is a perennial aromatic herb that is a natural hybrid of Mentha aquatica L. (Water Mint) and M. spicata L. (Spearmint).17 Hence, the x in Mentha x piperita, means a cross between the two. Peppermint is a medium-strength herb, whereas its cousin, Spearmint, is a milder remedy that also causes sweating and lowers fever, settles the stomach, and is useful for respiratory infections. It works well in a steam.

Versatile Peppermint leaf is a convenient herb to keep in the kitchen cabinet for easy access, when you are feeling “iffy” and have no energy, or lack the mental capacity to even think about a complicated remedy. It’s a useful herb in cough syrups. As a steam, it opens the airway (combine with Eucalyptus essential oil). Use as a tea if coming down with a cold. If the essential oil is placed on a cotton ball, it will repel ants and also smell divine. Just put it where you don’t want them to be and watch those ants march away, vacating the premises.

### Serenoa serrulata L. (Saw Palmetto berry)

Trigger words. * Male tonic * Reproductive restorative * BPH * Anabolic *

Botanical name. Serenoa serrulata L. (Fig. 11.16)

Common name. Saw Palmetto berry

Less common names. Dwarf palm, Sabal berry

Pinyin name. None.

Family. Palmaceae

Part used. Ripe, dried fruit

Editorial. Saw Palmetto berry has a long history of European and American use for BPH. It was an official drug, listed in two editions of the USP from 1906 to 1916, and in the National Formulary from 1926 to 1950. BPH use is supported by many studies. A good herb to combine with Saw Palmetto berry for this purpose is Nettle root. The Eclectics used Saw Palmetto for upper and lower respiratory tract problems, prostatic irritation, and enlarged gonads.

<!-- chunk -->

### Silybum marianum Gaertner (Milk Thistle seed)

Trigger words. * Hepatoprotective * Hepatic tropho-restorative * Antioxidant *

Botanical name. Silybum marianum Gaertner or Carduus marianus L. (botanical synonyms) (Fig. 11.17)

Common name. Milk Thistle

Less common names. St. Mary’s Thistle, Lady’s Thistle, Lady’s Milk

Pinyin name. None

Family. Asteraceae (Compositae, Daisy)

Part used. Fruit/seed

Editorial. This plant has the best reputation in the West as an all-around liver remedy. It restores and protects liver cells, as well as stimulating the liver to do its work. It is a definite choice for any liver disease or liver damage or problem stemming from poor liver detoxification. Pair with Dandelion root for a more stimulating effect and for use in menstrual problems caused from poorly deconjugated hormones. It’s a no-brainer for any herbalist’s Materia Medica.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taraxacum officinale Weber (Dandelion root and leaf) and T. mongolicum Handel-Mazzetti Pu Gong Ying (Mongolian Dandelion root and leaf)

Trigger words. * Liver/gallbladder stimulant * Clears Damp Heat * Diuretic * Detoxifier *

Botanical name. Taraxacum officinale Weber (Fig. 11.18)

Common name. Dandelion

Less common names. Puffball, Lion’s tooth, Wet the Bed

Pinyin name. Pu Gong Ying (Taraxacum mongolicum)

Family. Asteraceae/Compositae/Daisy

Part used. Root and leaf

Editorial. Dandelion root is used in Chinese Medicine, and Western and Ayurvedic herbalism. The Chinese species is T. mongolicum. It has a universal healing history. All varieties are interchangeable. Because it probably grows in your (one hopes) unsprayed backyard, use it. Westerners consider it a bitter digestive stimulant, liver tropho-restorative, diuretic, and detoxicant. The Chinese use it as an antiinflammatory that clears heat toxins for conditions such as boils, abscesses, and throat inflammation. Ayurvedic tradition values Dandelion as a digestive bitter and detoxicant.

Dandelion leaf has similar constituents to the root but with more potassium.9 This makes it an excellent diuretic for edema or hypertension. Don’t forget to include Dandelion greens in a spring salad as a bitter, nourishing, cleansing tonic food similar to Lamb’s Quarters herb. New, young leaves picked before the plant goes into flower are best. Juicing is a good option. The leaves should be eaten or tinctured fresh because they quickly lose potency when dried.

<!-- chunk -->

### Urtica dioica L. (Nettle herb)

Trigger words. * Nutritive tonic * Antiallergenic * Styptic * BPH (roots) *

Botanical name. Urtica dioica L. (Fig. 11.19)

Common name. Nettle, Nettles, Stinging Nettles

Less common names. Scaddie, Ortie, Slender Nettle

Pinyin name. None

Family. Urticaceae

Part used. Leaf, root, and seed

Editorial. Nettle is an incredibly useful, indispensable, and versatile plant. Herbalist Brigitte Mars serves this superfood all spring and summer from her garden in smoothies and baked in quiches and casseroles. (Use small young leaves, because older ones may cause digestive disturbances.) Handle and harvest the fresh plant with gloves; touching it causes an instantaneous burning rash from its formic acid content. But this rash also serves as a topical counterirritant. If the fresh leaves are intentionally brushed on the skin, it brings blood to the skin and helps arthritis and muscle pain. The sting doesn’t last long and really helps. As a styptic in a compress, it stops bleeding. Nettle root inhibits cellular growth of the prostate in BPH and is diuretic.

The fresh leaves were used as a spring vegetable, much like spinach, throughout history and helped prevent scurvy. Two cups of strong nettle infusion substitutes as a multivitamin and is a nutritious woman’s ally. The stinging hairs from the formic acid are inactivated when cooked or thoroughly dried. The seed oil was used for burning in ancient Egypt, and the herb is currently used as a commercial source of chlorophyll.

### Valerian officinalis L. (Valerian root)

Trigger words. * Calming, anxiolytic * Sleep * Empty Heat * Spasmolytic *

Botanical name. Valerian officinalis L. and spp. (Fig. 11.20)

Common name. Valerian

Less common names. All-heal, Capon’s tail, Setwell

Pinyin name. None.

Family. Valerianaceae

Part used. Rhizome/Root

Editorial. Valerian root has the reputation of being a stinky-smelling herb because the dried root has a dirty-sock odor, reminiscent of football locker rooms or teenage boys’ bedrooms, because of its pungent, warming, and stimulating qualities (Fig. 11.22). This reputation is not as true of the fresh root, newly dug from the forest, which is cooler, more restorative, and less odiferous. Therefore the fresh root is more predictable and forgiving for hot conditions, with less chance of a paradoxical effect.

Valerian combines well with Melissa officinalis (Lemon Balm herb), Passiflora incarnata (Passionflower herb) and Humulus lupulus (Hops flower) for sleep disorders. For kids over 3 years of age, combine with Lemon Balm. This medium-strength herb is not appropriate for younger children or babies. Substitute Lemon Balm or California Poppy for the little ones.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitex agnus-castus L., V. negundo L. Mu Jing Zi (Chastetree berry)

Trigger words. * Progesteronic * Pituitary regulation * PMS * Menopause * Infertility *

Botanical name. Vitex agnus-castus L. (Fig. 11.23)

Common name. Chastetree berry, Chaste Lamb, Five-Leaf Chaste tree Berry

Less common names. Monk’s Pepper, Cloister Pepper

Pinyin name. Mu Jing Zi (Vitex negundo L.)

Family. Verbenaceae (Verbena)

Part used. The fruit/berry

Editorial. Vitex is a go-to long-term herb for women with PMS, menopausal, and menstrual disorders caused by progesterone deficiency. This problem presents as withdrawn personality with loss of self-esteem, fatigue, and fibrocystic, painful, and lumpy breasts. Combine it with Yarrow flower to enhance progesterone effect. Think of it as acting on the pituitary and as a first-rate hormone balancer.

Spicy, peppery-tasting Vitex was used in place of Black Peppercorns to dampen a monk’s libido in monasteries of the Middle Ages, hence the common name “Chaste tree.” In China, other Vitex species (V. negundo, V. rotundifolia, and V. trifolia) are used very differently from the way they are used in the West. They are used as a respiratory bronchodilator, expectorant, and antitussive.4 Western Vitex can be used similarly.

### Zingiber officinalis Roscoe Gan Jiang (Ginger root)

Trigger words. * Warm and Pungent * Antiemetic * Diaphoretic * Blood Mover *

Botanical name. Zingiber officinalis Roscoe (Figs. 11.24 and 11.25)

Common name. Ginger

Less common names. Common Ginger, East Indian Ginger

Pinyin name. Gan Jiang (dried), Sheng Jiang (fresh), Pao Jiang (quick-fried), Jiang Pi (peel)

Family. Zingiberaceae (Ginger)

Part used. Rhizome/root

Editorial. Ginger is widely used in the major herbal traditions around the world: Chinese, Western, Ayurveda. It is a necessary herb in any apothecary. In Chinese Medicine, it is a minor but important part of many formulas, but not the major component. It is used to add warmth, movement, and increased tropism, and to help minimize toxicity of other herbs. It is used in four forms: the fresh rhizome is the most dispersing and diaphoretic—perfect in hot teas to bring on sweating in early-onset wind cold conditions, with watery, foamy white sputum and cold hands and feet. The dried rhizome is hotter and longer lasting for cold conditions. The fried rhizome is the strongest of the three and used locally to stop bleeding.1–5 The peel is considered more cooling.

For damp heat in the GI and skin, use Ginger and pair with Coptis Huang Lian (Goldthread root), Goldenseal, or Oregon Grape root and Scutellaria Huang Qin (Baikal Skullcap root). The Huang Qin species has a very different use from that of Western Skullcap, which is a nervine. For liver damp heat, combine Ginger with Coptis Huang Lian, Chinese Gardenia Shan Zhi Zi, or Western Blue Flag root.


In this chapter, a basic Materia Medica was presented. These herbs are very important for any herbalist’s apothecary. It is not a conclusive list but provides a starting point. I use these herbs repeatedly and retincture them often.

# Materia Medica Groupings

“…Now we turn to all the Medicine herbs of the world. From the beginning they were instructed to take away sickness. They are always waiting and ready to heal us. We are happy there are still among us those special few who remember how to use these plants for healing. With one mind, we send greetings and thanks to the Medicines and to the keepers of the Medicines.”

— from the Thanksgiving address by John E. Echohawk


Adaptogens

Alteratives

Anhidrotic

Anticoagulant

Antineoplastic

Antitussive

Anxiolytics

Demulcents

Diaphoretic

Diuretic

Dysuria

Enuresis

Hematuria

Hypnotics

Hypoglycemic

Oxytocic

Purulence

Yin tonics

In this chapter, we consider a few key herbal groupings, a sampler, using three approaches. One is the Western herbalism, action-oriented methodology that would describe Burdock root as an alterative. Another is the allopathic model of assigning names to diseases, like pneumonia or eczema. Finally, the Chinese Medicine approach, which uses energetics—warmth, taste, moisture—and syndromes, such as Damp Heat or Wind Cold. Western herbology, allopathic medicine, and Chinese Medicine descriptions are used back and forth—the intention being to single out the best herbal choice for a specific situation, and to distinguish one tradition from another.

As always, herbal indications, dosage, and safety reflect traditional and historical consensus and modern information based on research. No matter what, and if in doubt, consult the latest sources for up-to-date safety information.

## Sorting Out the Laundry List

Given five common nervous relaxants, which is the best choice for your client? They are not all the same, and although any one plant might do an ok job, why not choose wisely to complement the person’s condition? Instead of using herbs in an automatic “this-for-that” mentality, such as Goldenseal for infections or Lemon Balm for anxiety, how about being more specific and effective? The idea is to avoid picking at random from a list.

Furthermore, what if that nervine/calmer-downer could accomplish more than one function? If a person is anxious and stressed from an asthma attack, we might choose Lobelia herb because it opens the airway to help stop bronchial wheezing in the respiratory tree in addition to being a calming nervine. If there is stress because the head feels like it’s stuck in a vise, Skullcap would be better than Lobelia, because it relieves muscle spasms in that specific area, and calms emotional stress. Two birds; one stone.

Let’s take a look at some groups or categories, so we can consistently obtain good results, taking the guesswork out of herbalism.

<!-- chunk -->

## Calming Herbs for the Nervous System

<!-- chunk -->

### Scutellaria lateriflora L. (Skullcap herb)

Matricaria recutita L. (Chamomile flower)

Melissa officinalis L. (Lemon Balm leaf)

Lobelia inflata L. (Lobelia herb)

Humulus lupulus L. (Hops flower)

Ziziphus spinosa Hu, Suan Zao Ren (Sour Jujube seed)


* Nervous sedative * Spasmolytic * Insomnia *


<!-- chunk -->

##### Skullcap herb (Figs. 12.4 and 12.5)

<!-- chunk -->

##### Chamomile flower (Fig. 12.5)

<!-- chunk -->

##### Melissa Balm or Lemon Balm herb (Fig. 12.2)

<!-- chunk -->

##### Lobelia herb (Fig. 12.1)

<!-- chunk -->

##### Hops flower (Fig. 12.6)

<!-- chunk -->

##### Ziziphus Suan Zao Ren seed (Sour Jujube seed)


<!-- chunk -->

## Demulcents or Yin Tonics

<!-- chunk -->

### Asparagus officinalis L. (Asparagus root), A. cochinensis (Lour.) Merr. Tian Men Dong, A. racemosus (Bresler) Baker, (Shatavari)

Symphytum officinale L. (Comfrey leaf and root)

Ulmus fulva Michaux (Slippery Elm bark)

Althea officinalis L. (Marshmallow root)

Verbascum thapsus L. (Mullein leaf, flower, and root)


* Demulcents * Tonify yin * Moisten dryness *


Note: In Chinese Medicine, yin tonics strengthen yin and are cool, moist, and nourishing. Demulcents are cooling and moist but not always nourishing. These two terms are often used interchangeably, although not with strict accuracy.

<!-- chunk -->

##### Asparagus root

<!-- chunk -->

##### Comfrey leaf and root (Fig. 12.7)

<!-- chunk -->

##### Slippery Elm bark

<!-- chunk -->

##### Marshmallow root

<!-- chunk -->

##### Mullein leaf, root, and flower (Fig. 12.8)


This is an ambitious grouping and contains herbs that all herbalists should know. They have a lot in common. All five demulcents are sweet, cool, and moist, but they are not interchangeable. Asparagus, Comfrey, and Slippery Elm are nourishing. If you get a handle on their differences, the best demulcent to pick will become obvious. Furthermore, most are usually combined in formula as helper herbs to provide cool, yin moisture.

<!-- chunk -->

## Common Adaptogens

<!-- chunk -->

### Eleutherococcus senticosus Ruprv. et Maxim, Ci Wu Jia (Eleuthero root)

Ganoderma lucidum Leyss. ex Fr., Ling Zhi (Reishi mushroom)

Astragalus membranaceus Fischer, Huang Qi (Astragalus root)

Withania somnifera L. (Ashwagandha root)

Schisandra chinensis Turcz, Wu Wei Zi (Five Taste berry)

Rhodiola rosea L. (Rhodiola root)


* Adaptogens * Tonics/Restoratives * Neuroendocrine/immune balance *


Note: Prepare all adaptogens as dual extractions to get the most out of these chemically complex important herbs. Prepare a 1:3 95% dual extraction straight ethanol maceration with no water, then double the calculated water, and simmer pressed marc down to half (Chapter 7).


Note: Adaptogens are herbs that restore, build, nourish, and help the body balance stress.

<!-- chunk -->

##### Eleuthero Cu Wu Jia root (Fig. 12.11)

<!-- chunk -->

##### Ganoderma Ling Zhi mushroom

<!-- chunk -->

##### Astragalus Huang Qi root

<!-- chunk -->

##### Ashwagandha root

<!-- chunk -->

##### Schisandra Wu Wei Zi berry (Fig. 12.12)

<!-- chunk -->

##### Rhodiola root (Fig. 12.13)


Adaptogens are precious, restorative plants, and very safe if you stay within dosage range. They are cross-cultural, the supreme, elite, revered tonics that maintain health and help the body adjust to stress and modern chronic diseases, including autoimmune. The common names of many countries’ adaptogens often have the word ginseng in them (even though they’re not true ginsengs) to honor and imply their therapeutic similarity to the genuine “ultimates”: Asian Panax ginseng Ren Shen, and American Panax quinquefolius Xi Yang Shen. Cases in point are Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian ginseng root), Rhodiola rosea (Tibetan ginseng root), Pfaffia paniculata (Suma or Brazilian ginseng root). Asian and American ginsengs do not appear in this Materia Medica because of their exorbitant price. However, Chinese Medicine frequently uses a mild, weaker non-ginseng substitute in triple doses for the same purpose.16 The herb is Codonopsis pilosula Dang Shen (Downy Bellflower root), sometimes called Poor Man’s Ginseng.

Adaptogens are mild tonics that can, and probably should, be taken indefinitely for maximum prevention and health. They work well in combination with one another. All are warm or neutral, except the more cooling Rhodiola. True adaptogens support the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Chapter 27).

## Alterative Herbs that Help Detoxification

<!-- chunk -->

### Rumex crispus L. (Yellow Dock root)

Arctium lappa L. (Burdock root), Niu Bang Zi (Burdock seed)

Galium aparine L. (Cleavers herb)

Trifolium pratense L. (Red Clover flower)

Apium graveolens L. (Celery seed)


* Alteratives * Detoxifiers * Skin * Autoimmune *


Note: All alteratives (also called depuratives) enhance overall absorption and assimilation of nutrients and elimination of waste products of cellular metabolism through the liver, lungs, kidney, bowel, or skin. They are cooling, restorative, and dissolving. Some alteratives have affinities for certain body systems.

<!-- chunk -->

##### Yellow Dock root

<!-- chunk -->

##### Burdock root (Figs. 12.14 and 12.15)

<!-- chunk -->

##### Cleavers herb

<!-- chunk -->

##### Red Clover flower (Fig. 12.16)

<!-- chunk -->

##### Celery seed (Fig. 12.17)


The designation—alteratives—is a rather antiquated and vague herbal category, said to alter the body. They are used for treating toxicity, most famously from skin eruptions but also for arthritis and infections. Alteratives were widely used by the Eclectics and Thomsonians who called them blood purifiers, although not quite accurately. Alteratives help eliminate waste products of metabolism by stimulating the body’s natural avenues of detoxification. The body detoxifies all the time through the lymphatics, liver, kidneys, skin, and bowels. The result is so-called cleaner blood, because the blood is the transport system that carries waste products of cellular metabolism to those organs for removal. Hence, blood purifiers are actually detoxifiers. True alterative/depurative herbs not only aid detoxification, but also facilitate proper nutrient assimilation, which has a normalizing action on overall physiology.

There are so many alterative/depurative/detoxifying herbs not detailed here that address various body systems and problems or complement those covered. For skin detox, use Burdock root, Yellow Dock root, Jamaican Sarsaparilla root, Cleavers herb, Red Clover flower, or Figwort herb. For lymphatic drainage/detox, try Burdock root, Marigold flower, Walnut leaf, Echinacea root, Blue Flag root, Poke root, or Chinese Lonicera Jin Yin Hua (Honeysuckle flower) or Forsythia Lian Qiao (Forsythia valve/capsule). For antiarthritic action, try Celery seed, Parsley seed, Red Clover flower, Horsetail herb, or Pipsissewa (Wintergreen herb.)

<!-- chunk -->

## Expectorants, Bronchodilators, Antitussives

<!-- chunk -->

### Thymus vulgaris L. (Thyme herb)

Tussilago farfara L. (Coltsfoot herb), Kuan Dong Hua (Coltsfoot flower)

Prunus serotina Ehrhart (Wild Cherry bark)

Xanthium sibiricum Patrin, Cang Er Zi (Siberian Cocklebur fruit)

Chrysanthemum x morifolium Ramatuelle, Ju Hua (Chrysanthemum flower)

Platycodon grandiflorum de Candolle, Jie Geng (Balloonflower root)


* Antitussive * Bronchodilator * Expectorant *

There are numerous antimicrobial bug killers in the herbal realm. The sampler presented is enough to get an herb lover started. Lonicera Jin Yin Hua (Japanese Honeysuckle flower), often paired with Forsythia Lian Qiao (Forsythia valve) are a dynamic duo in Chinese Medicine and star players in the famous formula Yin Chiao (Chapter 17) for early-onset colds and flu. Uva ursi is a primary evergreen leaf in the West for acute UTIs. Andrographis Chuan Xin Lian (Heart-Thread Lotus leaf) goes straight to the sinuses. Osha root grows high in the Rockies and is one of my go-to plants for early onset upper respiratory gunk before heat sets in. Wormwood herb is a valuable intestinal parasite eliminator. Lonicera Jin Yin Hua (Japanese Honeysuckle flower) is a broad-spectrum antiinfective and detoxicant; it is one of the most important Chinese herbs used for eliminating heat and accumulated toxins. It is a different species from the many other Honeysuckles occurring worldwide. Pair with Western Calendula officinalis (Marigold flower) or Eastern Forsythia Lian Qiao (Forsythia valve).


A few key herbal groupings that an herbalist returns to again and again were considered. Important Western and Chinese herbs were included. The intention was to provide some common herbs with similar but nonidentical actions to provide a format for intelligent selection, based on energetics and matched to the patient’s condition: warming plants for cool conditions; drying herbs for dampness; pungent remedies to disperse congestion; sour taste for astringing, and so on.

This chapter is designed to provide a general awareness of what can go wrong when using botanicals for healing. It is not meant to scare anyone off or give false alarms—but to help us all be informed clinical herbalists. Herbal medicine has an excellent track record over time for being surprisingly safe.

In the United States, herbs are regulated as dietary supplements (Chapter 29). This regulation could lull one into the false assumption that they are perfectly safe, with no side effects in any amount or dose. Not so. Even beans and other commonly consumed foods can cause allergic reactions and toxicity. In Europe, Canada, and Australia, herbs are registered as medicinal products or classified as herbal medicine, even drugs. Because herbs contain a complex array of chemicals, they have physiological and pharmacological properties and are not inert. No matter their legal classification, have respect.

Presenting every side effect for any herb you might encounter is an unrealistic goal. Many reliable references are dedicated to this topic and represent contemporary knowledge. It is recommended that you include one or two in your library. Those listed in the bibliography and endnotes are good places to start. It is always the practitioner’s responsibility to determine the best treatment and dosage for each client and to appreciate that idiosyncratic and allergic reactions can be unpredictable. Herbal safety and drug interaction data are constantly changing. What is presented is a broad overview with guidelines and consensus (if one can be found) based on tradition, experience, and new information.

We are interested in general topics, such as herbs that might cause bleeding, raise blood pressure, or are contraindicated in pregnancy. The Materia Medicas (Chapters 11 and 12) also give specific safety considerations. We must all use herbs rationally and wisely, and above all, be safe.

<!-- chunk -->

## General Considerations Regarding the Safety of Herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## Allergic Reactions

Allergic reactions are the most common adverse effects related to herbs and drugs. It is theoretically possible for any herb to cause an immune response, ranging from contact dermatitis all the way to anaphylactic shock. These responses are mostly unpredictable. However, if your client has any previous history of allergies in the plant department, take precautions.

Out of all allergic responses, contact dermatitis is most common. Plant families commonly causing skin reactions are Ranunculaceae (Buttercup), Euphorbiaceae (Spurge), and Asteraceae (Daisy). Causes are from chemical irritants in the plants, including alkaloids, saponins, and anthraquinones.1 Some of these plants are frequently used as vulneraries in first-aid creams. Arnica flower (Fig. 13.1), German and Roman Chamomile flower, Garlic bulb, Peppermint herb, and Lavender flower are examples. None is completely harmless in susceptible individuals. Other reported offenders are Licorice root, Tea Tree essential oil, Cayenne pepper, and Echinacea root.

Allergic reactions can also cause asthma, eye reactions, or oral lip blisters. Always ask clients about plant allergies and for those with positive histories, look into cross-reactivity between species belonging to the same family. Most allergic reactions resolve when the herb is discontinued. Rarely, but possibly, there could be a history of a serious type 1 immediate sensitivity allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock) with hives, face swelling, swollen tongue, difficulty breathing, or respiratory arrest. This reaction is life threatening and requires an immediate emergency room visit.

## Herbal Constituents That Can Help or Harm

The chemicals listed in this section occur in many herbs. They can be a problem, or they can be used to therapeutic advantage.2 If you come across an herb with these chemicals, know that in the wrong situation, with the wrong dose, you might get into trouble. A few myths are cleared up, particularly the confusion over coumarins and salicylates.

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbal Actions Can Be Therapeutic or Harmful

Herbs have therapeutic actions; otherwise they would not be useful. However, with each positive action may come a negative action. For this reason, it is important to understand the mechanisms of herbal actions (how they work in the body). The following list shows general herbal classifications and commonly stated interactions you will frequently see in the literature.

<!-- chunk -->

## Adverse Herb and Drug Interactions

Allopathic drugs are very strong medicine. Increasingly, people use herbs without knowledgeable guidance or combine them with prescription drugs. Naturally, this circumstance is worrisome for herbalists, nurses, and doctors. It is a hot topic, because we want our patients to be safe. How does this fare when combined with herbs that may potentiate or interfere with those actions? Drugs, such as Coumadin that prolong clotting time or digoxin used in heart failure, must be monitored closely. There is a lot of misinformation out there, and most texts and resources written for herbalists and doctors err on the side of extreme caution. The Physician’s Desk Reference for Herbal Medicine is in its fourth edition at this printing and takes an extremely conservative viewpoint.

Herbalists are not expected to know every drug in existence, nor their side effects. Even doctors, nurses, and pharmacists constantly look up information. So, two points: (1) Always get a drug history from your clients, both for prescription and over-the-counter products. (2) Purchase a good drug handbook that is not too complicated. Recommended are Mosby’s Nursing Drug Reference or Saunders Nursing Drug Handbook. Both are updated every year. And there is always the internet. The top 10 medications by number of monthly prescriptions in 2016 are listed here.6 The drug categories don’t change much from year to year.

As you see from this preceding list, low thyroid, high cholesterol, asthma, diabetes, and indigestion are rampant health issues. These can often be helped by herbal remedies accompanied by lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise. Frequently prescribed anticoagulants, antihypertensives, cardiac glycosides, analgesics, and antibiotics round out the top-10 list and have appeared there in other years.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some Common Categories of Herb-Drug Interactions

Listed here are some categories of herb-drug interactions and what they mean. They are often cited in herbal safety books, and some knowledge of physiology, pharmacology, and chemistry is needed to understand these herb-drug combinations and why they might be a problem. A few of the specific herbs that could be implicated in these reactions are shown in Table 13.1. Some are substantiated by studies, and others are theoretical.

## Cytochrome P450 Enzyme System and Herb–Drug Interactions

Fat-soluble drugs, herbs, foods, hormones, chemical pollutants and other substances are broken down, metabolized, and detoxified through the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) family of enzymes, mainly in the liver (Chapter 19). This action is significant because this breakdown can affect how well a drug or herb does (or doesn’t) work when used in combination with others. Some enzymes inhibit, and some potentiate, a drug’s effect. It could make the difference between an overdose or an ineffective dose.

Various herbs, drugs, and foods, alone or in combination, react differently in this system and have an affinity to certain enzymes. There are 14 families of enzymes in the system, and it is hard to predict which enzyme does what—which drug-drug, herb-drug, food-drug, or food-herb combination will cause reactions and which ones won’t. Some enzymes cause no reaction at all. Many substances have not yet been studied, so the jury is out. There are also pronounced individual and racial differences in drug-metabolizing activity. A drug-drug or drug-herb combination can interact with CYP450 enzymes and be either an inhibitor or an inducer of the substance with which it is combined.7 Here are the terms and process involved.

<!-- chunk -->

### Examples of the CYP450 System Working Positively and Negatively

The CYP450 system can work in positive or negative ways on the body, depending on which substrate combines with which agent, and on which enzyme. For instance, the flavonoid naringenin in grapefruit or grapefruit juice activates enzymes in the liver’s detoxification system that decreases certain drugs’ rates of elimination from the body, altering their clinical activity and toxicity. An 8-oz glass of grapefruit juice contains enough naringenin to decrease CYP450 detoxification activity by a large amount. This boils down to an increase in the drug’s bioavailability, and can lead to overdose when the juice is taken with statins, antiarrhythmics, calcium channel blockers, and immunosuppressive agents. That’s why those drug labels say not to take with grapefruit juice. However, grapefruit juice on its own can be quite a healthy drink because of its vitamin C, minerals, and antibacterial activity.

Another example is Dandelion root, which inhibits the substrate/drug theophylline (bad effect) but also inhibits alcoholic intoxification (good effect). Umbelliferous herbs of the Apiaceae family, like Celery seed or Osha root, can inhibit the therapeutic effect of calcium channel blockers and antihistamines. Many drugs but very few herbs have been studied regarding their CYP450 interactions. The most-studied herbs and therefore most implicated in affecting CYP450 enzymes, up or down and for better or for worse, are Ginkgo leaf, Kava root, and St. John’s Wort. For instance, St. John’s Wort decreases blood levels of theophylline and digoxin, but Ginkgo, Kava, and St. John’s Wort increase blood levels of Dilantin and progesterone.1 An increased level of Dilantin can lead to an overdose (bad effect) but an increase in progesterone in a menopausal woman may be considered a favorable outcome.

Indole 3-carbinol is a sulfurous compound found in cruciferous herbs and brassica vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and bok choy (Chapter 28). Indole 3-carbinol is a key nutrient for CYP450 liver detoxification in both Phase I and Phase II, speeding up excretion of toxins. Thus cruciferous veggies are important foods to include in any well-thought-out detoxification program. They are extremely useful in treating cancer and for reproductive health in men and women. Indole 3-carbinol selectively binds to estrogen receptors blocking the bad estrogen (estrone) from building up in the body, which can cause breast, uterine, cervical, and prostate cancers.8

Our understanding of the CYP450s has been increasing since the first enzyme in the system was identified by Julius Axelrod and Bernard Brodie in 1955. As time goes on, herbalists can take advantage of new findings and incorporate them into their therapies. Diet seems to play an important role, as do herb-drug interactions.

## Pregnancy and Lactation Guidelines

Nothing strong or toxic should be ingested during pregnancy, and special care should always be taken in the first trimester, when risk of miscarriage is highest. Other concerns in pregnancy are risk of toxicity of the mother that can influence the child, fetal toxicity, developmental malformations (teratogenesis), and health effects on the child later in life. The fewer herbs and drugs ingested in pregnancy, the better. Many herb books give huge lists of herbs contraindicated in pregnancy. That said, sometimes they are safe and indicated (Table 13.2).

Table 13.2

aList provided by author and herbalist, Brigitte Mars, AHG certified.

Consensus as to which herbs are safe in pregnancy varies greatly. Some of the most common herbs given by midwives in a survey of North Carolina–certified nurse midwives were Ginger root for nausea (although you’ll see this one contraindicated in some books and also by Commission E), Raspberry leaf, Peppermint herb, Chamomile flower (Fig. 13.8), Evening Primrose oil, and Black and Blue Cohosh roots near labor and delivery time. Among naturopaths, popular herbs to administer were Echinacea root, Raspberry leaf, and Nettle herb.1 Many pregnant women take herbs on their own with no ill effects. This practice is common throughout the world. In general, follow these suggestions and refer to trusted herb books.


As a rule, available information about herbal safety errs on the side of caution. We must be discerning, keep up with research, and evaluate the validity of studies. Respect for our herbal allies is in order, but do not be overly paranoid. Confidence is tempered with knowledge and common sense. Trust your intuition. If you have reservations, don’t use that herb.

Allergic reactions are the most common side effect any herbalist will encounter, and of those, contact dermatitis heads the list. Dosage, herb quality, and the occasional need for monitoring blood pressure, coagulation, or glucose levels were examined. Certain herbal constituents such as tannins, lectins, and herbs that act as cardiac glycosides can present potential problems.

Herbs may potentiate or inhibit drug actions and vice versa. Strong allopathic drugs can be problematic when combined with herbs. The liver’s cytochrome P450 system of enzymes can also inhibit or potentiate drug and herb dosages. In pregnancy and lactation, nontoxic herbs are recommended. Children and infants can be given a wide variety as long as dosage parameters are followed (Chapter 21).

Formulating is the art of making up a personalized herbal blend. For individualized formulations, an herbalist must know the criteria for composing a generic herbal formula—any formula. This chapter is not about which specific herbs to use but rather the philosophy of choosing herbs, concocting a well-balanced herbal combination, and prioritizing and deciding herbal proportions in a remedy. How many parts of Dandelion root versus how many parts of Marshmallow root should go into the bottle, and why?

A dispensary is a dedicated space, such as an herbal apothecary, where herbs are prepared, combined (formulated) and provided. The process of formulating consists of deciding on which herbs to use, calculating correct herbal proportions, and accurately measuring and labeling. Proper calculation involves figuring out the amount of each herb needed for any bottle size based on decided proportions (how much of one herb is needed in relation to another). The exact same formula must be dispensed, regardless of container size.

Dispensing is ideally done in a dedicated room containing all herbs and supplies, called the apothecary—or in modern allopathic terms, a pharmacy. The space contains the tools of the trade: dry herbs, tinctures, measuring tools, bottles, droppers, and labels, all in one convenient location. Actual preparations are made up in the apothecary and presented correctly to the client. Accurate measurement and labeling are key.

Proper dispensing—handing out the remedy—involves deciding on appropriate dosage along with providing clear instructions on how to take the herbs. How much should a client take, how is that done, and when? Another detail is knowing which size bottle to dispense and the length of time it will last. If the client needs to take the formula for 2 weeks, it is best to dispense the appropriate amount so that they don’t run out or have too much left over.

Conversions, (changing medical measurements back and forth from English to metric), and medical abbreviations are part of formulating. A knowledge of metric measurements and English equivalents are vital when negotiating the world of herbal delivery. Standard Latin medical abbreviations simplify life and communication. Speak the language. Walk the talk.

### General Formulating Considerations

There are various considerations when making any herbal formula, regardless of client or condition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Principles of Herbal Formulation

The general principles in organizing a formula are the same in Western herbalism, Eastern, or otherwise. Once an assessment has been made of the client, the principles of formulating are as follows.

<!-- chunk -->

### Creating a Formula with Proportions for Each Herb

Proportion refers to how much of one herb is used in relation to another. Each proportion is referred to as a part. Parts in a formula remain constant regardless of amount of formula required. What changes is the number of milliliters used, depending on the container size. A gallon jar of a given formula always contains the same proportions or parts as a 1-oz bottle of the same formula. (If it didn’t, the formula would have changed.)

Examples show the principles of formulation, using formulas, with the principle, secondary, assistants, helper herbs, and the number of parts for each herb (Tables 14.1 and 14.2).

## Dispensing

### Bottle Sizes and Steps in Dispensary Calculations

When we have decided on the herbs in our formula and proportions or parts of one herb to another, we need to dispense them to our clients. Become familiar with standard bottle sizes. Boston rounds (BRs) in different sizes are typically used (Box 14.1).

Box 14.1

Boston Rounds

The following are the various steps in dispensing a formula to a client. The steps assume that the formula has been decided upon, and the dose, and proportion/parts of each herb has been determined.

2. Calculate how many milliliters there are per part. Add grams together for a total number of parts and divide into 120 mL (the size of the 4-oz bottle).

3. Calculate how many milliliters are needed of each herb. Multiply number of grams times each part in milliliters. Round number up or down.

<!-- chunk -->

### Labeling

Labels must be precise. Labels should include the name of the client, date, concentration of the tincture (as in 1:4 50%). Ingredients must be listed (Box 14.2). Herbalist’s contact information should appear. Dosage should be clear. Any additional instructions must be listed. There are laws regarding labeling that specify what you can and cannot claim. Most claims must be exceedingly vague. Here’s what to have on your label.

## Dosage

<!-- chunk -->

### General Principles

Herbal dosing is one of the most variable aspects of modern herbalism. Doses have differed among herbal traditions throughout the course of history, in pharmacopoeias of various countries, and in established pharmacological and clinical research. Herbal texts usually show a wide range. If an herb is used in a formula with 10 others, the dose of each individual herb will be smaller.

In the United States, doses tend to be conservative and small; in the United Kingdom, they are larger. In Chinese Medicine, doses tend to be extremely high, yet still safe. Herbalist Michael Moore, who ran the Southwest School of Botanical Medicine for many years, typically recommended tinctures at a 1:5 proportion with ethanol percentages dependent on constituent solubility. His tincture dosage varied from Asparagus root at 30 to 60 drops 3 times per day to Sarsaparilla and Burdock root at 30 to 90 drops 3 times per day.1

The point is that as long as you stick with nontoxic mild- to medium-strength herbs, dosing can be on the high end rather than low. I have personally found that higher dosing (within limits) obtains better results.

<!-- chunk -->

### Approximate Adult Dosages for Mild- to Moderate-Strength Preparations

The takeaway from the preceding dosage discussion is that there is a lot of leeway as long as you are using mild- to medium-strength herbs. The dosage ranges listed next are the ones that I have personally found to work safely and effectively and were used by students in the school I ran (Table 14.8 and Appendix A). I tend to go on the higher side because the results are better in individuals who can tolerate such. This approach is especially true with the strong superbugs and stubborn infections that are starting to inundate our world. But always know or get to know your client by starting conservatively. The dose can always be increased later. Honor your judgment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Infusions and Decoctions Dosage

The weight of dried herb used in a tea is the important measurement, not the amount of water used. Debate arises whether to go by weight or by volume when measuring out dried or raw herbs for a tea. Weight is more accurate. It’s been done this way in Chinese Medicine for thousands of years. However, a few grams of a dry, fluffy herb like Calendula or Chrysanthemum flower is an incredible amount of volume to fit in 1 little cup of tea. In such cases, many herbalists go with 1 tablespoon per cup and call it a day. If going by grams when dispensing a bag of tea to your client to make up at home, you can translate the gram amount for them to use into tablespoons (3 level teaspoons equal 1 tablespoon).

<!-- chunk -->

### Tinctures Dosage

When a problem is acute, the dose must be given frequently, such as every half hour to every 2 hours. Examples of acute problems include onset of infectious diseases, such as colds or flu, migraines, toothaches, bleeding, or burns. If the problem is chronic, the dose is reduced to steady amounts at 2 to 3 times daily. Chronic situations exist in ailments such as diabetes, deficiency syndromes, long-standing allergy or bronchitis, back pain, arthritis, or autoimmunity. Some conditions may start chronic and then flare-up to acute, or vice versa, all of which necessitates changing around the regimen frequency and also the formula.

Furthermore, the stronger the concentration of the tincture or extract, the less you need. The doses stated earlier by Michael Moore were usually based on a 1:5 proportion. I rarely make a 1:5 these days because better results seem to be obtained with stronger preparations, such as 1:3. Then, smaller doses may be given if need be.

If a tincture consists of mild-strength herbs, dose on the high end. If a tincture consists of mostly moderate-strength herbs, dose on the low end. Include a dose range on the label and have client start low and slowly build up to test the waters. More isn’t always better. Good judgment consists of gearing dosage to client’s constitution and sensitivity.

### Essential Oil Dosage

Make sure all essential oils taken internally are safe to do so. Consult a reliable text, such as The Complete Guide to Aromatherapy by Salvatore Battaglia (Bibliography). Also, be sure to use high-quality pure oils with no adulterants (Chapter 6). For average adult essential oil dosages, see Box 14.3.

## Conversions

Because most nonmedical folks in the United States use English measurements of cups, teaspoons, and ounces and the rest of the medical world uses metric, it is helpful to have some equivalents at your fingertips. When a dropper or pipette is inserted into a tincture bottle and squeezed once, the dropper fills nearly to one-half. This is considered to be 1 mL (30 drops). So if the dose is 60 drops, the dropper is squeezed twice to deliver that dose. The equivalency of 30 drops to 1 mL refers to drops of water. Tinctures are a bit more viscous and will take up varying amounts of room in the dropper. That is why this is all approximate, not rocket science. For mild- to moderate-strength herbs, it’s fine.

The equivalents provided in Box 14.4 are the most-used conversions for herbalists when making and dispensing preparations. They allow herbalists to figure out dosages for clients and to painlessly travel back and forth from metric units to English units and to weight-to-volume units. Tables 14.9 and 14.10 give other useful conversions, going from teaspoons to droppers to milliliters, and from grams to tincture equivalents.

## Abbreviations

The medical establishment uses many convenient Latin abbreviations that make life easier when writing your own notes. However, when writing instructions on labels for clients, it is best to use, for example, “3 times daily,” rather than “t.i.d.,” written out in plain English (Table 14.11).

Bedtime=H.S.

Before meals=a.c.

2 squeezes 4×daily before meals=2 mL q.i.d. a.c.

Considerations when making up a formula include intention (therapeutic principles), symptoms, age, constitution, proportions of one herb to another, and duration of treatment.

The traditional philosophy for making formulas divides the thought process into four areas. The principle/sovereign herb or first best choice addresses the chief complaint. The secondary/deputy herbs reinforce the effects of the principle. Assistant herbs attend to symptoms or problems not yet covered. The helpers/envoys round it all out, correcting energetic imbalances. Once these herbs are chosen, proportions are assigned to each.

A dispensary is a dedicated space where herbs are prepared, formulated and provided. Formulation consists of deciding on your herbs, their proportions, and determining amounts needed to fit in the correct sized bottle. Deciding on safe, yet effective dosages is an extremely variable aspect of modern herbalism. As long as mild- or medium-strength herbs are used, there is a lot of leeway. Ranges were provided for various preparations.

Herbalists should have the ability to use basic metric measurements and medical abbreviations, along with making wise dosage determinations. This important information is further summarized in Appendix A.

The time has come for action, to be a practicing herbalist. We covered a lot of basics, and the tools are in place. The next step is to meet and greet a real, live client, figure out what to do for her, and what to recommend. We will give wise and effective advice and do no harm. The nitty gritty can be scary but exciting.

A tried and true method is to follow what all medical professionals do. If you have ever visited a doctor, you know the routine. Practitioners gather information in the form of a written and verbal health history. We conduct a physical assessment, arrive at a conclusion as to the problem or syndrome at hand, and compose a health plan. We dispense herbs, if any, and finally document what was done so that we have a record. This process allows for a thoughtful, consistent follow up for the next visit.

## Intake: Principles to Use for a Health History

<!-- chunk -->

### Preparation

Get ready. Wash your hands. Set your priorities. Center and get grounded. Say a prayer or put out an intention for the greatest and highest good of all concerned. It is imperative to clear your mind of your own worries, anxieties, concerns, and to-do lists before you can be fully present for your client. Now breathe in deeply, blow out slowly. Allow the breath to wash over you and go down through your soles to Mother Earth. Cleanse and connect. Be receptive. Put out love. You are now ready to meet your client.

<!-- chunk -->

### First Impressions

When meeting a client for the first time, the person is a blank slate. Who is this person who walks into your office or clinic? You begin an unbiased, sizing-up process on a physical and vibrational level the moment the person appears. Does the client appear healthy and strong, weak or sick? Observe the walk, posture, and gait. Is it loose, relaxed, and easy going? Does the person appear in pain; use a cane, crutches, or favor one side? Is the client of average weight, overweight, or thin as a rail? What feeling is emitted? Is there sadness, depression, exaggerated cheerfulness, stress, confidence, or insecurity? How is the qi? Is there exhaustion or energy and liveliness? Is the voice strong, small, or normal? Is the person glad to be here or were they talked into it?

Use your senses. Observe, feel, smell, and listen. Observe skin and complexion. Does it shine or have an inner glow, or is it dull and pasty? Are there blemishes, eczema, or acne? Is the color very red, overly pale, or bluish? Are the eyes clear, or are deep circles underneath? What do you pick up? If it is part of your repertoire, how is their aura? Are there unusual body odors? Is the voice true and clear, overly soft or loud, or are words swallowed and inhaled? This nonjudgmental assessment speaks volumes in a short time.

Greet them and shake their hand, feeling their body heat or lack of it. Is the hand hot, warm, dry, or rough like sandpaper? Or is it cool, cold, or wet and sweaty? Is hand clasp strong or weak and flabby? Does person feel predominantly excess or deficient, warm or cold, dry or moist? Even now, in the first couple of minutes, clues are picked up. By the time the health history is completed, a blood pressure, pulse and tongue assessment done, an energetic pattern begins to emerge, and things start to add up.

### Revisit the Table of Correspondences

In the Table of Correspondences from the Chinese Medicine Five Element System, each of the five yin organs, plus their yang partners, has a color, taste, emotion, smell, and sound that are open to a sense organ and rule a tissue (Chapter 9). For example, the Liver’s emotion is anger/flow, taste is sour, sense organ is the eyes, and the tissues it influences are the joints, tendons, ligaments, and nails. So this gives clues. If the person is loud, angry, and extroverted and has sore joints and unhealthy nails, their Liver is calling. All things being equal, a Liver-related herb would be considered in the formula, particularly when other aspects of the health history and physical assessment point in the same direction (Table 15.1).

### The 24-Hour Organ Clock

The yin/yang organ pairs have a time of day when they are dominant, called the 24-hour clock (Box 15.1). The 24-hour clock represents the time of day when each organ is functioning optimally and has the most energy. The qi in that meridian is peaking. If the organ is healthy, all is well, and the organ is busy doing its job. But if that organ is challenged, a person could have adverse symptoms in the exact time slot related to that particular organ. There are six organ pairs. Each organ has a 2-hour period when it dominates. Four hours for each pair adds up to 24 hours. This is useful information in your assessment.

Box 15.1

The organ at the opposite side of the clock from the dominant one, 12 hours away, has waning energy and is at its lowest. When the Liver peaks at 1 to 3 in the morning, the Small Intestine’s energy is at its lowest because its peak time is 1 to 3 in the afternoon. At 3 a.m. the Liver is busy detoxifying, so give it a chance and don’t eat. However, at 1 to 3 in the afternoon, the Small Intestine is queen, a great time for eating and digestion. That’s why the wisdom is to have the heaviest meal of the day at lunch. The 24-hour clock helps us to know the best times to exercise, eat, have sex, rest, and sleep.

Every organ has a physical and emotional component, a lovely holistic mind-body view. If an individual repeatedly wakes up coughing at 4 a.m., it’s Lung time. There could be a physical Lung problem. If a person wakes up at 4 a.m. grieving for their dog who just died, it’s a Lung emotion. The Kidney filters blood and balances electrolytes but emotionally represents fear and insecurity. Use the 24-hour clock to assist healing on all levels. Often, if the emotional issue is not addressed, it will manifest later in the physical body in increasingly serious ways. The 24-hour organ clock is a powerful tool.

The 24-hour clock relates to the Western concept of biorhythms or the circadian rhythms of day and night. If we honor that flow and live our lives accordingly, stress will decrease, and well-being will increase. When I was a night shift intensive care nurse, my flow of qi was completely backward. I was completely off kilter for years and never knew the day or the time. No wonder. I slept all day and was up all night. Following the clock as much as possible gives us proper times for life’s activities.

## Taking a Health History

There are many ways to obtain a health history. Over the years, I’ve tried many combinations and various intake forms. One option is to have a client fill out a written form. Another is to ask questions face to face and jot down notes as you go along. Sometimes a combination works best. Either way, it is important to have an organized method, so nothing is left out. I ask the client to fill out a written questionnaire and bring it with them to their first visit. This initial health history form includes general demographics, covers the body systems, and asks for their pressing problems, the reason for the visit, or the chief complaint. I then review the history with them and take my own additional notes on a separate sheet. Both the client’s written (and signed) history, plus my handwritten notes, go into their folder or chart. This information provides a baseline for future visits.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal Health History: The Intake Form

There is no perfect health history form out there. Whatever you ask, something is always forgotten. A sample Herbal Health History form is provided, but you are all encouraged to develop your own, as experience is gained. Furthermore, it is human nature for a client to leave out sensitive written and verbal information until trust has been achieved. Sometimes people just plain forget certain facts. Others are reluctant to share intimate details, such as sexual concerns or bathroom habits, until they feel comfortable. As time goes on, you will develop a chemistry with your client and find out whatever is needed. The more you know, the better you can devise a good treatment plan. A warm, safe environment that is neat but homey helps. Privacy and a peaceful setting are important.

The Herbal Health History form (Table 15.2 and Appendix A) covers the bases. Going through this with a client will take about an hour and a half. It could easily take longer, depending on the complexity of the case and if the client is talkative. It is easy to get sidetracked and drift off topic. Stay focused and gently steer the conversation back on target. Venting is often therapeutic but set limits because the conversation could stretch out all day. Obtaining a good history is an art and skill that improves with practice.

### Rationale for Herbal Health History Questions

<!-- chunk -->

## The Physical Assessment

Once the interview is complete, it is time to do a physical assessment. This process consists of Western and Eastern techniques and any other known system. In a good assessment, a BP will be obtained, and a pulse and tongue analysis will be done. Information gained in the written and verbal Herbal Health History is compared with physical findings. The more signs and symptoms that line up, the greater the assessment accuracy. If tongue is purplish in the liver area and there is history of hepatitis or menstrual problems, you are getting liver clues. If the stomach area on the tongue map is yellow and greasy, there is damp and probably heat. These symptoms indicate digestive issues that most likely have already surfaced on the intake form. Having a red tongue and a fast pulse means heat. Having a pale tongue or a slow pulse means cool or cold (Chapter 9).

<!-- chunk -->

### Tongue Cheat Sheet

The tongue reflects the body’s condition and is observed for color, texture, size, and shape (Fig. 15.1). We look at its body under the coating (also called the fur or moss) and its shape. Finally, we see if there’s any correlation with the tongue map in relation to the organs. Table 15.3 is a handy reference to keep in the clinic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pulse Cheat Sheet

The primary location is the radial pulse on each wrist on the thumb side (Fig. 15.2). The wrists should always be below heart level when you are taking pulses. Both parties should be relaxed. Three pulses are palpated on each wrist. Hook your middle (longest) finger over styloid process until your fingertip finds client’s radial pulse. Place your index finger over the radial pulse between longest finger and client’s wrist. Third finger should naturally slip over the radial pulse next to longest finger toward the person’s elbow. Table 15.4 provides a quick review.

Table 15.4

Floating

Distinct when barely touches skin and fades with pressure. Exterior conditions, elderly.

Weak

Hardly presses back. Qi and blood deficiency.

Slippery

Feels rubbery, soft, and rolling as if pencil is spinning inside vessel. Borders indistinct or poorly defined. Dampness or phlegm or pregnant.

Deep

Only distinct with considerable pressure. Interior disease.

Strong

Forceful and pounding. Excess, a pathogen is present.

Choppy

Irregular form like grains of sand moving through a straw or teeth on a fine saw blade. Congealed blood, stagnant qi, or deficient blood.

Wiry

Guitar string that pushes back. Hits fingers at same time. Liver conditions and pain.

Fine

Small, thin like thread, thinner than wiry. Blood and yin deficiency.

Irregular. Hasty, knotted, intermittent

Disorders of Heart qi, dangerous in sick, can occur in health with mental or emotional strain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Blood Pressure Assessment

Blood pressure (BP) is the pressure of the blood within the arteries as the heart pumps blood. When the right ventricular valve in the heart contracts, it produces the high number, called systolic pressure, as blood is pushed out into circulation. When the ventricular valve muscles relax, the pressure is at its lowest, which is measured as diastolic pressure. The pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). A typical BP is written as systolic over diastolic, e.g., 120/80 and stated as “one-twenty over eighty.”

BP is measured with a sphygmomanometer, an inflatable cuff with a gauge attached that is wrapped around a limb right above a radial pulse. The most common site is the brachial artery at the inner elbow. Another site is on the leg just above the popliteal artery behind the knee. The cuff is inflated so that blood flow is cut off. Then it is slowly released while you listen to the pulse with a stethoscope and watch the gauge. The top heart sound or beat is the systolic pressure; the bottom or last sound heard is the diastolic pressure. Although there are many electronic cuffs out there, the most accurate readings are taken by hand with a cuff and your ears to a stethoscope.

When arterial pressure is too high, the client has hypertension, which increases the risk of dementia, Alzheimer’s, stroke, and coronary heart disease that leads to heart attack. This is particularly true when present with other risk factors. High blood pressure can occur in children or adults, but it’s more common among people over age 35. Risk factors include being of African-American descent; being middle-aged and elderly; being obese; being a heavy drinker; having a history of insulin and leptin resistance, gout, or kidney disease; and taking birth control pills. It may run in families but not always. Cardiovascular risk begins to increase steadily as BP rises from 115/75 mm Hg to higher values. The American Heart Association guidelines designate normal BP to be below 120/80 (Table 15.5).

## Herbalist’s Assessment Form

The Herbalist’s Assessment form (Table 15.6 and Appendix A) is designed for the herbalist to use for initial visits and follow-up appointments and is separate from the Herbal Health History form. It is where herbal formulas are designed and where records are kept of what was asked, observed and recommended at each visit. A new form is used for every session; use a form for the initial client assessment and for all others.

Table 15.6

Herbalist’s Assessment Form(See Appendix A, Fig. A.2, for reproducible form)

In subsequent follow-up visits, applicable areas are filled out and the rest left blank. First time visits will take about an hour and a half, whereas follow-up appointments should be perhaps a half hour unless there are major new developments. Follow-ups are concerned with the goal for today, the chief complaint, primary problem(s) being addressed, or anything new and different. Because a detailed health history has been already obtained, there is no need to do it again.

Any health professional, herbalists included, must always keep good records and make sure any dispensed herbal formula is on file. It is not unusual to hear from a client 1 or 2 years down the road with a request for a refill of that wonderful cold formula you gave them eons ago. Of course, their bottle with label of ingredients is long gone.

<!-- chunk -->

### SOAP

The Herbalist’s Assessment form follows a very particular format and uses an acronym called SOAP, which stands for subjective, objective, assessment, and plan. SOAP notes are a style of charting that is frequently used in medical professions. It is found in clinics and hospitals and used by doctors, nurses, physical therapists, and others; and it is a method of organizing information and going through a logical thought process to arrive at a treatment strategy.

## Herbal Consult Suggestion Form

The Herbal Consult Suggestions form (Table 15.7 and Appendix A) is a form for you to write out the client’s instructions for them to take home. I fill this out as I go along and make a copy for my records. They’ll never remember it all, and calmly indicating that you’re writing it all down takes away the stress. Be sure your contact information appears on the form so that they can call with any questions. Of course, being available and promptly returning calls is a given. At the follow-up appointment, review this form with them to determine what was actually done and accomplished.

Table 15.7

Herbal Consult Suggestions (See Appendix A, Fig. A.3, for reproducible form)

<!-- chunk -->

### Explanation of Consult Suggestion Form

<!-- chunk -->

## Keeping Records

The client has been seen. You now have three paper (or electronic) forms. The client filled out their (1) Herbal Health History form. A verbal interview and a physical assessment were completed. You, the herbalist, filled out your own sheet, the (2) Herbalist’s Assessment form, where you followed a SOAP format. You arrived at a plan and dispensed the herbal formula. You presented said client with her herbs and an (3) Herbal Consult Suggestions form to take home. You made a copy for your own records.

All that paperwork is confidential. It now becomes a medical record that must be kept in a locked file cabinet and locked office. What was said in the consult room stays there. No blabbing on the elevator, bus, or internet to a friend or family member about your client. Electronic records must be protected. Confidentiality and right to privacy are not only a moral obligation but a law. HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the HIPAA Privacy Rule that followed the Act, protect a patient’s written and electronic medical records and health information.

The only time HIPAA does not apply is when the client or a legal guardian has given written permission/authorization to share it with another health professional, facility, insurance company, attorney, or billing agency. Patients have a right to examine and obtain a copy of their health records and to request corrections.11 This all amounts to a client’s right to privacy and the need for discretion. Sounds obvious; worth saying.

What if you want to get some help and confer with another herbalist or health professional about a case? Of course, you may. Just do not use the client’s name. Consults are done all the time. The only times you are required to disclose medical information without a client’s permission are situations involving court orders, fraud, or mental health problems where the client presents some danger to self or others. Never give out information to anyone without making sure.


The entire process of how an herbalist operates in real time was covered. First was the initial intake, where the client filled out the Herbal Health History form. A rationale was provided for each question. Physical assessment includes (at the least) taking pulse, examining the tongue, and obtaining a BP. The cheat sheets provided for pulse and tongue may be copied for clinic use.

The Herbalist’s Assessment form is where the practitioner’s notes and findings are recorded and where a holistic course of action involving diet, exercise, herbs, and such is decided on. The assessment form is divided into a classic SOAP format (subjective, objective, assessment, and plan). Formulating the plan begins with listing the therapeutic principles. Then the herbal formula is designed, complete with parts, herb, rationale, and dose. Dietary changes, supplements, lifestyle changes, and any other recommendations are listed. The Herbal Consult Suggestions form is given to the client, and a follow-up appointment is made.

Every practicing herbalist should appreciate the importance of keeping medical records safe and the need for maintaining trust and privacy. HIPAA regulations and where herbalism fits into this scheme were covered.

An herbalist’s highest mission is to maintain health by the practice of preventative measures or to recognize what optimal health could look like for any given individual and help them attain that goal. This chapter is a crash course in functional medicine, which addresses the underlying causes of disease using a systems-oriented approach that engages client and practitioner in a therapeutic partnership. Everyone is unique. Some days are better than other days. Herbalists use functional medicine concepts, restoratives, tonics, adaptogens, bitters, appropriate dietary principles, supplements, and lifestyle suggestions to facilitate maintaining the body in health.

A fundamental aspect of prevention is supporting the gut microbiome. Use of functional foods and herbs geared toward healthy gut function heads the list and is given prime time. The role of inflammation and oxidative stress is explained in relation to the gut. Healthy food guidelines and proven diets play a role.

Case histories following the SOAP format (Chapter 15) will be used to arrive at individualized herbal formulas for typical situations and include diet and lifestyle recommendations to maintain a healthy state. Practice case histories culminate in real-life herbal consults. That’s where we’re headed.

<!-- chunk -->

## Optimum Health

Every person is biochemically unique. Optimum health is a continuum and different for everybody depending on life choices and what was dealt at birth. Individual metabolism depends on genetic expression, age, environment, activity levels, and the physical and spiritual nutrition we give our bodies. An herbalist’s greatest calling is to help her or his clients live up to their unique health potential through preventative medicine, the ultimate kind of healing. Maintaining this coveted state involves mindfulness: consciousness in respect to food, herbs, exercise, sleep, spirituality, service, action, and stillness. It is a process and a life’s work. To facilitate this state, an herbalist uses restoratives, tonics, adaptogens, appropriate diet, lifestyle suggestions, and intuition.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Microbiome

Good health begins in the gut. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is considered one of the most complex microbial ecosystems on Earth. The bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other critters that reside there outnumber the cells in our body by 10 to 1. There are more bacteria in our intestines, particularly the colon, than cells in the entire body. In fact, that collection of little bugs weighs over 2 pounds. This community of organisms that resides in the intestines of humans and animals is known as the microbiome or gut flora. Unbelievably, more than 10,000 species of bacteria are found in the gut. They perform a wide variety of functions and need to be fed, balanced, and nourished if we expect to maintain physical and mental well-being. They make or break our health. There is no one ideal gut microbiome or flora. We are all different, just as we all have different gene combinations or genomes.1

Certain autoimmune diseases, like multiple sclerosis (MS) or type 2 diabetes and arthritis, are showing up with specific patterns or signatures of gut bacteria. The Human Microbiome Initiative sponsored by the National Institutes of Health is a research initiative to improve the understating of microorganisms found in healthy and diseased humans. Distinct, signature bacterial colonies have been found in people with some types of cancer, mental illness, obesity, or Clostridium difficile infections. That is enormously empowering news. The clinical pearl for herbalists is to make a priority of balancing out the gut in themselves and in each and every client. Some of the gut’s many functions are summarized below.

### A Few Impressive Gut Flora Functions

<!-- chunk -->

### Unbalanced Gut Flora or Dysbiosis

If the intestinal flora gets out of whack with too much yeast or the wrong combinations or types of bacteria (dysbiosis), many acute and chronic diseases occur. Gut cell wall junctions become widened, leading to intestinal permeability (IP) or leaky gut, which are different names for the same thing. Undigested large protein food particles (macromolecules) leak out between the cell walls into the blood circulation, acting as environmental antigens. They travel to weak places in the body, setting up shop and causing inflammation and autoimmune responses. Resulting problems are asthma, arthritis, mental health disease, lupus, and so many more.

Signs and symptoms of leaky gut are all over the map, depending on which organ or body system is weakened or susceptible. As time goes on, major diseases can manifest: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Crohn’s disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and other autoimmune problems. If you come across a client with bizarre signs and symptoms in many body systems with no apparent reason, the best approach is to start at gut level. When it is healthy, many of their symptoms and problems described in the following list will miraculously disappear.

Dysbiosis and its resultant health problems are rampant in our society. The causes are everywhere and can be hard to avoid. Unless we and our clients are educated and conscious about these triggers in our food and drug supply and elsewhere, it is easy to develop an unbalanced microbiome (Table 16.1).

### A Good Diet Builds the Microbiome

Gut flora is as individual as a fingerprint or a snowflake, but certain foods have a huge impact on its health. Fibers in foods that feed the gut flora are known as prebiotics, whereas probiotics are actual live, friendly gut organisms, like acidophilus or bifidobacteria, that live long and prosper when fed a good diet of prebiotics. Prebiotics heal and seal the gastrointestinal tract, provide fiber for bowel health, and provide probiotics for healthy gut bacteria. Care and feeding of the microbiome with specific prebiotic and probiotic foods follow.

Tips of the Trade: The Gut and Fermented Kefir

A clinical herbalist frequently begins by helping clients fix the gut even before a single herb is administered. When digestion functions properly, herbs can be absorbed and utilized efficiently.

A nifty way to fix the gut is with all kinds of fermented foods, starting with lactose-free kefir. Kefir is fermented milk made with a culture that can be easily and economically made at home with a little instruction. It is rich in viable probiotics that aid digestion and snuff out gut inflammation. Kefir kills unfriendly bacteria, yeasts, and fungi while adding the good stuff, an amazing way to improve digestion. A plain, unsweetened kefir smoothie, sometimes with fruits and veggies added, provides a nourishing morning digestive aid, so any morning supplements can be better absorbed.

### Herbal Categories That Build Up the Microbiome and Help Leaky Gut

The following is a list of herbal categories that might be chosen in a leaky-gut formula (Table 16.2). Generally, pick one or two from each category as needed, depending on the person’s condition. Nothing is written in stone, and a good assessment is needed for each person so that formulas can be individualized. More on this in Chapter 18.

## Inflammation: The Good and the Bad

When working properly, acute inflammation is the body's normal attempt at self-protection and promotes the removal of harmful stimuli, including damaged cells, irritants, or pathogens. When we have an infected cut finger, the inflammatory cascade gets busy. The finger becomes red, hot, swollen, and painful. The immune system reacts normally. White blood cells remove pathogens; blood and lymph remove excess edema and fluid. Alarm substances are released: prostaglandins, interleukins, leukotrienes, and eicosanoids. These trigger the inflammatory cascade or pathway. Our finger heals, pain is resolved, and the inflammatory response ends. All’s well that ends well.

Chronic, pathological inflammation is another story and can last month or years. In this case, the inflammatory response is triggered when there are no foreign invaders to fight off. The body responds as if normal tissues are infected or somehow abnormal. But they’re not. The immune system won’t shut off. This response is misdirected inflammation, and it sets the person up for chronic disease and pain, cognitive decline, heart disease, and autoimmune reactions where inflammation attacks healthy tissue, such as the joints, the heart, brain, uterus, pancreas, or any individual weak area.

Chronic inflammation is caused primarily by dysbiosis. Contributing factors are poor diet, toxins, stress, heavy exercise, trauma, and even fasting and cleanses. Chronic inflammation can also be caused from chronic infection, adrenal exhaustion, poor immune functioning, and toxic environmental exposures. The fix is to normalize gut flora and indulge in an antiinflammatory diet with lots of veggies. Add whole grains, grass-fed meat, and healthy fats, including cold water marine fish and oil, and back way off processed foods, sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, and junk foods. It’s the same old mantra.

Huge lists of herbs in the literature cite antiinflammatory botanicals. Most are useless because they’re too general. A few herbs have tropisms to particular body systems and help reduce pain and inflammation. Think energetics. Inflammation is a hot condition, so most cooling herbs automatically tend to help inflammation. For instance, Scutellaria Huang Qin (Baikal Skullcap root) is a cold, bitter herb and a broad-spectrum antimicrobial and antiallergic. It is used in heat stages of infection and acute allergy (which is also hot), so by its very nature it is antiinflammatory by default. When choosing Huang Qin, we are adding the antimicrobial piece and inadvertently addressing inflammation. This is an elegant use of a single herb to accomplish a lot. Some of the best dietary choices to help inflammation are the use of omega-3 FAs and antiinflammatory foods (Table 16.3).

## Oxidative Stress

When chronic inflammation takes hold, free radical damage or oxidative stress occurs at the cellular level. This process damages DNA and cell membranes and is implicated as a cause of premature aging and degenerative diseases, including cancer.

Oxidative stress begins in the liver (Chapter 19) with the formation of rogue, unstable molecules called reactive oxygen species (ROS). As the liver detoxifies, it breaks down metabolites into free radicals, which are unstable oxygen molecules that have lost an electron, but need that extra electron to remain stable. A well-functioning liver (with the help of antioxidant-containing foods) eventually breaks down free radicals into water-soluble molecules that can be harmlessly excreted through the bowel and bladder.

If the liver becomes overwhelmed with its normal load and by too many added exogenous toxins, it becomes overworked (and underpaid in nutrients). It can’t keep up with the large influx of free radicals, which cause a destructive molecular chain reaction as they attempt to pick up their missing electrons. They steal electrons from one another, and more and more free radicals develop, playing havoc in the body. Damaging oxidation or oxidative stress is similar to how oxygen causes iron to rust. This alarming scenario is the result of chronic inflammation.

A healthy liver that detoxifies free radicals efficiently is helped along by antioxidants. Antioxidants are substances that inhibit oxidation by donating electrons to neutralize free radicals. They include vitamins C and E, selenium, and flavonoids. They are available in supplement form, but the best sources are from herbs and whole foods: fruits and vegetables. The purer the diet (minimizing food additives, preservatives, and drugs), the fewer free radicals are produced and the less oxidative stress occurs. Foods and herbs that potentially have an effect on health beyond basic nutrition are called functional foods or superfoods. They reduce oxidative stress, may be prebiotics or probiotics, are filled with antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, and promote optimal health (Box 16.2).

## General Food Guidelines to Maintain Health

Our epidemic of obesity in children is accompanied by early-onset type 2 diabetes, allergies, and food sensitivities, autoimmune diseases, and eventual chronic dementias. All are testaments to the typical Standard American Diet (SAD) that is filled with sugar, saturated fats, and fast foods. It’s no wonder that the first three letters in the word diet are d-i-e.

Healthy food choices are not really complicated. The following are generalities for healthy food choices and habits:

### Types of Diets

The least food faddy, gimmicky diets follow. They are based on sound principles and research, and have been around for a good long run.

## A Healthy Immune System

Maintaining a healthy, vigorous immune system includes keeping the microbiome balanced, keeping inflammation and oxidative stress to a minimum, and maintaining a good antiinflammatory diet. Those measures help keep us relatively flu- and cold-free most of the time. They are important physical-level factors.

Particular foods that boost immunity are vitamin C-rich: red bell peppers, kiwi, papaya, strawberries, and citrus and dark greens, such as spinach. Garlic, onions, and ginger are classics. The antiinflammatory magical mushrooms, such as turkey tail, shitake, maitake (Hen of the Woods), Ganoderma Ling Zhi (Reishi mushroom) are rich in antioxidants, B vitamins, and polysaccharides. They modulate inflammatory cytokines, boost immunity, balance blood sugar, and fight cancer and aging. Not only that, they are delicious and flavorful (Box 16.3). Many are available in farmers’ markets, health food stores, and Asian food markets.

Box 16.3

Delicious Immune Soup

Some of the best foods for the immune system include Lily family Onions and Garlic, antiinflammatory Ginger root, adaptogenic Astragalus Huang qi root, and nutrient-filled mushrooms (not the white button variety).

Instructions.

Bring water to boil in large pot. Heat olive oil. Sauté garlic, onions, and ginger until soft and aromatic. Add the maitakes and shitakes to the sauté. Add veggie broth, sautéed items, and Reishi mushroom to the water. Simmer covered for 2 hours. Remove Astragalus pieces and Reishi. Add salt and pepper to taste, then just enough cayenne powder to bring about a light sweat.

(Adapted from Andrew Weil’s Eight Weeks to Optimum Health)8

There are also emotional, spiritual, and environmental stressors to consider. Situations come along that are one-time events and cause us to become run down and then sick. But if someone develops infections on a regular basis, such as three or more colds a year regardless of external factors, then the immune system is shouting for attention. Tips for good immune function include:

## Materia Medica to Maintain Health

We’re aiming to get the body healthy and practice preventative herbalism. An important way to do this is to incorporate restoratives, adaptogens, and tonics, the foundational herbs that maintain health. Herbs in these three categories have a lot of overlap. Many restoratives are thought of as adaptogens, and in some circles Chinese tonics are also considered to be like Western restoratives. Superfoods such as red, blue, and black berries, algae, bee pollen, and Milky Oat berry fit into the tonic/restorative classifications.

<!-- chunk -->

### Restoratives

Restoratives are used in Western herbalism to target specific tissues or body parts to heal and build, improve function, and support vital energy. Some restoratives fall into the adaptogenic category, and others simply enhance the effects of adaptogens. Restoratives rebuild and strengthen tissue and are full of nutrients. Energetically, restoratives tend to be sweet, harmonizing, and balancing and are mild, nontoxic herbs safely used for long periods (Fig. 16.2). A particularly interesting immune-stimulating mushroom is Cordyceps Dong Chong Xia Cao (Chinese Caterpillar Mushroom fruiting body), which is parasitic on dead insect larva rather than on live or nonliving plant matter, like most other fungi. It is notably restorative to the lungs and bronchi but acts on the entire hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) as well (Chapter 27).

Some restoratives are general, in that they provide global nutrition for the entire body, much like a multivitamin. Others are sometimes called tropho-restoratives, because they have an affinity for a specific organ and improve structure and function (Table 16.4). In a broad sense, restoratives can be considered tonics in the Chinese sense, because they address deficiency conditions. They are extremely useful for postpartum issues, mental stress, grief and worry, and weak constitutions.12 In many formulas, restoratives are used solely for protection.

### Adaptogens

This word is relatively new. It was coined in Russia in 1962 with the study of Panax ginseng, and then with Eleutherococcus senticosus, which was nicknamed Siberian or Eleuthero ginseng root. This common name led to confusion, because Eleuthero is not even in the ginseng family. Adaptogens reduce signs of the fight or flight phase of the immediate stress response and also help with long-term stress. Because stress causes so much disease and illness, we are blessed to have these botanicals. Their three major functions are that they normalize the HPA axis that deals with stress, decrease cortisol (an adrenal cortex stress hormone), and enhance the immune response.13

Additionally, they balance out all hormones and the nervous system and so are vitally important herbs to maintain health. Adaptogens are mild herbs that can be taken over a long term. The most studied adaptogens are from China, but that does not detract from those traditionally used for centuries in other major herbal traditions (Table 16.5).

### Chinese Tonics

In China, tonics are targeted to build and maintain the broad categories of qi, blood, yin, and yang (Table 16.6). They are used when the body is deficient and weak and needs vital energy; they are important herbs that increase longevity. Some schools of thought say that tonics are not appropriate during acute illnesses because they could drive infection deeper into body. But I have personally found this not to be true, and that tonics can be taken safely over long periods of time, sick or not. This is especially the case with Astragalus Huang Qi and Ganoderma Ling Zhi (Reishi mushroom) which boost immune function during illness.

## Common Conditions to Maintain the Body in Health

Each case history in this chapter, and thoughout Part Four (Therapeutics and Formulations) is presented in SOAP format. This organizational principle gets us from A to B in a logical sequence, covering all bases. There is no one right answer or definitive herbal formula for any given scenario. Case histories presented are representative to maintain the body in health. Many different herbs and strategies could arguably be used and would not be wrong. The general situations have been discussed in this chapter. (Case Histories 16.1, 16.2, and 16.3).

Case History 16.1

Case History for Dysbiosis and Indigestion

S. Rosa is a 35-year-old single mom. She has two school-aged kids and holds down two jobs to make ends meet. She complains of chronic bloating, flatus, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. Sometimes she “can’t think straight.” She describes her life as very stressful. Most days, she resorts to fast-food take-out to get dinner on the table.

O. P Slippery and slow. T Sticky white coat.

A. Dysbiosis/Spleen Qi Deficiency/Damp and cold.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Warm and restore gut (Spleen). (2) Dry damp and resolve diarrhea. (3) Help indigestion, gas, and bloating with carminatives. (4) Decrease stress with essential oils.


Case History 16.2

Case History for Weak Immune System

S. Janine is a 40-year-old attorney who is always traveling. Another business trip is pending. She has had five “colds” since January (it’s May). She takes Tylenol when needed, frequent Emergen-C packets that contain 1000 mg of vitamin C, antioxidants, zinc, manganese, and B vitamins. She averages 6 hours sleep a night, and her energy is down. She rarely cooks; tries to eat “healthy” restaurant food when away.

O. T Pink. P Weak. She has dark circles under her eyes; skin is pale.

A. Weak Immune System, run down. Wei qi or protective qi deficiency.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Boost immunity with adaptogens, nutritive herbs, qi tonic herbs. (2) Gut restorative and blood building herbs. Inflammation.


Case History 16.3

Case History for Assorted Problems

S. Joe drives a truck cross-country and lives on truck-stop and restaurant food. He belches, burps, and has a lot of gas and bloating. Furthermore, he has had many colds the last 2 years, more than usual. Takes no supplements or herbs but is willing to “give it a try.” He has at least 3 energy drinks a day and drinks copious amounts of coffee. Sometimes his heart races, and he can feel it beat. He weighs 285 pounds and would like to lose 50 pounds.

O. P Slippery, strong. T Scalloped, yellow center/red body.

A. Dysbiosis, Spleen damp heat, lowered immunity, inflammation.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Normalize gut flora with bitters, cholagogues, restoratives, fermented foods. (2) Dry damp, cool gut. (3) Restore/detox liver caused by fast food and excessive caffeine intake. (4) Boost immunity with adaptogens, superfoods. (5) Lower inflammation and cool down heat with clean diet/herbs.


Optimum health can look very different for each person. Maintaining a healthy microbiome is an important mission for every herbalist. Processed foods, GMOs, and stress contribute to dysbiosis and intestinal permeability, bitters, GI restoratives, cholagogues, antimicrobials, and herbs to dry damp are often used to keep the flora in check. Important additions are prebiotics and probiotics (especially fermented foods).

Acute inflammation is a normal process the body uses to deal with injury that sends out alarm substances via the inflammatory cascade. However, chronic inflammation is pathological and causes heart, brain, and autoimmune diseases. Poor diet, dysbiosis, toxic overload, stress, and trauma are contributing factors. Oxidative stress is a result of too many free radicals, causing DNA and cellular damage. Intake of antioxidants, eliminating processed foods, and enjoying a clean environment are helpful.

Dietary guidelines to maintain health include a rainbow diet and plenty of fresh water. Herbalists should be familiar with the Mediterranean and paleolithic diets, and the Gut and Psychology Syndrome (GAPS) protocol for hard-to-treat mental and autoimmune problems. There are many tools to boost immunity to keep clients relatively free of infection. The techniques include physical, emotional, and spiritual measures. Herbally, adaptogens balance stress, restoratives build and strengthen tissue, and tonics tonify qi, blood, yin and yang.

We are transitioning into a discussion of a dis-ease state, such as when optimum health is off balance. An herbalist’s first intention is prevention, and for that endeavor we use adaptogens, tonics, and restoratives. But if a harmful, infectious microorganism has arrived for any reason, we use the anti’s: antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals, antiparasitics, antiprotozoals, antiinflammatories, antihelminths, or antibiofilms. When wellness is restored, we rebuild the body using preventative strategies so that dis-ease doesn’t come back to haunt us.

Specifics to address particular organisms include broad-spectrum and systemic herbs covering lots of territory. The berberines lean toward bacterial and fungal infections. Usnea spp. (Old Man’s Beard lichen) is notorious for going after streptococcal bacteria, although it is still used for others. Many, including Scutellaria Huang Qin (Baikal Skullcap root) cross over, treating both viruses and bacteria. Artemisia annua (Sweet Annie herb) is antifungal and antiparasitic, especially for malaria (Box 10.3).

Why are some infectious diseases and organisms so hard to treat despite our best efforts? Superbugs and biofilms are explored as possible explanations.

<!-- chunk -->

## Infection and Toxicosis

An infection is an invasion and multiplication of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites that are not normally present in or on the body. It can cause many symptoms or none at all. We are interested in both: those that cause symptoms and make us miserable and others that are temporarily dormant, particularly viruses. The presence of fever and inflammation implies the existence of infection, although these symptoms are not always present in the early stages. Infectious diseases range from external and superficial (on the skin) to internal or all the way down deep in the body. An acute infection is newly arrived, whereas a chronic one has been there a long time. In general, acutes are easier to treat. The longer they last, the deeper they go and the more stubborn they are.

Antimicrobials are generally taken internally, swallowed into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, absorbed into the blood, and circulated to various organs, tissues, and cells where they fight the offending microorganism. Antiseptics destroy or inhibit the growth of microorganisms locally, in or on living skin or mucous membranes. A Garden Sage leaf gargle swishes directly on the throat tissue, killing off organisms residing there; an Eyebright herb or Goldenseal root eyewash does the same for eyes. When using an external, antiseptic remedy, also treat internally to approach in in both directions.

Infections don’t magically appear out of nowhere. The body in health does a pretty good job of maintaining homeostasis, providing strength and vitality, known as wei qi or life-force. By remaining free of chronic unproductive stress and anxiety and maintaining an ecosystem of beneficial microbes, we increase chances of health. When dysbiosis occurs, we retain toxins and are more susceptible to infection. The first approach in treating infection is always prevention. The second or last resort is curative and remedial.

Toxicosis is the build-up of poisons from environmental (exogenous) factors and from factors that originate from within (endogenous). The body’s many metabolic processes produce their own end-product toxins, which are normally eliminated through the bowel, bladder, or skin. When foreign microbes invade the body, they release their own toxins as they are killed off by the immune system. If the load becomes too great, host tissue is damaged, and immunity is disabled. Therefore, when treating infection, toxins need to be cleared out as part of the therapeutic strategy. Environmental toxins are an entirely different story and are responsible for many health problems but not usually part of the infectious disease process (Chapter 19).

### Herbs for Infections and Toxicosis Worth Honorable Mention

An Herbs Worth Honorable Mention section will appear throughout Part IV, Therapeutics and Formulations (Chapters 16–28). These herbs are not listed in Part II Materia Medica (Chapters 11–12), but are still very important and specific to the particular body system addressed.

Box 17.1

Yin Chiao Pien, Honeysuckle, and Forsythia Tablets for Early-Onset Colds and Flu

This is a 200-year-old classic that is considered tried and true to ward off the external pernicious influences, such as wind and cold invading the lungs, External Wind Cold, and External Wind Heat. Use when exposed or likely to be exposed to external pathogens, sore throat, common cold, and other respiratory pathogens.4 Honeysuckle and Forsythia flowers are known for their synergistic antimicrobial effects.

There are many versions of Yin Chiao with differing proportions. The first seven herbs are found in most of them. Be sure to include those. Some formulas include other herbs, such as Bamboo grass leaf and prepared Soybean.

## Bacteria and Materia Medica

Bacteria are one-celled organisms that have a cell wall but lack organelles and an organized nucleus. They live everywhere, in and on plants, animals, and humans and in all environments, hot to cold, dry to wet, and desert to ocean. These are one of the oldest forms of life on planet Earth and are neither plants nor animals. Many are harmless; most are useful, covering the soil, causing fermentation, or inhabiting our gut. A few cause disease.

Bacteria have survived harsh environments, each other, and chemical assaults. Ever since Alexander Fleming developed penicillin in 1928, the “one drug for one bug” mentality was born. Antibiotics (meaning antilife) became the miracle drugs that could cure many dangerous bacterial infections like Pneumococcal pneumoniae (most common type of bacterial pneumonia), Streptococcus pneumoniae (causes bacterial strep throat), and Clostridium difficile (bacteria that affects the colon).

Unfortunately, antibiotic drugs have been overprescribed and overused, so much so that the bacteria have reacted as any self-respecting microbe would. They evolved, mutated, adapted, and changed form, generation by generation. For some bacteria, a new generation occurs every 20 minutes. Hence, many bacteria became resistant to antibiotics. In response, we keep changing the drugs to keep up with the mutations. Methicillin is no longer working against aptly named methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Bacteria have evolved into superbugs that are harder and harder to treat. Gonorrhea, tuberculosis, and other diseases, once presumed dead and eradicated, have returned, creating worldwide infectious disease crises.

Gram stains are a way to identify bacteria in the lab. In 1884, Danish scientist Hans Gram began applying a crystal violet stain to bacterial slides. If the cells showed up purple under the microscope due to a thick cell wall, they were dubbed gram-positive. If they didn’t and showed up red, they were gram-negative. Gram-negative bacteria lose the crystal violet stain and take on the color of a red counterstain.3

When applied to antibiotics, certain drugs and antimicrobial herbs are active against major gram-positive microbes like Clostridium difficile, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Others treat major gram-negative bacterial microbes such as Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella spp. Unless a drug or herb is broad-spectrum (most are), they are specific for certain microorganisms within one gram type or the other. Of course, this is known only if the studies have been done.

The Antibacterial Materia Medica table (Table 17.1) provides an overview of a few extremely useful herbs, information about broad- versus narrow-spectrum, systemic versus nonsystemic, and a little on gram-positive or gram-negative designations.

## Biofilms and Materia Medica

Biofilms are communities of bacteria species that live together within a protective slimy coating. They stick to each other, and often adhere to tissue surfaces. The normal state for bacteria is to coexist with many other species. Biofilms secrete a slimy matrix, chiefly a polysaccharide, that protects them from bacteria in other biofilm communities and from antibiotic penetration. The bacteria in a biofilm colony work together collectively to protect themselves. Biofilms have been compared to multicellular organisms, because there is so much interaction between the individual cells. In the 1980s, biofilms were discovered growing on medical implants, heart valves, stents, catheters, and pacemakers, causing infection. They can cause infective endocarditis and pneumonia in cystic fibrosis patients.

Biofilm theory explains why so many bacteria are resistant to antibiotic drugs and why certain diseases return repeatedly despite many rounds of antibiotic drug treatment.5 Consider chronic ulcers, stubborn urinary tract infections, and sinus infections that won’t clear up. Many bacterial species (but not all) live together in this fortified, protective slime, their biofilm community. This film protects them from antibiotics as they build up resistance, alter genetic expression, mutate, and change.6 To be fair, some biofilms are actually beneficial. For instance, Lactobacillus in the gut forms a biofilm that is protective for humans against malicious bacterial overgrowth.

Sweating It Out With Fresh Ginger Juice/Tea

The most effective way to use Ginger root for early-onset antiviral purposes is to make a fresh tea. That way, the active compounds enter the blood stream in about 30 minutes, peaking in 60, and get the sweat going.

Directions with juicer. Juice a large piece of fresh rhizome, the size of a medium carrot or 4 thumb-sized pieces. Combine ¼ cup fresh juice with 12 oz hot water. Add 1 tablespoon wild honey, ¼ of a squeezed lime as juice, and ⅛ teaspoon ground Cayenne pepper.

Directions for tea. Grate or finely chop a thumb-sized piece of Ginger. Steep covered in 8–12 oz hot water for at least 20 minutes, and then strain. Add honey and ground Cayenne pepper. Spicy, hot-tasting, and yummy for a Wind Cold condition.

Yield. One cup or a little more. It’s easier to double or triple this to last for a day’s worth, especially if sick and feeling very sleepy. Just reheat/simmer tea, as needed, throughout the day. Add the honey and Cayenne separately each time.

Dose. One cup every 2 to 3 hours in acute conditions to keep blood levels high.

## Viruses and Materia Medica

Viruses are unique life forms—the ultimate survivalists. Unlike bacteria, viruses have no nucleus or cell wall. They are a simple strand of DNA or RNA surrounded by a protein coat or capsid, so small they cannot be seen with an electron microscope and can reproduce only within a host cell. Each type of virus has a specific shape.2 Viruses can enter cells, snip off sections of its DNA or RNA, and weave the sections into their own genetic structure. This allows them to alter themselves and be extremely adaptable. Like seeds or spores, they can hang out for years on their own or exist in host cells in a state of hibernation and dormancy. When conditions are right, they come to life and multiply. They don’t break apart and divide like normal cells. Instead, they insert their genetic material into their host’s nucleus, literally taking over its functions.

Viruses are travelers. Some are spread by respiratory droplets, as with colds and flu. Some travel on ticks, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, or on mosquitoes, causing dengue fever, yellow fever, West Nile virus, and Zika virus illnesses. In humans, they often travel via immune system cells in search of preferred locations. The Epstein-Barr virus looks for B cells, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) searches out T4 lymphocytes. Others prefer certain organs. The hepatovirus species that causes hepatitis goes to the liver, and the Herpes spp. virus travels to the brain and spinal cord, causing encephalomyelitis. Once viruses find a compatible host cell, they break off pieces of themselves and send them to the host’s nucleus where they quickly replicate.

But don’t consider all viruses on Mother Earth to be a horror show. Most live in the soil, the water, and in and on us quite symbiotically and happily. The healthy microbiome in the gut and on our skin are examples of places where bacteria and viruses live with us harmlessly and beneficially. Viruses, like other microorganisms, represent our origins and beginnings of life. They were here first and still remain. We evolved from them and are dependent on them, so we best get along. That means not madly and obsessively washing them from our skin and countertops. Hygiene is important, but no there is need for fanaticism.

No really effective antiviral drugs exist, and those that do tend to be very strong with nasty side effects. Thankfully, this is not so with antivirals in the plant kingdom. An Antiviral Materia Medica appears in Table 17.3. The main Western medicine weapons for viral infections are vaccines. Vaccines stimulate the production of our own antibodies against the disease in question, providing immunity most of the time. Early vaccines eradicated deadly smallpox and polio. Tetanus and measles vaccines have practically eliminated those threats. Today there is a movement against vaccinations. Doubt, controversy, and strong opinions exist about contaminants, heavy metals (especially mercury), and claims that vaccines actually cause, rather than prevent, the disease or make us sicker. It is a loaded topic and one where it’s best to steer clear and let parents and individuals decide for themselves.

## Therapeutic Principles for Treating Bacteria, Viruses, and Biofilm Infections with Case Histories

Fortunately for us, many herbs are quite effective against general infection and biofilm communities because the plants have learned to fight off their own microbe invasions and contain chemicals that can do this. Strategies for biofilms are similar as for general infection. Basically, the therapeutic principles for an infectious disease formula should include the following components.

Case History 17.1

Case History for Upper Respiratory Viral Infection

S. Roy seems to have had “the same cold” many times this season. It comes and goes. Low grade fever averages 101°F when it occurs. Rhinitis with clear mucus. Complains of headache and pressure around the eyes. He has been using Echinacea tincture from the health food store and vitamin C. Throat culture and sensitivity was negative for bacteria.

O. P Rapid. T Red. Temperature 100°F. Lungs clear to auscultation.

A. Depressed immune system (Wei qi). Wind Heat. Resistant upper respiratory/sinus/viral infection.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Eliminate infection and fever with strong, cooling antibiofilm, antiviral herbs. (2) Increase immunity with immunostimulants. (3) Nervine for headache and relaxation. (4) Restorative for respiratory.


Case History 17.2

Case History for Early-Onset Respiratory Infection, Microorganism Type Unknown

S. Stefanie came down with chills the previous night. Her throat is scratchy and tickly. She wants to “get right on it” before she is “really sick.” There is no fever or thirst. Stomach feels “queasy,” and she is a little nauseated.

O. P Tight. T Normal; thin, white coat. Forehead cool and sweaty. No fever.

A. Wind Cold. Early-onset infection, microorganism unknown.

P. Specific therapeutic principles: (1) Dispel wind cold/infection with warm, stimulant diaphoretics. (2) Ginger juice/tea to “sweat it out.” (3) Soothe throat. (4) Settle stomach. (5) Stimulate immunity.

## Parasites and Materia Medica

Parasites are organisms that live on others and obtain nutrients from their host. The three types of parasites that cause human disease are helminths, protozoa, and ectoparasites. Helminths are worms—like roundworms, tapeworms, and pinworms—and can live in the GI tract or blood. Protozoa are one-celled organisms that can multiply in humans and elsewhere. Trichomonas vaginalis is a protozoan that infects the vagina. Malaria is caused by the protozoan parasite, Plasmodium spp. Giardia spp. is a microscopic protozoan parasite found in unsafe, unsanitary water. Ectoparasites are the bloodsuckers, including ticks, fleas, lice, and mites.12

Anthelminthics are herbs that kill and flush worms. They work as vermicides that kill parasites and as vermifuges that flush them out. Remedies called parasiticides treat parasites externally. These include Aloe Vera gel and Alum root and essential oils of Camphor, Thyme, Lemon, Lavender, and Eucalyptus. Inorganic substances are also used: calomel, realgar, litharge, and sulphur.

Fungi are neither plants nor animals. Some are parasites; some are not. They consist of mushrooms, yeasts, molds, mildews, smuts, and rusts; they live by breaking down and absorbing dead or live organic matter. They have no chlorophyll and reproduce by spores. Fungal infections can affect any part of the body. Candida albicans is one of the most common yeast infections that can infect the gut, the vagina, and the mouth (thrush). Other frequently seen fungal infections are athlete’s foot and ringworm. Onychomycosis, also called tinea unguium, is a fungal infection that gets under the fingernails and toenails and is very hard to eradicate.

<!-- chunk -->

### Therapeutic Principles for Treating Parasites

Parasites can be difficult to treat with herbs because they often accompany or hide behind other syndromes. Sometimes a specific diagnosis can be helpful, such as a positive ova and parasite (O and P) stool culture for worm eggs taken by a healthcare provider. Parasites might be a one-time problem, caused from drinking Giardia-infested water or from traveling to a foreign country and contracting a strange eye fungus. If that is the case, antifungal herbs should do the trick. See the Antiparasitic Materia Medica in Table 17.4. Case History 17.3 illustrates a typical fungal infection.

Case History 17.3

Case History for Fungal Infection

S. Louise has red cracks between her toes. They itch, sting, and burn. She’s had this since the summer when she went swimming. Over-the-counter athlete’s foot powder didn’t help. Reports gas, bloating, and indigestion on regular basis.

O. P Normal. T Thick, yellow coat. Feet have red cracks between the toes with flaking and sweaty skin that looks like it’s breaking down.

A. Spleen Damp Heat. Fungal infection of the foot; probably athlete’s foot (Tinea pedis). Compromised immunity due to dysbiosis.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Kill foot fungus. (2) Dry spleen damp. (3) Treat dysbiosis. (4) Strengthen immune system. (5) Treat herbally, externally and internally.


More often parasites are sneaky, because they hide behind and accompany other problems like chronic skin outbreaks, dysbiosis, allergies, chronic infections, chronic fatigue, or cancer. Consequently, in addition to eliminating the actual parasites, it is necessary to treat the underlying deficiency.11 This treatment includes using restoratives for the offending area, tonifying yin or yang as the case may be, nourishing the yin or blood. The microbiome has to be addressed. It takes good detective work and a wise assessment to puzzle it out. The basic therapeutic principles follow.

Intestinal parasitic die-off. This is a possible, but not an absolute, positive side effect of anthelmintic treatment. Die-off refers to toxins from dying pathogens (parasites, worms, candida, etc.), overwhelming the body’s abilities to clear them out. It can cause nasty side effects: fever, muscle aches, headaches, skin rash, excess mucus, brain fog, and irregular bowels. Hence, an important therapeutic principle is to make sure the body can eliminate all the dead worms and their toxins. This is accomplished by including one or two lymphatic decongestants, such as Cleavers herb or Red Root, a qi and blood mover, a mild laxative, and/or a diuretic.

## Chinese Medicine Perspective on Infections with Major Syndromes

In Chinese Medicine, many infectious syndromes have wind in their names, meaning microbes enter the body from the outside environment, external wind, or from the inside, internal wind. Herbs that treat these infections are broad-spectrum antiinfectives that also stimulate the immune system. Most are antipyretic, antiinflammatory, and act as local antiseptics or systemic antimicrobials (Table 17.5).

Table 17.5

To treat: dispel wind cold and promote sweating.

Use warm, stimulant diaphoretics and antimicrobials.

To treat: dispel wind heat, cool the exterior, and promote sweating.

Use pungent, cool, relaxant diaphoretics and antimicrobials.

This chapter explored concepts regarding infection and toxicosis, which included bacteria, viruses, the many types of parasites, and their Materia Medicas. Antimicrobial herbs are usually cold, bitter, astringent, drying, sinking, and chemically rich in alkaloids. Chinese Medicine syndromes related to infection and toxicosis include: Wind Cold, Wind Heat, Damp Heat, and Fire Toxins.

Bacteria are one-celled organisms that can cause lethal diseases. They can be broad- or narrow-spectrum, systemic or nonsystemic, and gram-positive or gram-negative. They are becoming increasingly resistant to many antibiotic drugs, causing an infectious disease health crisis.

Viruses are incomplete cells made up of strands of DNA or RNA surrounded by a protein coat. They can lie dormant for years and come to life inside a healthy host cell’s nucleus, replicating when the time is right. The chief allopathic treatment for viruses is vaccines; however, there are many antiviral herbal remedies.

Parasites live on other organisms and get their nutrients from their host. Helminths are parasitic worms that can live in the gut. When treating worms and other parasites, an important concept to address is die-off, in which toxins from dying pathogens can cause unpleasant symptoms in their host.

The germ theory was contrasted to the biofilm theory. Biofilms may be one explanation for why infections are resistant to antibiotics. It now seems that these entire microbe groups are often the culprit and explains why some diseases remain entrenched and chronic, despite repeated antibiotic treatment. Many broad-spectrum antimicrobial herbals are effective for biofilms, such as Echinacea angustifolia, the berberines, and Scutellaria Huang Qin.

The gastrointestinal or digestive system is so named because of its obvious function as a channel for food digestion, assimilation, absorption, and elimination, and the many ills associated with these roles. We need food to live, providing both nutrients and energy. The gastrointestinal (GI) system was first discovered and researched by U.S. Army surgeon, William Beaumont (1785–1853), known as the father of gastric physiology. We now know the GI system goes far beyond Beaumont’s original understanding.

The gut affects whole body health because of the 2 ½ to 3 pounds of intestinal microbiome associated with health and/or disease. The gut profoundly influences the immune and nervous systems and can even affect our moods, because it is part of the gut-brain connection. The Four-R approach to gut health involves using herbs and foods to fix and maintain the microbiome and mucosa. Appreciation for a healthy intestinal flora and for keeping it healthy is a priority for herbalists.

From a mind-body perspective, the gut is the location of the third chakra, our personal energetic power center in relation to the external world and the seat of our emotions. When we know and feel a truth at gut level, it is unshakable and hard to deny. It must be confronted, no matter how painful or fearful. The third chakra relates to self-esteem and our perceived place in the world. Working with it is part of the healing journey.

In Chinese Medicine, the GI system involves the yin Spleen and its organ pair, the yang Stomach. The Spleen has many functions, some not really part of digestion. Consequently, you will also meet the Chinese Spleen in other chapters.

## The Many Aspects of Gut Functions

<!-- chunk -->

### The Gut Is a Digestive Organ System

We can live about 3 days without water and around 3 weeks without food. The digestive system extracts and synthesizes the nutrients from our food with the help of enzymes and hormones. It takes care of breaking down our food into the macronutrients—carbohydrates, proteins, and fats—so that they can be absorbed and transported throughout the bloodstream to every cell in the body. Carbohydrates supply energy; proteins are used for growth and repair; fats store energy. These are obviously crucial functions, and things can go quite wrong with this process, causing most commonly indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, infection, weight gain or loss, reflux, gallstones, celiac and Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel disease (IBD), hemorrhoids, diverticulitis, and other problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Gut Houses the Microbiome

The microbiome, addressed throughout this textbook, concerns the all-important 2 ½ or so pounds of roughly 1000 different species of microorganisms residing mainly in the large intestine (Fig. 18.1). These can get out of balance and make us very uncomfortable. The microbiome affects nutrient absorption, detoxification, moods, appetite, food cravings, chronic pain, and mental function. When it gets out of balance, we get inflammation, leaky gut or intestinal permeability, and the resultant ills of inflamed neurons, autoimmune and chronic diseases, obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes, hormonal problems, anxiety, depression, and brain fog.1 Add to this list arthritis, allergies, and food intolerances. Any and all body systems may be affected. Maintaining and/or healing intestinal permeability is paramount in dealing with these problems. Further on we’ll look at the specifics of doing this on a nutritional and herbal level.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Gut Is an Immune Organ

At least 70% of the immune system is in the gut. The gut is constantly threatened with antigens, which are foreign invaders from the diet and any other infectious bacteria that get in the mouth by whatever means. Even in our cleanliness-obsessed society, no food is sterile. Utensils and countertops are quite germy. Who knows what comes in contact with our hands before they reach our mouths? Don’t even think about what babies touch and eat and somehow live through it. How come we don’t (usually) get sick?

The colon has developed an amazing barrier to deal with these threats, the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which is an important part of the immune system. The GALT is only one single cell wall thick yet guards against the penetration of microbes from outside sources. It traps bacteria in its rich protective mucus, kills and expels foreign invaders, and activates many types of immune cells.

A well-balanced colon microbiome provides essential immune protection and is necessary for mucosal health. Commensal, friendly microbes compete with potential pathogens for space and food. Furthermore, good gut flora regulates maturation of the mucosa and activates immune functions in the GALT, whereas pathogenic gut flora causes immune dysfunction, increasing inflammation that leads to leaky gut, and resulting in disease formation.

When exposed to pathogenic microbes in spoiled or bad food, we can get food poisoning. Should this occur, the gut wall secretes the inflammatory response chemical, histamine, which is detected by the enteric nervous system (ENS), a meshlike system of neurons that governs the function of the gastrointestinal tract. Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea ensues in attempts to expel the bad bugs.

### The Gut Is an Autoimmune Organ

The autoimmune disease list keeps growing. Here’s the physiology. When spaces form between the cell walls of the intestinal lining because of microbiome imbalance or dysbiosis, leaky gut or intestinal permeability (IP) is created (Fig. 18.2). IP allows large undigested protein molecules to leak out between the cells and be absorbed across the intestinal lining into the bloodstream (just like digested food). These molecules are then transported all over the body. When they arrive at a weakened, susceptible organ, they initiate an inflammatory response. This sets up an antigen-antibody response. The body perceives the undigested food as an antigen—an enemy—and builds up antibodies to destroy the tissue. Essentially, this process is an autoimmune response—the body is destroying itself. The gut wall is destroyed in Crohn’s, ulcerative colitis, and celiac disease. The myelin sheath is destroyed in multiple sclerosis (MS). Joints deteriorate in arthritis. Pancreatic islet cells stop making insulin in diabetes. The thyroid gland enlarges in Hashimoto’s hypothyroidism. All of these are autoimmune responses.

When the microbiome is balanced, and IP is healed and sealed, inflammation and the antigen-antibody response stops. The autoimmune condition is improved, if not cured.

### The Gut Communicates with the Brain and Affects Mood

We used to think that all thoughts and emotions were in our head. Not so. The gut affects the brain, and the brain affects the gut. The gut is considered the second brain. Neurons composing the enteric nervous system (ENS) in the gut send out hormones and chemical neurotransmitters to the brain along the vagus nerve. These chemicals are responsible for originating the emotions and thoughts that the brain interprets. If we are joyous, nervous, or depressed, the actual chemicals released from the ENS send that message to the brain. In this way, mood and mental illness are influenced on a gut level. This connection is why the gut is considered the second brain.

The brain does the same thing in reverse. Sometimes the chemicals and neurotransmitters originate at the brain end, sending messages to the gut. However, more emotional messages originate in the gut than in the brain. This association is why so many GI illnesses are stress related (excessive cortisol production) and why stress gives us GI symptoms.

We literally “feel it in our gut,” intuitively and physically, and this phenomenon affects our health for better or worse. Mental illness and exaggerated emotions are related to this phenomenon, egged on by intestinal permeability. Most mental illnesses, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism, are helped by healing dysbiosis and leaky gut.

The close connection between gut and brain explains why we can feel intestinal or GI pain or get a bout of diarrhea when stressed, because these issues all begin on a gut level. Nausea might result from appearing before an audience or presenting a paper. It’s not all in our heads. Depression, anxiety, anger, happiness, and particularly stress have an influence on our health. Negative emotions can lead to GI inflammation, susceptibility to infection, and depressed immunity. Irritable bowel and other GI irregularities are more severe when there is stress. Stress makes pain worse.2 Therefore, therapies for stress reduction such as meditation, yoga, psychotherapy, and other modalities can help reduce many inflammatory bowel diseases and improve immunity and overall well-being.

### The Gut Is an Endocrine Organ

The gut and a healthy microbiome influence hormonal balances throughout the body, which then impacts women’s health, thyroid problems, sleep patterns, diabetes, weight control, and appetite. For instance, gut flora plays a role in premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and menopause. When estrogen accumulates and is not properly eliminated by the liver each month, a situation called estrogen dominance occurs (Chapter 28). This is one cause of heavy periods, PMS, fibroids, and uterine cancer. Dysbiosis is a key player and makes the situation worse.

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune type of hypothyroidism, the most common kind. Autoimmune diseases are a well-established result of leaky gut. Healthy flora is essential for conversion in the thyroid gland (and liver) of thyroid hormone T-4 into the stronger and more bioavailable T-3 (Chapter 27).

The flora also affects mood and sleep. About 80% to 90% of the feel-good hormone, serotonin, is produced in the gut. Melatonin hormone production, which enhances sleep, is produced from serotonin. Therefore a good serotonin supply helps induce a good melatonin supply and ensures sound sleep.

Another example is appetite control. The wrong microbiome mix alters the way we store fat, balance blood glucose levels, and respond to hunger and satiety. Leptin hormone tells us we’re full; ghrelin hormone increases hunger. With a wacky microbiome, we become leptin-resistant and don’t get the signal to quit eating.3 We plow on through that carton of ice cream.

### The Gut Is a Detoxifier

The digestive system is a natural toxin eliminator that works 24/7 to sort through and eliminate waste. When it becomes overloaded, trouble begins. Normally, undigested, unabsorbed, and unusable food products are passed through the colon for elimination. If these pile up too fast, they overwhelm the gut. They break down, adhere to the colon wall, and, in time, seep back into the bloodstream, resulting in a toxic condition.

Bowels develop toxic overload from chemicals, fertilizers, antibiotics, pesticides, industrial waste, cleaning products, heavy metals, and drugs that permeate our food and water supply. The body tries hard to detoxify these contaminants through the bowel and liver but often can’t keep up. Toxins can bind to cells in the immune, nervous, and endocrine systems. Inflammation and oxidative stress occur, even causing genetic alterations.1 Symptoms can manifest in any body system. We might develop brain fog, impaired memory, autoimmune syndromes, metabolic prediabetic syndrome, and hormonal imbalances with PMS or hot flashes. Some of the more common symptoms are fatigue, cyclic breast tenderness, inability to lose weight even on a low-calorie diet, emotional swings, and digestive problems, all of which signal toxic overload.

All kinds of cleanses or detoxification programs exist: colonics, colema boards (a type of home enema), fasting, expensive supplements, and powdered foods, for example. Most cleanses work temporarily, and the person initially feels lighter, brighter, and more energetic and experiences weight loss. Too soon old symptoms return, and the need for detoxification creates a vicious cycle. Eventually, the thyroid resets the thermostat to slow down and store more fat. As the person reverts back to old eating habits, weight gain returns. Except in severe instances when all else has failed, we really don’t need a heroic cleanse. Here are two conservative detoxification methods:

## Chakras

Chakra is a Sanskrit word meaning wheel. Chakras refer to the spiritual energy center of the body (Fig. 18.3). There are seven major chakras in the form of spinning wheels or balls of light ascending from the base of the spine to the crown or top of the head and situated along major nerve bundles (a plexus) along the way, places where the physical body and consciousness meet. They are a linking of mind, body, and spirit and have everything to do with holistic healing. Each chakra is associated with the physical organs they are near and with various emotional and spiritual issues a person might be dealing with that is contributing to their illness.

These wheels of light are connected to one another, and energy can get blocked anywhere along the way. (A lot like Chinese meridians and qi.) So too, each spinning chakra can wobble on its axis, spin in the wrong direction (clockwise is normal) or stop moving altogether. If emotional issues are not dealt with, illness may eventually manifest on a physical level, because of the mind-body connection.

As we go through the Therapeutics and Formulations section, considering the body systems one by one, the chakra connected with that system will be included, along with its significance to total healing.

### The Third Chakra, the Power Center

Gut-level feelings are nothing new. Metaphysically, they were always the case, and now science is chiming in with evidence that they are a physical fact (Fig. 18.4). The gut is related to the third chakra, our core and power center, called the solar plexus, located right below the diaphragm and connected energetically to the digestive organs.4 It is the seat of our emotions, having to do with feelings, self-esteem, and how we view ourselves in the world. It is interesting that this intuitive metaphysical insight was around thousands of years before science became aware of the gut-brain relationship to emotions.

When we consider the mind-body connection, we realize that spiritual and emotional work must be done as effectively as the work we do to maintain physical structure. This requirement is especially true with autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), indigestion, ulcers, hepatitis, and eating disorders. It is important to take back our power and deal with issues, such as overcoming our fears, so that gut health can be realized.

## Chinese Medicine Perspective: The Gut with Major Syndromes

The Chinese Spleen is different from the Western spleen. In Western physiology, the spleen is part of the immune system, a lymphatic tissue that stores blood and produces white blood cells, antibodies, and stem cells. In the Chinese Medicine realm, it is the main organ of digestion and much more besides.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chinese Medicine Major Spleen Syndromes

Please note that signs and symptoms listed for any given syndrome are all the ones that are possible, not all those required for that syndrome to exist. Furthermore, there are parallels in pulse and tongue that cross over to other syndromes. A person may also have one or more existing syndromes at the same time. (The same applies to Western signs, symptoms and diagnosis.)

Four Gentlemen Decoction Si Jun Zi Tang

The Four Gentlemen Decoction patent formula tonifies qi and strengthens Spleen (energy and digestion)

Si Jun Zi Tang is an elegant and essential energy-enhancing formula because of its yang and qi tonifying aspects. To have good energy, we must have good digestion. The formula addresses this, which is the root of many a problem. Four Gentlemen refers to the fact that each herb is equally important and together exhibit ideal behavior—a lovely gentlemanly Chinese concept, not that it is a men’s-only formula. It is also useful for women.

Symptoms for the formula are fatigue, pale, quiet voice that results from lack of qi; possibly weak appetite and low body weight; and a tendency toward loose stools. All this involves a weakening of the central qi.6 Four Gentlemen strengthens the immune system, digestion, and liver and gives more energy. Very useful for common ills of modern living.

Directions. 3 cups of decoction 3 × day or 5 mL of a 1:5 tincture 3 × day.

## Good Gut Health

A happy digestive system requires a well-balanced gut microbiome. To prevent dysbiosis, diets rich in rainbow-colored foods provide a wide range of needed antioxidants, fiber, and nutrients. These prebiotics are essential to feed and grow the flora. Gut flora foods include fibrous veggies like onion, leeks, asparagus, garlic, chicory, and oats. The probiotics are the actual friendly bacterial strains a healthy gut requires. These can be supplied by fermented foods, such as unsweetened yogurt or kefir, miso, kimchee, and fermented veggies (Box 18.2). If a client refuses these foods, a last resort is a probiotic capsule filled with many live strains of bacteria. Foods first, pills later.

Box 18.2

Prebiotic and Probiotic Foods

Prebiotics are specific high fiber foods that are known to feed the friendly bacteria in the gut to help them divide and multiply. Examples are onions, asparagus, leeks, oats, garlic, Jerusalem artichokes, cabbage, jicama, legumes, apples, and apple cider vinegar.

Probiotics are foods that actually reforest and replenish the microbiome, the good guys residing in the gut. Some of the best sources are fermented foods, such as sauerkraut, kimchi, natto, cabbage, carrots, and pickles (fermented veggies); miso and tempeh (fermented soybean products); kefir, buttermilk, and plain yogurt (fermented dairy); and apple cider vinegar (ACV) (fermented apples).

These basics are general dietary measures used to build and maintain the microbiome. When the microbiome is in disarray because of bad habits practiced over time, GI problems rage. Dysbiosis can be caused by many factors: excessive use of refined sugars, consumption of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), use of herbicides and pesticides, gluten, processed foods, consumption of conventionally raised animals and birds that were fed antibiotics and genetically engineered feed, chronic constipation, chronic stress, elevated hormones, and any or all food allergens or sensitivities. Often a Paleo diet that discourages grains and dairy does the trick (Chapter 16). Throw in small bowel bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and bacterial, viral, yeast, and parasitical infections in the large intestine, and you’ll see there are plenty of possibilities implicated in messing up the gut.

### The Four-R Program: Remove, Replace, Reinoculate, Repair

How does herbal medicine deal with gut dilemmas? There is a systematic approach used in naturopathic and functional medicine circles developed by Jeffrey Bland, PhD., and his associates at the Functional Medicine Institute. Many variations of this program exist. The Four-R program has been successfully adapted by wise herbalists. The remove and replace categories have many choices to select from. Determining which categories to address takes a little detective work, however. The repair and reinoculate steps are pretty straightforward.

Warm Golden Turmeric Milk

Bright golden Turmeric milk is a traditional Ayurvedic staple. It heals the gut and has antiinflammatory and immune-building properties. There are many versions, but they should all be mixed in a fat-based liquid, because of Turmeric’s fat solubility, and include Black Peppercorns, necessary for Turmeric absorption. Possible additives are Panax Xi Yang Shen (American ginseng root) or Ashwagandha root for stamina; Holy Basil leaf for stress; Lycium Gou Qi Zi (Goji or Wolfberry) or Zizyphus Da Zao (Jujube date) for antioxidants and sweetness; vanilla for flavor; and Cardamom pod to combat nausea, bloating, and gas. Be imaginative.


Blend all ingredients in high speed blender until smooth. Pour in saucepan and heat until hot but not boiling. Drink and enjoy daily.

### Trophorestoratives, Spleen Tonics

GI trophorestoratives are nutritive, have an affinity for the gut, and heal and seal the intestinal lining over time. Spleen tonics include Chinese Medicine and Western herbs specific to digestive health. They treat deficient conditions and are predominantly sweet. The Spleen is associated with the sweet taste; thus general GI restoratives are sweet, as well. They can also be moist or drying. The moist, demulcent ones help with constipation or dry, hard stools. The dry ones address wet, loose, and frequent bowel movements. Spleen tonics work gradually over time, build the flora, contain nutrients, facilitate absorption, build tissue and physical strength, and help fatigue. Because they tonify Spleen qi, they are indicated in Spleen Qi Deficiency. They work for the Western disorders that we call enteritis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s (Fig. 18.8).7 The big three Spleen tonics—Codonopsis Dang Shen (Downy Bellflower root), Atractylodes Bai Zhu (White Atractylodes root), and Panax Xi Yang Shen (American ginseng root)—appear at the head of the tropho-restorative list (Table 18.1).

### Bitters

A well-established fact of physiology, backed by centuries of tradition in the West, is that bitters (herbs with a predominantly bitter taste) trigger certain digestive juice production and processes. In fact, many of these processes need to be in full swing before foods such as heavy proteins and starches hit the stomach for healthy, robust digestion to occur. Bitter taste receptors are directly connected to the digestive part of the stomach’s functions. The centuries-old Swedish bitters tradition is based on this now well-proven information.

These days, herbalists use bitters for many purposes. Bitter is one of the five major tastes and has a downward, sinking energy. Bitter taste receptors are not only on the tongue but have been found in the smooth muscle cells of the stomach. Energetically, bitters are cooling and so relieve heat and toxins; drying, so they dry damp; and stimulating so they help liver detoxification. The alkaloids present in bitters provide an antimicrobial action. The concept and popularity of bitters is very Western; recall the Victorian penchant for bitter tonics as a digestive aid. Bitters also heal the gut, although the Chinese healer would include sweet restoratives as part of the rejuvenation process. In such cases, Codonopsis Dang Shen (Downy Bellflower root) or Atractylodes Bai Zhu (White Atractylodes root) would be used, neither of which are bitter.

Some bitters can be strong and overpowering, though bitters offer a continuum of strengths. Gentian is one of the strongest, famously present in Angostura bitters found in most bars worldwide. Artemisia absinthium (Wormwood herb) and Ruta graveolens (Rue herb) are also strongly bitter tasting. Strong, but easier-to-take notables are Goldenseal root and Oregon Grape root of berberine fame. Even milder ones include Dandelion root, Yarrow herb, or Chamomile flower (Table 18.2). The more bitter an herb, the less you need to use.

The bitter facts and actions:9

Contraindications for bitters include situations where there is increased stomach acid (HCl), accelerated peristalsis, or accelerated bile stimulation. Conditions include peptic or duodenal ulcer, kidney stones, gallbladder disease, gastroesophageal reflux, or hiatal hernia.10 These are conservative contraindications that occur in the literature but are not always supported by actual research.

Dosages of bitters need not be large. All that is needed for digestive aid is a bitter taste. No need to be overwhelming: dispense 5 to 10 drops of a 1:5 tincture before meals. Generally, the health benefits of bitters require that taste to dominate in a formula. So don’t drown out the bitter taste with other sweet herbs in hope of helping the medicine go down. The benefits do not occur unless the bitter herb is tasted.9 For instance, prepare a separate bitters formula to take before eating and use sweet Spleen qi restoratives in a formula specific to that purpose, taken at a different time.

### Gut Antimicrobials

The antimicrobials listed in Table 18.3 are the major bug-removers for the Four-R program. Most are broad-spectrum. They take care of unwanted SIBO, yeast, parasites, fungus, amoebas, viruses, and bacteria. Some are cooling and drying, the ticket to removing Spleen damp heat. Uses are for long-term dysbiosis, acute intestinal infections, bacterial and amoebic dysentery, food poisoning, flare-ups of Crohn’s, and acute ulcerative colitis. Sometimes referred to as GI sedatives for infection, they are strongly antiinflammatory and antimicrobial. A few striking examples to eradicate unwanted microbes are the broad-spectrum berberines, Atractylodes Cang Zhu (Black Atractylodes root) for yeast and fungal infections, or Gentian root for worms and parasites.

### Prebiotics and Leaky Gut Healers

The herbs listed in Table 18.4 repair the epithelial lining of the gut and tighten cell junctions. Herbs that heal and seal leaky gut are our friends; sweet ones include Licorice root, Slippery Elm bark, Meadowsweet, and others. Many gut-healing herbs (but not all) happen to be bitter. Bitter-tasting gut healing herbs and roots include Gentian root, the Artemisia spp., the berberines, Blessed Thistle herb, and Turmeric and Dandelion root. These provide the many usual actions of all bitters. Refer to the earlier section on bitters to review.

Table 18.4

Ulmus fulva (Slippery Elm bark)

Althaea officinalis (Marshmallow root)

Aloe vera (Aloe gel)

Taraxacum officinale (Dandelion greens/root)

Cichorium intybus (Chicory root)

Arctium lappa (Burdock root)

Calendula officinalis (Calendula flower)

When introducing a protocol for dysbiosis, do it in stages, using different formulas and herbal combinations at different times in the process. Once the gut lining is healed, it should usually stay that way, unless further abuses occur down the road.

### Digestive Aids: GI Stimulants, Relaxants, Antacids, Carminatives, Demulcents

The plants listed in Table 18.5 are an array of herbals that help digestion, covering many categories. GI stimulants increase digestive processes, and by so doing, have a calming effect. They have an outward-moving, pungent taste. The warm-to-hot ones will either work or not, meaning reactions are quite individual. Some warm-to-hot ones are Black Peppercorn, Cayenne pepper, Clove bud, Ginger, and Horseradish root. Others are not as hot and more general: Magnolia Hou Po (Magnolia root), Kava root, and Atractylodes root Cang Zhu (Black or Red Atractylodes root). Some indications that pungent GI herbs are needed include dyspepsia (when the need is to help digestion and move food along) or when better peristalsis might help, as in nausea, projectile vomiting, and colic.16

Cetraria islandica (Iceland Moss)


Glycyrrhiza glabra or G. uralensis Gan Cao


Codonopsis pilosula Dang Shen


Acorus calamus (Calamus root)

Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)

Antacids neutralize stomach pH, make it less acid. This is helpful in acid reflux (GERD). Beware that indigestion is often caused by too little stomach HCl, not from too much. Need to establish which, by using the acid test.

Notice that many of these herbs double as restoratives.

Note: Native North American Acorus calamus (Calamus/Sweet Flag root) has long been used for all kinds of digestive problems. It is a warming and pungent antacid, antidiarrheal, carminative, and restorative. Contrary to bad press on and off throughout the years, it is a medium-strength herb that is safe and effective in formula. It is cumulatively toxic when used alone. Do not use as a simple or continuously.13

The pungent taste could also help increase peripheral circulation, decongest the bronchia, or topically, reduce joint and muscle pain. Contraindications for hot GI stimulants occur with GERD or with very acid conditions, hepatitis, hot diarrhea with anal burning, and chronic nephritis.16

GI relaxants relax the gut. They relieve pain and take away the gripe, an archaic word for sharp bowel pain and cramps. They ease painful smooth-muscle spasms by causing them to relax. They also relieve the pain of acute intestinal colic, gastritis, dyspepsia, IBS, enteritis, diarrhea, or constipation and stress. Alternately, they are called spasmolytics or intestinal analgesics. They circulate qi in the intestines (the middle burner) and induce gut relaxation. They help relieve symptomatic pain without necessarily getting to the root of the problem. Energetically, many GI relaxants tend to be warm, pungent, and stimulating. When they provide an outward moving energy, a tight gut relaxes; muscle spasms let go. Gone is the pain; in comes relief and relaxation.

Like any other remedies, GI relaxants have tropisms to particular organs and areas that are actually causing the cramping. Pain doesn’t just happen for fun. Therefore Black Cohosh root, Cramp bark, St. John’s Wort, or Tansy herb are useful spasmolytics with dysmenorrhea; gentle Chamomile helps children and elders with indigestion; Citrus Qing Pi (Green Tangerine peel) can be given when bile and liver need stimulation. Hops reduce stress or insomnia in hot conditions.

Herbal antacids relieve upset by alkalinizing gastric contents and can help with GERD. Some antacid herbs include Meadowsweet herb, Iceland Moss, and Chickweed herb. Carminatives, because of their volatile oils, aid indigestion by increasing peristalsis, moving gas, and relieving bloating. Consider using Cinnamon bark, Fennel seed or Cardamom pod. Bitters could easily have been included in this section but have been addressed separately because their uses go beyond digestion.

GI demulcents are moistening because of their saponins. They topically lubricate the gut wall, making them useful for constipation, dryness, and hard stools. They are also cooling and so can soothe inflammation, relieving stomach pain. Although Marshmallow root is a multipurpose demulcent, it is not restorative. Use others that have the added virtue of being nutritive and restorative, plus moistening to the gut mucosa: Slippery Elm bark, Licorice root, and Iceland Moss thallus do both. Pick your demulcent whenever cooling, moistening yin or pain relief is needed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Antidiarrheals and Hemostatics

Most herbs that curb diarrhea are drying astringents that tighten connective tissue and mucous membranes (Table 18.6). They work because of their tannin content, which tightens cell junctions and pulls inward. If diarrhea is severe or chronic, dehydration becomes an issue. Astringents help prevent that danger by reducing water loss. Diarrhea is present in Spleen Qi Deficiency and Spleen Yang Deficiency, where there is not enough qi to hold the stool in place.

Table 18.6

Acorus calamus

Calamus root

Geranium maculatum

Cranesbill root

Potentilla erecta (Tormentil Root)

Quercus alba

White Oak bark


A good diarrhea formula should include astringents, plus a sweet Spleen restorative/tonic and anything else indicated to address the underlying cause. Use sweet Spleen restoratives, like Codonopsis Dang Shen (Downy Bellflower root) or Atractylodes Bai Zhu (White Atractylodes root). If there is exhaustion, include a neuroendocrine restorative, like Licorice root.13

Drying astringents can also be used to help curb internal GI rectal bleeding as might occur in a gastric ulcer. In such case the herbal choice would be a hemostatic. Examples are Cotton root bark, Cranesbill root, Yarrow herb, or White Oak bark. Simple astringent hemostatics, like antidiarrheals, dry damp on a symptomatic level only and are not long-term solutions. They do not address the root cause, so herbs that do so should be included in the formula.

<!-- chunk -->

### Laxatives

Laxatives are herbs that act mildly to gently relieve constipation. Purgatives are stronger and act more forcefully (Table 18.7). It is all a matter of degree. In addition to promoting bowel movements, laxatives have been used successfully for heat clearing, decongesting, detoxification, and draining of excess water. Even if these are not the main intent, they can be secondary effects. Laxatives should not be used with clients in very weak conditions such as exhaustion, diarrhea, GI bleeding, or severe abdominal pain.13 They also should not be used routinely. Find and fix the cause. We’re supposed to go to the bathroom without help.

Curcuma longa (Turmeric rhizome)

Cynara scolymus (Artichoke leaf)

Gentiana lutea (Gentian root)

Rumex crispus (Yellow dock root)

Taraxacum officinale (Dandelion root)

Bowel transit time refers to number of hours for food to move from the mouth to the end of the intestine or anus. To check, use the dye test or substance test. Have the client ingest beets, corn, or sesame seeds and have them observe the number of hours for these substances to be seen in the bowel movement. (Check the toilet. Beets turn the water fuchsia; undigested corn kernels come out whole.) Anything less than one bowel movement a day means toxins and waste are recirculating back into the bloodstream from the colon and may result in fatigue, headaches, gas, bloating, acne, allergies, and muscle and joint pain if constipation persists over time. A fast transit time (shorter than 10 hours) indicates food is passing through the system too quickly, suggesting nutrients are not absorbing properly.

Constipation is bowel frequency of less than 3 times a week, with the need to strain more than 25% of the time.16 Some say two or more bowel movements a day are necessary. Regular, once-a-day movements seem to be a fine middle ground to keep us healthy. Before reaching for herbs, try the usual remedies first. Have the client consume adequate fluid and fiber, get plenty of exercise, reduce stress, listen to their body, and act on the urge.

Mild bulk laxatives work through enlarging, lubricating, and softening the stool. They are useful for hemorrhoids and constipation-dominant IBS and serve as a prebiotic to feed flora and slow absorption of sugars and cholesterol. Indications are for IBD, constipation, blood-sugar management, fluid retention, obesity,16 and occasional use with atonic colon in sedentary or elderly folks. Psyllium husk is a good example of a bulk laxative. When mixed with water, it quickly thickens and slimes up into a bulky, mucilaginous gel before it is removed from the spoon. It is present in products like Metamucil.

Demulcent laxatives are mild, sweet, cooling, and moistening. Use for dry, hard stools when yin needs a boost. Demulcents are high in mucilage and, thus lubricating. Examples are the fruit kernels of peach, prune, and apricot. Cannabis goes in this category, as does flax seed. Demulcent laxatives are appropriate for pregnancy, children, and elders. Sweet stimulating laxatives are mild and gentle, good for children and elders as well. Licorice root, Tamarind pulp, and Ziziphus Da Zao (Black Jujube berry) gently stimulate peristalsis.

Saline laxatives are dissolvents that soften, moisten, and break up stool. Magnesium sulfate, better known as Epsom salts, the seaweeds, and liquid trace minerals work in this manner. They dissolve bowel accumulations and clear dry heat (Fig. 18.10). Cholagogues improve liver function and stimulate bile flow. They are bitter, cold, and useful in liver and gallbladder congestion. Dandelion root, Artichoke leaf, Milk Thistle seed, Yellow Dock root, and Burdock root reside in this category.

Stimulant anthraquinone-containing laxatives increase peristalsis by irritating the intestinal wall and causing large evacuations; they are the purgatives. Occasional short-term use is safe when nothing else works; long-term use can cause dependency. Find the cause, rather than allowing the client to become reliant on these laxatives. Purgatives are contraindicated in pregnancy and nursing because they stimulate the lower abdominal area. Examples in ascending order of strength include Senna and Cascara leaf, then comes Rhubarb root, and the strongest of all, Mayapple root.

## Common GI Conditions

<!-- chunk -->

### Diarrhea

Definition. Frequent liquid bowel movements that can be acute or chronic (diarrhea) are a symptom, not a disease. Look for causes like infection, food poisoning, drugs, and toxins. Chronic diarrhea is almost always from infection. Inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn’s or ulcerative colitis and IBS are likely suspects. Medications, food additives, and malabsorption are other possibilities.

Case History 18.1

Case History for Diarrhea

S. Nancy ate some fresh oysters last night and now has foul-smelling diarrhea, mucus, burning, and cramping. She feels weak.

O. P Weak. T Greasy, red coat.

A. Diarrhea with damp heat. Possible food poisoning.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Antimicrobials for food poisoning. (2) Astringents to curb diarrhea, dry damp. (3) Cooling demulcents to ease burning and pain. (4) Spasmolytics to ease cramping.

Other Suggestion

Adequate fluids to prevent dehydration.

<!-- chunk -->

### Simple Constipation

Definition. Fewer than three bowel movements a week is considered to be constipation. Can be caused by dehydration, lack of fiber, little exercise, being bedridden or post childbirth, having stress, or high alcohol consumption. Simple constipation can be occasional or chronic, but it is not inflammatory, and not in the IBS or IBD categories that are discussed further on.

Case History 18.2

Case History for Chronic Constipation

S. Leslie is 70 years old and has had chronic constipation for years. Usually has one to two BMs a week with bloating, dry, hard stools that finally come after straining. She loves hot spicy foods. She has tried all kinds of laxatives, including Metamucil.

O. P Fine. T Red and dry.

A. Yin Deficiency. Chronic constipation.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Moisten and increase yin with a demulcent; (2) Gentle laxative. (3) Cholagogue to increase bile flow. (4) Carminative for bloating. (5) Gut restorative.


<!-- chunk -->

### Indigestion, Food Stagnation

Definition. Dyspepsia. Pain or discomfort in the stomach from difficulty digesting food (Case History 18.3).

### Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

Definition. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is an umbrella term that involves two chronic autoimmune GI problems, both involving inflammation. Severity ebbs and wanes but continues for years, never disappearing. Ulcerative colitis involves long-lasting ulcerative sores and painful bleeding in the colon and rectum, whereas Crohn’s disease involves inflammation, bleeding, and patchy damage through all layers of the gut wall anywhere in the GI tract (Case History 18.4).15 These two must be treated with autoimmune protocols, adapted to the GI tract (Chapter 16).

Box 18.5

Robert’s Formula for Ulcers and Inflammatory Bowel Diseases

Robert’s Formula is a famous traditional Eclectic formula used for ulcers, IBS, Crohn’s, ulcerative colitis, and any stomach inflammation. The story that has come down to us says that Robert was a sailor who learned about these herbs from healers in various ports. It helped him so much that he spread the word. This formula has stayed around, often with embellishments and changes, and is still recommended by naturopathic doctors today.

In ulcers, Helicobacter pylori is a biofilm that colonizes in the nonacidic mucous layer of the stomach. It becomes infectious when the mucous layer is damaged. This formula restores mucus and destroys the biofilm.17 Originally, dried herbs were ground and placed in capsules, but this formula may also be dispensed as a tincture.

Dose: Flare-ups, 2 caps 3 × day as needed between meals. During remission: 1 cap 2 × day between meals.

Case History 18.4

Case History for Crohn’s Disease

S. Louise has had Crohn’s for 41 years, all her adult life. Her main symptom was almost continuous diarrhea with mucous and blood in the stool. She has lesions in her bowel per endoscopy, and no mainstream treatment has really helped. She has been on Prednisone for years.

O. P Wiry and rapid. T Dark red with a yellow, greasy coat.

A. Spleen Damp Heat, Spleen Qi Deficiency, Crohn’s per healthcare provider, inflammation/diarrhea.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Eliminate microbes and heat. (2) Dry Damp. (3) Use astringents to stop bleeding. (4) GI Restoratives. (5) Antidiarrheals. (5) Cooling, soothing mucilage. (6) Nervous relaxant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)

Definition. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional motility bowel disorder in the United States. It tends to flare up intermittently and then subside. Typically, it is triggered by stress and anxiety, food intolerances, leaky gut, too much fiber, parasites such as Giardia spp. or Candida albicans, enteric microbes, and inflammation (Case History 18.5). Unlike ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s, no damage to the bowel tissues occurs, and it is not an autoimmune issue. Note: If there is bleeding, fever, weight loss, and persistent severe pain, it is not IBS but more likely one of the more serious autoimmune IBDs.

Case History 18.5

Case History for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)

S. Dave has a stressful computer programming job. For 10 years, he has had frequent alternating diarrhea and constipation, painful cramping, bloating, gas, and burping. He is anxious and gets headaches. He also eats fast foods and loves breads, pasta, and pizza. For the last 4 weeks, he’s been constipated with a dry BM every 3 to 4 days.

O. P Wiry, especially in Spleen position. T Dry, thin white coat.

A. Liver invading Spleen, Liver Stagnation right now. Irritable Bowel Syndrome, dysbiosis.

### Gastric or Duodenal Ulcers

Definition. Ulcers are open sores on the inside lining of the stomach (peptic or gastric) and the upper portion of the small intestine (duodenal) (Case History 18.6). Excess acid creates painful, open sores that may bleed or perforate, causing hemorrhage or leakage of gastric contents into the abdomen. Stomach wall perforation can lead to peritonitis, a medical emergency.

Case History 18.6

Case History for Gastric or Duodenal Ulcers

S. Michael has a stressful job and home environment. He has gas, bloating after eating, general indigestion, and bright red rectal bleeding at night.

O. P Weak, wiry, deep. T Dusky, pale, teeth marks.

A. Possible GI ulcer. Healthcare provider consult for definitive diagnosis.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) GI demulcents; (2) Antacids; (3) Stop infection with antimicrobials; (4) GI Spasmolytics for pain.

Red Flag

Bleeding ulcers indicate bowel perforation, a medical emergency. It is evidenced by black tarry stools and/or red, black or coffee ground vomiting.

### Gluten Sensitivity or Intolerance versus Celiac Disease

Definition (gluten sensitivity or intolerance). Gluten sensitivity is a continuum that ranges from mild indigestion when gluten is consumed to flat-out celiac disease, in which gluten cannot be eaten under any circumstances. Both forms are on the rise, perhaps because of greater awareness or because of the prevalence of wheat-containing gluten not only in obvious foods like bread and other baked goods, but also in countless hidden sources, such as almost all processed foods, ice cream, gravies, soy sauce, and even beauty products. Gluten is hard to avoid. Just about everyone has some type of adverse reaction to gluten.

Definition (celiac disease). Sometimes called sprue, celiac disease is a long-term, genetic, autoimmune inflammatory disorder where the ingestion of the gluten protein triggers antibodies that release inflammatory cytokines, causing damage to villi in the small intestinal lining. Leads to severe malabsorption and long-term complications and is many steps up the ladder from simple gluten sensitivity. Although many people are not even aware of their sensitivities to gluten, 1 out of every 133 average, healthy Americans is diagnosed with celiac disease. In all cases of gluten sensitivity, ranging from discomfort to celiac disease, some amount of inflammation, intestinal permeability, and dysbiosis is involved.

Case History 18.7

Case History for Possible Celiac Disease

S. Jack has had weight loss; foul-smelling, greasy stools; rectal itching; eczema-type skin breakouts; and abdominal cramping. He is forgetful and “can’t think straight.” This has been his norm for 5 years, He knows his trigger foods are pasta and bagels, but he loves them.

O. P Weak. T Pale and greasy.

A. Spleen damp and deficient. Malnutrition. Celiac disease or gluten intolerance with probable yeast infection.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Four-R program, gluten-free, antiinflammatory Paleo diet. (2) Antimicrobials. (3) Remove gut inflammation. (4) Restore gut lining. (5) Dry damp. (6) Immunomodulation. (7) Robert’s Formula (Box 18.5).


<!-- chunk -->

### Intestinal Yeast Infection

Definition. Candida albicans or yeast overgrowth in the gut occurs as a result of inflammation, intestinal permeability, dysbiosis, weakened immune system, diabetes, antibiotic and cortisone use, and/or birth control pill use. Yeast infections can also appear on the skin, the vagina, rectum, penis, mouth (as thrush), and blood. In all cases, treat the root cause, the gut (Case History 18.8).

Case History 18.8

Case History for Intestinal Yeast Infection

S. Jackie’s stomach aches badly. She has had loose, smelly stools; rectal itching; gas; and bloating. She reports getting many colds over the last 2 years and losing weight. She feels hot. Though she has not changed her marginally standard American diet (SAD), she reports extreme fatigue and has had eczema on her elbows, knees, and hips for 6 months. Her stool tests positive for parasites.

O. P Rapid. T White coat and yellowish greasy center.

A. Spleen Damp Heat, Spleen Qi Deficiency. Probable stomach infection with intestinal parasites and diarrhea. Leaky gut and dysbiosis.

P. Specific Therapeutic Principles. (1) Antiparasitic herbs that should help underlying condition of eczema and fatigue. (2) Blood cleanser/alterative herbs for eczema. (3) Lymph movers and diuretics to flush out parasites. (4) Immunostimulant herbs. (5) Relieve cramping with carminative herbs. (6) Antidiarrheals, as needed (prn). (7) Restore and heal gut.


<!-- chunk -->

### Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

Definition. In gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hydrochloric acid comes up from the stomach into the esophagus through a weakened esophageal sphincter. This smooth muscle is supposed to close, but if it’s weakened or relaxes inappropriately, the food goes back up. As a result, the stomach’s HCl can damage the esophageal wall, thus leading to tissue breakdown and cancer. GERD is also called acid reflux or acid indigestion and is sometimes caused by a hiatal hernia, where the upper part of the stomach moves up into the chest (Case History 18.9). Common trigger foods are carbonated drinks, fatty or fried foods, tomato sauce, alcohol, chocolate, mint, garlic, onion, and caffeine.

Case History 18.9

Case History for GERD

S. Lucy has burning, acid regurgitation in her throat, and frequent burping after she eats a large meal. This makes her gaggy and nauseated. She fears she’s having a heart attack, but antacids seem to help temporarily. She’s been taking Maalox regularly for 5 years. She is overweight at 195 lb. but a nonsmoker. She is very stressed.

O. P Fast. T Red.

A. Heat and Rebellious Stomach Qi (that is rising instead of sinking).1 GERD.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. Get her off OTC antacids. (1) Heat signs of red tongue, fast pulse, and burning require cooling down, e.g., with Coptis Huang Lian. (2) Demulcents to cool GI and decrease inflammation. (3) Decrease stomach inflammation. (4) Increase digestion with carminatives and decrease acidity. (5) Increase qi flow. (6) Decrease stress with nervous relaxants. (7) Use Spleen restoratives.


If all an herbalist ever did was to heal the gut, her or his service would be invaluable. Along with digestion, assimilation, absorption, and elimination, the GI houses the intestinal flora, a vital part of the immune system that plays a major role in the autoimmune epidemic. The gut influences mood and mental health via the gut-brain connection. It serves as an endocrine organ and detoxification center. The Four-R protocol is the core regimen for gut and body health that heals inflammation, dysbiosis, and intestinal permeability. Get this one down.

Esoterically, the gut is the home of the solar plexus chakra, our center of power and emotions. From the Chinese Medicine perspective, the Spleen and Stomach are the digestive organs. The Spleen also supports organs and holds blood in place. Prolapse indicates Spleen Qi Collapse, and abnormal bleeding and bruising indicate the Spleen is not controlling blood.

The GI Materia Medica is quite large and includes restoratives, which heal and seal the intestinal lining, and bitters with multiple actions. Antimicrobials clear up all kinds of infection, stimulants accelerate digestion and have a calming effect, relaxants decrease pain and smooth muscle spasm, and prebiotics feed the flora. Carminatives increase peristalsis and move stuck food, antacids alkalinize gastric contents, and demulcents cool, moisten, and soothe.

Hepato relates to liver, and biliary refers to bile. Nobody can live without a functioning liver, our main detoxification organ. Simply by being alive we create toxins from waste products given off through normal chemical reactions in the body (metabolism). Even if we had a pristine diet, breathed immaculately pure air, and lived on a remote mountaintop, the liver could never take a break.

We can live without a gallbladder but would not have optimal digestion. The gallbladder is tucked up under the two liver lobes, stores bile, and releases it in response to dietary fat intake. Bile emulsifies fats, preparing them for ultimate digestion and absorption into the blood. Hardened bile (gallstones) can form in the gallbladder or its ducts, causing excruciating pain and blockage.

Chinese Medicine is respectful and fond of the liver. Liver syndromes appear in many Western body systems, including the gastrointestinal, the hepato-biliary, neuro, kidney, and reproduction (notably women’s health) systems.

## A Liver’s Work Is Never Done

As is famously touted in physiology books, the liver has over 500 functions, although rarely are they all listed; it is not called “the Commanding General” for nothing. The adult liver weighs close to 3 pounds, roughly the size and shape of a football. It is beloved in herbal and functional medicine circles and claims utmost importance in Chinese Medicine. We are always preaching to first fix the gut, but a well-functioning liver plays a close second. Almost any herbal formula could justifiably contain a good liver herb. A few liver highlights follow:

<!-- chunk -->

## Liver Detoxification, the Gut, and Liver Health

The liver is the largest metabolically active organ in the body. It is a garbage collector and recycler. In addition to processing nutrients and microorganisms from the gut and dealing with the normal end products of metabolic chemical breakdown reactions (endogenous), it handles toxins from the outside environment (exogenous) wastes: drugs, heavy metals, hormones, molds, and pollutants that are everywhere. The liver is assigned the huge job of deconjugating, transforming, and breaking down these toxins into harmless substances the body can excrete through the urine, bowels, and skin. If the liver isn’t breaking down metabolites, and the kidneys aren’t making good-quality urine, a person with such conditions will quickly die of sepsis in about a week. If the liver is off-kilter but not in failure, and the kidneys are doing all right, we live longer, but not in optimal health. End-stage liver failure from alcoholism, chronic hepatitis, or other factors is not a pretty sight.

The gut is related to the liver, and the liver is related to the gut. The two communicate in what is sometimes dubbed the gut-liver axis.2 It has been found that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is positively correlated to intestinal permeability (IP). In other words, leaky gut can lead to liver disease and failure by overtaxing its detox pathways. A balanced microbiome, intestinal wall integrity and efficient liver detoxification are important aspects of whole-body health.

Unhealthy large intestine microbes and small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) excrete endotoxins that must be dealt with (Chapter 18). Foods, nutrients, and toxins are absorbed from the intestines, which happens either the right way across the villi into the capillaries or the wrong way through leaky gut junctions. Regardless of route, they go directly to the liver’s portal system before entering general circulation. If all goes well, the liver handles the load as best it can and passes on cleaned-out blood and nutrients for delivery to all cells and tissues. If things go badly because of intestinal permeability and further toxic overload, many symptoms and chronic diseases can occur. We develop depressed immunity, brain fog, additional digestive problems, allergies, skin outbreaks, adrenal stress, hormone imbalances, and autoimmune syndromes.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Detoxification System

The liver’s detoxification pathways occur through its Cytochrome P-450 enzyme detoxification system. There are two phases or pathways, Phase I and II (Fig. 19.2). Both need to be properly balanced and in sync. The result is that toxic chemicals are converted into harmless substances the body can excrete. If not, there are increased incidences of allergies, asthma, environmental sensitivities, autoimmune diseases, skin outbreaks, food cravings, severe PMS, and hormone imbalances.

### Herbs and Foods for Phase I and II

### How to Tell if Liver Detoxification is Needed

People don’t all detoxify at the same rate; some do it better than others. There are quite a few events that can cause the liver to be in metabolic overload, a sign that detoxification help is needed. One factor is a slow and steady dose of environmental toxins or a sudden influx of external pollutants and toxins that overwhelm the liver. Excessive drug and alcohol ingestion tax the liver. Another is a liver that does not have adequate nutrients to take on additional detoxification requirements.

Because of the liver’s multiple responsibilities, one or more of these jobs done badly over time can create signs or symptoms that indicate attention is needed by herbalists. One sign may not be indicative, but three or four very well could be. Heeding subclinical early warning signs is far better than waiting for outright liver disease or failure. By the time liver function tests are elevated in a routine blood analysis, damage has already been done.

<!-- chunk -->

### Signs and Symptoms Indicating Metabolic Overload

<!-- chunk -->

## Heavy Metal Detoxification

Heavy metal exposure puts an enormous strain on the liver. The metals most concerning to human health include lead, mercury, cadmium, and inorganic arsenic. Heavy metals enter the body through eating nonorganic foods and fish, inhaled smoke and gasoline, lead paint exposure, mercury in tooth amalgams, exposure to air pollution, and more. Heavy metal overload is diagnosed from urine, blood, and hair analysis. Obtaining a thoughtful health history and asking the right questions can give the herbalist substantial clues to signal if this is a likely issue.

A chelate is any substance that attracts heavy metals. Chelation therapy is a form of heavy-metal detoxification, where heavy molecular-weight metallic ions chemically bind to ions of another substance, the chelating agent. They are both eliminated together through the kidneys. Plant allies acting as chelators include seaweeds (Fig. 19.3), algae, Garlic, Cilantro, and Milk Thistle seed.

## Chinese Medicine Perspective: Liver and Gallbladder with Major Syndromes

The Liver is intricately related to a toxic world, anger, and stress. Because there is no shortage of these experiences, the Liver shows up in many conditions that are seemingly unrelated. The Liver is always lurking around women’s menstrual problems and stress-related ailments that can affect any organ.

The Liver opens to the eyes, manifests in the nails, and is in charge of the tendons. Problems in any of these areas require Liver attention. Botanical medicine and the Liver go hand in hand. As part of their folk heritage, most people around the world recognize the importance of vegetables for a healthy liver. The bitter taste is prominent in liver botanicals because it specifically triggers secretion of bile, and bile is known to aid digestion and liver metabolism in general. A bitter taste in the mouth is also reported in various liver pathologies, because bile backs up into the mouth.

### Liver Herbs Worth Honorable Mention

<!-- chunk -->

### Hepatic Restoratives

Hepatic restoratives help liver cells (hepatocytes) regenerate and heal. The liver is the only internal organ that can regenerate. Only scarred, completely damaged liver cells (as in cirrhosis) will not heal. If too many cells are destroyed, a transplant is necessary. Restoratives are sweet and warm. They nourish and build moist Liver yin, the syndrome being Liver Yin Deficiency. A liver can’t have too much yin. If the liver isn’t detoxifying properly, restoratives are needed along with stimulants.

Specific indications for liver restoratives are a history of viral or bacterial hepatitis, adverse effects of alcohol consumption, exposure to toxic chemicals, long-standing drug use, cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, skin outbreaks, and chronic inflammatory diseases.8 Symptoms could include constant all-day fatigue (adrenal burn-out), poor immune function, hypoglycemia, and headaches. Restoratives help with weight loss, malnutrition, anemia, frequent infections, and chronic hepatitis. Milk Thistle seed, Dandelion root, Bupleurum Chai Hu and Schisandra Wu Wei Zi are highly regarded restoratives (Table 19.1).

Table 19.1

<!-- chunk -->

### Hepatic Stimulants (Liver Qi Movers)

Liver stimulants encourage the liver to carry on its more than 500 functions (Table 19.2). They are the Liver qi movers that decongest sluggish or congested qi and are therefore called for in Liver Qi Stagnation, where Liver energy slows down or gets stuck. This condition can be caused by too much alcohol, poor diet high in fats and sugar, and inadequate exercise. Some stimulants are cooling; others are warmer and pungent. Many have a bitter taste (the bitters). In summary, hepatic stimulants increase liver activity. They are detoxifying because they stimulate Phase I and II detoxification pathways. Some cholagogues contain glutathione, an important liver antioxidant.

Table 19.2

Choleretics are a subcategory of liver stimulants. The prefix chol and/or chole relates to bile and bile ducts. Technically, choleretics stimulate bile production and cholagogues stimulate bile ejection. In reality, herb categories with the prefix chol have both functions, and these days they are lumped together under the term cholagogues. Cholagogues stimulate peristalsis and thus reduce epigastric fullness, bloating, and constipation and are detoxifying because they carry out wastes through the bile.

Indications for cholagogues include nonimpacted gallstones, moderate gallbladder infection (cholecystitis), jaundice caused by decreased excretion of bile, chronic constipation, and indigestion caused by fatty foods.8 Contraindications for cholagogues are for obstructed bile ducts from gallstones clogging up the works and for acute colic and spasms caused by the blocked duct. Cholagogues are not used for acute viral hepatitis with jaundice because they are too strong in such cases.9 Most bitter herbs and liver stimulants are cholagogues by default. Strong cholagogues are Gentian root, Wormwood herb, Barberry root, Wild Indigo root, Blue Flag rhizome, and Goldenseal root. Milder ones include Dandelion root, Garden Sage herb, Fringe Tree bark, and Artichoke leaf.

<!-- chunk -->

### Stimulating Hepatic Detoxifiers

Herbs that detoxify are stimulating. They help Phase I and Phase II along. Many are cholagogues and some provide the free radical-quenching antioxidant, glutathione. They are often found in foods. Herbalists should tuck these important allies into their detox repertoire and consciousness (Table 19.3). Indications for hepatic detoxifiers are when the liver is overwhelmed by external environmental toxins, heavy metals, and by internal microorganisms and metabolic overload.

Table 19.3

<!-- chunk -->

### Hepatic and Gallbladder Antiinfectives and Antilithics

These are the ones for infection, inflammation, and possible fever (Table 19.4). They clear damp heat in the liver and gallbladder. They are sometimes called sedatives, because they cool heat and relax, in the sense that they cool a hot infection and stop gallbladder spasms. Some liver antiinfectives/sedatives work very well for generalized infections in other parts of the body, such as Scutellaria Huang Qin (Baikal Skullcap root). Western Liver Damp Heat diagnoses include acute hepatitis, cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation with possible blockage), liver abscesses, and fatty liver.

Table 19.4

Antilithics are used for gallbladder fire with gallstones. They have a moving and dissolving action and help prevent and/or break up stones. Signs of gallstones could be pain, pounding headache all over the head, dark urine, constipation or diarrhea, and possibly jaundice.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Liver restoratives. (2) Hepatic detoxifier. (3) Cool, draining diuretic. (4) Adrenal restorative. (5) Stress relief with relaxing nervine.


A few of the liver’s many functions include detoxification, the ability to transform one substance into another based on need, glucose regulation, bile and cholesterol production, regulation of digestion and blood clotting. The gut-liver axis refers to the relationship between the two organs. Many problems can occur if they are not working harmoniously. A leaky gut can lead to liver failure by overtaxing its detoxification pathways.

Detoxification involves the role of the cytochrome P450 enzyme pathways. This process can be helped through the use of cholagogues and hepatic stimulants, like Yellow Dock or Dandelion root, and the glutathione boosters Milk Thistle seed and Turmeric root. Metabolic overload is often related to environmental challenges, such as heavy metal toxicity. Remedies include herbal chelators, such as seaweeds, Milk Thistle seed, and Garlic.

In Chinese Medicine, the yin Liver deals with anger, opens to the eyes, and likes the sour taste, whereas the yang Gallbladder deals with decision or indecision. Liver Qi Stagnation has a role in toxic overload, Liver Yang Rising is connected to alcoholism, and Gallbladder Damp Heat is implicated in gallstones and cholecystitis.

Hepatic-biliary Materia Medica categories include restoratives that heal hepatocytes, stimulants that help detoxification, and sedative herbs that include antimicrobials and antilithics. When it comes to the liver, most herbalists will use detox measures the most. Gut dysbiosis and liver toxicity are the most pervasive causes of the chronic disease epidemic in our society. They are areas where allopathic medicine fails miserably.

Many thanks to the respiratory system for the breath of life. Unfortunately, common respiratory illnesses plague us like no other. Of all the remedies I personally formulate, these have top billing and are in highest demand. Herbs excel in treating numerous airway conditions, and effective combinations have been perfected over time in every culture. With judicious use, herbalists can have many successes and gain converts to botanical medicine in the process of eradicating a nasty cold.

Maintaining healthy lungs is paramount and reflects the health of our immunity. Respiratory Materia Medica categories are numerous, as are Chinese Medicine respiratory syndromes. Some of the more serious conditions are not covered here, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or tuberculosis (TB). In such cases, if they aren’t hard-core herbal advocates, clients are probably at the hospital or seeking out a Western healthcare provider. The herbalist’s role at that point, is to provide supportive treatment. If a respiratory problem doesn’t resolve in a reasonable time, refer out for further assistance.

## Methods to Keep Breathing Up to Par

We breathe in and out about 23,000 times a day and unless there is trouble rarely give it a thought. There are many obvious and not so evident measures to keep it that way. Genetics, smoking, and pollutants all play a part in hindering optimal breathing.

## The Fifth Chakra, Speaking Your Truth

The fifth chakra is located at the throat, and its energy connection to the physical body encompasses the throat, thyroid, parathyroid, trachea, esophagus, hypothalamus, neck vertebrae, mouth, jaw, and teeth—hence its inclusion in this respiration chapter that involves the throat (Fig. 20.1). Any physical illnesses and issues regarding these structures are under the auspices of the fifth chakra and most likely come from some form of speaking our truth and making decisions.

On an esoteric level, the fifth chakra involves the power (and illusion) of free will, finding your voice, having the courage to speak up and to act on it, regardless of consequences. It involves the power of choice, having authority with ourselves and not being out of control when it comes to another’s power over us. It is the freedom to make our own life decisions about relationship, career choices, and money and includes realizing the consequences of these choices on our spiritual karma. This is a huge responsibility because if this is done with consciousness, by using our spiritual guidance we cannot blame anyone else for the results. It involves faith and the courage to put our trust in Divine authority, and to commit to a decision.6

The pitfall of acting on our will is the danger of acting out of fear. If a decision is made only from fear, desire, or what we think we want, there may be unforeseen and unwanted consequences. The lesson is to give up needing to know why things happen as they do and trust that the unscheduled events of our lives are a form of spiritual direction.

## Chinese Medicine Perspective: The Lungs and Major Syndromes

When assessing and formulating, it is useful to incorporate some common Chinese respiratory syndromes into the mix along with their accompanying pulse and tongue signs. If the Lungs are too dry, there’s a deficiency of moist yin. If the Lungs are weak, there’s not enough energy or qi. Lung phlegm, or catarrh, can be too hot and dry or too damp and moist.

A key respiratory concept involves the idea of wind (feng) and movement. External wind implies pathogens blowing in from the outside environment, exterior to the body. A superficial pulse accompanies this to show that the qi is on the surface, fighting the pathogen. If wind goes in deeply enough, it can affect and infect internal organs. It is best to stop external wind before that happens. (Note: Internal wind is different. It originates inside the body from the Liver and manifests as involuntary movements like tremors, dizziness, or spasms. It is associated with neurology in the West; in Chinese Medicine, there is no nervous system.)

### Chinese Medicine Major Respiratory Syndromes7

<!-- chunk -->

## Respiratory Materia Medica

Many herbs, as usual, overlap and conveniently fit into more than one category. This is useful for efficient formulation. Licorice root is demulcent and cooling, and it is an immune modulator and antiinfective. Mullein leaf restores, moistens, and cools a sore throat. Thyme herb reduces infection, dries up mucus, and serves as an antispasmodic for asthma and coughs.

### Respiratory Herbs Worth Honorable Mention

<!-- chunk -->

### Respiratory Restoratives/Tonics in Chinese Medicine and the West

There are two types of Lung tonics/restoratives in Chinese Medicine. One type is moist and cooling (demulcent) and tonifies the yin by addressing Lung Yin deficiency. The other type is more warming (adaptogen) and addresses Lung Qi deficiency, a lack of lung energy. Use either or both types, depending on condition (Table 20.1). Because lungs like to be cool and moist, respiratory restoratives do their jobs by tonifying yin (increasing moisture and coolness). If lungs become too hot and dry, there is inflammation and irritation with dehydration, thirst, dry tongue and throat, nonproductive irritating cough, and dry sticky sputum. There may be hard, waterless stools, fatigue, and possibly fever. These all point to the syndrome Lung Yin Deficiency, described earlier.8

### Expectorants

Expectorants move mucus up and out of the lungs. In Western herbalism, they are a large and varied bunch. They can be stimulating or relaxing. They can be both stimulating and relaxing at the same time. They can be warming or cooling. The takeaway is that they either liquefy the mucus, help in its expulsion from the respiratory tree, or do both (Table 20.2).9

Abnormal mucus, known as sputum (catarrh), can narrow the airway and become thick, sticky, and difficult to clear out. Catarrh contains bacteria and viruses. Catarrh-filled, used nose wipes are very contagious items that should be stored in a closed paper bag. Basically, expectorants push up the gunk and stop mucus and infection from spreading to the lower respiratory tract, where real troubles can begin, such as serious pneumonias and other deep-seated infections. It’s always easier (and wiser) to treat an upper airway condition before it makes its way down the respiratory tree into the lungs.

There are two main types of expectorants: stimulating and relaxing. Stimulating ones are straightforward; they warm the lungs and help produce more mucus when supply is scant. The relaxing ones include various categories: bronchodilators, antitussives, and demulcents.

Demulcents can be relaxing expectorants. Demulcents are good for dry, stubborn, and irritating coughs that need to become productive and wetter. The types of herbs used in this case are the cooling wet ones, such as Licorice root, Plantain leaf, Irish Moss, Iceland Moss, Mullein leaf, Grindelia flower, Lungwort lichen, Platycodon Jie Geng (Balloonflower root). Many are also expectorants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Respiratory Antimicrobial Herbs

Antimicrobial herbs for the upper and lower respiratory tract (Table 20.3) are not all that different from general antimicrobials. (Chapter 17). Respiratory antiinfectives are sometimes referred to as respiratory sedatives, in the sense that the cold ones sedate or calm heat (not calm the nervous system). This difference was confusing to me for the longest time.

Table 20.3

Andrographis paniculata Chuan Xin Lian

Andrographis herb

Cold, dry, very bitter.

Astringent.

Lonicera japonica

Jin Yin Hua


Forsythia suspensa

Lian Qiao

Forsythia valve

Usnea spp.

Song Luo

Old Man’s Beard thallus

Scutellaria baicalensis

Huang Qin


Sticta pulmonaria

Lungwort thallus

Restorative and relaxing, mucostatic (drying), but also moistening for yin deficiencies, Not strictly antiinfective, but a great adjunct.

For upper respiratory infections with watery discharge, allergy, fever, headaches, flu, cough. Great for sinus congestion, sinusitis, rhinitis, colds, and flu.

Echinacea angustifolia


A few respiratory antimicrobials are warming or neutral, but most are cooling. For wind cold early-onset conditions, we want more warming ones. For wind heat conditions, we want them more on the cooling spectrum. Furthermore, some respiratory antimicrobials have affinities/tropisms for various parts of the respiratory tree. Garden Sage loves the throat and makes a good gargle. Andrographis Chuan Xin Lian (Heart-Thread Lotus leaf) goes to hot sinus infections around the eyes, Usnea thallus (Old Man’s Beard) is specific for strep throats (Fig. 20.6), and Osha root is an upper respiratory herb, for sure.

<!-- chunk -->

### Diaphoretic Herbs

We sweat all the time, no matter what. Sweating maintains normal body temperature, cools us down, and helps to eliminate toxins. Heat is either lost or conserved, on an as-needed basis, depending on the amount of evaporation occurring through the sweat glands. In early-onset flus and colds, body temperature begins to rise as an inflammatory response to infection. Herbalists are big on promoting sweating when an infection begins in order to lower fever (not necessarily eliminating it) and to push out toxins generated by microorganisms. Promotion of sweating is an important therapeutic principle when treating respiratory infections.

Diaphoretics increase sweating. If we encourage sweating with diaphoretic herbs, we push fluids (blood) toward the skin, the exterior. Herbs that accomplish this task are usually drying, pungent, and spicy; the pungent taste pushes energy outward (Table 20.4). They are often antiinfective, antipyretic, and antiinflammatory as well.8 Pungent diaphoretic herbs may be warming or cooling. The warm ones are used to banish wind cold. The cooling ones are used to banish wind heat.

Table 20.4

For wind cold, use warm arterial stimulants.

For wind heat, use cool peripheral vasodilators.

Zingiber officinale

Ginger root

Sweet, hot, dry. Arterial stimulant, for wind cold, cold/flu onset.

### Herbs That Drain Lymphatic Fluid

Along with encouragement of sweating comes another therapeutic principle when treating respiratory infections: the promotion of lymphatic drainage. Lymph circulation is part of the immune system. It transports infection-fighting white blood cells to tissues, and filters and catches bacteria through its nodes. Lymph empties into the blood circulation where toxins are filtered and eliminated through the kidneys and bowel. Therefore sponsorship of lymphatic flow and good drainage with the use of lymphatic drainer herbs is an important aspect of healing respiratory ills. Some prime lymphatic movers are Red Root, Ocotillo bark, Cleavers herb, Calendula flower, Figwort root and herb, and Poke root.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lymphatic Drainers That Are Liver Decongestants

When the liver is stimulated to do its detoxifying function, it helps the body drain toxins and fluids through the bowel and bladder. Many liver decongestants have a dual function as lymphatic drainers. Some of these double-duty herbs are Figwort root and herb, Calendula flower, Yellow Dock root, Burdock root, Blue Flag root, Poke root, Forsythia Lian Qiao (Forsythia valve), and Lonicera Jin Yin Hua (Honeysuckle flower) (Table 20.4).8 Thus, use of liver decongestants can be considered a therapeutic principle in treatment of colds and flus.

<!-- chunk -->

### Antihistamine Herbs

Histamine is a substance produced by mast cells as part of a local, hyperimmune response to an allergen (such as pollen). The histamine response causes inflammation and the dreaded Type I immediate allergy symptoms: runny, itchy eyes; nasal congestion; sneezing; rhinitis; postnasal drip; and sore, scratchy throat. Antihistamines are herbs that block histamine. They fix the symptoms. They do not prevent the allergy. Addressing allergy prevention is a bit more complicated, because the cause must be found and eliminated. But when a person is suffering from hay fever, the first step is to relieve their misery. Antihistamine herbs that do just that include Xanthium Cang Er Zi (Siberian Cocklebur), Ephedra Ma Huang (Fig. 20.8), Goldenrod herb, Eyebright herb, Ganoderma Ling Zhi (Reishi mushroom), Echinacea root, and Nettle herb (Table 20.4).

## About Coughs

A cough is a reflex, which is the body’s way of getting foreign bronchial irritants and excess mucus up and out. A dry, hacky cough irritates and hurts the throat, making it inflamed and sore. But a productive cough brings up stuff like bacteria, viruses, and smoke particles.

Coughing is a symptom. It is caused from something else. The most common reason for an acute cough is from a viral or bacterial respiratory infection. Air pollution or a strained or pulled abdominal muscle are other possibilities. Common chronic causes are bronchitis, allergies, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and postnasal drip.12 Red flag: A cough that doesn’t respond to treatment or that produces blood (hemoptysis) needs referral. This type of cough could indicate chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, or even cancer. The best way to alleviate a cough is to focus on the underlying cause. Anytime there’s a cough on board, the formula must tackle the root and respect and alleviate annoying symptoms. Sometimes, the way to approach this is to have the main formula address the infection (or whatever the cause may be) and then to provide a separate cough syrup, as needed (Box 20.1).

Box 20.1

Cough Begone and Sore Throat Syrup Adapted from herbalist Rosemary Gladstar13

Most generic herbal cough syrups contain a little bit of everything. They include an expectorant to bring up phlegm, a demulcent to soothe an inflamed throat, an antitussive to calm the cough (but not stop it short), an antimicrobial, and a nervous relaxant. A nice blend of warming and cooling. A cough syrup should taste good too, as it will be taken often. Have one preprepared to grab right from the fridge.19,20

Directions. Measure out dried, ground herbs, mix together, weigh 2 oz herb mixture to 1 qt water. The measurements shown here are approximate. Over low heat in a heavy bottom pot, simmer herbs and water until it is reduced by half (1 pint). Strain return liquid to the pot. For each pint of liquid, add 1 cup of honey (or more, if desired). Heat gently and mix until the syrup is well-blended.

Optional. Add 4–8 tbsp brandy and 1–2 tbsp Black Cherry concentrate. Yummy, nurturing, and effective.

Dose. 1 tsp every ½ hour to every 2 hours.

Coughs can be soothed, stimulated, or suppressed. Obviously, if there’s infectious mucus to expel, that process needs to be stimulated, not suppressed. That condition calls for an expectorant that is soothing and a bit stimulating. But, if the cough is a nervous, nonproductive, and chronic dry tickle, it serves no purpose. In such cases, good riddance. A suppressing antitussive that relaxes and puts an end to that annoying and irritating cough reflex is needed.

## About Permanent Prevention of Seasonal Allergies

Recurring immediate allergies such as hay fever are generally a reflection of a deeper underlying problem. The best approach is to first relieve the symptoms, but when they abate, keep digging for answers. There is a reason some suffer from repeated hay fever, seasonal allergies caused from pollens or other environmental allergens year after year. The ultimate answer is to find the cause, and work on that. It is not a quick fix and will take some dedicated time and commitment from client and herbalist. As always, return to root causes. Allergies are just about always associated with digestive functions, including food sensitivities, or weak adrenals and immune function.13 Establishing good nutrition is paramount.

## Common Respiratory Conditions

<!-- chunk -->

### Laryngitis

<!-- chunk -->

### Sore Throat

A sore throat usually accompanies a viral cold, flu, or upper respiratory inflammation. The palatine tonsils (lymphatic tissue on either side of the throat) are sometimes involved. They contain antibodies and are part of the immune system, the first line of defense for the respiratory system. The tonsils trap microorganisms and external pathogens, and they defend against external wind. If they are inflamed or enlarged as in tonsillitis, it’s a sign the body is attempting to fight an infection.

A streptococcal throat infection is a potentially serious bacterial infection. If untreated, it can but may not always go systemic and lead to rheumatic fever, affecting the heart, kidneys, or joints, or cause meningitis or otitis media. It must be treated. On inspection, the throat appears red, sometimes with white or yellow streaks of pus. Red spots are on the soft or hard palate. There can be fever and intense throat pain. Throat cultures can be obtained from an healthcare provider to verify. Usnea thallus, the berberines, Juniper berry, and Echinacea angustifolia are particularly indicated if you suspect strep throat and must touch the membranes directly.16

### Common Cold

Here we must determine stage of infection, whether External Wind Cold, External Wind Heat, or Wind Damp Heat, and treat with appropriate herbs. These Chinese Medicine conditions were laid out in detail in Chapter 17.

Case History 20.2

Case History for Common Cold

Part 1 Common Cold, Day One

S. Elise has had symptoms for 1 day. There is a scratchy throat; white, moist sputum; painful, mostly nonproductive cough; no fever. She is rarely sick.

O. P Slippery. T Body normal, coat greasy, moist, and white.

A. Early-onset common cold with no fever, Lung Phlegm Cold.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Expel cold, dry damp. (2) Immunostimulants. (3) Antivirals. (4) Warm, pungent arterial stimulant diaphoretics. (5) Expectorants that are warming and stimulating.

Other Suggestion for Common Cold, Day One

Vitamin C Pills Courtesy of Rosalee de la Forêt.21

These tasty, tart pills are easily made by hand and will keep for a very long time. All four herbs are notoriously high in vitamin C and other antioxidants, necessary immune system boosters. The powders may be purchased from Mountain Rose Herbs and other companies.


Mix the powdered herbs together, breaking up any clumps. Pour some slightly warmed honey into the powdered mix and stir. Use enough to hold the powders together, not too moist or sticky. Roll into pea-sized balls, and then roll the ball into some extra dried orange powder. (Sweet Orange peel powder is yummy.) Makes about 45 pills. Store in an airtight container. These should last a very long time.


1–3 balls per day. It is hard to overdose on water-soluble vitamin C. The adverse effect is loose stools. If that happens, decrease dose.

Part 2 Common Cold, Day Five

S. Elise felt a little better, so she cut back on the herbs. Now, on day 5, her symptoms have changed. Sputum is sticky and yellow/green, and hard to expectorate. Cough is irritating and scratchy. She has a bad headache and a slight stomachache.

O. P Wiry or tense. T Body is red, coat dry.

A. Lung Phlegm Heat and Qi Constraint. Common cold, no fever with dry cough.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Overall, expel heat, moisturize lungs, relax Lung qi. (2) Cooling, broad-spectrum antimicrobials. (3) Immunostimulants.

Red Flag. Anaphylactic shock is the result of a severe life-threatening IgE (immunoglobulin E) antigen reaction that blocks airway and breathing and can occur in seconds or minutes. This is not simple hay fever and a different scenario. Common triggers are from peanuts and other foods, bee stings (insect venom), and medications. An automatic ejector of epinephrine (EpiPen) is good to have if person is known to be allergic. Go to a hospital.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bronchial Asthma

Asthma is a condition marked by spasms in the bronchi causing narrowing of the airway and difficulty breathing. A chronic allergic reaction can develop over time and involves airway inflammation. It can be controlled but not cured by modern drug therapy. In worst cases, it causes life-threatening respiratory arrest. An asthma attack is the tip of the iceberg when an environmental trigger sets off a crisis. Triggers are numerous. They can be from allergens, particularly dust mites; diet (especially dairy, eggs, and nuts); royal jelly; temperature changes; smoking; poor digestion, manifesting as low HCl and acid reflux; viral infections, such as colds or sinusitis; hormonal changes; and of course, stress.9

Case History 20.7

Case History for Acute Asthma Attack

S. Joe has a history of bronchial asthma brought on by stress. He was anxious about an impeding public speaking engagement and suddenly suffered shortness of breath, wheezing and coughing, and intense anxiety. He began his breathing exercises. His prescription for Albuterol inhaler just ran out.

O. P Rapid and wiry. T Normal. In acute respiratory distress. Wheezing heard without stethoscope.

A. Asthma attack. Respiratory distress, anxiety. Lung Qi Constraint.

A few methods to maintain a healthy respiratory system include good hydration, smoking cessation, breath work, aerobic exercise, and surrounding the environment with green plants.

The respiratory Materia Medica is extensive, and if used wisely, an herbalist could cultivate a friend for life. Expectorants address many types of coughs. Demulcents soothe, moisturize, and decrease inflammation. Spasmolytics stop persistent coughing, and antitussives calm coughs down. Anticatarrhals decrease copious mucus, and bronchodilators widen the airway.

Tonics or restoratives heal and strengthen weak airway tissue in chronic conditions. For immediate allergies, antihistamines lower the inflammatory response and stop symptoms. Diaphoretics cause sweating (a major therapeutic principle for herbalists). Lymphatic drainers eliminate excess fluids, toxins, and dry damp. They must be included in respiratory formulas for those reasons. Topical throat remedies make for good gargles.

Allergies are a common respiratory complaint. Permanent prevention involves returning to gut health with the Four-R program and addressing immune modulation and the adrenals. In Chinese Medicine, the concept of External Wind is basic to the Lungs. Wind can come in with heat, cold, and/or damp on board, and Lungs may be qi and yin deficient.

Children respond amazingly well to herbs as long as their parents project confidence. The herbalist’s job is to facilitate this situation and make it a win for both. A mother’s willingness and success in giving her child herbs depends on her own relationship with health and healing. A trusted parent/herbalist interaction is needed. Along with that, the herbalist needs to have a basic understanding of differences between children and adult physiology and knowledge of a safe Materia Medica and its use. With those tools, a bright future is assured for pediatric herbology.

Herbal administration to kids is a bit different from administration to adults. Digestive systems and livers are immature at first. Dosages for children differ from adult dosages and must be adjusted, and safety issues are a factor. Furthermore, the tricky business of getting a kid to actually ingest a strange, weird-tasting substance is discussed. Time-tested methods from years of experience of mothers and herbalists are included. Last are case histories covering some common childhood illnesses and discussion of the importance of knowing when to refer out and when to recognize the red flags.

<!-- chunk -->

## Confidence for Everybody Is Key

For most of human history, herbs were the only medicines given to anybody, children included. Herbal medicine has a long track record for safety in treating common childhood-related health concerns. Obviously, not all plants are safe, and strong toxic ones are not suitable for kids or adults. But long lists of botanicals have been used in traditional healing, so use them with confidence, faith, and common sense.

Babies and kids don’t have opinions about any philosophy of medicine, allopathic or otherwise. If the parent is confident, the child will accept herbal medicine. If the herbalist is competent and enthusiastic, most parents will give herbal cures a try and end by feeling empowered. A parent is always the first line of defense against their baby’s illness. We all know how stressful and scary it is for inexperienced moms and dads to witness their sick child. Happily, a great many childhood illnesses are uncomfortable but self-limiting. Children’s bodies are naturally responsive. They recover quickly. Herbalists can play a role in many favorable outcomes.

Try things out on your own children or with a friend’s to get a feel. Start with very simple applications, teas, or essential oils. If one formula doesn’t work, go for another. Follow the dosage and formulas given later in this chapter and have fun. Confident herbalists and parents make for herbally initiated kids. Help them pass on the tradition.

<!-- chunk -->

## How Children’s Bodies Differ From Those of Adults

Kids are not just miniature people. Babies and children have faster metabolisms than adults. They absorb nutrients differently. Infants have immature livers with less bile and digestive enzymes in the first months of life. This immaturity translates into impaired fat digestion. Kids do not have fully developed gut flora until around 11 or 12 years old. These are just facts; not cause for alarm, but it does mean that pediatric herbalism is a bit of a specialty.

## About Children’s Herbs and Childhood Infections

For beginning herbalists, stick to tried-and-true pediatric herbs (Fig. 21.1). There are plenty of them, and you’ll, perhaps, feel on safer ground. In reality, children can be given most of the same herbs as adults, just in lower doses.1 That said, avoid powerful laxatives like Senna leaf or Rhubarb root, or strong-tasting bitter herbs like Wormwood herb or Goldenseal root. (Most kids will spit them out anyway, even if you get them in.) Anything potentially toxic such as Poke root or Aconite root should absolutely not be given.

Most children’s illnesses are in the respiratory (viral) and GI areas. In general, kids need herbs with these tropisms, plus gentle nervines for calming and sleep issues. Herbs commonly appearing in children’s remedies are Catnip herb for low-grade fevers, respiratory infections, headaches, indigestion, and sleep; Chamomile flower for colic and as a mild sedative; Echinacea root for colds; and Licorice root for lung congestion.5 Other popular herbs that have historically been safely used for children include Melissa herb for calming and GI spasms; Dill seed, Fennel seed, Aniseed, and Caraway seeds as carminatives for tummy aches and colic; Burdock root and Calendula flower for skin irritations; Elderberry for colds and prevention; Eyebright herb and Chamomile herb for pink eye; and Marshmallow root and Slippery Elm bark to soothe stomachs. There are many more.

Children tend to get infections of the respiratory system, stomach, skin, and eyes. By using the pediatric Materia Medica, apply the same therapeutic principles as for adults:

<!-- chunk -->

## Respiratory, Eye, and Ear Materia Medica

Most respiratory infections are viral and spread like wildfire in kids who lack mature immunity, such as those exposed to germs for the first time ever in preschool and kindergarten settings. The child will build up antibodies after recovering from the exposure, not before. Children’s respiratory herbs are similar to the adult ones. Just use the milder varieties.

Important immune modulators like Andrographis herb Chuan Lian (Heart-Thread Lotus leaf), Echinacea spp. root, and Astragalus root Huang Qi are basic when treating infection. Use antimicrobials, such as Echinacea root, Lonicera Jin Yin Hua (Honeysuckle flower), Forsythia Lian Qiao (Forsythia valve), Andrographis Chuan Lian (Heart-Thread Lotus leaf), Garlic bulb, and Eucalyptus and Tea Tree essential oils. Antitussives include Hops flower, Wild Cherry bark, Licorice root. For allergies, there is Nettle herb and Scutellaria Huang Qin (Baikal Skullcap root).

A major childhood challenge is retained airway secretions, a buildup of mucus caused by a weak cough and impaired cilia. Therefore mucolytics must be used: Aniseed, Fennel seed, Thyme herb, Eyebright herb, Cinnamon bark. Important expectorants include White Horehound herb and Grindelia flower. Demulcents that soothe and cool the lungs are good: Mullein leaf, Slippery Elm bark, or Irish Moss thallus. Spasmolytics are needed to relax the bronchi and bronchioles: Coleus herb, Licorice root, and our friend, Grindelia’s milky flower bud. Anticatarrhals to dry upper-respiratory secretions include: Eyebright herb, Peppermint leaf, Elderberry, or Plantain leaf. For lower respiratory tract, use Mullein or Plantain leaf as moisturizers, or strong and bitter Garden Sage leaf to dry up secretions. Honey and Licorice root help the medicine go down; in addition, honey (for children older than 1 year of age) is antimicrobial, and Licorice is antiviral.

<!-- chunk -->

### Go-To Herbs for Respiratory, Eye, and Ear Problems

These are special choices for use with children but are also used in adult herbalism. They run the gamut with categories already mentioned in Chapter 20: expectorants, demulcents, antitussives, antimicrobials, mucolytics, and antispasmodics (Table 21.1).

Table 21.1

<!-- chunk -->

### Diaphoretics

Children are warm by nature, and they run on the hot side, so generally the cooler vasodilating diaphoretics are in order. Sweating is a must to bring down a fever and release toxins, because heat can be transferred from the body core via blood to the skin through vasodilation. Some tried-and-true children’s diaphoretics include Yarrow flower, Elderberry flower, Catnip herb, Peppermint herb, and Lemon Balm leaf (Table 21.2).

Table 21.2

<!-- chunk -->

### Fevers

Temperature elevation is a tricky business with no strict rules in children. Children and infants tend to run higher fevers than adults do. Temps can vary by 2°F just from emotional activity, stress, exercise, or being bundled in warm clothing.6 Usually, a fever is a reaction to an acute viral or bacterial infection and is a sign the body is fighting infection by increasing white blood cells. Fevers can also be caused by dehydration, overexertion, bug bites, and allergic reactions. If a fever is brought down and the child looks and feels better, hooray. If they still look and feel sick, even with a lowered temperature, it’s something else. Look elsewhere. Here are some fever guidelines (Box 21.1).

Box 21.1

## Common Conditions for Respiratory, Eye, and Ear Problems

<!-- chunk -->

### Common Cold and Influenza

Babies and children are especially prone to respiratory infections because the system does not reach full maturity until around 6 years of age. There are many factors involved. The number of alveoli increases with age; kids have a higher basal metabolic rate requiring more oxygen. Infants are nose breathers until they are 3 or 4 months old, and their immune systems, which protect against outside pernicious influences (pathogens), are still immature.8 The best approach to respiratory problems is prevention. Use immune enhancing herbs, such as Echinacea root (Fig. 21.2) or Andrographis Chuan Xin Lian (Heart-Thread Lotus leaf).

Case History 21.1

Case History for Common Cold

S. Lisa has no temperature, but seems very uncomfortable, cries and points to head and stomach, cranky and tired. Cries when she eats, clear rhinitis, unproductive cough, stomachache. She is 2½ years old and weighs 28 lb.

O. Index finger vein is pinkish red when rubbed, extending a little past knuckle.

A. Wind Cold turning to Wind Heat. Viral respiratory infection.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Diaphoretics. (2) Antiviral, dispel wind heat. (3) Expectorants. (4) Immunostimulant. (5) Moisturizeld mucous membranes. (6) Treat stomach and headache.


Red Flag. Call a doctor if a fever persists after 3 days, if a cold does not clear up in 3 weeks, or the child develops a rash. Respiratory distress could indicate pneumonia.

Box 21.2

Garlic Lemonade and Licorice Stick Lollipops

Garlic Lemonade

A yummy way to sweat out a fever. Most kids will merrily comply. Use freely during a cold or flu episode to keep them hydrated.

Licorice Stick Lollipops8

These are fun to suck on to relieve a sore inflamed throat. Sweet Licorice sticks soothe and moisturize the respiratory mucosa of sick, miserable kids.

Case History 21.2

Case History for Influenza

S. Susie is 15 months old, 22 lb. She has runny nose with green secretions, dry hacking cough, temperature of 103.5°F. She refused breakfast (it probably hurts to swallow); her face is flushed, and she is very fussy. Throat was red when inspected with flashlight. She just wants to sleep. Her muscles seem to ache.

O. Index finger vein pink when rubbed, extending to the second joint.

A. Wind Heat. Probable flu and seems quite sick.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Diaphoretics for fever. (2) Cooling antivirals. (3) Settle stomach with carminatives. (4) Help expectorate and stop cough. (5) Moisturize mucous membranes. (6) Stimulate immune system. (7) Muscle and nervous relaxant.


Red Flags. Very high fever, seizures, changes in level of consciousness, mental function (could be encephalitis), any respiratory distress manifested as increased breathing rate, gasping, wheezing, nostril-flaring, bluish color.

<!-- chunk -->

### Acute Otitis Media (AOM)

Ear and respiratory infections go hand in hand. Babies and children have short, straight eustachian tubes that provide a direct viral pathway from the throat to the ear, whereas adult tubes are curved, giving them ear infections less frequently. As long as the ear drum is intact, a fresh Garlic and Mullein flower sun oil is used externally (Box 21.3).

Case History 21.3

Case History for Acute Otitis Media (AOM)

S. Amelia is 3½ years old and has been tugging and hitting her right ear. “Hurts,” she cries. Reports running a fever of 101.1°F. She weighs 32 lb.

O. Temperature 101.3°F when taken by herbalist. Ears reddened on inside.

A. Damp Heat. Probable ear infection. Index finger vein pinkish extending to middle knuckle.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Clear infection with cold, dry antiinfectives. (2) Lymphatic drainage to help drain bacteria. (3) Cool/bring down fever. (4) Stress relief and sleeping help.


Red Flags for ear infections, acute or chronic, include (1) Severe pain with ear drainage which could mean a perforated ear drum. (2) Hearing loss, severe headache, stiff neck, and/or lethargy could indicate meningitis.8

Box 21.3

Fresh Garlic and Mullein Flower Sun Oil (A Summer Project)

This good outer ear oil can be stashed in the apothecary fridge for use, as needed. Childhood or adult painful ear inflammation and infections respond well. It also softens ear wax (cerumen). The oil absorbs through the tympanic membrane to the middle ear.


Collect lots of Mullein flowers. Mullein grows everywhere in dry, disturbed ground. Flowers are plentiful in summer and fall, a labor of love to collect, and hard to purchase. Chop fresh Garlic cloves. Mix herbs together, half and half. Pack herbs tightly into an absolutely dry ½ pint or smaller Mason jar to very top. Pour in olive oil, so there is no air space between herbs, oil, and underside of lid. Stir with chopstick to expel air bubbles.

Place jar outside in shade on pie tin (it will overflow a bit). Add more oil, as needed. Let it macerate a few weeks, watching as it turns to a lovely yellow green. Strain through knee-high nylon stocking, hooked around top of jar. Squeeze out the oil. Discard oily stocking. Store oil in refrigerator in dark glass Boston round. Change to smaller jar as oil is used up, to decrease air space under lid.


Safe for children 2 years and older. Use oil at room temperature. Squeeze 3 or 4 drops into ear with pipette. Massage outer ear and around base. Lightly place small wad of cotton or tissue at ear opening to catch any excess drips. Repeat every hour, as needed. You’ll smell like Italian dressing.

General guidelines

Before use, warm up oil by placing bottle in hot water. Test temperature on wrist. Dose: 3–5 drops in ear every 6 hours. Lightly place a little twist of cotton ball just inside ear opening to soak up drips. (When sleeping, use an old pillowcase.)

Caution: Contraindicated for perforated ear drum (tympanic membrane). Short of visual inspection with an otoscope, signs and symptoms include ear pain that may subside quickly because pressure is released; clear, pus-filled, or bloody drainage; hearing loss; ringing in the ear (tinnitus); spinning sensation (vertigo) with or without nausea or vomiting.

### Chronic Otitis Media with Effusion

Case History 21.4

Case History for Chronic Otitis Media with Effusion (OME)

S. Three-year-old and 35 lb. Daniel is finally recovering from an acute cold after 3 weeks. Now he tugs at his ears and cries. They are plugged up and he seems dizzy. No discharge, no fever. Was bottle fed with a soy-based formula and now drinks lots of milk and loves cheese and ice cream.

O. Index finger vein bluish when rubbed. Hard to see.

A. Head Damp. Probable otitis media with effusion (OME).

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Use cooling broad-spectrum antivirals. (2) Drain damp with lymphatic drainage and diuretics. (3) Use immunostimulants. (4) Treat pain and anxiety. (5) Apply external ear oil because there is no drainage (indicating intact ear drum).


<!-- chunk -->

### Eye Infections

Kids and babies often get eye infections. Warm compresses and external washes are the best approaches. Application of a wash takes a little practice (Box 21.4).

Box 21.4

Application of Eye Washes and Compresses

Treat eye ailments with washes or compresses. The best herbal bets are antiinflammatory and anti-infectious: Chamomile flower, Goldenseal root, Eyebright, and Chickweed herb. As with all external conditions, treat internally as well. In the case of eye infections, an Echinacea root tincture for the immune system could be part of the program. Cleanliness is essential for eye washes.

Clean or sterilize an eye cup and storage container. Boil eye cup and glass storage jar and lid for 5 minutes. Leftover eye wash can be kept and reused from this clean airtight glass jar and will keep safely in the refrigerator for 24 hours. You will be using and applying solution 3 to 6 times a day.

Create a saline solution. A normal saline solution (technically 0.9% sodium chloride to water) is a mixture of water, salt, and a pinch of baking soda that is similar to the salt concentration in blood and tears. It should be the base of eye washes, wound and nasal irrigations, and rehydration drinks.

Remove saline solution from stove and steep the herbs

Technique. Gently wash eyes with warm water and rub away the dried discharge. Use a very clean or sterilized eye cup, a dropper, or a cotton ball soaked in tea and dribbled in the eye. Tilt head back or lay child in your lap and dribble the wash from corner of eye toward ear to prevent contaminating the healthy eye. In the case of a compress, discard after each use. Use a new one for each eye or session.

Keep it clean. Pink eye and other infections are highly contagious from kid to kid, kid to adult, and adult to adult. Discard any tissue that touches infection, so it doesn’t spread to the other eye or from person to person. Using personal towels and pillowcases is important. Wash them daily. Wash your own hands before and after treatment. Discourage child from rubbing eyes. (Good luck with that one.)

A Compress

This is soothing and can bring down swelling, although the eye is closed so the medicine does not get in direct contact with the conjunctiva. A child might be more compliant with this method. Soak a clean cloth in the herbal infusion (the same as the one made for the wash) and place over eye. Keep it warm. Another compress idea is a conveniently prepackaged black tea or Chamomile tea bag that is wet, wrung out, and used as a compress, which is both astringent and antiseptic.

## Digestive Materia Medica

Gastric upsets are a frequent occurrence, especially if a child is overwhelmed, nervous, or tired. The gut-brain reaction kicking in. Babies get colicky (Case History 21.5). Tummy problems can be caused by gastritis, constipation, and diarrhea; and by hunger, full bladder, stress, excitement, or food sensitivities. Many digestive herbs double as nervines, the perfect double-duty combination. Some herbal favorites are: Catnip leaf and Chamomile flower for aches and colic; Slippery Elm bark or Psyllium fiber for constipation; Raspberry leaf and Geranium root for diarrhea; and the carminatives, like Fennel seed and Dill seed or Citrus Chen Pi (Ripe Tangerine rind) for indigestion (Stuck Stomach Qi).

Case History 21.5

Case Histories for Common Gastrointestinal (GI) Conditions (Colic, Gastritis, Constipation, Diarrhea)

Part 1 Colic

S. Jerry is 3 months old. Even when dry, fed, and rocked, he doubles up and cries inconsolably every evening starting around 8:00 pm. He was recently weaned off breast milk. He sucks the bottle vigorously for about 30 seconds and pulls off the nipple. This has been going on 3 times a week for 4 weeks and lasts about 3 hours. His parents are at wit’s end.

O. Tense abdomen, distress.

A. Stagnant Stomach Qi. Infantile colic.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. Gripe water. (1) Remove spasms and inflammation with carminatives. (2) Calm with nervines. (3) Cool with demulcent.

Herbal Formula for Gripe Water.

(A classic colic formula.)

Other suggestions for colic

Part 2 Gastritis

S. Lily was running around in glee during her 8th birthday party. She ate two helpings of ice cream and cake. The guests have gone home, and she now has pain, nausea, stomach cramping, gas, and bloating. She is balled up on the couch crying. She weighs 63 lb.

O. T Greasy, white coating.

A. Food stagnation. Stress and overeating. Stomachache with gas. Birthday party syndrome.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Carminatives to stimulate peristalsis, eliminate gas and nausea. (2) Nervines to calm anxiety. (3) Spasmolytics to relieve cramping.

Other suggestions for gastritis

Part 3 Constipation

S. Timmy is 2½ years old, weighs 31 lb. He has been eating mainly bananas and cheese, and not drinking much. Has not had a bowel movement for 4 days and complains of stomach cramps. His last stool was hard and dry.

O. Dry, hard stools; no bowel movement in 4 days. Index finger red.

A. Constipation with heat. Finger vein reddish, extending between first and second knuckle.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Increase bile flow. (2) Moisten and cool gut. (3) Relieve cramping.

Other suggestions for constipation

Red Flags: Constipation is a symptom, not a disease. Beware a vomiting infant who won’t nurse, bloody stools, severe pain when passing stool, and chronic or persistent constipation. Serious complications include fecal impaction, painful tears around the skin (anal fissures), intestinal protrusion out of the anus (rectal prolapse).

It is necessary to ascertain causes, such as dehydration, high carb and low fruit and vegetable diet, bed rest, lack of exercise, potty training stress, cow milk allergy.

Part 4 Diarrhea

S. Jenny has had frequent loose watery stools for 2 days, abdominal cramps that come and go, some vomiting. There is no fever. She is 4 years old and weighs 40 lb.

O. Watery stools for 2 days. P Rapid. T Body red, coat slightly dry.

A. Diarrhea. Spleen Damp Heat.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Astringent antidiarrheals. (2) Broad-spectrum antiinfectives, berberines. (3) Carminatives for cramping. (4) Avoid dehydration. Use Rehydration drink (Box 21.5). (4) Immune support.

Other suggestions for diarrhea

Red Flags. Dehydration, persistent cramping, and bloody stools, going on for more than 2 weeks.6 Serious reasons for diarrhea are from: reactions to medications, irritable bowel disease, hepatitis, cystic fibrosis, and fistula. Diarrhea is often caused by an infection, such as a virus, bacteria, fungus, or plasmodium. Can be spread from other kids, or contaminated food or water. Also, food sensitivities from newly introduced foods can do it, such as lactose intolerance, citrus fruits, wheat, sugar, and dairy. The priority is to keep the child hydrated.

Box 21.5

Slippery Elm Gruel and Rehydration Drink for Diarrhea

Slippery Elm Gruel

This is a bland herbal food that heals the gut and absorbs water. It bulks up the stool to stop watery diarrhea.6 (This gruel also treats constipation, because it softens stool and helps movement.)

Re-Hydration Drink

This drink balances electrolytes, adds fluids, and vitamin C that helps immunity. Water and electrolytes (sodium Na+ and potassium K+) are lost in sweating, diarrhea, and/or fever.

Red flags for stomach problems in children include weight loss, growth retardation, GI blood loss, frequent vomiting, chronic diarrhea, constant upper-right or lower abdominal pain, or persistent fever. If any of these are present, a referral is in order. For persistent diarrhea, be aware of dehydration. IV fluids might be needed.

Otherwise, for the vast majority of tummy aches, choose among the herbal categories in this list that will cover most gastric conditions (Table 21.3).

## Nervous System Materia Medica

We all get stress, kids included. Nervines that calm the nervous system and anxiolytics (herbs that treat anxiety) are the ticket (Table 21.4). When parents are stressed and anxious, a child quickly picks up on it. Stress decreases immune function and leads to more respiratory infections. Infant sleep problems are among the most common conditions seen by pediatricians.1 If you can help a parent get their child to sleep, you’ll have a convert for life (Case History 21.6). Another very common problem is attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome (ADHD).

Table 21.4

Case History 21.6

Case History for Insomnia and/or Anxiety

S. Alex is 18 months old, weighs 27 lb, and doesn’t yet sleep through the night. He wakes frequently, cries, responds to his mother singing softly, goes back to sleep, but awakens 10 minutes later. Mom is exhausted. He is on solid foods, with a little breast feeding still being done for comfort.

O. Agitated and cries constantly. No apparent stomach distress. Cries too much when finger is rubbed.

A. Heart Yin Deficiency. Difficulty staying asleep.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) The best approach to anxiety and sleep disturbances is to find the cause, be it colic, teething, nightmares, pain, indigestion from eating spicy meals too close to bedtime, or in older children, underlying stress or worry. (2) Nervines/antianxiety herbs to calm NS and help sleep. (3) Nervous system tonics.

Child’s Dose for insomnia: 0.5 mL at bedtime and then 0.2 mL every 15 min as needed up to 2 hours, then STOP. Per Fried’s rule (Box 21.6).

(Same frequency as adult schedule in 5 mL of expressed breast milk.)

## Common Nervous System Conditions

<!-- chunk -->

### Insomnia and/or Anxiety

Anxiety refers to a state of excessive uneasiness and apprehension, sometimes with compulsive behavior or panic attacks. Anxiety may or may not be chronic. Sleep problems are common complaints. Babies, toddlers, and school-age kids don’t necessarily sleep through the night. Lack of sleep can lead to concentration and learning problems.

There are many fail-safe childhood nervous system remedies for sleep, anxiety, and stress. Chamomile flower is the supreme goddess of them all. Also, honor Passionflower, Lemon Balm herb, California Poppy, and Lavender herb and essential oil. For pain, use Catnip leaf or a Lavender essential oil bath. Don’t forget the nervous system. The Ayurvedic tonic, Bacopa monnieri (Water Hyssop, all parts used medicinally) and Chinese Medicine’s Ziziphus Suan Zao Ren (Sour Jujube seed) are for matters of the Heart, or shen disturbances, which include sleeplessness, anxiety, and worry.

## Skin Materia Medica

Babies get diaper rash and atopic dermatitis. Children 2 to 5 years old get eczema, viral warts (Human papilloma virus, also called HPV), and impetigo (usually from Staphylococcus aureus). Teenagers get Acne vulgaris (Chapter 25). Often, this is because their usual avenues of detoxification (the liver, the bowel, and the bladder) are overloaded. Hence, skin eruptions occur in the body’s attempt to eliminate the waste. The skin is considered a detoxifying organ, too, sometimes called the third kidney (Chapter 25).

Herbal categories that address detoxification through the kidneys are important in clearing up the skin. These herbs work by increasing diuresis (urination). They are sometimes called the diuretic detoxicants: Burdock root, Nettle herb, Celery seed, Parsley leaf, and Dandelion leaf. Lymphatic drainers also channel water through the kidneys and help the child to pee out toxins. Antimicrobials are generally included because so many skin problems have a primary or secondary infectious component (Table 21.5).

Table 21.5

In Chinese Medicine, the Lungs rule the exterior of the body and manifest in the body hair. It is interesting that respiratory problems are the most common problems found in kids, with skin ailments way up on the list. The high incidence of respiratory infections accompanied by eczema confirms this.10 Most skin problems are damp heat. There is heat because of inflammation and emotional stress, and damp because of insufficient flushing of waste and toxins, water retention, and a humid or moist environment. Thus the therapeutic intention is to clear damp heat.

Some prime skin herbs are the antiviral St. John’s Wort; antimicrobial and skin healing Calendula flower; the alteratives Red Clover flower and Nettle herb; diuretic detoxicants such as Burdock root; and lymph draining Cleavers herb. To clear damp heat, we need cool, drying herbs like Andrographis Chuan Xin Lian (Heart-Thread Lotus leaf) and Scutellaria Huang Qin (Baikal Skullcap root).

## Safety with Children’s Herbs

As a general rule, a child can be given the same herb that you would give an adult but at lower doses.5 Naturally there are qualifications. You wouldn’t give a child a strong laxative, very strong-tasting herbs, or anything potentially toxic. As true in pregnancy and lactation, there are very few good studies on this topic. It seems that women and children have been left behind in the research department. Herbal decisions are typically based on traditional use, anecdotal comments, existing studies, and knowledge of phytochemical constituents found in the plants (Table 21.6). Many widely used pediatric herbs are known to be safe because of long historical use. Let common sense prevail.

Table 21.6

<!-- chunk -->

## Ballpark Children’s Dosages for Mild Herbs

Obviously, children’s doses need to be smaller than those for adults. Infants up to 1 year of age and sometimes kids up to 6 years of age absorb herbs differently than adults do because of erratic transit times and lower levels of digestive enzymes. Hence, the bioavailability of herbs could be compromised. Furthermore, lots of children get tummy aches with constipation or diarrhea. Constipation decreases transit time; diarrhea speeds it up. Either way, there is no consistency. So be careful and conservative with doses, particularly with children younger than 3 years of age.

Begin on the lower end of dosage range and watch a child’s reaction. It is important that an herbalist maintain good communication with the parent. Have caregivers check for signs that symptoms are easing. Ask parents to observe how the child is feeling and reacting. Children are sensitive. They get sick quickly and get well quickly. It is always best to consider each child individually, their weight, the severity of the condition, and their overall health.

In general, children respond very quickly to small doses. More frequent smaller doses, rather than less frequent higher doses, are the rule. If there is no response after a couple of doses in acute conditions, then increase the dose. For a chronic condition, if there is no positive change after a week, increase the dose. If the herbs are medium strength, such as Lobelia herb or Pasqueflower herb, rather than mild herbs like Catnip herb, the dose must be smaller. Test out a small amount and see how they do. Use tried-and-true pediatric herbs on the very young. They are in the mild category.

<!-- chunk -->

### Calculating Children’s Doses

There are a variety of ways to calculate a child’s dose. Two traditional methods are Clark’s rule that goes by weight, and Young’s rule that goes by age in years (Box 21.6). Clark’s weight-based method makes more sense, because the so-called normal growth and development charts hardly apply these days, what with childhood obesity being so common. Weights of different children of the same age vary widely. If a kid is an average weight, according to the standard growth chart, the calculated dosage between the two methods will be close. If they are not, the answer will be skewed. So go by Clark’s rule, which goes by weight, to be safe. Fried’s rule is for infants younger than 24 months old. Fried’s rule uses the age in months, rather than in years.

Box 21.6

Children’s Dosage Calculations

Tip. To measure out children’s dosages in fractions of a milliliter, such as a 0.7 mL dose, invest in some syringes which are calibrated in tenths and available in pharmacies. Twist off the covered needle and dispose properly in a sharps container. Fill the syringe to desired tenth of a mL dose, and gently push the tincture into the back of the child’s mouth.

Clark’s Rule12 (weight-based)

Divide weight of the child in pounds by 150 = fraction of adult dose.

Then multiply fraction by adult dose.

Adult Dose × (Child’s weight in pounds ÷ 150) = Child’s Dose

Example: Adult dose is 3 mL. Child weighs 35 lb.

35 ÷ 150 = 0.2333 = fraction of adult dose. Then: 0.2333 × 3 mL = 0.699. Round up to 0.7 mL (child’s dose)

YOUNG’S RULE (age-based)

Child’s age in years divided by age plus 12 = fraction of adult dose.

Then multiply fraction by adult dose.

Adult Dose × Child’s age ÷ (Age + 12) = Child’s Dose

Example: Adult dose is 3 mL and child is 3 years old.

3 ÷ 15 = 0.2 = (fraction of adult dose). Then, 0.2 × 3 mL = 0.6 mL (child’s dose)

FRIED’S RULE13 (Infants up to 24 months)

Age in months divided by 150 = fraction of adult dose.

Then multiply fraction by adult dose to get child’s dose.

(Age in months ÷ 150) × adult dose = child’s dose

Example: Child is 4 months old. Adult’s dose is 5 mL.

4 months ÷ 150 = 0.266 (fraction of adult dose). Then: 0.266 × 5 mL = 0.13 mL (child’s dose)

## Routes of Administration for Infants and Children

### Compliance Tips for Yucky-Tasting Tinctures and Teas


Many of the herbs used for children are the same as those for adults but in smaller doses. In the early years, children’s GI system, livers, and lungs are immature. They need mild, gentle herbs. The majority of health problems herbalists see with kids involve lung infections, tummy aches, and accompanying emotional disturbances, such as sleep challenges and anxiety. Skin outbreaks are also common. For this reason, sample Materia Medicas and case histories are given in those areas.

For respiratory infections, we use immune builders, antimicrobials, and diaphoretics to sweat out a fever; mucolytics to break up phlegm; and antitussives to calm coughs. For eye infections, use antimicrobials, especially the berberines; for ear infections, antimicrobials and lymphatic drainers. For stomach ailments, such as gastritis and colic, use the relaxants and carminatives; for constipation, choose the cholagogues; and for diarrhea, use astringents. For anxiety or ADHD, turn to the standard nervines and nerve tonics. In the skin department, look to alteratives.

Very few studies have been conducted on herbal safety in children. Usage is based on traditional use, anecdotal reports, and a little research. Many plants that have been used safely over time have never been investigated. Dosage calculations are based on Clark’s rule that goes by weight, Young’s rule that goes by age, and Fried’s rule that is used for infants under 2 years old. Methods of administration include teas, baths, steams, and topical essential oils. Inventive compliance tips gained from trial and error were enumerated.

The heart sings and hums as its miraculous pump keeps us alive, circulating oxygen-rich blood to every cell and accepting it back for another round. The heart is accompanied by its transportation network: arterial and venous blood vessels and capillaries (cardiovascular). An herbalist’s task is to keep the system healthy. Lifestyle, diet, exercise, and spiritual and emotional health have a huge impact. Prevention is the best medicine and then come herbs, but if you’re not getting anywhere, refer the client to a good cardiologist and work together.

Esoterically, the heart is the fourth chakra, the place of healing and unconditional love. The best heart tonics are love, kindness, caring, and service. Mind-body connection is heart connected. The opposite of unconditional love is hatred, resentment, loneliness, and bitterness (the Heart’s taste in Chinese medicine). In the East, the Heart houses the shen or spirit. Mental, emotional, and spiritual conditions are affairs of the heart and, as such, are intertwined with its health. All you need is love is a truth.

Our cardiovascular Materia Medica covers the physical heart and blood vessels. Chapter 23 covers its shen aspects. A few herbal highlights are restorative Hawthorn berry used in the East, West, and Ayurvedic systems; the heart stimulant Lily of the Valley herb; the venous decongestant Horse Chestnut seed; Ginkgo leaf for microcirculation; and Salvia Dan Shen (Cinnabar Sage root) and Ligusticum Chuan Xiong (Sichuan Lovage root) used as multipurpose antilipemics, coronary restoratives, vasodilators, and anticoagulants.

## Maintaining Cardiovascular Health

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide.1 CAD refers to a full or partial blockage of one or more of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart. A waxy substance called plaque can build up inside the coronary arteries, creating atherosclerosis. Blockage deprives the heart muscle of oxygen that is critical for contraction. If attacked, the heart stops beating, and death results. All of the measures discussed are ultimately to prevent this from occurring, an honorable job and responsibility for any herbalist.

<!-- chunk -->

### Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Risk Factors

Multiple related factors cause CAD, some widely touted, some not so much. Common, well-accepted risks include smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, and family history. Under-the-radar aspects involve insulin and leptin resistance (Chapter 27), gluten sensitivity, dysbiosis, and diets high in saturated and trans fats.2 Insulin and leptin resistance and an abnormal waist-to-hip ratio are also predictors of CAD risk.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cholesterol and the Advanced Lipid Blood Panel

Cholesterol is a sterol made by the liver and found in most body tissues. It is not inherently bad, a myth that has been perpetrated by Big Pharma to sell more statin drugs, (e.g., Lipitor, Crestor, Mevacor), which have significant side effects and do not always work. Cholesterol is necessary and used by the body in manufacturing cell membranes, sex hormones, vitamin D, and for immune health. (Very low levels are unsafe and can indicate cancer, and a total cholesterol count is irrelevant, unless over 400.) When cholesterol oxidizes by contacting free radicals, toxins, and other inflammatory particles in the blood, it becomes dangerous. Once oxidized, cholesterol particles can damage the delicate endothelial lining of arteries and cause clogged arteries and coronary heart disease.4 That’s why a toxin-free, antiinflammatory diet is so important.

Box 22.1

The Advanced Lipid Analysis, Risk Factors, and Its Relationship to Statin Drug Effectiveness

The advanced, fractionated cholesterol blood panel is the best indicator of coronary artery disease and tells whether statin drugs can help the situation or make matters worse. Not all LDL particles are necessarily bad, and some HDL particles are not so good. Furthermore, high triglycerides are pretty bad across the board.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lifestyle Fix for Coronary Artery Disease

The factors in this list are all good measures for herbalists to suggest when devising a heart-healthy regime for prevention or when a cardiac event has occurred.4 Another is routine preparation and consumption of a heart-healthy tea (Box 22.2).

Box 22.2

## The Heart Chakra, Unconditional Love

Energetically and metaphysically, the heart is the fourth chakra, residing right behind the sternum (Fig. 22.1). It refers to unconditional love and healing. It is the middle chakra, number four out of seven. It is considered the bridge between the physical and the spiritual body, so it mediates body and spirit. As such, many issues related to love reside here. In its highest form, love is unconditional and pure, with an endless capacity to forgive and respond to prayer. This applies to self and to others. When heart chakra energy is low, we have feelings such as jealousy, bitterness, and anger and an inability to forgive ourselves and others.7

The heart’s challenge is to deal with loaded issues such as grief, anger, hatred, trust, loneliness, fear, jealousy, betrayal, and absence of commitment to relationships. Metaphysically, aspects of CAD, heart failure, heart attacks, breast and lung cancer, and upper back and shoulder problems are spiritually connected to heart.

Because the heart chakra is the place of unconditional love, it is where healing energy resides. When an herbalist heals from this center, no harm can ever be intentionally caused. This space holds no blame, no judgments, no opinions, and no prejudice. We may think we live here all the time, but what happens if a client pushes one of our buttons? These triggers could be philosophical; related to sexual orientation, addiction, race, money, or political views; related to how the client smells or dresses; or based on whether they instill fear. I have never met anyone (myself included) who is totally without baggage in this regard. If some thought or negative feeling gets in our way, and we cannot approach a client unconditionally, the ethical action is to refer the client out. The heart chakra will let you know.

## Cardiac Materia Medica

Many tried-and-true cardiac herbs overlap in multiple categories. They are the “must haves” in your cardiac apothecary. Pay attention to ones that are multipurpose and fit many situations. Some of these are Hawthorn berry, Ligusticum Chuan Xiong (Sichuan Lovage root), and Salvia Dan Shen (Cinnabar Sage root).

<!-- chunk -->

### Cardiac Herbs Worth Honorable Mention

This list includes very valuable herbs for use in cardiac formulations.

### Cardiac Restoratives

Some restoratives are general heart tonics; some work on arteries; others work on veins, and still others apply to capillaries. Use what’s appropriate, depending on condition.10

Table 22.1

Table 22.2

Table 22.3

Table 22.4

<!-- chunk -->

### Anticoagulants

Anticoagulants increase clotting time and decrease blood clots. By thinning the blood, they prevent bleeding and clotting in all the wrong places: coronary arteries, veins, microcirculation or capillaries, uterus, urine, and gut, wherever. A thrombus is a blood clot in the vascular system that blocks or impedes blood flow. A clot in the coronary arteries causes a heart attack; a clot in the vessels of the brain creates a stroke. To work with these issues, select herbs with the correct anticoagulant tropism. Ligusticum Chuan Xiong (Sichuan Lovage) root, Hawthorn berry, and Gingko leaf all lessen coronary clotting (Table 22.5). Witch Hazel leaf or White Oak bark help varicose veins (venous decongestants). Yellow Sweet Clover, Lady’s Mantle, and Shepherd’s Purse (Fig. 22.6) herbs help heavy menstrual clots with dysmenorrhea (obviously, this use is out of the coronary realm, but it illustrates the point).

Table 22.5

In Chapter 8, we discussed the coumarin controversy and the fact that certain herbs, such as the clovers and some grasses containing coumarins were not anticoagulants, particularly the legume plants of the Fabaceae/Pea family, such as Melilotus officinalis (Yellow Sweet Clover herb); however, when they were newly mowed in the fields they fermented (spoiled), changing their chemical structure into dicoumarol, which did in fact cause coagulation and bleeding in grazing animals.

However, another study published in 2017 found that fresh, unspoiled Yellow Sweet Clover herb does contain coumarin, and yes, it does have anticoagulant properties.11 So the takeaway is to be careful with these plants and assume that they may have anticoagulant properties after all. This is another example of how evolving research is constantly changing beliefs and information about our healing plants.

### Antilipemics

Antilipemics are herbs that lower cholesterol levels in the coronary arteries. As noted earlier, cholesterol is not necessarily bad. The body uses it to make hormones and vitamin D, and to aid digestion, protect nerves, and produce all cell membranes. Statin drugs happen to block liver enzymes responsible for making all kinds of cholesterol. They come with numerous nasty side effects: liver dysfunction, increased risk of diabetes, nerve damage, muscle weakness, and more. Wise herbalists use botanicals that raise HDL, rather than indiscriminately lowering any and all cholesterol.

Some of the best botanicals to reduce bad LDL and increase healthy HDL are our friends: Curcuma longa (Turmeric root), Cynara scolymus (Globe Artichoke), Crataegus spp. (Hawthorn berry), and high doses of the berberines. Garlic bulb capsules help blood quality, whereas Gotu kola herb manages unstable plaque. Green tea reduces cholesterol and triglycerides, increases HDL, and decreases platelet clumping (Table 22.6).2 Clumped blood cells lead to clots.

### Arterial Relaxants/Vasodilators

Arterial relaxants dilate or widen the systemic arteries (vasodilation) throughout the body and lower BP. When the tubes or vessels are dilated or when their size increases, the pressure in them drops, and more blood flows. Also, more oxygen will reach the cells, with more nutrients delivered and waste removed. Hence, this category is used for treating hypertension, enhancing oxygenation, and improving circulation flow when called for. Many arterial relaxants are also coronary vasodilators, which increase blood flow/oxygenation systemically and to the heart muscle directly. This improved flow helps prevent angina and heart attacks. Prunella vulgaris (Selfheal spike) (Fig. 22.7), Chrysanthemum Ju Hua (Chrysanthemum flower), Valerian root, Skullcap herb, and Lily of the Valley herb are examples. Be patient. They act over the long term, requiring a few months to make a difference. Notice that many of these are also nervine relaxers (Table 22.7).

### Hypertension

High BP is risky and should always be screened. Don’t take a client’s word for their BP level; take it yourself and know the parameters (Table 22.8). Herbalists should own a stethoscope and a regular adult and large size BP cuff. Hypertension increases chances of heart disease, leading to heart attacks, heart failure, stroke, kidney disease, eye damage, and foggy brain (e.g., dementias and Alzheimer’s). These are good reasons to check BP often and to obtain a baseline pressure. When Western medicine can offer no known cause and no symptoms are present, the disorder is called essential or primary hypertension (Case History 22.1). But high BP doesn’t just come out of nowhere. Look carefully and find the reason.

Table 22.8

Case History 22.1

Case History for Essential Hypertension

S. Alex is 49, just divorced, has a blood pressure (BP) reading of 172/95. He has palpitations and anxiety. Sometimes he gets dizzy. He is quick to anger. There are no arrhythmias and his ECG is normal. Has been unresponsive to meds prescribed by his healthcare provider. Maintains a junk food diet.

O. P Forceful, strong, rapid. T Red, thin yellow coat. BP 172/95. Pulse rate 93.

A. Liver Yang Rising with tinnitus and dizziness. Essential hypertension with nervous component.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Clear heat, sedate yang. (2) Vasodilators. (3) Nervous system relaxants. (4) Diuretics to remove excess fluids. (5) Cardiac restoratives. (6) Look for other causes and treat as indicated.


Red Flags. Refer out if you do not get results after 3 months, or if blood pressure (BP) is very high, for example, 180/120, or with confusion or other neurological symptoms, nosebleed, fatigue, blurred vision, chest pain, or abnormal heartbeat.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hyperlipidemia

Case History 22.2

Case History for Hyperlipidemia

S. Melissa is 35, has elevated LDLs, a high Lp(a). Reports her blood pressure (BP) is 150/90 and she frequents fast food places. Says she has a lot of bloating and burping. She is overweight, never exercises. Her father died of an myocardial infarction (MI) at 59 years old. She has a stressful, fast-paced job.

O. P Forceful, rapid. T Body red. Coat greasy and yellow. BP 155/92.

A. Damp heat. Elevated statin-resistant cholesterol, hypertension, probable dysbiosis and stress.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Antilipemics. (2) Antihypertensives. (3) Normalize gut flora with cool bitters. (4) Stress control. (5) Dry damp.


<!-- chunk -->

### Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)

Case History 22.3

Case History for Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)

S. Fred is 82. When he moved to Denver from New Jersey to be with his grandkids, he began having shortness of breath, and his ankles swelled up. He was diagnosed with CHF, begun on Digitalis. Now, 8 months later, he is stable and would like to begin herbal treatment. He is on the beta blocker Atenolol and a diuretic for hypertension. He is nervous.

O. P Weak. T Normal. BP 134/90 maintained with Atenolol and diuretic. Ankles become swollen when sitting.

A. Heart Qi Deficiency. Stable CHF.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Use arterial stimulant herbs that contain milder cardiac glycosides than the very toxic strong herb, Foxglove, from which Digitalis is derived. Cardiac glycosides increase the force of heart contractions and decrease heart rate, both needed in CHF. Lily of the Valley herb and/or Coleus root14 are the safest to use. (2) Diuretic herbs like Dandelion leaf/root or Goldenrod herb or Poria Fu Ling. (3) Restoratives like Hawthorn berry, Salvia Dan Shen. (4) Decrease stress with nervines.


Red Flag: For acute episodes with difficulty breathing, refer to a hospital emergency room. When stable, may be able to wean off meds with herbal intervention, as shown in earlier case history. Cooperation with the doctor is needed. Never administer Lily of the Valley concurrently with Digitalis. Client should be completely off the drug for about 4 days, before starting Lily of the Valley. If on Digitalis, drug levels should be drawn periodically.

<!-- chunk -->

### Angina Pectoris

Case History 22.4

Case History for Angina Pectoris

S. Marc has been getting chest pain whenever he runs or gets stressed. He was diagnosed with angina after a scare and a hospital stay. A myocardial infarction was ruled out. Cardiac catheterization showed beginnings of atherosclerosis. His blood pressure (BP) is elevated. He was sent home with a statin, two BP meds, and nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain. He had a cursory nutritional consult. He mainly eats in restaurants, and he smokes a pack a day.

O. P Choppy. T Purple spots. BP 180/90.

A. Heart Blood Stagnation. Angina pectoris, per healthcare provider. Hypertension.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. Remove stasis, get blood moving. (1) Arterial stimulants/restoratives. (2) Antihypertensives. (3) Antilipemics. (4) Nervine for stress.


<!-- chunk -->

### Myocardial Infarction (MI)

Case History 22.5

Case History for Post Myocardial Infarction (MI)

S. Joseph was rushed to the emergency room after experiencing stabbing chest pain at work. He was diagnosed with an MI and started on all the usual hospital meds and IVs. Now he is home and back to work. He is on Coumadin, a statin, an antihypertensive, diuretic, and antianxiety medications. One MI is enough. He is only 41 years old. Can he get on some herbs? His dietary and exercise habits are marginal.

O. P Tight, wiry. T Purplish.

A. Post MI. Heart Yang Deficiency. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, anxiety.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Cardiac restoratives like Ligusticum Chuan Xiong, Salvia Dan Shen, and Hawthorn berry. (2) Anticoagulant herbs in conjunction with coagulation labs: Ginkgo leaf, Salvia Dan Shen, Lily of the Valley herb. (3) Antihypertensives like Ligusticum Chuan Xiong or Coleus root. (4) Antilipemics such as Turmeric root or Artichoke leaf. (5) Stress control.


Red Flags For any chest pain, refer quickly to a hospital emergency room. Herbalists cannot legally adjust prescription meds, but client can be weaned down under a doctor’s supervision. Caution combining anticoagulant herbs if client is on Coumadin. Client will require an INR (blood clotting ratio) level drawn periodically to monitor and maintain therapeutic drug levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Varicose Veins

Case History 22.6

Case History for Varicose Veins

S. Mary Jo works at the checkout in a supermarket. Her veins around her medial knees are large, soft, bluish, and snakelike. They do not hurt.

O. P Wiry, weak on right under Spleen pulse. T Sublingual veins enlarged and purplish.

A. Venous Blood Stagnation. Spleen Qi weakness. Varicose veins.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Astringents to decrease vein diameter. (2) Restoratives to tone and strengthen connective tissue vessels. (3) Antiinflammatories to ease discomfort. (4) Bioflavonoids to strengthen vessel walls. (5) Increase circulation, stop stasis, move blood. (6) External lotion/compresses (Box 22.3).


Box 22.3

Varicose Vein Liniment

This easy liniment involves making a maceration of dried herbs and soaking them in store-bought distilled Witch Hazel extract.15 The astringency of the herbs and the tannins in the barks tighten the vessels. Calendula and Horse Chestnut contain flavonoids and saponins that stimulate venous circulation.9 The remedy addresses Chinese Venous Blood Stagnation.

Instructions. Place herbs in quart jar and cover them with Witch Hazel extract. Macerate for 4 weeks, strain and rebottle.

Administration. For compress, soak a small cloth in the liniment, wring out, and place over varicosities. Alternately, pour a little liniment into hand and gently rub over veins 3×day.


In addition to the traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors such as family history, hypertension, and smoking, we also considered insulin resistance and leptin resistance. A major dietary remedy for cardiac risk is to reduce dietary sugar and processed fructose.

From the Chinese Medicine perspective, the Heart reflects physical heart, vascular problems, and spiritual issues. Because the Heart houses the shen or spirit (emotional and psychological center), mental illness and emotional troubles are part of its domain. Some common physical cardiac syndromes include Heart Qi Deficiency (comparable to CHF), Heart Blood Stagnation (similar to angina), Heart Yang Deficiency (often seen as a heart attack), and Venous Blood Stagnation (varicose veins or sluggish peripheral blood flow).

The cardiac Materia Medica includes general restoratives and herbs with a unique affinity to veins, arteries, and capillaries. The fact that many single cardiac botanicals have multiple actions makes it very convenient and easy to use them for more than one purpose in formulas. Always refer a client with a cardiac emergency to a hospital. Case histories included are for the stable heart situations an herbalist is likely to encounter.

Vagus nerve

Physically, the nervous system (NS) is a specialized collection of cells called neurons. The central nervous system (CNS) consists of the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) consists of the peripheral nerves that branch out from the brain and cord to every cell. This miraculous communications network sends chemical messages (neurotransmitters) released at the end of nerve fibers in response to the arrival of an electrical nerve impulse. These messages travel place to place and cell to cell, telling us to take another breath, to keep the heart beating, and to contract smooth muscles without conscious thought.

The NS is also the ultimate seat of the mind-body connection, how our thoughts and emotions influence physical health. On the emotional and spiritual level, we transcend to a connectedness of physiological and psychological factors. Our thoughts, beliefs, and emotions affect physical health and vice versa. This powerful understanding allows us free will about our life and our health.

The Chinese intuited the mind-body connection long before modern science identified nerves. The Western concept of the nervous system actually encompasses all the Chinese Medicine organ systems. The joyful Heart is the place where the shen (spirit), psyche, and emotions reside. Excessive thoughts and worry belong to the Spleen. The physical brain is an extension of the bone marrow, which is the Kidney’s body part, and thus receives its nourishment. Even the Liver, associated with anger and unpredictable wind, has its own neurological syndromes.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Mind-Body Connection

The mind-body connection refers to how our thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and attitudes can positively or negatively affect our biological functioning. From a scientific standpoint, emotions are chemicals that can have desirable or harmful effects on health. The only way we can truly heal is by attending to deep-seated belief patterns and emotional and spiritual issues, along with physical body concerns. Among many who have famously explored and practiced these ideas are endocrinologist and holistic thinker Deepak Chopra, M.D.; the late inspirational teacher Louise Hay; medical intuitive Carolyn Myss; and holistic women’s health practitioner Christiane Northrop, M.D.

The nervous, endocrine, and immune systems share a common chemical language that allow constant communication between the mind and body through hormones and neurotransmitters.1 Psychoneuroimmunology is a growing field that studies and acknowledges the interaction between the brain, the nervous system, the immune system, and how they affect each other. We can literally laugh ourselves well or cry ourselves sick. As odd as that might seem, we frequently set ourselves up for physical dis-ease because of the biochemical effect suppressed emotions and undealt-with issues have on our immune and endocrine systems.2 Healing tools used for this nonphysical, emotional, and spiritual work include meditation, stress reduction, visualization, yoga, biofeedback, psychotherapy, medical intuitive work, and prayer. Herbalists are reminded to respect this holistic viewpoint and its healing potential when working out therapeutic strategies.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Sixth Chakra, the Intuitive

Energetically and metaphysically, the brain and nervous system are part of the sixth chakra (Fig. 23.1), located in the center of the forehead between the eyebrows. Also associated with this chakra are the eyes, ear, nose, and the sinuses. Those types of physical issues reside here.

The sixth chakra connects the mental to the emotional. It is esoterically known as the third eye, the place of intuitive sight and wisdom where we learn to distinguish between false truths, fear, and illusion (what we believe or wish to be true) versus the truth. False truths are a result of fears, personal experiences, and memories that can distort the facts. The intuitive center activates the link between mind and psyche that leads to wisdom. A mantra for the sixth chakra is “I see.” It helps us become conscious, to detach from subjective perceptions, and to see the truth and symbolic meanings in a situation, as painful as that might be.

The challenge is to look within and separate and detach from our fears, external counsel, and our shadow side, and to see clearly. Clarity of mind is the essence of wisdom.3

<!-- chunk -->

## The Gut-Brain Axis and Leaky Brain

The concept of the gut-brain axis explains the interaction between a healthy microbiome and mental and neurological health. The axis is a communication network that enables a bidirectional association between the brain and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.4 It refers to the physical connections (nerves) and the chemical connections (neurotransmitters) running between the two and how they affect health and emotions.

We have already discussed the implications of intestinal permeability or leaky gut (Chapter 18). When that exists there is also permeability in brain tissue, leaky brain, where cell junctions around the capillaries of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) become too large, allowing harmful bacteria and toxins to leak into the brain causing chronic inflammation. The technical name for leaky brain is the blood brain barrier hyperpermeability syndrome.

Inflammation caused from leaky brain can result in eating disorders and obesity, as well as disturbances in cognitive function, including intuitive decision making. Other neurological diseases can occur, such as dementia, autism, seizures, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis (MS); attention deficient disorder (ADD); and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. These problems would be a lot less likely if the gut was taken care of in the first place.

<!-- chunk -->

### Enteric Nervous System

When it comes to mental and neurological well-being, appreciate the fact that we have two brains and must treat both. The obvious one is the brain in the head. The other is the older, primitive brain embedded in the wall of the gut, called the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS is composed of two layers of gut tissue running from esophagus to anus. It’s a meshlike system of neurons that governs the function of the GI tract. The ENS sends out signaling neurotransmitters, just as brain neurons do.4

The ENS explains many things that have been long intuited regarding the mind-body-gut connections. It involves the field of neurogastroenterology, the study of the gut and brain, and their interaction as related to mental/neurological illnesses. We feel emotions on a gut level when we’re nervous. We can make ourselves sick when we are stressed. Do these emotions originate in the brain or the gut? We used to assume it was all in our head and that emotions began there.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vagus Nerve

The gut-brain communication pathway is a two-way street occurring via the neurotransmitters traveling from gut to brain and from brain to gut. These chemicals pass back and forth via the long wandering pair of the tenth cranial nerves, the vagus nerve. (There are really two, but they are usually referred to as a single nerve, the vagus.) The majority of neurotransmitters travel from the gut to the brain, not the reverse.4 Gut conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or Crohn’s disease originate in the gut but go up to the brain, leading to their connection to mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression. However, nervous butterflies originate in the brain’s autonomic sympathetic nervous system (SNS), the fight-or-flight area, and travel down to the gut, causing us to have nausea and diarrhea and run to the bathroom because we’re so stressed out.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurotransmitters

Many gut-produced neurotransmitters are of the same class as those produced in the brain: dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, norepinephrine, and nitric oxide. For instance, dopamine is considered a feel-good neurotransmitter, and serotonin prevents depression, regulates sleep, appetite, and body temperature. Implications of this chemical communication show how emotions, mental illness, and gut health are microbiome, gut-related phenomena. Microbiome integrity influences the type of brain neurotransmitters produced. The takeaway for mental illness is to always treat the gut.

## Maintaining a Healthy Brain and Nervous System

<!-- chunk -->

## Chinese Medicine Perspective: The Nervous System and Major Syndromes

The Kidneys are an extension of the marrow (correspondences) and enter into the neuro picture because they nourish the brain, spinal cord, and cerebral spinal fluid. However, Chinese Medicine does not recognize a nervous system per se. No single Chinese organ system is responsible for the care, maintenance, and functioning of what is called the nervous system in the West. There is no neat translation. After all, if you think about it, the Western nervous system travels all over the body to every cell, tissue, gland, and organ. Each case needs to be treated individually. This list describes how emotional and mental problems are related to the Chinese Heart, Spleen, or Liver.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nervous System Excesses and Deficiencies Related to the Kidneys

In Chinese Medicine, nervous system deficiencies and excesses are sometimes related to the Kidneys. They may represent deficiencies, the overall “blahs,” such as exhaustion, depression, despair, lack of initiative, or apathy, brain depletion, poor memory (senior moments), absentmindedness, and emptiness. Or they may relate to excess conditions such as stress, anxiety, being riled up and hyper, manic behaviors, bipolar symptoms, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nervous System Materia Medica

Nervine is a general catch-all Western term for any herb that affects the nervous system, whether restoratives, uppers, or downers. Nervines can either warm things up or relax and cool things down. The term is not much help when you are trying to be specific. It is best to use designations like nervous system restoratives, relaxants, or stimulants, because they are much more descriptive. Within those categories, further breakdown is made, depending on where you look and who you read. As usual, many nervous system herbs fit into more than one category.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neuro Herbs Worth Honorable Mention

<!-- chunk -->

### Nutritive Restoratives and Antidepressants

Nervous system nutritive restoratives treat deficiencies like mental fog, decreased concentration, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s. Mental depression is a deficient condition, and deficiencies need to be strengthened, nourished, and restored. Basil leaf, Ginkgo leaf, Rosemary leaf, Garden Sage leaf (adrenal tonic), Skullcap herb, Thyme leaf, and Polygonum He Shou Wu (Flowery Knotweed root) all achieve this action. Included under restoratives are the highly nourishing nervous system superfoods, such as Flower pollen, Milky Oat tops, microalgae, green tea, and shitake mushrooms, all important when taken as food and/or a supplement (Tables 23.1 and 23.2).

### Trophorestoratives and Adaptogens

Major trophorestoratives and/or adaptogens have a specific affinity for the neuroendocrine/HPA axis, so their influence is widely spread and goes deep by protecting cells from oxidative stress, decreasing damage from stressors, helping mental fatigue, enhancing learning and memory, and relieving emotional disorders.8 These herbs tonify qi, blood, and essence, and are used to treat weak or deficient conditions, such as depression or fatigue, that have gone on for long periods of time. Trophorestoratives also balance hormonal secretions and enhance the immune system (Table 23.3).

Patience is needed to see their effects. They are subtle, important, and precious. The trophorestoratives are safe but effective and should be used with chronic, longstanding conditions, especially when anxiety is pronounced.8 They are long-term tonics, our super friends and relations: Panax Xi Yang Shen (American ginseng root), Schisandra Wu Wei Zi (Five Taste berry), Eleuthero Ci Wu Jia (Eleuthero/Siberian ginseng root), and Ashwagandha root. Rhodiola root is an adaptogen that has a marked and fast-acting antidepressant action (Fig. 23.7).

### Nervous System Relaxants

Nervous system relaxants are a large group with many overlapping actions and body system tropisms. Some are general relaxants for any body system, and others have affinities to particular ones (Table 23.4).

Most nervines are quite general and have multiple functions and subclasses. Relaxing nervines can help with anxiety and irritability (anxiolytics), calm smooth-muscle spasms (spasmolytics or antispasmodics), help with sleep (hypnotics), relieve pain (analgesics), and reduce seizures (anticonvulsants). Representatives from various nervous system relaxant subclasses include the analgesics: Jamaican Dogwood root bark, Bupleurum Chai Hu, Kava root, Corydalis Yan Hu Suo (Corydalis corm), and Skullcap herb (nerve pain). Some spasmolytics are Black Cohosh root and Skullcap herb. Anticonvulsants, which treat internal wind, include Lobelia herb, Jamaican Dogwood root, Valerian root, Uncaria Gou Teng (Gambir Vine twig), Gastrodia Tian Ma (Celestial Hemp corm), and Passionflower and Hops flower (Table 23.5).

Table 23.5


Valerian officinalis


Could have paradoxical (opposite) results than intended. Use with deficiencies (cool) conditions only, not with excess (heat). The fresh root (versus the dried root) is less likely to have this effect.


Lemon Balm leaf

Melilotus officinalis

Lobelia root and herb

Gastrodia Tian Ma

Celestial Hemp corm

Uncaria macrophylla Gou Teng

Gambir Vine twig


Energetically, nervous system relaxants are cooling and both bitter and sweet, or a combination of the two tastes (bittersweet). The person could have fatigue, nervous tension, depression, vague feelings of anxiety, poor sleep, feelings of being generally stressed-out even if they don’t know why, and vague aches and pains.13 These herbs work well in combination. Some of the most popular are St. John’s Wort, Chamomile flower, Lavender flower, Passionflower herb, Lemon Balm leaf, and Wild Lettuce leaf. Heart Blood Deficiency and Heart Yin Deficiency go here. Most of these also double as cardiac relaxants.

Hypnotics are herbs that cause drowsiness, depress the CNS, and inhibit motor function. They induce a healing state of sleep. They are not related to hypnotism or the sedative-hypnotic classification of Western drugs. Examples of herbal hypnotics are Kava root, Passionflower herb, Wild Lettuce leaf, Jamaican Dogwood root bark, and Valerian root.

There are also nervous system relaxants for over-the-top hyper situations that treat excess with heat and that are cooling, relaxing. and sedating. They are for anxiety disorders, agitation, seizures, and hyperactivity, all states that warrant calming down and cooling. The person is stressed, anxious, sleepless, overworked, or in chronic physical and emotional stress. How many of these folks do you know? Herbs include Wild Lettuce leaf, Melilot herb, and Hops flower.

Relaxing nervines come in varying strengths. Here is a subjective synopsis of their relative potencies (Table 23.5):10

### Nervous System Analgesics and Pain

Pain is a demanding problem. Back pain is one of the top reasons people initially seek allopathic help. Herbal analgesics tend to work with mild to moderate pain, especially if the pain is linked to inflammation or visceral or vascular spasm (Table 23.6). If pain is very severe, then unfortunately, strong prescription pharmaceuticals are best for the job, including the synthetic opioids derived from the latex of the Opium Poppy, and the alkaloid, cocaine, derived from Coca leaf. These drugs give relief but are highly addictive and must be discontinued (the sooner, the better). There is an opioid crisis in the United States. Various cultivars of Cannabis spp. have been successfully used medically (where legal) for pain relief, muscle spasms, seizures, and insomnia, when accompanied by a healthcare provider’s prescription and purchased at specially licensed venues. Another controversial herb, also for pain and opioid withdrawal, is Mitragyna speciosa (Kratom leaf), which is in limbo regarding U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.

Traditionally, weaker botanicals are most often used in clinical herbalism. Tried-and-true allies are the salicylate sources from Willow bark, Birch bark, Aspen bark, and Meadowsweet herb; and some mild nonaddictive plants from the Poppy family, such as California Poppy herb and Corydalis Yan Hu Suo (Corydalis corm). Westerners use Jamaican Dogwood bark or Valerian root. As always, when treating pain, its cause needs to be addressed to adequately approach the problem. Chinese Medicine is especially skilled at this (Chapter 24).

### Nervous System Stimulants

Stimulants get us going, create movement, and warm us up (Table 23.7). Some contain caffeine, and some don’t. Stimulants treat depression and deficiency and often pair as nerve restoratives; examples are Panax Xi Yang Shen (American ginseng root) or Ginkgo leaf. Stimulants that give the mind focus and help us pay attention include Rosemary leaf, Basil leaf, Skullcap herb, Garden Sage leaf, Ginkgo leaf, and Polygonum He Shu Wu (Flowery Knotweed root).

But nervous stimulants are not all one way, and these plants have their benefits. Newer research credits coffee with helping in the treatment of chronic diseases, including cancer, metabolic syndrome, heart disease, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s.12 Green tea is filled with healthy antioxidants.

Box 23.2

Type of Headache Pain

Related to Chinese Medicine Syndromes

In Chinese Medicine a description of the type or kind of pain a person experiences can give clues as to which syndrome is involved. A good history and careful questioning are in order. A lot of headaches imply heat to the head (yang), so bringing heat down to the feet with a hot footbath and a cool head cloth is one hydrotherapy approach.

Box 23.3

Location of Headaches in Chinese Medicine

In Chinese Medicine, there are perhaps 10 types of headaches. They frequently apply to location: Where on the head or face does it hurt, and which meridian passes through that area? Pain along a meridian indicates a blockage of qi. For instance, pain along the sides (temples) or top (vertex) of the head is related to Liver and Gallbladder. Pain in the front of the face is caused from a blockage of qi in the stomach and large intestine.

### Neurological Autoimmune (AI) Diseases

Case History 23.6

Case History for Parkinson’s

S. Lacy is 52 years old. It began with a right-hand tremor. Then developed stiff gait, slow movement, worsening balance. Neurologist gave a diagnosis of Parkinson’s.

O. P Thin. T Pale, quivering and dry.

A. Parkinson’s, an autoimmune disease caused by decreased dopamine. Liver yin has become weak, causing tremors or wind.16

P. Specific therapeutic principles. Cause is from decrease of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is converted from the amino acid l-dopa. (1) Replace dopamine with Macuna pruriens (Velvet bean). This herb is proven to contain l-dopa. The drug, Levodopa (or l-dopa) is the precursor to dopamine, and a class of medications that is the Western gold standard treatment for Parkinson’s.17 (2) Nourish the nervous system, kidney yin, and liver. (3) Sedate internal wind and tremors. (4) Nervous system restoratives. (5) Adaptogens.


Many of these factors listed are best identified with functional medicine testing, but basics can be addressed with good assessment and herbs. Autoimmune diseases are a challenge and take a long time to reverse.


The nervous system was investigated on the physical level and as an aspect of the mind-body and gut-brain connection. The nervous system is a communications network sending chemical messages in the form of neurotransmitters throughout the body. Emotionally and spiritually, our thoughts, beliefs, and emotions affect our physical health. When leaky gut is present, so too is leaky brain, both factors adversely affecting neurological health.

In Chinese Medicine, the mind-body connection affects every organ system. The spirit, psyche, and emotions reside in the Heart. Thoughts and worry are Spleen functions. The brain is an extension of the bone marrow, the Kidney’s body part. The Liver is concerned with wind, a manifestation of abnormal movement, shakes, and spasms.

Nervines are a general catch-all Western term for any herb that addresses the nervous system. The nervous system Materia Medica includes restoratives, trophorestoratives, adaptogens, stimulants, spasmolytics, hypnotics, analgesics, and anticonvulsants.

Of particular relevance today are the numerous autoimmune diseases. Our example in the neurobiology realm is Parkinson’s. However, the basic treatments presented are the same for any autoimmune condition in any body system. Heal thy gut.

Humans have always contended with muscle aches, bone pain, and structural injuries. Egyptian mummies and ancient skeletal remains have been unearthed showing signs of degenerative discs and arthritis. Bones and muscles give us our form, support our weight, allow us to move, and hold us together; they get plenty of wear, tear, and abuse. Joint disorders and back problems are primary reasons people visit their doctor, because the first thing bringing them to a healthcare provider’s door is pain.

Pain, inflammation, and analgesia are primary topics, and alleviating discomfort with nonaddictive herbs is a worthwhile skill for any herbalist. The endocannabinoid system and its role in pain relief is explained. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are explained, and their dangerous side effects are an important concept. External and internal herbal applications are explored in depth.

<!-- chunk -->

## Overview of the Muscular-Skeletal System

The muscular-skeletal (M-S) system is made up of various forms of fibrous connective tissue: muscles, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, fascia, and bone. Connective tissue binds and supports, and it ranges in density from liquid (blood) to bone, the hardest tissue in the body. Muscles contract and relax, move joints, pump blood, and support vessels and hollow organs. Bone supports the body and give it shape and structure. Tendons connect and bind muscles to bones. Ligaments connect one bone to another. Cartilage is flexible tissue found on the articulating surfaces of joints. Fascia comprise thin fibrous sheets that enclose and separate muscles and organs like a stocking and winds continuously throughout the body.

The internal environment and health have a lot to do with the state of our muscles and bones. Pain, of course, is a chief concern and must always be addressed. But pain is a symptom, a sign that something is wrong. We must always find the cause of injury and promote healing. Along with providing antiinflammatory herbs and analgesia, herbalists heal from the inside out, because systemic factors play a huge role in chronic muscular-skeletal degenerative diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and fibromyalgia have autoimmune causes.

Diuretics, alteratives, digestive aids, liver restoratives, and stimulants are often key therapeutic herbal categories because of the systemic nature of chronic M-S problems. Fixing leaky gut and dysbiosis is paramount because they contribute to chronic inflammation. Circulation and elimination must be improved. Lifestyle, exercise, and hydration are factors, as are the manual therapies and structural analysis. The M-S system must be looked at holistically. As Chinese Medicine has always understood, we must treat the root along with the branch.

## Pain, Inflammation, and Analgesia

Pain and its sidekick, inflammation, take first priority when treating muscular and skeletal injury. These symptoms are present in muscle strain; joint, back, knee, and neck pain; arthritis; and nerve compression in sciatica and repetitive stress injuries like carpel tunnel. Bodywork of all types help immensely—massage, myofascial release, reflexology, chiropractic and osteopathic adjustments. Internal and external herbals are important accompaniments.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inflammation

Inflammation is a localized physical condition in which part of the body becomes reddened, swollen, hot, and painful, especially as a reaction to injury or infection. Back strains, shoulder pulls, and knee twists all become inflamed. This inflammation can happen externally to all types of M-S tissue: muscles (myositis), joints (arthritis), bursa (bursitis), fascia (fasciitis), and internally to bones (osteomyelitis). Inflammation is a defense mechanism that attempts to localize and eradicate the irritant and repair the surrounding tissue. Without inflammation, wounds would never heal.

We have discussed pathological, chronic internal inflammation (Chapter 16) as a contributor to many diseases, such as irritable bowel disease (IBD) and heart disease, but here we are concerned with M-S inflammation, sometimes acute, as from immediate injury from sprains and strains, and sometimes chronic, as with arthritis or persistent lower back pain. Acute injury treatment focuses on cooling off and bringing down this hot condition. Chronic injuries will need some warming up. In all cases, pain relief and antiinflammatory measures come first, although other important systemic measures are part of the herbal solution.

### Pain, Inflammation, and External Applications

Box 24.1

External Chinese Patent Pain Remedies

Patent pain remedies are available at Chinese pharmacies, and some are now even sold in health food stores and regular supermarkets. They are very handy to use on clients or to suggest for purchase.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the most commonly used painkillers on the market, are the mainstays to treat M-S pain, but they are also riddled with nasty side effects. Many are available OTC without a prescription. Just walk into your corner drugstore and pick from countless products lining an entire aisle. They stop pain and inflammation by blocking cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes, which in turn inhibit production of prostaglandins, part of the inflammatory cascade. They are also prescribed by doctors, just in higher doses.

NSAIDs include aspirin compounds, such as Bayer and Bufferin; ibuprofen compounds, such as Motrin and Advil; and naproxen sodium compounds, such as Aleve. NSAIDs are antiinflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic (reduce fevers). NSAIDs are commonly used for back and muscle pain, injuries, dental pain, PMS, and all types of inflammation, including arthritis, tendonitis, and bursitis. Tylenol is not an NSAID; it comes from the compound acetaminophen that stops pain and lowers fever but does nothing for inflammation.

The problem with NSAIDs is that, yes, they help pain and inflammation temporarily, but chronic use causes high risk for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, ulcers, internal bleeding, heart disease, and kidney failure. Reye’s syndrome has occurred in children as a result of being treated with aspirin. People pop NSAIDs like candy, but eventually it has a rebound effect and doesn’t work as well as it did initially.1 Taking more and more accomplishes less and less. Herbalists can do better by making their own healing oils and liniments (Box 24.2).

Box 24.2

Sports Massage Oil

This blend is nice to have on hand for muscle aches and pains and for use as an alternative to NSAIDs. This preparation calls for the quick, accelerated version of making an herbal oil. Start with dry herbs, put them in a blender with an olive oil carrier, and afterward add a few drops of essential oils.


Blend herbs by weight. Moisten with 95% alcohol. Let stand 20 minutes to 1 hour to break down cell walls. Put herbs in blender. Cover with olive oil. Blend on high until mixture becomes warm. Strain. Add essential oils. Rub onto sore muscles as needed.

## Cannabis and the Endocannabinoid System

It has long been claimed that Cannabis spp. (Marijuana bud) helps relieve pain (Fig. 24.1). The proof is now in. It happens via the endocannabinoid (ECB) system, named after Cannabis sativa, the plant leading to its discovery. The ECB system is a biochemical signaling system that helps maintain normal cerebral and physiological functions.2 This neurotransmitter system communicates between the central nervous system, the immune system, and connective tissue (including bones, muscles, fascia, and tendons), and it regulates pain, damage, and inflammation caused by injury. It also controls mood, appetite, and cellular life and death cycles. It does this via chemical neurotransmitters that are produced in the fat cells of all mammals.

Endocannabinoids naturally produced in the body hook on to various nervous system receptor sites, such as CB1 and CB2, among others. In the case of pain, they send messages that act as a dimmer switch to prevent excessive nerve-firing by other neurotransmitters. The result is turned-down pain signals. Endocannabinoids prevent the release of proinflammatory substances (histamine, kinins, leukotrienes, prostaglandins) and are thus, antiinflammatory. Pain and damage caused by injury is minimized.3

This bridge between the body’s organs and the nervous system, as seen in the ECB system, is a classic example of the mind-body connection. When a postsynaptic neuron is activated, cannabinoids released from the nerve cell travel backward, attaching to the cannabinoid receptors on the presynaptic neuron. The pain response is decreased by limiting the amount of neurotransmitter being released. Some research suggests that deficiencies in the ECB system are found in conditions associated with pain and inflammation in fibromyalgia, migraines, and irritable bowel disease. This deficiency could be helped or alleviated with medical cannabis2 and other plants, because the ECB system controls inflammatory complications, energy balance, intestinal permeability, immunity, and development of obesity.

The first external substance discovered to supply ECB neurotransmitter chemicals was CBD (cannabidiol) in Cannabis sativa, hence the name cannabinoid. The CBD portion of cannabis is not psychoactive or intoxicating, but the THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) portion is psychoactive. Medically used cannabis is an extract that has varying ratios of CBD to THC. Cannabis plants (Fig. 24.2) can be cultivated or cloned to be high in one active ingredient or another. Improved strains that are specific for different conditions are constantly being developed. In fact, THC and CBD are a tiny fraction of 120 or so chemicals and alkaloids present in the herb. As we know, plant synergy has a lot to do with actions and safety.

Phytocannabinoids are plant substances that stimulate and attach to various cannabinoid receptor sites in humans (Fig. 24.3). Theobroma cacao (Dark Chocolate), Echinacea spp., Humulus spp. (Hops strobiles), Helichrysum italicum essential oil, Piper nigrum (Black Peppercorn), Ruta graveolens (Rue herb), and even broccoli are all phytocannabinoids. Cannabis sativa is obviously another. More phytocannabinoids are being identified. Peppercorns and helichrysum have historically been included in pain formulas. Now we know another reason why.

There are records of cannabis being used with great medicinal success 4000 years ago in Mesopotamia and in ancient India, Egypt, Persia, and China. Unlike opioids, cannabis is not physiologically addictive. The chief temporary side effects are dizziness, dry mouth, increased appetite, and drowsiness. Unfortunately, its legal status in the United States as of 2019 remains in limbo. Well into the 20th century, cannabis was included in the U.S. Pharmacopeia. It was removed from it in 1942. Presently in the United States, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) classifies it as a Schedule I controlled substance, meaning it has a “high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use.”2 This statement is untrue and merely a matter of political debate.

Hemp is the fiber of the cannabis plant that comes from the stem and is traditionally used to make rope, stout fabrics, fiberboard, and paper. It happens to be high in CBD and low in THC. The cannabis bud, on the other hand is higher in THC. Hemp is used as a source of CBD oil. Hemp’s legal status as a cash crop in the United States is in flux, as is that of the bud.

Cannabis has been legalized in many states in both recreational and medical capacities and is now used for pain relief, in calming of muscle spasms, in treating asthma, for control of nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy, in cancer treatment, as a sleep aid, in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and for childhood and adult epilepsy, where antiseizure drugs have all but failed. There is hope for future federal legalization, and the only thing that can be depended on is change. Cannabis is another of our herbal allies. Stay tuned.

## The Overrated Alkaline Diet pH Test

This diet is a regimen that has been embraced by herbalists and naturopaths since the 1920s and is frequently used in arthritis cures. The problem is that one of its goals is for the client to produce alkaline urine as proof it is working, which is a very hard thing to do. The diet is still popular today, so herbalists need to know of it. Urine pH kits and strips can be purchased at health food stores, so pH can be monitored.

An alkaline diet is a cleansing and detoxifying regimen that is rich in fresh fruits and vegetables and low in proteins and processed foods. Any diet that accomplishes this goal reduces inflammation and oxidative stress and will improve arthritis symptoms. So far, so good. The body is always making and eliminating acids in the form of acid metabolites and products of digestion. Arthritic joint problems are a classic outcome of a failure to do this.4

Alkaline foods are rich in calcium, potassium, and sodium. When they are digested, they leave an alkaline residue. Examples are fresh fruits and veggies of a rainbow-colored diet. Alkalinity cuts down on inflammation. Acid foods do the opposite. When acids are digested in the body, they leave an acidic residue. Acidic foods consist of coffee, tea, grains, processed foods, and proteins that are high in sulfur (meat, eggs, and cheese). An overly acidic diet contributes to inflammation, oxidative stress, leaky gut, and dysbiosis, all the factors leading to chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases.4

The kidneys and lungs are responsible for maintaining acid-base (pH) balance and normally do an excellent job of keeping the urine slightly acid. Average urine pH is an acidic 6 (Seven is neutral and over seven is alkaline) (Chapter 26). One way to make urine a little less acid for a while is to eat prodigious amounts of fruits and vegetables. Consuming acidic foods (and other factors like dehydration, diarrhea, diabetes, and respiratory problems) will all swing the urine pH in the acid direction. When concentrating on detoxification, many practitioners and their clients become quite obsessive about creating alkaline urine by following an incredibly strict diet. They monitor urine with pH test strips in hope of moving the scale in an alkaline direction. This goal is exceedingly difficult to accomplish and could drive anyone nuts, creating unnecessary stress.

Clinical pearl: If acute arthritis with inadequate detoxification is a factor, a strict alkaline regime (without pH testing) can be healing for a limited time. A one- or two-day veggie juice fast wouldn’t hurt, but when acute arthritis symptoms calm down and become chronic, it is far better to eat a well-balanced diet that includes moderate protein. Follow a Mediterranean or Paleo diet and all should be well.

## Chinese Medicine Perspective: The Muscular-Skeletal System and Major Syndromes

<!-- chunk -->

### General Principles

<!-- chunk -->

### Syndromes

<!-- chunk -->

## Muscular-Skeletal Materia Medica

Main categories are muscular-sketetal restoratives, stimulants, relaxants, and/or sedatives. Additional sections have been included for analgesics, spasmolytics, and topical applications. These designations should facilitate success when searching for herbs to include in a formula. Within each main category are various subcategories that encompass Western descriptive terms.

<!-- chunk -->

## Muscular-Skeletal Herbs Worth Honorable Mention

<!-- chunk -->

## Muscular-Skeletal Restoratives

M-S connective tissue restoratives and tonics tend to be warming and dry and contain alkaloids, glycosides, essential oils, and organic acids (Table 24.1).7 They are indicated for cold, long-standing chronic M-S issues where the tissue has deteriorated over time. Restoratives are also used in acute trauma with tissue damage to sinews, muscle, or bone. Arthritis erodes and wears down cartilage in knees, shoulders, and hip joints, and intervertebral discs degenerate. Sprains are a stretching or tearing of a ligament. Strains are when muscles or their tendons are pulled or overstretched. Fractures are broken bones. All of these situations call for reparative restoratives. The Chinese refer to problems of worn-out and damaged tissue as Liver and Kidney depletion, because Liver rules the sinews and Kidney rules the bones.

Table 24.1

Eucommia ulmoides Du Zhong


Eleutherococcus senticosus Ci Wu Jia

Eleuthero root, Siberian Ginseng


Symphytum officinalis


Walnut hull and leaf

Vaccinium myrtillus

Bilberry berry


Many restorative herbs double as detoxicants. This dual action is convenient because detoxification is an important therapeutic principle in tissue repair when toxins have formed because of the inflammatory process caused by lactic acid buildup that happens in muscle overuse, in tissue breakdown, or from underlying metabolic toxicosis. Many restoratives happen to have a diuretic and alterative action also. Alteratives help the body eliminate waste, and diuretics are needed to flush out those wastes through the kidneys. It’s always lovely and elegant to use one herb for multiple purposes.

### Warming Arterial Stimulants

These are the ones for cold, chronic situations, Wind Damp Cold Obstruction (Table 24.2). They are warm, bitter, and pungent. Some are diaphoretic, relieve external wind, and are often used in respiratory infections. These qualities also make them analgesic, antiinflammatory, muscle relaxing, and/or spasmolytic.7 Arterial stimulation is needed to move qi and blood, increase circulation and warm up the area, and thereby relieve chronic muscle pain, radiating nerve pain (neuralgia), and bruising (contusions). Bruises form when blunt force causes capillaries under the skin to tear and bleed, leaving a discoloration under the skin.

Indications for blood-moving arterial stimulants are limited range of motion; painful joints and muscles; bruising; and chronic versions of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, tendonitis, bursitis, torticollis (stiff neck), and carpal tunnel syndrome (myalgia, muscle pain, in this case caused by nerve compression).

Herbs appropriate to use as warming arterial stimulants include Ledebouriella Fang Feng (Wind Protector root), Cassia Gui Zhi (Cinnamon twig), Juniper berry, and Prickly Ash bark. In the Western tradition, warming arterial stimulants appear in descriptive categories such as antiarthritics or muscle relaxants, useful in cold M-S ailments.

<!-- chunk -->

### Relaxants

The relaxants and/or sedatives are frequently cooling herbs that treat acute, hot painful, inflammatory conditions (Table 24.3). Acute situations include flare-ups of rheumatoid or osteoarthritis, gout, tendinitis, bursitis, osteomyelitis, and lupus. The Chinese syndrome is Wind Damp Heat Obstruction/Bi. Energetically, M-S relaxers are bitter, pungent, and cool.

In Western descriptive terms, relaxants fall into various categories. Just about all of them are analgesic and antiinflammatory, such as Jamaican Dogwood root bark, Wild Yam root, and Celery seed. Some are quite cold antipyretics, like Wormwood herb, or Gentiana Qin Jiao (Gentian root). Others are antispasmodics, such as Valerian root and Black Cohosh root. Most of these herbs fall into many of these relaxant or sedative categories. For this reason, it is just as easy to call them all relaxants.

### Analgesics

Analgesics relieve the symptom of pain (Table 24.4). The only way to truly relieve pain (and not just mask it) is to fix the underlying problem. However, all self-respecting herbalists should have a good internal formula (Box 24.3) and external pain remedy (Box 24.4) ready to recommend. Some analgesics are warm, and some are cold. Select appropriately. Some herbs, like Celery seed, have an alterative and diuretic action that creates analgesia by eliminating excess fluids that cause painful swelling, tissue compression, and edema. Boswellia serrata (Frankincense resin) is particularly indicated to relieve pain and inflammation, whereas another species, B. carterii Ru Xiang, is an important Chinese Medicine wound healer/vulnerary/antihemorrhagic used in first-aid formulas and for analgesia in rheumatic pain or Wind Damp Obstruction.7

Frankincense and Myrrh Pain Balls

Most types of pain are caused by qi and blood stagnation, so remedies involve herbs that move qi and blood. There are countless excellent internal and external pain combinations in the literature. These balls are an example, best used for chronic pain. Frankincense and Myrrh resins are pain-relieving classics.

Pain Balls


Directions. Grind equal parts of these herbs. Mix with warm honey and roll them into little balls (that contain 6–9 g of the mixture).

Dose. Take 1 pill 2×day with a little water.

Dit Da Jow Liniment

Dit Da Jow, Hit Liniment

There are numerous versions of Chinese hit liniments out there, called “hit” because they are traditionally used in martial arts training to ease the many strains, sprains, bangs, and bruises that so often occur. Many of these blends are secret and remain so in their martial arts lineages. This blend is public and does all the right things. It moves qi and blood, is analgesic, antiinflammatory, and antimicrobial; it also repairs tissue and resolves bruises. Ideal for the acute traumas of everyday life.

Ingredients. Equal parts 1:8 40%

Panax notoginseng San Qi

Pseudoginseng root

Hyssopus officinalis (Hyssop herb)

Cinnamomum cassia Rou Gui


Commiphora myrrha Mo Yao


Calendula officinalis (Marigold flower)

Capsicum annuum (Cayenne pepper)

Zanthoxylum americanum

Prickly Ash bark


Directions. For sprains, strains, bruises, arthritis, muscle pain, and inflammation.

External use. Not for open sores. Rub briskly onto affected part 3 to 4× daily—or every ½–1 hour as needed for acute pain. If a joint is injured, apply liniment entirely around it, not just where it hurts.

Internal use. ½–1 tsp in a little water 3×daily. Or pulse dose, 3–5 mL every ½–1 hour, only for a few hours, as needed for acute pain.

When dosing symptomatically for acute pain, the only way to get results with the nonaddictive mild- to medium-strength herbs used in this text is to employ frequent pulse dosing at 3 to 5 mL every ½ to 1 hour (Appendix A). An acute pain formula might contain an analgesic or two for the chief herb, an antiinflammatory, a vulnerary, a spasmolytic, and herbs to move qi and blood. Dit da Jow liniment (Box 24.4) is a good example. Pulse dosing does not apply to prevention formulas or to those meant to build and strengthen connective tissue. which would be given on a schedule of 3 times per day.

Salicylates are a group of phenols contained naturally in some plants (Chapter 8). These compounds include salicin (which does not demonstrate the antiplatelet effect seen with aspirin), methyl salicylate, and salicylic acid. Salicylate-rich herbs have been used with good results for pain and inflammation, particularly in arthritis.

The plants contain varying amounts of salicylates, are slower acting than aspirin, but work for mild to moderate pain. Salicylate botanicals include the inner barks of many trees, such as White Willow, Cottonwood, Birch, Aspen, Black Haw, and Cramp bark (these last two are typically used for menstrual cramps).9 Others are Wintergreen, Pipsissewa, Meadowsweet herb (Figs. 24.6 and 24.7), and Poplar leaf buds (Balm of Gilead). All are antiinflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic, and antiseptic.

The active chemical in aspirin is acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). This chemical has an extra acetyl group that gives it blood-thinning properties.10 Aspirin famously irritates the stomach and can cause bleeding ulcers because of this antiplatelet activity. Fortunately for the herbalist, salicylate-containing plants differ chemically and do not have this acetyl group, so they do not have this danger. Enteric-coated aspirin is used therapeutically by cardiologists as a preventative blood thinner. It is coated to prevent it dissolving in the stomach, which allows it to bypass intact to the small intestine and prevent gastric irritation.

Phytosterols, meaning plant sterols (Chapter 8), are antiinflammatory saponins, a group of chemicals occurring naturally in some botanicals. Phytosterols have various actions. In the muscular-skeletal realm, phytosterols act as saponin steroids that bring down inflammation. (Steroids are used in Western medicine for their antiinflammatory actions.) Some important antiinflammatory phytosterols used for the Bi syndromes of arthritis are Wild Yam root, Bupleurum Chai Hu (Asian Buplever root), and Jamaican Sarsaparilla root.10

Other plant sterols, such as Saw Palmetto berry and Pygeum bark, contribute to sexual and hormonal balance. Some act as adaptogens, such as the ginsengs and Licorice root. Some lower cholesterol, and Horse chestnut seed and Rehmannia Shu Di Huang (prepared Rehmannia root) are useful sterol-containing adrenal tonics and antiinflammatories used for autoimmune diseases.

### Spasmolytics

One way to remove pain is to ease muscle spasms using spasmolytic herbs (Table 24.5). A muscle spasm is an abnormal, involuntary contraction of a skeletal muscle that can cause a great deal of pain. There are three types of muscle tissue: striated, smooth, and cardiac. Striated muscles are the skeletal muscles under voluntary control. Smooth muscles are involuntary and outside of conscious control (except with conscious practice), and they reside inside organs and blood vessel linings. Cardiac muscle is specialized involuntary heart muscle with its own conduction system and has a different set of relaxing herbals (Chapter 22).

Most spasmolytics (antispasmodics or muscle relaxants) affect both smooth and striated muscles. However, they may have tropisms to a specific area. For instance, Wild Yam root is often indicated in menstrual cramps/spasm of the smooth muscle of the uterus, but it will work for skeletal problems. Black Cohosh root works well for either. Lobelia herb is specific for relieving bronchial asthma, but there is no protocol against using it for a back spasm. It is probably best to select an herb that is traditionally used for the area intended.

### Topical Applications—Rubefacients

Rubefacients (sometimes known as counterirritants) are hot, pungent herbs used topically in compresses, baths, liniments, and creams (Table 24.6). They increase blood flow to the skin and relieve congestion, pain, and irritation. Use in sprains, strains, muscle aches, and pains caused by overdoing it, the weekend warrior syndrome. They make wonderful topical remedies, feel fabulous, and are easy for herbalists to concoct. Those that come in essential oil form, such as Peppermint, Wintergreen, and Camphor, are usually applied with a carrier oil or a few drops added neat to liniments.

Rubefacients range from warming to very hot. Hot ones such as Mustard seed or Cayenne pepper can redden, blister, and irritate the skin, so care is needed with people who are sensitive to such substances. Capsicum, the pungent chemical in Cayenne pepper, stimulates and then blocks transmission of the pain neurotransmitter, substance P.11 Ginger root and Cinnamon bark are medium heat. Some rubefacients are cooler and contain menthol, like Mint or Wintergreen essential oils. Menthols have an alternating heating and cooling effect on the skin, moving qi and blood. Camphor is a resin derived from the wood of Cinnamomum camphora (Camphor tree). OTC Bengay ointment contains camphor and menthol, as does Chinese Tiger Balm.

Rubefacients are contraindicated in people with delicate skin, babies, young children, and elders, and on damaged or open skin. Use caution in clients with very fair complexions and red hair, and people with sensitivity to heat. If using in essential oil form, mix with a carrier oil. In general, rubefacients bring blood to the skin surface and relieve pain.

## Rheumatology versus Arthritis

The medical specialty, rheumatology, treats more than 100 different connective-tissue diseases. Many affect the joints, muscles, and ligaments, and others affect blood vessels or skin. Some are systemic; others are local. Well-known M-S rheumatic problems are osteoarthritis, tendonitis, bursitis, gout, spondylitis, and even growing pains. Some rheumatic diseases are autoimmune, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, scleroderma, sarcoidosis, and fibromyalgia. Arthritis simply means inflammation of the joints and is a category of diseases within the large rheumatology specialty. Joint diseases are just a fraction of rheumatoid diseases.

The problem is that in Western herbology there is a whole section of herbs called antirheumatics. This is unfortunate and confusing. That heading really includes plants with various actions that help arthritis indirectly and in different ways by being antiinflammatory, analgesic, alterative, antispasmodic, and/or diuretic. Please erase that vague herbal classification from your mind. Examples in this list are: Celery seed, Yarrow herb, Mugwort herb, Blue and Black Cohosh root, Yellow Dock root, Wild Yam root, and Blue Flag root.

For the record, we can be thankful for Chinese Medicine, because it does not even bother with the names of the various rheumatic diseases. Wind Damp Heat Bi or Wind Damp Cold Bi are fine designations that say it all. Therapeutic principles are based on what is observed and reported, plus any knowledge you might have about the disease.

### Fibromyalgia Syndrome

Definition. Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a rheumatic disease with a large group of symptoms: widespread muscular-skeletal pain with trigger points, sleep disturbances, and GI and emotional problems (Case History 24.6). FMS has been linked to increased amounts of neurotransmitter substance P (for pain) in cerebral spinal fluid, chronic fatigue syndrome, adrenal depletion, and viral-induced changes in cytokines,4 or inflammatory markers. It is not yet an official autoimmune disease, but it sure looks like one. Treat accordingly.

Case History 24.6

Case History for Fibromyalgia

S. Shelia has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. She has diffused, dull, chronic pain on her hips, neck, shoulder, and back. It moves around. She is anxious, depressed, and exhausted. Cannot sleep. Stomach has gas, belching, bloating, and alternating constipation and diarrhea. Right now, it’s the diarrhea stage. Has gotten minimal relief from her healthcare provider.

O. P Slippery on right, tense on left. T Greasy, red coat.

A. Wind Damp Heat. Liver Invading Spleen. Shen Disturbance. Fibromyalgia with chronic fatigue, anxiety, and depression.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. Two formulas: one for day and one for sleep. (1) Analgesics and antiinflammatories move qi and blood. (2) Adrenal support. (3) Immune support. (4) Nerve tonic. (5) Antidiarrheals and gut restoratives. (6) Separate sleep formula. (7) Four-R Program.


The muscular-skeletal system includes connective tissue: bone, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia. Pain is a chief reason a person visits an allopathic healthcare provider. Herbalists have many tools and opportunities to keep folks off addictive narcotics and NSAIDs which can cause ulcers, GI bleeds, heart disease, and kidney failure. A wise herbalist addresses pain symptomatically but focuses on the root of the problem. Alteratives are used to dredge up toxins, and diuretics flush them out. Chronic inflammation is present in many M-S conditions and often requires a leaky gut fix.

RICE (rest, ice, compression, and elevation) is a basic first-aid procedure. External remedies can range from a bag of frozen peas to compresses, creams, and liniments. Manual therapies like massage, reflexology, tui na, osteopathy, and hydrotherapy are useful tools, as is moxa and cupping. The ECB system is a way the body manages pain. Phytocannabinoids are plants that hook on to its receptor sites and include Cannabis spp., Hops flower, and Echinacea root. Rubefacients are forms of topical analgesia that bring blood to the skin surface. Plants containing salicylates and sterols help reduce pain.

In Chinese Medicine, pain is caused by a blockage of qi and blood which must be moved to free up energy flow and give relief. Bi means painful obstruction and Bi syndromes involve pain, inflammation, and arthritic symptoms that are either acute (hot) or chronic (cold).

Our outer layer, the integument, is better known as the skin. It includes the hair, nails, skin glands, and nerves. The skin is the largest organ in the body, covering about 10 square feet in adults (if laid out flat), and weighing approximately 10 pounds. Skin disorders are common reasons for a doctor’s visit. Although rarely life threatening, they can create genuine embarrassment or emotional, physical, and mental anguish.

The skin is out there and mirrors our internal health and well-being. People experience their self-image through their skin, and it communicates who we are to the world. In Chinese Medicine, the Lungs rule the exterior of the body (skin) and manifest in the body hair. Skin is also related to Liver, Blood, and Heart shen in certain ways.

The integumentary Materia Medica revisits many old herbal friends and acquaintances, with some new ones joining the scene. Selected skin cases were reviewed in pediatrics (Chapter 21). Therapeutic principles do not change much for adults, but stronger botanicals could be indicated. Frequently the same standbys apply: the flowers of Chamomile, Red Clover, and Calendula; and of course, Burdock root and seed and Yellow Dock root.

<!-- chunk -->

## Overview of the Skin

A common consensus among present-day herbalists is that skin diseases are among the most complicated and inconsistent to treat. There is little agreement on any particular herb or regimen for a given problem. A this-for-that approach doesn’t work. Results are unpredictable and unreliable, no matter what is tried. A skin condition may appear to be all cleared up, only to return again and be worse. Each case must be taken individually, and an herbalist must doggedly return to the basics of digestive and liver health. Chinese Medicine always advises to treat what you see. Address the syndrome, not the disease. If an immunological or allergic problem exists, this approach is even more important.

<!-- chunk -->

### Skin as the Third Kidney and Detoxification

Internal and external skin problems test an herbalist’s holistic skills. If there is external trauma with bruising or open wounds, the focus is to avoid infection; restore and heal the cells; treat any bites, stings, or poison ivy; or remove offending chemicals the skin has touched. These irritants obviously come from the outside environment.

Treatment of chronic skin problems with internal causes involves more than rubbing on a salve. Topical creams soothe symptoms, but internal detoxification is needed. The Eclectics espoused this and so do Chinese Medicine practitioners. If the body cannot eliminate poisons adequately through the bowel or bladder, they will manifest on the skin. They have to go somewhere.

For this reason, the skin has historically been seen as the third kidney. The fix is to use alteratives and herbs that stimulate, push, and coax eliminatory functions, and call on help from the kidneys, colon, liver, and lymphatics. Red Clover flower and Yellow Dock root change the internal environment, and Cleavers herb moves lymph. Nettle herb provides nourishment and removes toxins through its diuretic action, and Burdock root works on the kidneys and liver. For stubborn chronic skin outbreaks and autoimmune or allergic reactions, an herbalist must obtain a thorough health history and assessment to get to the root cause.

The liver’s role on skin is basic. If Phase I and Phase II detoxification pathways are out of sync (Chapter 19), where do the toxins go? They build up in the body, causing oxidation and inflammation in susceptible places. Allergies follow. Metabolic overload and failure of adequate liver detoxification often show up as chronic skin problems, such as acne, rosacea, eczema, or psoriasis. Liver stimulants and detoxification herbs are part of the skin fix: Dandelion root, Artichoke leaf, Turmeric root, and the very strong Poke root. Liver herbs work robustly on the skin, so use them conservatively in small amounts.

Then there’s the gut. When dysbiosis occurs, the skin suffers. Chronic skin problems such as psoriasis, cutaneous lupus, and autoimmune skin diseases are frequently a sign of an unbalanced microbiome and probable food sensitivities. If we eat too much sugar, the face can yell loudly. Our beloved Four-R program would be the solution.

### Skin Functions

Like any other organ, the skin has many responsibilities.

### Skin Assessment

Skin assessment includes observing factors such as color, complexion, radiance, or dullness. Nails and hair are extensions of the skin.

### Skin Applications

Box 25.1

Cleansing Facial Steam6

by Rosemary Gladstar

Aromatic steams open the pores and help blemishes such as whiteheads, blackheads, and acne come to a head. Normal skin does well with a lot of Comfrey, a moisturizing, mucilaginous herb; and if skin is on the oily side, more drying astringents are added such as Witch Hazel leaf or Garden Sage leaf. Steams call for dried, raw herbs, but 2–3 drops of essential oil could be substituted for any of the dried botanicals.

Directions (for either formula)

Weigh out and mix herbs together. Bring 2–3 qt of water to a boil and drop in about a handful of the mixture. Turn down to a simmer with lid on for 2 min. Remove from heat, place pot on hotplate, and cover head with a towel. Allow steam to waft up in the face. Come up for air when necessary.

## Chinese Medicine Perspective: the Skin and Major Syndromes

<!-- chunk -->

### Chinese Medicine Major Skin Syndromes

Some typical scenarios involve the skin, described in this list in terms of their Western disease counterpart. Treatment depends on assessment. These syndromes apply to many skin conditions, not just the ones given.

<!-- chunk -->

#### Hives in Chinese Medicine

Hives (urticaria) are a rash of pale or red welts on the skin that itch intensely, sometimes with dangerous swelling, caused by an allergic reaction, typically to specific foods.

Box 25.2

Jade Windscreen Formula (Yu Ping Feng San)

A versatile combination of only three herbs that act as a barrier from external wind.

The main classical actions of Jade Windscreen are to protect and stabilize the immune system (wei qi), disperse external wind and pathogens, and to stop spontaneous sweating from qi deficiency. In modern times, it is used for food or seasonal allergies and hives, spontaneous sweating, immunodeficiency, environmental sensitivities, as well as more traditional protection from external wind, such as coughs, colds, bronchitis, viral infections, and more. (For this reason Jade Windscreen could also have just as appropriately appeared under Respiratory (Chapter 20).11 The name Jade indicates how highly valued this trio is in Chinese Medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

#### Eczema in Chinese Medicine

Eczema refers to small blisters or pustules that can later become chronic, with crusty or dry itchy patches. When there are red raised papules that weep and ooze, it is a sign of damp heat. Later in the crusty stage, it’s damp heat with dryness. Syndromes follow from acute to old, chronic, and dried-up eczema.

<!-- chunk -->

#### Shingles in Chinese Medicine

Shingles are painful viral skin blisters that follow nerve pathways on one side of the body. Syndromes range from horribly acute pain and burning and proceed to end stages when lesions dry up. Nerve pain should ease but sometimes goes on for years.

<!-- chunk -->

## Skin Materia Medica

The skin Materia Medica ranges across the board. Some herbs treat symptoms, whereas others address underlying causes. Categories include vulneraries used for tissue healing in wound trauma; antiseptics applied locally to wounds to clear infection; hemostatics to stop any bleeding; antimicrobials for varied skin infections; alteratives that restore proper functioning through detoxification and waste elimination; lymphatic drainers to encourage cleansing, reduce edema, help immune function; diuretics to move out toxic wastes and dry damp; antiinflammatories; analgesics; antipruritics for any itching; and anticontusion remedies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Skin Herbs Worth Honorable Mention

<!-- chunk -->

### Vulneraries, the Wound Healers

Vulneraries are herbs that heal general skin lesions and soft-tissue injuries. Soft-tissue injuries refer to open trauma wounds such as lacerations (a deep cut or tear), abrasions (superficial scrapes), hematomas (bruising or localized swelling of clotted or partially clotted blood and caused by a break in the wall of a blood vessel that makes a black-and-blue mark), and puncture wounds (caused by splinters, thorns, or foreign objects that pierce the skin). Vulneraries that heal soft-tissue injuries could be in an herbalist’s basic first-aid kit (Table 25.1).

Table 25.1

• Normal saline (1 tsp. salt to 1 qt. boiled water)

• Salvia officinalis (Garden Sage herb)

• Achillea millefolium (Yarrow herb)

• Monarda spp. (Bee Balm herb)

• Propolis (Bee glue). Resinous, waterproof mixture made by bees to seal up the hive. Antimicrobial, antiseptic, and antioxidant. A waterproof band-aid.

1. Clean wound (wash or irrigate). Get rid of all debris before applying a vulnerary.

2. Normal saline works as an irrigant. Have at least a gallon ready to pour over wounds.

3. If using herbs to irrigate, make a light infusion, strain, cool to room temperature, and gently clean wound.

4. Cover wound with either an herbal vulnerary cream or an essential oil; do not need both.

5. Alternately, cover with a high alcohol 80% Propolis tincture. Acts as an exceptionally effective antimicrobial vulnerary.5

• Larrea spp. (Creosote, Chaparral leaf)

• Achillea millefolium (Yarrow flower)

• Plantago spp. (Plantain leaf)

• Capsella bursa (Shepherd’s Purse herb)

• Hamamelis virginica (Witch Hazel leaf)

• Geranium spp. (Cranesbill root)

• Quercus spp. (Oak bark)

1. If bleeding is severe, apply pressure.

2. If not, irrigate first, apply pressure to stop bleeding, then allow clot to form.

Vulneraries are also used for healing lesions from various conditions, such as acne, shingles, eczema, boils, and skin eruptions of all kinds. Vulneraries can be applied externally through liniments, salves, soft and hard plasters, poultices, and compresses. They are used internally through decoction or tincture.

Vulneraries can have many actions. They are tissue repairing and can be antiseptic and/or antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, emollient (a demulcent used on the skin), and analgesic; they can also reduce swelling (edema). Bruising calls for Arnica flower and/or Panax San Qi (Notoginseng root). To reduce itching, consider Witch Hazel leaf, Calendula flower (Fig. 25.3), or Chickweed herb. Good astringents to reduce discharge and sepsis include Wild Geranium root and Witch Hazel leaf. For inflammation, use Boswellia resin, Chamomile flower, Calendula flower, and Plantain leaf. For strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial vulneraries, single out Frankincense and Myrrh resins, Creosote (Chaparral leaf), and Turmeric root. Bleeding wounds call for hemostatics or styptics, such as Panax San Qi, Yarrow flower, and Shepherd’s Purse herb (Table 25.2).

### Alteratives

This category is variously called alteratives, depuratives, blood cleansers, and blood purifiers. Alteratives work from the inside out and help the body eliminate toxins (Table 25.3). They do this in diverse ways by cleansing through the liver, kidneys, and/or lymph. Some are antibacterial (Echinacea root). Blue Flag rhizome, Yellow Dock root, Dandelion root, and Poke root stimulate the liver. Burdock root and Knotgrass herb work chiefly through the kidneys. Some move lymph (Fig. 25.4) (Cleavers herb and Red Root), which activates lymphocytes and macrophages and helps drain bacteria and toxins, returning them to the bloodstream so that elimination can take place.

Heartsease, Wild Pansy herb


Because many chronic skin diseases such as eczema, psoriasis, or herpes are in part caused by toxic overload, alteratives are needed as a part of those formulations. The Eclectics used them extensively with good results. They take a long time to work their magic. Ideally, include one or two that affects more than one avenue of elimination. For instance, combine a lymphatic drainer with a diuretic or combine a liver and lymphatic stimulant, all depending on individual case. If the problem is glaringly liver related, then use two liver alteratives (Fig. 25.5).

In the Chinese Medicine system, skin outbreaks call for alteratives (although not called that). They are herbs that clear heat, damp heat, or toxic heat; one example is Lonicera Jin Yin Hua (Honeysuckle flower).

Indications for alteratives include:

There is such a thing as a healing crisis that once upon a time was sought after in traditional homeopathic and naturopathic circles. It refers to a dramatic detoxification reaction with temporary worsening of skin symptoms and eruptions, often brought on by fasting and heroic cleanses. It used to be considered a positive sign of healing, a sign of the toxins coming out. However, healing is not a crisis, and if this exacerbation occurs, too much has happened too quickly, and otherwise healthy skin has become inflamed and damaged. One herb known to accomplish a healing crisis was Burdock root.15 So do not provoke the situation and instead combine Burdock root with other alteratives to balance out the effect.

## Considerations for Treating the Skin

Therapeutic principles and herbal choices for skin management depend on suspected cause. This should be determined initially, if possible. Without expecting herbalists to be full-fledged dermatologists, a few good questions, awareness of the possibilities, and deductive reasoning can help. Here are some possible causes.

Case History 25.1

Case History for Road Rash

S. Jack scraped up his knee when he fell off his mountain bike riding very fast around a curve. He was wearing shorts. The wound covers his entire knee, which is raw, red, bleeding, and filled with dirt and gravel.

O. P Rapid. T Normal. Raw, dirty wound.

A. Trauma-induced scrape or road rash.

P. Specific therapeutic principles. (1) Irrigate and clean off dirt and gravel with normal saline using a gauze pad. (2) Cover a new large sterile gauze pad (or two) liberally with a first aid salve containing hemostatic, tissue healer, and antibiotic herbs. (3) Apply to knee and wrap with paper tape or elasticized bandage to hold gauze in place. (4) Change dressing daily. If gauze becomes dried up and stuck to the wound, dribble some normal saline over it to loosen without disturbing clot. (5) Internal formula: use same type of herbs as in salve, plus something for anxiety and pain.


Change dressing daily or when needed. May need to wet bandage before removing so scab isn’t pulled off. Apply salve to bandage and secure.

Box 25.4

Antifungal Salve18

by Rosemary Gladstar

A useful antifungal emollient salve. This includes infections such as athlete’s foot, nail fungus, jock itch, ringworm, and Candida. Will require frequent applications over a few weeks.

Directions for accelerated oil made into a salve

Weigh out and grind herbs. Moisten with 95% ethyl alcohol to break down cell walls. Let stand 20 minutes to 1 hour. Put herbs in blender and cover with olive oil. Blend on high until warm. May have to let motor cool down intermittently. Strain. To each cup of herbal oil, start with 1 oz melted beeswax. Test for firmness by placing a little dollop in freezer to cool. Adjust thickness. For harder salve, add more wax; for thinner salve, add oil. Pour into jars or tins and let harden.


Apply to lesions 3×daily up to 1 month, even if lesions have cleared up. Do not double dip. Remove enough for one application and discard applicator after use. Fungi are contagious.


Skin functions range from temperature regulation to immune protection. Problems must be treated internally and externally. Assessments of complexion, hair, and nails reveal multitudes about whole body health and can indicate internal problems. Healthy skin requires good hydration, a diet rich in essential fatty acids, and protection from harmful UV rays. Topical skin remedies take the form of baths, compresses, poultices, creams, lotions, and salves. Herbalists would do well to keep one or two basic preparations on hand. A pain relief liniment and a first aid wound healer are decent choices.

In Chinese Medicine, the Lungs are the most exterior organ and rule the skin and body hair. Sweating is a Lung function, another kind of breathing called wei qi. If this energy is deficient, we sweat excessively (hyperhidrosis), a major sign of Lung Qi Deficiency. From a skin standpoint, wind refers to itching, acute hives, and spontaneous sweating.

Two main categories of the skin Materia Medica are vulneraries and alteratives that work on an internal detoxifying level. Common skin situations confronting herbalists include first-aid measures for cuts and scrapes, itchy stress-related eczema, autoimmune psoriasis where cells proliferate quickly and wildly, painful burning shingles that follow nerve pathways, embarrassing acne, and the locker-room hazard, athlete’s foot.

The kidneys are an extremely complicated body system. Anatomically, the urinary system (also called the renal or urogenital system) is made up of only four structures: the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. That’s it. Physiologically, kidneys do far more than make urine, although that is certainly a most obvious and important function. Kidneys are vital organs of detoxification, water balance, blood pressure, acid-base electrolyte balance, and more. We can’t live without them for longer than a week, give or take. Beyond that time frame, a person must be on dialysis or get a transplant to stay alive.

Keeping the kidneys healthy is important to our well-being. We usually make urine unconsciously and urinate easily and painlessly; except when we don’t. Normal adult output is around 1.5 to 2 liters a day (1 liter is close to a quart), depending on the weather and body’s hydration. Urine characteristics tell a lot about overall health. This chapter will explore these parameters.

In Chinese Medicine, Kidneys affect whole body and, in that sense, are the most holistic of organ systems. In Chinese Medicine, the Kidneys make urine, as in Western medicine, and are involved on the physical level with the ills that function entails. This chapter deals with that aspect. Chapters 27 and 28 involve other Chinese Medicine Kidney functions. Physical Kidney conditions are known as Lin syndromes. They include urinary tract infections (UTIs), other infections, and calculi (stones).

Happy Kidney Tea with Parsley

Petroselinum crispum (Parsley leaf, root, and seed)

Nutrient-dense Parsley from the carrot family is a lot more than a pretty garnish to be daintily put aside on the plate. The leaves are an excellent source of iron, vitamins K and C and folate. The flavonoid, apigenin, is anticarcinogenic, antiinflammatory, and antioxidant.

Parsley leaf, root, and seed have long been used for the kidneys. The leaf contains cleansing chlorophyll, the seeds are filled with kidney-loving essential oils, and the root dissolves stones.

Ingredients for Happy Kidney Tea with Parsley


Pour freshly boiled water over 2 tsp of tea. Steep for 3 to 5 minutes. strain and drink. Add honey or lemon to taste.

## Urine Assessment

A simple visual inspection of urine is easy and can tell the herbalist a lot. Normal urine appears in various shades of yellow, is clear and not cloudy, has no visible blood, no suspended particles, and smells like ammonia if there is dehydration. A simple dipstick that can be purchased in pharmacies will show pH and presence of microscopic blood. Determination of bacteria, sediments known as casts, crystals, protein, white and red blood cells, and other parameters require microscopic examination and is carried out in a urine analysis (UA).

### Urinary Herbs Worth Honorable Mention

Box 26.2

Dry Damp with Poria Fu Ling

Poria Fu Ling (Hoelen fungus) is a curious fungus that grows on the lower trunks of conifer trees and under the ground. It is a perennial white or pinkish fungus, commercially available in various shapes (curly, flat and cubed) although shape has no bearing on its properties. (I like the curly one; it’s more fun.) It can be found in central and coastal China on dry hillsides and in Japan and North America. It is a favorite of many herbalists, East and West.

Its primary use is as a bland, drying, and draining diuretic, useful for any dampness, such as edema, mucus accumulation, or diarrhea. It is gentle, but effective and safe for children. It can be found in many Chinese Medicine formulas, not used on its own.7 Think of Fu Ling whenever anything needs drying out. It has the added bonus of restoring the Spleen, in Spleen Qi Deficiency, and of being a mild nervous relaxant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Urinary Restoratives

Urinary restoratives are used for any chronic urinary problem where the bladder and kidneys are weakened or deficient, as in dribbling, incontinence, chronic UTIs that won’t quit or enuresis (involuntary urination or bed-wetting). Urinary restoratives tend to be astringent and tone the smooth muscles of the urinary tract. They also help in UTIs where there is residual urine left in the bladder after voiding.11 Bladder restoratives help flush the bladder completely and not leave any bacteria-filled urine behind (Table 26.1, Box 26.3).

Tea to Restore the Kidneys9

Parts are measured by weight. Mix dry herbs together. If using fresh Cornsilk, increase amount to 1 part and add to tea. Use 1–2 tbsp per cup and drink a cup a day.

Note: Marshmallow root can be taken alone for a urinary tract soother. If so, use a cold infusion, 2 tbsp herb to 1 qt water. Let sit in fridge overnight.

<!-- chunk -->

### Urinary Stimulants, the Diuretics

Diuretics are urinary stimulants that increase secretion and elimination of urine from the body. In doing so, waste products are excreted, and the detoxification process is enhanced. Any circulatory stimulant is a diuretic in that it increases blood flow, resulting in greater blood circulation through the renal arteries, and thus, more urine production. Caffeine-containing herbs such as Coffee bean and Black tea leaf also do this. So-called draining diuretics are a stronger designation and are indicated in generalized edema anywhere in the body, including in ankles and lower legs, as seen in congestive heart failure (CHF) and renal failure. Examples: Alisma Zi Xie (Water Plantain root) or Couch grass root.

Kidney herbs tend to double as diuretics; they dry damp. They regulate water balance and promote lymphatic drainage, increasing the volume of urine. Celery seed and Uva ursi leaf are both antiinflammatory and diuretic. Gravel root (Fig. 26.3) and Stone root are antilithics (break down mineral deposits in stones) and are diuretic. Uva ursi and fresh Yarrow are antimicrobial, astringent, and diuretic. Cornsilk is demulcent and diuretic and soothes, coats, and cools the mucous membranes, taking down pain and inflammation. It is helpful to select your diuretic with its other action(s) in mind (Table 26.2).

Table 26.2

Zea mays (Cornsilk)

Althea officinalis (Marshmallow leaf)

Elymus repens (Couch grass root)

Hydrangea arborescens (Hydrangea root)

Diuretics are indicated in most kidney problems where flushing out the urine is a good idea. This is true for UTIs, kidney stones, hematuria, dysuria, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), renal failure with oliguria (abnormally small amount of urine), and anuria (failure to produce any urine). Naturally, diuretics are important in skin conditions, rheumatoid arthritis, and any foot and ankle edema, such as occurs with a sprained ankle, congestive heart failure, and renal failure. For the last two, draining diuretics are needed, although those clients will likely be hospitalized. Selection would be based on a diuretic’s tropism to various body systems, such as Lily of the Valley herb for the heart, Celery seed for the skin and muscles, Dandelion leaf (best when used fresh) for liver and digestive areas.

<!-- chunk -->

### Urinary Relaxants: Spasmolytics, Analgesics, and Antilithics

Urinary relaxants are spasmolytics that have a tropism to the smooth muscles of the urinary tract (Table 26.3). These would be called on especially for pain or dysuria, renal colic. This occurs in UTIs or prostatitis. They also are used in dribbling, discharges, and incontinence caused by weakness and muscle spasms.

Relaxants also include analgesics, many of which work by relaxing muscle spasms. Some analgesics are general and useful for pain anywhere in the body, such as Corydalis Yan Hu Suo (Asian Corydalis corm) or Jamaican Dogwood bark. Willow bark is specific for the bladder pain of UTIs, although it is also used for headaches and inflammation.

Another category of urinary relaxants are the antilithics (Table 26.4) that break up stones and dissolve hardened calcium or uric acid oxalates. Urinary stones cause incredible pain and spasm when they pass into the narrow ureters, and once broken up and dissolved, there is blessed relief. Stone breakers are dissolving, diuretic, and detoxifying. They tend to prevent stone formation and weaken and slowly dissolve existing stones. Mineral deposits imply a damp, weak, and deficient condition with irritation and scanty urine and possible physical obstruction.

Antilithics work for hardenings other than urinary stones, such as calcium bone spurs, atherosclerosis, gouty deposits, and gallstones.6 Their diuretic action is needed to help the dissolved stones or gravel pass out in the urine to dry up damp.

### Urinary Sedatives: The Antimicrobials for Damp Heat

These are the antimicrobial herbs that treat infections, bladder Damp Heat Lin syndromes (Table 26.5). There is painful, burning, urgent, frequent cloudy urination, and the client experiences thirst, nausea, or backache. These herbs tend to be antimicrobial, antiseptic, antiinflammatory, and spasmolytic. Uva ursi leaf and Dianthus Qu Mai (Proud Pink herb) are examples. Some in this antimicrobial category are on the warmer side and are therefore used for cooler chronic urinary infections. Examples here are Juniper berry or Kava root.

## Common Urinary Conditions

### Urinary Infections: Acute and Chronic

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) involve the bladder and urethra and are known as cystitis. Most urinary infections are Lin Damp Heat syndromes and can be effectively treated with herbs (Case History 26.1). Urinary infections and/or inflammations generally come from an outside source and ascend into the urethra (urethritis), up to the bladder (cystitis), to the ureter (ureteritis), to kidney level (pyelonephritis). Pyelonephritis is much more serious than an infection of the bladder. Sometimes the infection begins at kidney level. If kidney infections are not aggressively treated, they could lead to kidney failure. This is the time to be careful and refer to a healthcare provider.

Kidneys make urine, and through this process waste is removed, and pH, electrolytes, and water volume are balanced. Electrolytes are charged elements that are essential to the body in very correct amounts. Water must be in its designated compartments in and out of the cells and in the right amounts. The kidneys regulate and maintain blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) pathway and also make red blood cells.

Normal urine is light yellow, has an acceptable odor, and does not look murky or have sediment or pinkish signs of blood. Being kind to the kidneys includes staying well hydrated and consuming a diet filled with greens, fruits, and veggies. In Chinese Medicine, the Kidney organ system is basic to whole body well-being, but the physical kidneys are addressed in the form of Lin syndromes—bladder and kidney infections, stones, and incontinence—the same as in the West.

The urinary Materia Medica includes restoratives, stimulating diuretics, relaxants in the form of antispasmodics and analgesics, stone-dissolving antilithics, and the sedating antimicrobials. Common Lin conditions include acute and recurrent bladder infections; the elusive interstitial cystitis, which is probably autoimmune and not really an infection at all; and calculi that are most easily treated when small.

Neuroendocrine system

The endocrine system consists of an assortment of glands that are stimulated to produce chemicals that regulate the body. Known as hormones, these chemicals are communicators, making the body hum and keeping things in balance. If the thyroid gland needs removal because of a tumor or cancer, then hormone replacement drugs would need to be taken for life. As a nurse, I’ve seen first-hand the havoc that can occur from the loss of just a single one of these tiny groups of specialized cells.

A takeaway from the study of the endocrine system is how chronic stress negatively affects chronic health issues in Western societies, such as hypothyroidism, digestive ills, blood sugar imbalances, autoimmune disorders, and reproductive problems. We will investigate the adrenals, thyroid, and pancreas. Chapter 28 covers reproductive glands and hormones. Relevant syndromes in Chinese Medicine are matched with Western endocrine diseases. The entire chakra energy system also coordinates with the endocrine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Overview of the Endocrine System

Endocrine glands comprise a network of ductless glands that produce hormones, which are chemical messengers that regulate all types of body functions from stress, energy, growth, and development to metabolism, immunity, sexual function, and many others. Endocrine hormones are secreted directly into the bloodstream and carried through the blood to their target organs.

For instance, the thyroid gland makes T3 and T4, which deal with metabolic activity and the body’s ability to produce and consume energy. Those hormones are carried to every cell in the body. The adrenals, located over each kidney, secrete the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol (among others). The pancreatic islet cells secrete insulin and glucagon involved in blood sugar regulation. They are regulated and controlled by a negative feedback loop: when a hormone level gets too high, the brakes are set, and production decreases until the next time it is needed; when levels get too low, more hormone is produced and circulated.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Neuroendocrine System

The interaction between the nervous and the endocrine systems is known as the neuroendocrine system. They are the two main body controllers and work together. The neuro portion of the endocrine refers to the hypothalamus, a tiny part of the brain which could be considered a rapid-relay station linking the nervous system to the endocrine glands via the pituitary. The hypothalamus acts as a collecting center for information regarding the internal well-being and homeostasis of the body.2

The hypothalamus is located right below the pituitary gland and behind the third eye (right between the eyebrows). This mission control center receives and regulates signals from all over the body through the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS regulates involuntary vital signs like breathing, heart rate, blood pressure (BP), and stress response signals.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis (HPA Axis)

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) is an interactive system linking the hypothalamus to the pea-sized pituitary gland and then to the adrenals. The hypothalamus also has other pathways. After it sends either nervous signals and/or hormones to the pituitary, instead of messaging the adrenals, the pituitary can connect to the parathyroid glands, the thyroid gland, or the ovaries or testes. It all depends on which hormone it releases. Even the pancreas is involved, because it has been recognized that a subgroup of hypothalamic neurons and neurons elsewhere in the brain have the capacity to sense glucose and influence the secretion of anti-insulin hormones and hepatic glucose production.3

<!-- chunk -->

### Adaptogens and Their Relationship to the HPA Axis

The herbal takeaway, as far as the HPA axis goes, is that whenever an herb is designated a neuroendocrine stimulator, it balances the entire hormonal pathway from the brain to the adrenals. True adaptogens meet this criterion. Adaptogens, such as Schisandra Wu Wei Zi (Five Taste berry) and Ashwagandha root regulate and normalize stress responses, blood glucose levels, and cardiovascular, immune, and nervous system functions, e.g., stress, and can have enormously positive effects on chronic and autoimmune diseases, premature aging, and our health (Chapter 16).2 This effect is particularly true when combined with optimal nutrition, exercise, and rest. That’s why adaptogens are so precious and revered. They smooth out the highs and lows of neuroendocrine imbalances and decrease elevated cortisol, the classic sign of prolonged stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Adrenals and Stress

The two adrenals are little triangle-shaped glands that sit on top of each kidney and have an enormous amount to do with stress. There are two parts. The adrenal medulla is the inside portion and secretes adrenaline (also called epinephrine); the outside covering, the adrenal cortex portion, secretes the glucocorticoid hormones, one being cortisol, when stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary.

Short-acting epinephrine is considered the survival fight-or-flight hormone that deals with immediate stress and processes fear or danger. This action happens when you get a rush, run from a threat, are thrilled by something new and exciting, ride a roller coaster, or look down over the edge of a high mountain. Alertness, heart rate, BP, and oxygen intake increase because of signals from the hypothalamus’ regulation of the ANS.4 Runners experience so-called adrenaline highs and are able to get a last burst of energy to complete a race. In the hospital, nurses who thrive on trauma and excitement in the emergency room or intensive care unit (like me at one time) refer to being adrenaline junkies.

Sometimes, this stress becomes chronic, and the body never quits being in this constantly wired state. Prolonged stress that lasts for weeks, months, or years, can be detrimental and turn into anxiety and illness. Fight-and-flight epinephrine has been used up and is long gone, and the body then switches to cortisol from the adrenal cortex to maintain the habitually stressful state. Cortisol is a vital steroid hormone that acts to help stop inflammation and to regulate the immune system, libido, reproduction, and production of thyroid hormones.4 Its bad reputation as a stress hormone occurs when stress is continual, and cortisol is called on to maintain an unhealthy high-alert state in place of epinephrine. Cortisol blood levels soar, and trouble begins. For instance, ultrahigh sustained cortisol levels can make thyroid hormones less available to cells and can also reduce the liver’s ability to clear used-up estrogen from the system.4 The former leads to hypothyroidism; the latter leads to estrogen dominance with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) problems, good examples of the results of unending stress and the interconnectedness of the various body systems.

Cortisol blood levels are normally highest in the morning when we rise and lowest in the evening and night when we rest and sleep, a typical biorhythm cycle. But if a perpetual pattern of high alert and chronic anxiety ensues, and the person (typically a female) never stops running and busily doing activities, rarely relaxes, has little time or ability to sleep, cortisol levels can become alarmingly skewed. Cortisol might be low in the morning (lazy Mary), when we are supposed to rise and shine without the help of stimulants. Blood levels can slump in the late afternoon, necessitating a caffeine frenzy in the midafternoon (the 4 p.m. cortisol and glucose slump). Levels could also peak at night (the night owl scenario) when some people work late, can’t sleep, or lie in bed worrying till dawn.

Eventually, as we never turn off, cortisol production runs out of steam and goes from high to low. This result is the so-called overdrive, adrenal fatigue/burnout stage that is rarely recognized by allopathic medicine. Interestingly, the World Health Organization officially included adrenal burnout as an occupational phenomenon (workplace stress) in its revision of the International Classification of Diseases in May 2019.5

Symptoms of adrenal burnout include energy depletion and exhaustion, brain fog, digestive problems, blood sugar fluctuations, salt and fat cravings especially in late afternoon, food sensitivities, depression, and anxiety. Sex drive goes out the window, immunity is lowered, and frequent colds and skin outbreaks occur. PMS or menopausal symptoms peak as hormones go berserk. Autoimmune syndromes kick in, most notably Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and insulin resistance. Time to hit the pause button.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Thyroid

The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the front of the neck at the base. Its main functions are to regulate metabolism, growth, and development. It is like a thermostat that increases or decreases the amount of energy (adenosine triphosphate or ATP) called on to carry out many functions, such as how efficiently calories are burned and whether weight can be lost. It regulates mood and memory, body temperature, skin health, and in women, hormones governing menstrual cycles, PMS, or even the tendency for breast lump formation.

Just as the HPA axis regulates adrenal activity, the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis (HPT axis) regulates thyroid activity. It triggers the hypothalamus to stimulate the pituitary gland to release thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which in turn causes the thyroid gland to produce larger or smaller quantities of T3 and T4, based on negative feedback. Thus a well-working pituitary becomes part of the puzzle when balancing out the thyroid, an example of the neuroendocrine connection.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Hypothyroid Epidemic

Hypothyroidism is the most prevalent type of thyroid disease in the United States, and for years the synthetic thyroid hormone Synthroid has been one of the most frequently prescribed medications. There is a nonautoimmune type (hypothyroidism) and an autoimmune type called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. In countries where iodine is deficient in the diet and for other reasons, nonautoimmune hypothyroidism heads the list; but in the United States and in most developed Western countries where there is no dietary iodine deficiency, the situation is reversed.

In the Hashimoto’s epidemic, antibodies attack the thyroid cells for similar reasons that other autoimmune diseases occur. These reasons are all the items repeatedly alluded to in this text: a standard American diet (SAD), toxic overload, inflammation, dysbiosis and leaky gut, food sensitivities, hidden infections with immune disruptions, insulin resistance, chronic stress, and lack of sleep. Isn’t it interesting that an herbalist’s tools of the trade boil down to a few basic principles and fixes, no matter which body system is involved?

The symptoms of hypothyroidism and Hashimoto’s are the same, and the list is long. They are what would be expected to occur if thyroid functions are down and there is an internal energy crisis. Fatigue is the primary symptom, followed by cold intolerance (putting on jackets even in warm weather); lack of sweating with dry skin; constipation; hair loss; weight gain; anxiety, depression, and insomnia; low immunity; and hormone imbalances with PMS, low sex drive, irregular periods, breast tenderness, or postpartum depression.4 There are more symptoms but that’s enough to get the idea.

<!-- chunk -->

### What’s With Iodine?

The thyroid gland uses iodine found in many foods and converts it into thyroid hormones. Thyroid cells are the only cells in the body that can absorb iodine. Too much or too little iodine can cause a goiter, where the thyroid becomes enlarged and can become cancerous. The thyroid combines dietary iodine and the amino acid tyrosine to make the hormones T3 and T4. These are then used to control metabolism by converting glucose and oxygen into energy ATP. Inactive T4 must be converted to the active form, T3, with the help of selenium, zinc, and iron. The question becomes, how much iodine do we need in our diet, and should it be supplemented for a healthy thyroid? Generally, the amount of iodine in food and herbal sources is totally adequate. Before iodine is supplemented, the herbalist must be very sure that it is needed.

Sometimes supplemental iodine is a hindrance. An iodine excess—iodine-induced hypothyroidism—has been recognized as a trigger to Hashimoto’s autoimmune hypothyroidism following acute or chronic iodine exposure, and in those cases a low iodine diet has been helpful in normalizing function.6

## Keeping the Thyroid and Adrenals Healthy

<!-- chunk -->

## The Pancreas

The pancreas, located deep in the mid-abdomen, is another endocrine gland with two major functions. It is both an exocrine gland and an endocrine gland. Exocrine glands have ducts, and in the pancreas’s case, they empty digestive enzymes into the gastrointestinal (GI) system.

The ductless component of the pancreas is the endocrine gland function that regulates how the body uses glucose, and its relationship to insulin. Insulin is the hormone, made in specialized pancreatic beta cells, that drives glucose-rich carbohydrates from digested food in the bloodstream onto receptor sites in the cells so that glucose can then be used as a raw material in the manufacture of the energy molecule ATP.

Another beta cell hormone is glucagon, which raises blood sugar levels if they fall too low, thereby turning off insulin. Insulin lowers blood sugar when it drives glucose into the cells. It is crucial to have the correct amount of glucose in both places. Therefore glucagon and insulin work together in opposition to make up the pancreas’s negative feedback loop. When one goes up, the other comes down.

<!-- chunk -->

### Diabetes Mellitus Type 1

<!-- chunk -->

### The Hypoglycemia, Insulin Resistance, and Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 Spectrum

Because of poor lifestyle choices, blood sugar problems (dysglycemia) typically occur on a gradual continuum, not overnight. Fatigue, depression, hypoglycemia, and food cravings are at one end of the spectrum. Insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome is in the middle. Prediabetes and adult-onset type 2 diabetes are at the other end.

Normally blood sugar levels stay at 80 to 120 mg per deciliter. Insulin produced in the pancreatic islet cells moves sugar in the food we eat (glucose) from the bloodstream to the cells. When blood glucose levels fall too low, glucagon slows down insulin production to maintain a normal range. High blood sugar is called hyperglycemia, and low blood sugar is hypoglycemia.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Endocrine Chakras

The chakra system, the endocrine system, and the nervous system are intricately related (Fig. 27.2). As we ascend each spinning energetic ball, from the first at the root to the seventh at the crown, an endocrine gland is associated with each. The glands are located in the physical vicinity of their associated chakra.

Our metaphysical chakras (consciousness) are understood to communicate with the physical body through the nervous system and the endocrine system (neuroendocrine). This communication is yet another awesome example of the mind-body connection. Each chakra is associated with an endocrine gland and a physical nerve bundle called a plexus.12 When the chakra system was first intuited, no one knew we had endocrine glands or physical nerve bundles.

All the chakras have physical, mental, and spiritual associations and challenges. Our task on the physical plane is to keep the chakras open and in balance to achieve physical and mental health, and ultimately, spiritual enlightenment. This formidable challenge is approached through meditation, yoga, and various spiritual practices throughout many lifetimes. Often, healing on the physical level cannot occur unless core issues associated with the related chakras are resolved. Herbalists must be aware of this to help healing occur on all levels.

### Endocrine Herbs Worth Honorable Mention

Box 27.1

Hormone Balancing Maca, Cinnamon Smoothie

Lepidium meyenii (Maca root) is an earthy Peruvian superfood in the Mustard family that looks like a turnip. It is an endocrine and immune restorative (companion adaptogen) with a rich, pleasing flavor. This smoothie could serve as a quick, easy, and filling morning drink, when too busy to make breakfast, a candidate for the adrenal fatigue, on-the-go client. It is gluten-free and contains healthy fats and protein.17 Extra protein powder could be added to help stay full longer. Could add a banana or cocoa powder, or mix Maca root with spinach and avocado for a green drink.

Instructions

Blend it all together until smooth. Add more or fewer flavors, as needed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Adrenal Herbs

Neuroendocrine restoratives are needed in adrenal burnout or extreme fatigue (Table 27.1). These translate into yin and yang tonics, the adaptogens. Ideally, adaptogens work on the HPA axis. The ones that do this superbly are the primary adaptogens. Primary adaptogens have all been well-researched and proven beyond doubt to address the HPA axis. These include Schisandra Wu Wei Zi (Five Taste berry), Ayurvedic Ashwagandha root, Eleuthero Ci Wu Jia (Siberian ginseng root), and Rhodiola root.2 Primary adaptogens also include the classic ginsengs, such as Panax Ren Shen (Asian ginseng root) and Panax Xi Yang Shen (American ginseng root), although they are very costly and might not be economical to use freely.

Table 27.1

Other adaptogens are sometimes called secondary adaptogens because they are not 100% proven to address the HPA axis. However, tradition and many well-known herbalists have always classified them as bona fide adaptogens, being in the neuroendocrine category. These include notables such as Astragalus Huang Qi (Astragalus root), Ganoderma Ling Zhi (Reishi mushroom), Licorice root, Rehmannia Shu Di Huang (prepared Rehmannia root), Holy Basil herb (Tulsi), Milky Oat seed, and others.2 They are especially effective when combined with the must-have primary list.

Adaptogen companions consist of plants that focus on the immune, nervous, and hormonal systems. They are often foods, herbs, and beverages consumed frequently in various cultures, such as Rooibos tea from Africa (Box 27.2), Maca root from Peru, green tea from China, Rose Hips and Elderberry from the West, and Grape seed and skin from the Mediterranean. It is difficult to refrain from expounding on the enormously long list of superior foods and herbs, so I’ll just add microalgae (Box 27.3), Polygonum He Shou Wu (Flowery Knotweed root), Nettle herb, Ginger root, Saw Palmetto berry, and Bee Pollen.

Box 27.2

Rooibos Tea

A sweet and nutty noncaffeinated tea for adrenal fatigue

Rooibos tea (pronounced ROY-boss), is a traditional, noncaffeinated, antiinflammatory, South African tea that brews up into a beautiful, bright reddish-brown color with a sweet, fruity taste. It is traditionally consumed to improve appetite, calm digestion, and reduce nervous tension and anxiety. It is filled with antioxidants, more so than green tea. Other proven benefits include antiviral, antiallergenic, cholesterol-reducing, and immune-modulating properties. The plant is cut by hand and then bruised to encourage oxidation, which develops the rich color and flavor. As it oxidizes, Rooibos becomes redder and sweeter.23

Preparation

8 oz boiling water per heaping teaspoon loose leaves. Steep at least 5 minutes. Drink plain or add plant-based milk, honey to taste.

Box 27.3

Microalgae

A neuroendocrine superfood

Microalgae are microscopic, salty-tasting water plants that live in colonies. They are one of the most nourishing foods on the planet, containing high amounts of protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and cleansing chlorophyll. They contain the nucleic acids RNA and DNA, all eight essential amino acids; the macrominerals calcium, potassium, phosphorous, and magnesium; numerous trace minerals, including iodine, iron, zinc, copper, titanium, and cobalt; the entire vitamin B complex, vitamin C, and vitamin K. If you could have only one single food if stranded on a desert island, microalgae would be a wise choice.

Microalgae were the earliest forms of plant life, originating billions of years ago, the beginning of all life on planet Earth. They live in saltwater marine sources and in freshwater lakes and ponds. Spirulina spp. is a blue-green alga that grows in fresh and salt water and Chlorella spp. is a freshwater green alga. These two are the main forms of edible microalgae.24 Various cultures worldwide have used them as food, with good reason.

Preparation

Sold without prescription in tablets, powders, granules, and tinctures. You can also fill your own capsules with the bulk powder, as shown. May be taken internally and used topically as gargles and mouth washes.


For maintenance and prevention 2–5 g per day. For treatment: 5–10 g per day.

It is definitely best to mix and match all types of adaptogens and to include adaptogenic companion foods when addressing the many things adaptogens help, including loss of energy, adrenal fatigue, and compromised immunity. They are to be considered long-term therapeutics, requiring a good 3 months for results.

From the Chinese Medicine standpoint, herbs for adrenal fatigue are those that tonify both Kidney yin and Kidney yang. Moist, cooling tonics are on the yin side and could be considered to help the PNS. These botanicals include Asparagus Tian Men Dong (Asparagus root), or Solomon’s Seal, and Comfrey root.

Drying and warming Kidney yang herbs are on the SNS side and include botanicals such as Eucommia Du Zhong (Eucommia bark) or Rosemary leaf.

### Thyroid Herbs

Endocrine restoratives are needed that have a tropism to the thyroid (Table 27.2). Artichoke leaf, Saw Palmetto berry, Coleus root, and the adaptogenic Ashwagandha root are all valuable thyroid allies, particularly for hypothyroidism. For hyperthyroidism, Bugleweed herb (Fig. 27.4) and Motherwort herb stand out and are two of the few in this category. These two Mint family plants have been traditionally used to reduce cardiac symptoms such as hypertension, palpitations, and irritability,24 which often accompany hyperthyroidism.

Table 27.2

A very promising herb, Nigella sativa (Black seed, Black Cumin), native to the Mediterranean and Southwest Asia and long used around the world, has now been shown to cut down on thyroid antibodies present in Hashimoto’s disease and to normalize blood flow to the thyroid.21 Nigella sativa is certainly an herb to try.

Thyroid superfoods are filled with trace minerals and vitamins needed by that gland. Watercress herb that grows in cold running water has an amazing range of minerals and trace minerals, especially iron and iodine. Milky Oat berry is an archetypal nutritive restorer for neuroendocrine deficiencies of all kinds; it tonifies the thyroid, adrenals, and pancreas. Maca root is another.

Liver herbs should be considered in formulas for thyroid imbalance because the liver converts T4 to bioavailable T3. Therefore liver-supportive herbs such as Dandelion root, Oregon Grape root, or Burdock root are used. They also happen to be cholagogues that will help any constipation problem that is frequently present in hypothyroidism (Chapter 19).

Iodine-rich sea vegetables work well to maintain healthy thyroids. But they should be used discriminatively and included only in some formulas involving hypothyroidism. Their use could backfire in some folks with autoimmune Hashimoto’s thyroidits (discussed earlier). Start slowly with sea veggies to determine whether or not there is improvement. Examples that wash up on the Atlantic and Pacific shores in profusion include Fucus vesiculosus (Bladderwrack), which has air-filled bladders that can be popped like bubble wrap, and long strands of Laminaria spp. (Kelp thallus) illustrated in Fig. 27.5.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pancreatic Herbs

Herbs that help lower blood sugar are called hypoglycemics (Table 27.3). The opposite of these are substances that increase blood sugar, hyperglycemics. (It is possible that black coffee may do this in some individuals whose blood sugar is super-sensitive to caffeine.) Most often, herbalists are concerned with lowering blood sugar levels. If a person becomes hypoglycemic, as frequently happens in the early stage of insulin resistance, the best fix is with foods. Reach for a good protein, such as a hard-boiled egg, or a healthy carbohydrate, such as an apple or orange, rather than a Danish and coffee.

Table 27.3

Bitters are extremely important in lowering and normalizing blood sugar in insulin resistance. The bitter taste is antiinflammatory, hypoglycemic, and enhances fat metabolism. Momordica charantia (Bitter Melon) and Curcuma longa (Turmeric root) are famous for this.

Others, not quite as bitter but superb nevertheless, are hypoglycemic: Ayurvedic Gymnema sylvestre that masks the sweet taste on the tongue and Vaccinium myrtillus (Bilberry leaf). Opuntia spp. (Prickly Pear cactus, Nopal) is a versatile and useful tart cactus native to Latin America and the arid American Southwest. The fruit, flowers, and leaf pads are traditionally used for food and medicine (Box 27.4). The pad pulp is known for treating insulin resistance and DM2 because of its high inulin content and ability to lower the glycemic index of any food eaten with it when taken before meals, and also because of its high pectin content that lowers LDL cholesterol. The mucilaginous inner pads and flowers are a superb internal mucosal vulnerary for upper airway (infections), digestive (ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease), and the genitourinary tract (urinary tract infections, stones, and gout). And the Aloe Vera-like mucilaginous pad gel acts as an external first-aid vulnerary when rubbed onto the skin or used as a poultice to heal burns, contusions, and minor abrasions. Even the fruit, which is high in vitamin C, flavonoids, and minerals, can be cooked down into medicinal syrup bases, jams, liquors, or used as a hangover cure.20

Box 27.4

Prickly Pear Cactus Pad Preparation

For insulin resistance and diabetes type 2

If you happen to live in the American Southwest, you might want to be hardcore and take on the herbalist’s Prickly Pear challenge. First the thorns. Use thick gloves. The best way to harvest is with the pad still attached to the plant. Pick one that is sticking out by itself away from the others. The long spines and the fine, human-hair-thick barbed thorns at their base (called glochids) are then carefully scraped or sanded off between two large flat rocks that fit well into your hands. Know that glochids can be felt, if not always seen. When clear of nasties, cut off the pad.26 An alternate traditional method is to sear the spines off using a gas flame torch or open fire.

The pad is then cut open like a bagel (longitudinally) and the pulp from the center is scraped out into a bowl. Repeat. This mucilaginous gel will keep for 2–3 weeks in the refrigerator.

Internal insulin resistance use

Make a pulp slurry (folk method). Mix several ounces of hard-earned pulp with several ounces of water. Blend and drink 1–2 oz before meals.

External vulnerary use

Make an infusion of the pad pulp and flowers (the redder the better, according to Michael Moore).22 Make into a salve or compress and apply to wounds 3×a day. Or mix the cactus gel with Aloe vera gel, honey, or other dried or fresh herbs and apply as a poultice to the skin.26

If you’re hungry from all this work

Cut the dethorned pads into slices like a bell pepper and fry them up (skin and all) into a scramble with mushrooms, onions, and eggs.

In summary, herbalists are looking for herbs that improve insulin sensitivity. Botanicals that restore the liver are important to include because the liver plays an important role in glucose metabolism. Hemoglobin A1c (HgA1c) is an important blood test marker that reflects average glucose levels over a 2- to 3-month period and so provides a long-term trend in diabetes risk. The famous liver restorative, Milk Thistle seed, has been cited in many studies to normalize HgA1c.18 Others are Cinnamon bark, Olive leaf, and Gymnema leaf (Table 27.3).

Diabetes can damage blood vessels and capillaries and decrease circulation, leading to nerve damage and complications of blindness (diabetic retinopathy) and to foot and lower limb amputations (as a result of peripheral neuropathy). Antioxidants and microvascular stabilizers help prevent and repair these damaged capillaries. Consider herbs such as Bilberry leaf, Ginkgo leaf, Pine bark extract, and Grape seed extract. These also help repair cerebral vessels that are damaged in strokes.

Nutritious green superfoods are another category for prevention of insulin resistance. These foods are similar to ones used for any other neuroendocrine conditions: Nettle leaf, Alfalfa leaf, Maca root, and others.

Endocrine glands produce hormones, chemical messaging substances, and deliver them directly into the bloodstream. The neuroendocrine system includes the hypothalamus that links the ANS to various endocrine glands via the pituitary. These include the adrenals (the HPA axis) and the thyroid (the HPT axis). Primary adaptogens, secondary adaptogens, and companion superfoods are crucial endocrine allies.

The Chinese Medicine Kidneys are associated with the nervous and endocrine systems because they are linked with life force, essence, and energy. Many endocrine conditions are deficiencies, with a decrease of Kidney yin, yang, or qi. Therefore, tonics are used in cases like adrenal fatigue and hypothyroidism.

Stress hormones include fast-acting epinephrine produced during immediate fight-or-flight stress situations and long-lasting cortisol made during prolonged, unproductive stress. Elevated cortisol can result in adrenal fatigue, which causes many chronic health problems.

Autoimmune endocrine disorders include Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, and diabetes type 1. Unlike insulin-dependent diabetes where insulin injections are a lifetime requirement, insulin resistance can be reversible with proper lifestyle changes.

Male and female reproduction involves the sex hormones estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. They are steroids derived from the cholesterol molecule and are major players in reproductive health. Female reproduction is complicated and changeable as a woman journeys through her life. When one problem is solved, another can appear. Herbalists need an excellent grasp of the menstrual cycle, the function of each hormone, and the results of imbalances. Most reproductive fixes involve juggling these hormones.

In men, matters are frequently simpler, and a vast quantity of male reproductive challenges can be helped by improving health habits and incorporating lifestyle changes. These include concerns such as poor diet involving too much sugar and bad quality fats, hypertension, and high blood sugar (all insulin resistance related). Another consideration is cutting down on excessive alcohol and smoking.1

The Chinese Kidneys govern jing and essence and are involved in the life cycle from conception to death. An expression of Kidney essence is in the progression of women traveling through the Triple Goddess triad of the maiden, mother, and wise woman; and for men, journeying through the triad of youth, the warrior or father, and finally attaining the status of wise man or sage.

## The Second Chakra, Partnerships

The reproductive organs are associated with the second generative chakra located in the pelvic area (Fig. 28.1). It relates to our need for relationship. It is sometimes called the partnership chakra.2 When children start making friends outside the home, this chakra kicks in. It has to do with control of our external lives or fear of losing that control. It includes relationships that are sexual and platonic and how we relate to money, power, ethics, honor, blame, and guilt.

The second chakra easily becomes unbalanced when loss of control is real or feared. Creation of a new life happens at second chakra level, as does infertility or abortion. Creativity includes conception and giving birth but manifests in other areas such as when reinventing our lives, cooking a good meal, playing music, and painting a wall or a canvas. All these activities bring out the creative. Sexual inequalities, such as fear, rape, or incest, are second chakra issues, in these cases, sex not being a fair exchange of yin and yang energy.

On the physical level, an askew partnership chakra can lead to prostate or ovarian cancer, or chronic lower back pain (our physical support system). Reproductive issues include hot flashes, fibroids, infertility, and menopausal or erectile dysfunction. Rape, addiction, financial loss, frigidity, and abandonment by parents, primary partners, or professional colleagues are all issues that challenge a healthy second chakra.

On the plus side, ability to survive financially, psychically, and physically; to protect ourselves; and to take risks and/or to recover from any loss of close family members, partners, occupation, or bodily health denote a healthy partnership chakra.2 The mind-body connection involves all seven chakras. Healing needs to happen emotionally, spiritually, and physically.

## The Sacred Moon Cycle

The wisdom of a woman’s cyclic nature is profound, her bleeding the most basic earthly cycle she has. It follows moon phases, tides that ebb and flow with the moon’s pull, and the changing seasons (Fig. 28.2). When left to the forces of nature, ovulation and conception most often occur at the time of a full moon; blood flows during the dark, new moon. In many cultures still, a woman’s cycle is sacred, as is her connection to the archetypal feminine.6 These truths are worth remembering for ourselves and our clients when plagued with problems and things going awry in this complicated process.

The menstrual cycle is the hormonal process a woman’s body goes through each month to prepare for a possible pregnancy. Figure 28.3 illustrates the 28-day menstrual cycle in a linear clinical format, frequently seen in traditional text books. It shows the phases, the rise and fall of hormone levels and the uterine lining (endometrium) thickening and shedding. On the other hand, Fig. 28.2 depicts the moon cycle in a circular presentation, emphasizing our metaphysical relationship to the moon phases, and cyclic changes in our moods. The first half is a woman’s outward yang time, and the second half a yin, going within time.

Each cycle lasts on average 28 days and is divided into two halves. The first half (days 1–14) is the follicular phase. It is the time between menses and ovulation when the endometrial lining thickens, and an egg grows inside its follicle (egg sac) residing within the ovaries. Energetically, women are ripening an egg. It is the time of increased drive, preparing to give birth to someone or something; acting on ideas; starting new projects; being out in the world and feeling upbeat, enthusiastic, extroverted, social, and loving. It is an outward, exterior yang time.

Ovulation occurs at mid-cycle (about day 14) when the egg pops out of its sac and starts its journey down a fallopian tube in preparation for fertilization. Ovulation is the time when a woman is fertile and sexual desire peaks, at full moon. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and also luteinizing hormone (LH) are at their highest and changes occur with basal body temperature, consistency of cervical mucus and position and texture of the cervix (Box 28.1).

Box 28.1

A Woman’s Fertile Time

A woman can become pregnant only during a few days in each menstrual cycle. This 5-day window of opportunity (or signal to take preventative measures) occurs midcycle around ovulation: 2 days before, 1 day during, and 2 days after the egg leaves its sac and begins traveling up a fallopian tube to meet a sperm. Sperm live for 5 days. Eggs can be fertilized up to 24 hours after ovulation.17 There are three basic signs signaling fertile time. (Cramps don’t count, and ovulation times can vary, so it is best to keep records.)

The second half of the menstrual cycle (days 14–21) is the luteal phase. This lasts from ovulation to the onset of menstruation when the endometrial lining sheds. The second half is premenstrual time, a more reflective going-within spell, when the female body is preparing for possible conception as the released egg travels up through one of her fallopian tubes to the uterus for a possible meet-up with a sperm. This lunar time is when a woman can be most in tune with her intuition and can work her magic. Her inner knowing tells her what isn’t working in her life. She feels more withdrawn and less receptive to love and relationships.6 This second half of the cycle is called the luteal phase because the emptied egg sac remnant changes into a yellow body called the corpus luteum, a temporary gland that produces large amounts of progesterone. This is an inward, interior, yin time.

Finally, when hormones are at their lowest ebb, the menstrual phase occurs. Women bleed, have less energy, and rightfully should slow down. In some religions and cultures, women isolate themselves or gather together in groups during their menses, the new moon.

From the standpoint of the mind-body connection, problems often begin when the inner guidance system and natural flow of the cycle is ignored. Physical and menstrual troubles appear, especially PMS. It is easy to overlook the moon cycles and our connection with nature when the busy lifestyles of Western societies take over. Menstruation is often brushed aside unheeded. It is frequently considered taboo in modern cultures and sometimes called a curse.6

One encouraging Wise-Woman trend is to celebrate and honor our daughters when their bleeding begins at menarche, helping them to shift joyfully from their maiden to mother stage. When menopause is eventually reached and bleeding stops, another transition takes place. Children have flown away, and women leave their earlier, younger worries behind, hopefully evolving from mother to crone or Wise-Woman. They become mentors, examples of a sagely lived feminine. Many herbal grandmothers are gracing this phase. These three stages are often depicted as the Triple Goddess Triad of Maiden, Mother, and Crone (Fig. 28.4).

<!-- chunk -->

## Estrogen

Estrogen is classically a female reproductive sex hormone that peaks during the first half of the cycle and is highest just before ovulation. Its primary and traditional function is to stimulate development of female characteristics—breasts, underarm hair, and pubic hair—and to regulate the menstrual cycle. Like all sex hormones, it is stimulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Please, do not confuse this pathway with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) pathway which connects the brain to the adrenal glands located on top of the kidneys. When reproduction is involved, the hormonal pathway/axis ultimately leads to the ovaries and testes (gonads).

In the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, the hypothalamus in the brain releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) that tells the pituitary to release follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), which signals the ovaries to produce estrogen, which in turn stimulates growth of a mature egg inside. During fertile years, the highest estrogen levels are at mid cycle and indicate ovulation; the lowest levels are during menses.

Estrogen is produced in the ovaries, in fat cells, in the adrenal glands, and in the male testes. In men, it helps sperm mature and maintains libido. Estrogen is really a group of three hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

### Benefits and Functions of Estrogen

In proper amounts, estrogen has multiple benefits and functions. Its good effects keep us healthy and sane.

<!-- chunk -->

### Estrogen Dominance

Too much of a good thing can be problematic. Estrogen dominance is epidemic, a common hormonal imbalance in women of childbearing age, usually a result of not enough progesterone to counteract it.8 Xenoestrogen (environmental) exposure is a major cause, occurring via our food supply, water, personal care products, and clothing. Logical herbal therapeutic principles for estrogen dominance are to (1) Counteract estrogen by adding progesteronic herbs; (2) Decongest the liver because it has the formidable job of deconjugating used-up estrogen every month and detoxifying all those endocrine disrupters, the xenoestrogens; (3) Decrease heavy flow and clots, which inevitably appear, with antihemorrhagics. Estrogen dominance results in numerous health problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Estrogen Insufficiency

Estrogen deficiency is the flip side of estrogen dominance. It produces symptoms that look a lot like menopause and normally (but not always) occurs during that transitional time. Women experience trouble sleeping, headaches, decreased libido, irregular periods, cramps, mood swings, dry skin, and hot flashes. In men, sexual desire decreases, and there is fat around the middle. Use phytoestrogenic foods (Table 28.1), phytoestrogenic herbs, demulcents for dryness, spasmolytics for cramps, and treat any other symptoms.

Table 28.1

<!-- chunk -->

## Progesterone

Progesterone is named for progestation, the precursor to pregnancy. Progesterone hormone peaks in the second half of the cycle, after the egg has developed in the first half under the influence of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estrogen. High FSH from the follicular phase triggers luteinizing hormone (LH) to surge from the pituitary and stimulate ovulation, which is when the egg in the follicle bursts out. Progesterone levels increase as FSH decreases. The endometrial lining of the uterus gets very thick in preparation for potential implantation. If implantation does not happen, progesterone and estrogen levels drop, and with both hormones at their lowest, the uterine lining sheds during menstruation. After 2 to 7 days of bleeding, the cycle repeats every 21 to 35 days, give or take.

Progesterone, like estrogen, is regulated by the HPG axis. Because estrogen dominance is usually a result of not enough counteracting progesterone, it follows that a progesterone deficiency would make the situation even worse, and it does.

<!-- chunk -->

### Main Progesterone Functions, Excess, and Deficiency

Like estrogen, its other half, progesterone, has a lot of functions. The two hormones rise and fall by negative feedback mechanisms. It can be hard to keep their roles straight, so a handy little cheat sheet is provided in Table 28.2.

Table 28.2

## Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) and Bioidentical Hormones

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a controversial subject. Common wisdom always held that estrogen protected women from heart disease. When a woman goes through menopause, her heart disease risk increases. The Women’s Health Initiative at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was a landmark study, carried out between 1993 and 1998 to determine, among many other things, the effect of the synthetic estrogenic drug Premarin (derived from pregnant mare’s urine) and progestin (synthetic progesterone like Provera) on women who had not had hysterectomies. However, the study was shut down midstream because it was too dangerous. The hormones were actually increasing the risk of stroke, heart disease, breast cancer, and dementia, not the other way around.10 This finding was a very big deal and caused a media furor.

A debate ensued on whether or not a woman should be taking any artificial hormones at all, including BCPs or intentionally prescribed HRT for various reproductive problems. Some doctors stopped prescribing them; many didn’t. The problem with synthetic hormones is that, yes, their structure is similar enough to hook onto receptor sites, but these molecules are not an exact fit. They do the damage described in the Women’s Health Initiative study.

This brings us to bioidentical hormones, which are specially formulated and custom-made by prescription in a compounding pharmacy. These molecules fit perfectly onto receptor sites and are virtually identical to human-made hormones and are safe and effective. When HRT is used, it should always be bioidentical, be it estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, or thyroid hormone.

Natural progesterone must be extracted in a laboratory from Wild Yam root or soybeans (Fig. 28.5). Unfortunately, an herbalist cannot tincture up her own Dioscorea villosa (Wild Yam root) and expect it to have the same effect, a popular misconception in herb land. Wild Yam contains a precursor of a steroid hormone called diosgenin, a useful phytoestrogen. But diosgenin can only be converted into progesterone in a lab.11 The body cannot change diosgenin into progesterone by itself. So, homemade Wild Yam cream does not contain progesterone, although natural Wild Yam root does have a weak phyto-estrogenic (not progesteronic) effect, is a lovely smooth muscle relaxant for all kinds of cramping and can lower LDL cholesterol. You will see the hormonal effect of Wild Yam root touted repeatedly in the literature, accurately or not.

<!-- chunk -->

## Prolactin

The hormone prolactin is made by the anterior pituitary and is classically known to stimulate milk production after childbirth (lactation), hence its name. When there is no pregnancy, levels should be low, but they can become abnormally high from hypothyroidism and a prolactinoma, a surprisingly common type of benign pituitary tumor. The most common symptom from high prolactin levels is milk leakage from nipples in women and men; the hormone is present in both sexes. It increases water retention, inflammation, stress, and fatigue; shortens the luteal phase; and can stop periods completely. This action leads to anovulation and trouble getting pregnant.

The clinical takeaway is that obtaining a blood prolactin level could shed light on many unsolved reproductive problems, including infertility. Effects of abnormally high blood prolactin levels (hyperprolactinemia) are as follows:

<!-- chunk -->

## Testosterone and Male Hormone Facts

Testosterone is an androgen, the major male steroid hormone that triggers development of male sexual characteristics at puberty, such as voice changes, enlargement of penis and testes, growth of facial and body hair, and increased muscle mass. Like estrogen, it is triggered by the HPG axis. When levels are low, the hypothalamus releases gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the pituitary, which triggers the pituitary to release FSH and LH. These two stimulate the testis to produce testosterone. Testosterone is also responsible for sex drive, sperm, fat, and red blood cell production. In women, testosterone is produced in small amounts in the ovaries and, along with estrogen, helps to maintain sex drive and bone density. Androgen receptors are in all her bone cells. It is produced in the adrenals in both sexes. Testosterone facts follow.

### Restoratives and Tonics for Men and Women

This group has a normalizing effect on the reproductive organs and other actions as well. Many of the same tonics are used for men and women (Table 28.3). For instance, Ashwagandha root normalizes mood, energy levels, hormones, and overall immune function. Hawthorn berry supports the heart; Nettle herb builds blood and increases immune function and energy. Maca root keeps libido healthy and promotes energy and natural fertility. Nettle herb builds blood. Its root slows prostate growth, used historically to decrease symptoms of prostate enlargement.

Kidney yin tonics are moisturizing, nutritive, and especially useful in menopause with declining estrogen levels, dryness, and hot flashes. Kidney yang tonics help stamina, sex drive, ED, fertility, and energy in men and women. Blood tonics are nutrient dense, high in minerals, and improve blood quality. Indications for blood tonics are thin menses with watery, pale-pink blood, heavy flow with blood loss resulting in anemia, and during postpartum after blood has been lost in childbirth. Angelica Dang Gui is used in the follicular phase to enhance fertility caused by blood deficiency and is often combined with Ginger root and Cinnamon bark to protect the stomach.13

Tonics and restoratives are used to moderate other types of herbs and are included in most gynecological formulas, especially with uterine involvement, for prolapse, during childbirth, and postpartum. A famous women’s gynecology Chinese Medicine tonic is Four Things Soup or Decoction, Si Wu Tang (Box 28.2). If an emmenagogue is used to bring on menses, a tonic moderates this. If a spasmolytic is used for cramping, the restorative retains muscle tone. Tonics are used for men needing assistance with energy, libido, fertility, and testosterone building. If an herb is used to shrink the prostate, tonics balance this action.

### Phytoestrogens

Phytoestrogens are plants with estrogen-like activity (Table 28.4). They have structural similarities to human estrogens, allowing them to bind to receptor sites and to block harmful exogenous estrogens in the environment and endogenous ones produced in the body.

Phytoestrogens help women with PMS and menopausal women with hot flashes and vaginal dryness, and phytoestrogens reduce risk of stroke, osteoporosis, and breast cancer. Phytoestrogens can make human estrogen levels rise or fall, depending on need. This balancing action works similarly to a class of drugs called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs); one example is the breast cancer drug, Tamoxifen.15 SERMs are selective because they block estrogen from entering breast tissue but leave it alone in the uterus and bone where it is needed.

All sex hormones are derived from cholesterol, variations changing them into specific types. Phytoestrogens contain different active chemicals. Isoflavones are commonly found in Red Clover or Kudzu root. Steroidal saponins are in Jamaican Sarsaparilla root and Wild Yam root, and phytosterols are in Licorice root. In fact, plants with steroidal molecules have traditionally and intuitively been used for women’s menstrual functions throughout the Wise-Woman tradition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Progesteronics

Naturally occurring progesterone is not known to exist in plants in biologically active levels, but certain botanicals seem to calm down overactive estrogen (Table 28.5). Phytoestrogens, like Licorice root and other Pea family plants, have a weak binding capacity for human receptor sites, but progesterone receptor sites are pickier and more selective. Plants containing steroidal saponins (more progesteronic) and phytosterols (more estrogenic) have chemical structures similar to those of many human hormones, but whether their structures are similar to those of progesterone or estrogen is not clear. Whether and why certain plants are actually progesteronic is a debatable topic.

Dioscorea villosa (Wild Yam root), Trillium grandiflorum (Birthroot) (Fig. 28.8), and the endangered Chamaelirium luteum (Helonias root or False Unicorn root) seem to have an indirect effect, improving the balance of estrogen to progesterone. Another good herbal bet for increasing progesterone is the HPG axis level approach, which stimulates the release of FSH and LH. One of the all-time best HPG influencers is Vitex agnus-castus (Chastetree berry).

### Bleeding: Hemostatics and Emmenagogues

Some herbs exist to decrease bleeding, and others to increase bleeding (Table 28.6). Reproductive hemostatics are herbs that discourage abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding by causing capillary constriction or by speeding up blood clotting (coagulants). They are usually astringents that tighten tissue with a tropism to the uterus, such as Witch Hazel leaf or Shepherd’s Purse herb (Fig. 28.9). A normal amount of bleeding for a girl or woman to expect is 30 to 80 mL a month, or a need to change menstrual pads or regular-sized tampons three to six times a day.6 Of course this amount varies and tapers off toward the end of the cycle. Menorrhagia refers to excessive menstrual bleeding beyond reasonable parameters.

Table 28.6

Gossypium spp. (Cotton root bark)

Constricts and coagulates. Use organic. Very strong hemostatic.

Zingiber officinale (Ginger root)

For delayed periods, warming, spasmodic dysmenorrhea. Strong emmenagogue.

Capsella bursa-pastoris

(Shepherd’s purse herb)

For any type of bleeding, varicose veins. Strong hemostatic.

Artemisia spp. (Mugwort herb and other Artemisias)

For delayed periods, amenorrhea, long cycles. Strong emmenagogue.

Trillium spp. (Birthroot or Beth root)

Astringent.

For bleeding, discharges, diarrhea, prolapse. Often used pre- and postpartum. Medium-strength hemostatic.

Actaea racemosa (Black Cohosh root)

For delayed periods, spasmodic dysmenorrhea, difficult labor. Moderately strong emmenagogue.

Alchemilla vulgaris (Lady’s Mantle herb)

General for heavy menses and diarrhea.

Mitchella repens (Partridge berry). Moderately strong emmenagogue.

Hamamelis virginiana (Witch Hazel leaf)

General hemostatic and astringent for heavy menses, GI bleeding, and hemorrhoids. A capillary restorative and vasoconstrictor.

Angelica sinensis Dang Gui (Dong Quai root)

For scanty periods, amenorrhea, spasmodic dysmenorrhea, and blood deficiency.

Typha angustifolia Pu Huang (Cattail pollen)

General hemostatic for heavy menses, styptic, hematuria. Also, hypotensive, vasodilating, and antilipemic.


(Blue Cohosh root)

Moderately strong emmenagogue.

Chamaelirium luteum (Helonias root, False Unicorn root)

Mildly astringent, so helps heavy bleeding. A steroidal saponin, and progesteronic.

Salvia officinalis (Garden Sage herb)

For delayed periods, estrogenic, hot flashes especially at night. Mild emmenagogue, but a medium-strength herb.

Achillea millefolium (Yarrow herb)

Heavy menses with bright red blood, wounds, hemorrhoids, GI, phlebitis. Mild astringent. (Notice that Yarrow appears in both columns.) Its astringency stops heavy bleeding, but it brings on delayed menses because of its stimulating effect.

Achillea millefolium (Yarrow herb)

For delayed periods, a mild emmenagogue that can paradoxically stimulate menses when slowed down by exposure to cold.14 Progesteronic, venous decongesting and antispasmodic, for all kinds of cramps, and menopausal symptoms.

Cinnamomum cassia


Arrests flow, astringes, dries damp. Add 1 drop essential oil per ounce of tincture to slow bleeding.

Artemisia vulgaris

Mugwort herb

Uterine stimulant and relaxant. Can help stagnant qi and bring on periods.

For hemostatics to work, pulse dosing is used, which involves herbs given frequently and close together (Appendix A). A dosing example might be 5 mL (1 teaspoon) every 15 to 30 minutes until bleeding lessens, up to 2 hours maximum. (Note that extremely heavy bleeding that doesn’t let up could be a medical emergency.) Some important hemostatics are, from strong to weak: Cotton root bark, strongest; Goldenseal root and Shepherd’s Purse herb, next strongest; and Red root, Yarrow herb and Birthroot, medium-strength.

Emmenagogues are uterine stimulants. They increase uterine contractions and menstrual flow. Some work through stimulation because of their bitter taste, others through localized irritation.16 They do not cause miscarriages but could bring on a late period if there is no pregnancy; Ginger root and Mugwort herb are examples. Late periods could be caused by life’s occurrences, such as stress, lifestyle disruptions, relationship angst, travel, anovulation, and excessive exercise. The absence of a period for at least three previous menstrual cycle lengths or at least 6 months in a previously menstruating woman is termed amenorrhea.17 Unless reasons are natural causes such as pregnancy, breastfeeding, going off BCPs, or perimenopause, amenorrhea is generally treated with HRT, and emmenagogues are not used.

Caution: Some emmenagogues are so strong they have been used as abortifacients by ancient Wise-Women and by the Eclectics and should be used only by very experienced herbalists. These include Hedeoma pulegioides (Pennyroyal essential oil, which has caused death), Ruta graveolens (Rue herb), and Senecio spp. (Ragwort herb).6 They all can have extremely toxic effects (Table 28.6).18

### Uterine Pain, Part I: Move Blood with Venous Decongestants and Arterial Stimulants

For pain relief, we use herbs that move blood in the veins and arteries (Table 28.7). The uterine muscle is very vascular. Blood can accumulate and get congested there, causing dull, heavy cramping, especially in the luteal phase. This is called congestive dysmenorrhea. In Chinese Medicine, it is called blood congestion. This type of menstrual cramping is solved by increasing the circulation and moving accumulated venous blood away from the uterus, moving it upward, against gravity, and back to the heart. Herbs that do this are cool, dry, astringent venous decongestants that squeeze the blood up and away. Examples are Lady’s Mantle herb, Pasqueflower herb, or Shepherd’s Purse herb.

Table 28.7

Lady’s Mantle herb


Mitchella repens

Partridgeberry herb

Cinnamomum cassia


Zingiber officinalis

Zanthoxylum americanum

Prickly Ash bark

In addition to moving venous blood, arterial circulation should be encouraged because of blood becoming engorged in the uterine capillaries. Use warming arterial stimulants in small amounts in formula along with the venous decongestants. Examples here are Prickly Ash bark, Ginger root, or Cayenne pepper.

<!-- chunk -->

### Uterine Pain, Part II: Relax Smooth Uterine Muscles with Spasmolytics

Spasmolytics relax smooth uterine muscles and are used to stop cramps caused from muscle spasms (Table 28.8). It is useful to use them in conjunction with the venous and arterial blood movers just described. The former help congestive dysmenorrhea by moving pooling blood away from the uterus, and the latter relaxes the uterine muscles. Because we don’t always know the cause, it is a good idea to use them all.

### Male-Oriented Herbs

Every culture has addressed male reproductive health. Many of these herbs are traditional Chinese Medicine yang tonics, warming and energizing (Table 28.9). They address signs of incontinent urination caused by enlarged prostate, premature ejaculation, loss of libido, and low sperm count, and they tend to stimulate the HPG axis.20 By approaching the problem from that level, they can help both sexes, and Panax spp. (Ginseng root) and Epimedium Yin Yang Ho (Horny Goat weed) do just that. Although they are traditionally oriented toward males, they should not be overlooked for women, the yin principle balancing the male yang.

Other herbs that help men’s reproductive health include Ayurvedic tonics, Tribulus fruit, or Ashwagandha root. Western examples are Damiana herb and Saw Palmetto berry. Yang tonics tend to contain subgroups of predominantly androgenic/testosterone steroid hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other Herbal Reproductive Categories

There are many herbal categories discussed elsewhere in this book that are often used in reproductive formulas. Liver decongestants, tonics, and stimulators are very important to include in estrogen-dominant conditions. They improve liver function and help metabolize estrogen. Remember the bitters: berberines, the docks, and others like Blue Flag root, Chaparral leaf, Fringe Tree bark, and Dandelion root. Include herbs such as Salvia Dan Shen, Milk Thistle seed, and Poke root. Remember the lymphatic circulators in formulas for uterine fibroids, fibrocystic breasts, and other lumps: Cleavers herb, Marigold flower, Echinacea root, Red root, Pau d’arco bark, and Yellow Dock root.

Cooling and/or estrogenic herbs for hot flashes dealing with Chinese Medicine’s empty heat designation include Anemarrhena Zhi Mu (Know Mother root), Chickweed herb, Elderflower, Garden Sage leaf, Solomon’s Seal root, Schisandra Wu Wi Zi (Five Taste berry), and Scrophularia Xuan Shen (Black Figwort root).

For fertility enhancers, use the yang tonics listed earlier. Nutritious Red Clover flower is Susun Weed’s go-to fertility choice for women. Use herbs that work on the HPG axis, like Chastetree berry, Saw Palmetto berry, the ginsengs, and other adaptogens. Consider Cotton root bark, Mugwort herb, Damiana leaf, Jamaican sarsaparilla root, and Yarrow herb.

### Phase Dosing

Because of the complexity of female reproduction, sometimes it makes sense to administer different formulas at specific times of the menstrual cycle. Phase dosing is the dispensing of a separate formula at different phases (halves) of the cycle, depending on a woman’s condition, or giving a symptomatic formula during the menstrual phase. Normally the follicular phase is when estrogen dominates, the luteal phase is when progesterone peaks, and bleeding time is the menstrual phase when hormones bottom out. Here are some examples of when phase dosing might be appropriate.

Human reproduction is a major topic and we just scratched the surface. An herbalist’s clinical practice could be in this area alone. Metaphysically, the second chakra deals with sex and relationships. The menstrual cycle was approached as moon centered, moon driven, and circular. Physically, the female hormones estrogen, representing the outwardly oriented first, follicular half of the menstrual cycle, and progesterone, epitomizing the second half or luteal phase of the cycle, were explained and contrasted. This information, along with the role of FSH and LH, are basics for herbalists to internalize. The role of testosterone in men’s reproductive health is a lot easier to grasp.

Pertinent Chinese Medicine reproductive syndromes are usually related to Kidneys and Liver. Classic patent formulas that herbalists might easily use in clinic included (1) Four Things Soup or Decoction, Si Wu Tang, a female tonic to tonify blood and regulate menses. (2) Free and Easy Wanderer, Xiao Yao Wan, a multipurpose formula for PMS. (3) Rehmannia Six, Lu Wei Di Huang Wan, a timeless menopausal remedy. Any of these may be embellished or modified, depending on the situation.

The reproductive Materia Medica included many herbs encountered in other chapters, plus a few more. Black Cohosh root has enjoyed a long reputation for being the go-to phytoestrogenic plant but according to new research may not hook on to receptor sites. Consequently, it has been omitted from most of our case history formulations, usually substituted with herbs like Red Clover flower, Licorice root, or Wild Yam root.

Phase dosing is a women’s reproductive strategy to dispense herbs. The conditions chosen for case histories were those most commonly encountered but are by no means a complete collection. Please refer to the bibliography for further related references.

The legal practice of herbalism in the United States and around the world is in a state of flux. The United States comes up short with respect to legal recognition of plant medicine in comparison with the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, Australia, China, and others.

Herbal medicine and other complementary modalities are used extensively throughout Europe. Regulation and practice vary, but public demand is strong. Changes are in progress in the Netherlands and the UK. In Africa, a large percentage of the population uses some form of traditional herbal medicine, and the topic enjoys significant attention in global health debates.

Herbalists in the United States must keep their radar tuned to the doings of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), because legal use of targeted herbs can go under fire and the herbs can be quickly banned. Private herbal organizations such as the American Botanical Council keep its members informed of pertinent impending legislation. It is important to stay knowledgeable, informed, and aware of the politics of the healing arts because it could affect herbal practices and businesses in a blink. To appreciate how we got to this point historically, refer to Chapter 2.

## Historical Aspects of Herbalism in the United States

<!-- chunk -->

### Federal Drug Administration (FDA) Established by Congress in 1928

The sad story of modern herbal regulations in the United States, and the herbal profession’s association with the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) began with the passage of the Pure Food and Drugs Act in 1906. The act was passed to ensure food and drug safety and eventually merged into the FDA by 1928. The FDA’s responsibilities range from regulating new medicines and herbs to inspecting food processing centers. The organization is powerful, complete with lobbyists and millions of dollars thrown its way in the interests of large pharmaceutical companies, Big Pharma.

The FDA was originally lax about drug laws. Then in 1959, the Thalidomide scare occurred, and the situation changed. Thalidomide was an over-the-counter (OTC) drug used to treat morning sickness in pregnancy, and it caused horrible birth defects. Children were born without limbs, hands, or ears. In response, a Congressional OTC Review Panel was formed, and it directed the FDA to tighten their standards.1 Drug companies thereafter had to demonstrate safety in elaborate studies at costs of hundreds of millions of dollars. Attempts to recoup their losses caused prescription drug prices to skyrocket. This situation persists today, and research costs are used as an excuse for the exorbitant prices so many pharmaceutical companies charge for lifesaving drugs.

OTC drug producers were required to conduct expensive research not only on drugs, but also on herbs and other products in their resale inventory, products that historically had been used safely for years. As a result of their complaints and pressure, the Congressional Over the Counter Panel wrote reports called monographs, which served as the basis for including past approvals of OTC drugs and herbs previously deemed safe and effective. The catch was that the Congressional Panel only reviewed what was submitted by the drug manufacturers. Many drugs were presented, but only a limited number of herbs made it to review, primarily laxatives like Senna bark, Psyllium seed, and Cascara Sagrada herb; a few decongestants such as Peppermint and Eucalyptus essential oil; and two ingredients derived from Chinese Ephedra Ma Huang.

These were only a tiny fraction of the more than 100 herbs that had historically and clinically been deemed safe and effective and that were listed in the United States Pharmacopeia (USP). For instance, Valerian-based sleep aids were available in pharmacies before World War II, but Valerian root was dropped in place of drug sedative antihistamines such as Benadryl. As of 2020, as far as herbalists are concerned, the outcome of this sorry tale is that any drug or herb not grandfathered into the USP after the Thalidomide scare must now undergo the same expensive, time-consuming testing the FDA requires of all new drugs. From the 1920s to the present, the inclusion of healing herbs was rapidly dropped from the USP.2

<!-- chunk -->

### The Important Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) 1994

The Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act (DSHEA) was passed by the United States Congress in 1994, and all herbalists need to know its specifications, definitions, and requirements. Herbs are considered dietary supplements or foods. They are not considered drugs. A drug is legally defined as a substance “intended for use in the diagnosis of, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.”3 The fact that herbs are not considered drugs has pros and cons. Herbs, unlike drugs, cannot have medical claims made about them, even though they have been used as effective medicine for centuries. On the other hand, herbs don’t require the same extensive testing as a drug. For example, an herb label cannot claim that Goldenseal root will cure the flu (a medical claim), but it can state that it supports the immune system. Herbal product labels and internet statements must be extremely vague and unclear about an herb’s therapeutic effects and uses. To be designated a drug, it must undergo rigorous and expensive testing and be FDA approved, which is about impossible to accomplish without large financial backing.

The DSHEA spells out regulations regarding manufacture and sale of dietary supplements and defines permissible labeling claims. A dietary supplement is a product intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one of more of these dietary ingredients: a vitamin, a mineral, an herb or other botanical, or an amino acid.4 (Tobacco is excluded from this classification.)

The DSHEA also outlines safety requirements for new dietary ingredients. Still in effect as of early 2020, it allows the FDA to consider petitions that would allow manufacturers of herbs and dietary supplements to make medicinal claims. To date, very few medical claims have been approved. One approved claim was that soy protein helps to lower cholesterol.

Generally, the FDA has declined many requests to reopen the OTC review process to accommodate healing herbs. Thus medicinal herbs are sold as dietary supplements, a designation several rungs down the ladder from a drug, significantly decreasing its status. For now, herbalists must be very careful not to call an herb a drug.

### The Standardization Issue

Drugs are standardized. Most herbs are not. Standardization means that one or more components (deemed the active ingredients) are present in a specific, guaranteed amount, usually expressed as a percentage. It guarantees that the consumer gets a product in which the chemistry of the product is specific from batch to batch. In a strong, potentially toxic drug, it is critical to know how much is being delivered every time. Nevertheless, there are arguments for and against this specification (Table 29.1).

Table 29.1

• The exact amount of active chemicals or constituents is known in measured amounts.

• The stated plant is guaranteed to actually be in the product.

• Nothing else is added.

• The herbal products are reproducible, batch for batch.

• A plant has synergy. It is more than the sum of its parts. The combination of many constituents, active or not, helps it work in a safe manner.

• A whole plant is milder acting than one extracted chemical. Overdose is rare.

• The entire chemical makeup of a plant might be unknown. Its so-called active ingredient may not be the only therapeutic factor.

• Herbs have been safely used for centuries with no institutional interference.

• Herbs are considered a food, not a drug under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act.

• If an herb is standardized, it is being treated like a drug.

Plants follow nature’s standard, not the drug model. There are many, many constituents in any given plant existing in varying amounts, depending on climate, location, soil, and other factors. Dandelion greens harvested in one location are not exact chemical replicas of those growing elsewhere. In drugs, so-called active ingredients are isolated and often artificially synthesized in a lab. An adult-sized tablet of Bayer aspirin always contains 325 mg of acetylsalicylic acid. That is a given standardized amount, the bioactive chemical.

Herbs are synergistic and many ingredients, perhaps some not yet chemically isolated, play an important role in an herb’s action. What may be toxic in isolation is often much safer when combined with other chemicals in the plant, tempering the toxicity. There may be currently unidentified constituents contributing to a plant’s healing magic. Once removed, the botanical becomes less effective.

As Big Pharma gets increasingly interested in entering the herbal market, they see the potential to make big bucks. But money cannot be made from natural Dandelion greens growing in the earth. An apple can’t be patented. So, the way around this profitability problem is to isolate the assumed active ingredient, send it to a lab, and have it synthetically produced. The active ingredient is studied, clinical trials are done to establish safety, and FDA approval for the newly created drug follows. The plant has become a phytopharmaceutical, an herbal drug. It is now patentable and with patents come exclusive rights to manufacture, produce, and aggressively market the product, and to rake in the profits. This limits the broad range of traditionally known properties and uses of an herb, in favor of a single-use mentality based on the action of a particular active ingredient. Do herbalists want to give up their power in that way?

### Standardized Herbal Extracts

Earlier on (Chapter 7), the strength of an herbal tincture and extract was expressed in terms of its weight-to-volume (w/v) concentration. A w/v tincture was said to range from a 1:5 (meaning 1-to-5) to a 1:3 concentration of whole herb to menstruum. A weight-to-volume extract was considered to be a stronger liquid tincture, having a 1:2 to 1:1 concentration of whole herb to menstruum. The lower the second number, the stronger the tincture. The first number is always 1. These tinctures and extracts ensure that one part of whole herb was infused in a specified proportion of liquid menstruum. It gives no information about amounts of any specific chemical constituents contained in the whole herb.

Standardized extracts are different and are approaching the status of drugs. Instead of a w/v ratio, they are expressed as a weight-to-weight (w/w) ratio. The numbers are in the opposite order from w/v tinctures or extracts. For instance, a 4:1 (meaning 4 to 1) concentration of a standardized extract means that a powdered extract contains the extracted constituents from 4 g of starting material in 1 g of finished extract. Stated another way, 1 part of the extract is equivalent to or derived from 4 parts crude herb.5 A 10:1 extract means 10 parts of raw plant was used to create 1 part of extract. The higher the first number, the stronger the extract. The second number is always 1 in the ratio.

Advanced analytical methods have taken herbal production one step further toward attaining drug status, a determination of active ingredient (in milligrams or percentage) present in the extract. The plant is manufactured into extremely strong liquid or solid form. Commercial fluid and solid extracts get their strength by distilling off some of the alcohol by processes known as vacuum distillation and countercurrent filtration. To convert a fluid extract into a solid or powder, the liquid solvent must be removed. This removal is done by either method just mentioned, or by thin layer evaporation, a type of drying out procedure.5 What is left is then ground into a powder, a solid extract. Ordinarily, 4:1 is the typical concentration of a solid extract.

Proceeding down the road toward drug creation, standardized products can be analyzed in a laboratory to ensure that the extract is guaranteed to contain what is considered the active component at an accepted standardized level in milligrams or to contain a specific percentage of a marker compound, the biochemical constituent characteristic of the plant.2 A saving grace (distinguishing them from an official drug) is that the entire plant and all its constituents still remain in the extract with its synergistic factors intact. This is a bit better than an isolated phytopharmaceutical, a botanical product reduced to one or several plant substances or active ingredients. The following bulleted list gives examples of herbal standardizations on the market and products based either on active components or characteristic marker compounds.

Arriving at a truly standardized extract requires expensive technology that only large companies have at their disposal, almost certainly pushing small businesses and stand-alone herbalists out of the picture. It is far beyond the scope of small apothecaries, folk methods, and kitchen tincture making. The traditional w/v method is no longer sufficient in the eyes of Big Pharma.

### Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Introduced Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) Status 1958

Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) is the designation the FDA gave to food additives in 1958. However, the label has little consistency or clarity and is not as good as it sounds. For a substance to be considered GRAS, it has to meet certain criteria. Substances that were in general use as food additives prior to January 1, 1958, were grandfathered in for this designation, based on common knowledge gained through a history of safe use. No further safety testing was required.6

Substances put into use after January 1, 1958 are considered GRAS only if their safety is based on scientific procedures and research. GRAS status does not have to be affirmed by the FDA, and it is legal for GRAS additives to be based on the research of qualified experts in the food industry, without requiring independent investigation. A conflict of interests, perhaps?

Furthermore, GRAS status is designated for substances considered safe for ingestion as additives in foods taken orally. No testing is required for other paths of body entry. Toxicity can vary greatly, depending on route of administration. The fragrance industry and the essential oil industry, which sell products that enter the body through the nose and the skin, both use GRAS status.

Many herbal products fall into a gray area of regulation. About half the herbs sold by the herb industry are not on the GRAS list but are widely imported and sold for food use. Their omission does not imply that they are unsafe. For example, Barley and Arrowroot are not on the GRAS list of food additives, yet these foods have been safely ingested for hundreds of years. Examples of herbs that are included on the GRAS list range alphabetically from Alfalfa herb and Red Algae to Yucca root and Zedoary bark. Listed essential oils range from Alfalfa, Allspice, Almond, and Cherry bark to Ylang Ylang,7 implying safety in commonly used quantities. The GRAS status list may be found on the FDA website,8 but the designation does not appear on most product labels.

### Wise-Woman Tradition Continues: The Self-Help Movement 1960s to Present

Women’s status in healing and herbalism has come full circle or, more accurately, full spiral. The Women’s Self-Help Movement that began in the 1960s and 1970s is thriving and stresses the importance of taking charge of one’s health without total trust and dependence on the medical establishment. The heart-centered Wise-Woman Tradition is being reinvented with a different name. Of course, this passage of herbal lore and wisdom handed down through generations has always existed. Many Wise-Men have joined, adding and blending their important yang to the yin. Empowering folks to take responsibility for their own healing is the way of the herbalist. We are reclaiming our power.

The Wise-Woman Tradition cites the 12th century mystic, prophet, and herbalist Hildegard von Bingen to be the first acknowledged woman who actually wrote anything down, moving us from an oral to a written tradition. Many courageously followed her example, and countless well-respected herbalists enjoyed a revival in the 1960s and 1970s.

Individuals of the modern herbalist movement are numerous. One such Wise-Woman elder was Juliette de Bairacli Levy, who passed in 2009. She was a breeder of Afghan hounds, a friend of the Romani people, and a pioneer of holistic veterinary medicine. Juliette of the Herbs is a classic film about her life.9 Another beloved grandmother was Hannah Kroeger, at one time owner of the only herb shop in Boulder, Colorado. She dispensed her healing wisdom along with packets of herbs in the 1950s. Hannah’s wheat germ and carrot juice were revolutionary items at the time. She was a Boulder institution.

Present-day herbal grandmothers and grandfathers range from folk herbalists to scientists to modern healthcare providers. Many have written books leaving their legacy. A few well-known grandmothers are Rosemary Gladstar, Mindy Green, Feather Jones, Susun Weed, Brigitte Mars, Lisa Ganora, Rosalee de la Forêt, Kiva Rose, and Aviva Romm. The male principle has contributed stars such as Jim Duke, Christopher Hobbs, Michael Tierra, Michael Moore, Matthew Wood, Stephen Buhner, Simon Mills, Kerry Bone, Peter Holmes, and Dr. John R. Christopher. (For those omitted, my deep apologies.)

### National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) 1998

The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) was founded in 1998 under National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States. Its purpose is to conduct scientific research on complementary and integrative health approaches, so it can provide well-informed recommendations to the public. It is interesting that NIH played around with appropriate naming of its center. They went through three names. It was originally called the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM), then the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). Now it is known as the National Center for Complimentary and Integrative Medicine (NCCIH). Notice that the word alternative was eventually dropped; whereas complementary and integrative were either added or retained. The implication is that holistic medicines have moved up a notch and are now considered legitimate parts of health care delivery that merge into the whole, rather than a last-ditch resort or an alternative. Herbalism, chiropractic, massage, reflexology, and many others presently integrate with and complement status quo allopathic medicine.

NCCIH has funding in the millions of dollars. It is used for studies, surveys, and research, including grants and training. One NCCIH 2007 survey conducted on the subject of pain found that American adults who use complementary health approaches to treat or manage pain spent an estimated $14.9 billion out of pocket. The four types of pain with the highest estimated out-of-pocket spending on complementary approaches were back, neck, joint, and arthritic pain. Back pain was the number-one pain disorder.10

Because the NCCIH funds scientific research on complementary and integrative health, an herbalist can apply for a grant or funding to be trained as a researcher. It is telling and encouraging that the U.S. government finally finds complementary health worth investigating.

## State of Herbalism Around the World

### Kampo and the Japanese Pharmacopeia (JP) 1886

In Japan, herbal medicine has been used effectively for over 1400 years; the first version of the official Japanese Pharmacopeia (JP) was published in 1886. Japanese Medicine consists of traditional folk use of raw herbs and Kampo, a Japanese adaptation of traditional Chinese Medicine and the official medicine of Japan. Many Kampo herbal formulations dispensed in granules and powdered forms (designated in Japan as drugs) are covered under their national health insurance. Kampo herbals are regulated in a manner similar to the regulation of drugs in the West.

The 14th edition of the JP lists 165 herbal ingredients that were approved for use in Kampo remedies. The most common herb listed is Glycyrrhiza uralensis Gan Cao (Licorice root), which appears in 94 of Tsumura formulas, the leading manufacturer of Kampo medicines in Japan.11

<!-- chunk -->

### World Health Organization (WHO) 1948

The World Health Organization (WHO) directs and coordinates international health within the United Nations’ system. It defines traditional use of herbal medicines as having had “long historical use that is well-established and widely acknowledged to be safe and effective and may be accepted by national authorities.” The WHO further and reasonably concludes that “a traditional medicine is the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures.” Their function is to “help mothers and children survive and thrive so they can look forward to a healthy old age.” It ensures “the safety of the air people breathe, the food they eat, the water they drink, and the medicines and vaccines they need.”12 The founding date of the WHO was April 7, 1948, and nations celebrate World Health Day annually on April 7.

### The Pharmacopeia of the People’s Republic of China (PPRC) 1953

Herbal medicine is part of Chinese culture. Over the last century, traditional Chinese Medicine has coexisted with allopathic medicine. Hospitals have units for traditional medicine, and most rural doctors are able to provide either modality. Doctors are trained in both, and the two systems are practiced side by side at every level of the health care system. Herbal medicine plays an enormous and respected role.

The Pharmacopoeia of the People’s Republic of China (PPRC) began publication in China in 1953. Tellingly, Volume One is the herbal volume that covers single herbs and fixed herbal formulas, the patents. Volume Two is the Western medicine volume that addresses conventional pharmaceuticals.13 Additional volumes have been added over the years. In China, the word drug applies to plants and plant medicines, and botanicals have equal footing with allopathic remedies.

Monographs in the English edition appear in alphabetical order according to the pharmaceutical name, indicating the plant part used (Glycyrrhiza radix), and then by Latin name (Glycyrrhiza uralensis), giving the genus and species. Some of the PPRC features reflecting China’s long history of traditional Chinese herbal medicine include thousands of herbal monographs, application of contemporary analytical technologies, emphasis on safety, protection, sustainable development of traditional remedies, and development of green standards.

### The United Kingdom and The British Pharmacopoeia (BP) 1968

Ever since Henry VIII ordained parliament to pass the Herbalist’s Charter in 1543, (Chapter 2) to assure himself access to herbal treatment for his painfully gouty ulcers, herbalists in the UK and its present and former territories, such as Australia, have had an amazing amount of freedom to practice and dispense herbal medicine. The first issue of the British Pharmacopoeia (BP) was published in 1864, although its legal status didn’t occur until 1968.14 The BP is used by individuals and organizations involved in pharmaceutical research, development, manufacture, and testing.

King Henry VIII’s ordained freedom to practice herbalism now seems to be under attack and flux, with pressure from some factions to create a licensure requirement for the practice of herbal medicine.15 With the advent of and subsequent withdrawal of Britain from the European Union (EU), the situation has become more complicated and muddier in terms of an herbalist’s access to herbs, herbal products, and formulas. Herb shops and apothecaries that once freely sold herbs to the public had to undergo an expensive and complicated licensing process to comply with EU standards, resulting in many herbs disappearing from the market.

Depending on issues such as claims, presentation, and dosage, a single substance can be designated a food or a medicine. Echinacea spp., for example, can be marketed as a fully licensed product or as a medicine exempt from licensing. Garlic bulb can be a food or a medicine. Saw Palmetto berry can be a food, a medicine exempt from licensing, or a fully licensed product. The British Herbal Medicine Association tries to keep this all straight and its members informed, as the legal situation of herbals remains in flux.

### Germany’s Commission E, Established 1978

Germany’s Commission E monographs stand out as the world’s most authoritative government-sponsored, expert-developed information on medicinal herbs. An Expert Advisory Panel similar to the FDA’s earlier OTC Review Panel, routinely publishes monographs that list uses, dosages, side effects, and any known drug/herb interactions. It also lists herbs deemed unsafe. So far, they have declared more than 300 herbs to be safe and effective.16 Commission E monographs can be obtained in English translation from the American Botanical Council (ABC).

German herb companies are allowed to make medicinal claims in line with Commission E monographs, which are intended to inform consumers, not provide a scientific basis for safety. Legally, herbals are considered to be medicines in Germany and are distributed through OTC sales in pharmacies and by medical prescription through pharmacies. Herbals are, in principle, reimbursable by the health insurance system, unless special criteria for their exclusion apply, such as substances negatively assessed by Commission E. Herbal medicines are not prescription-bound but can be prescribed by healthcare providers for reimbursement.17 What an enlightened idea.

### Therapeutic Goods Act Regulations of Australia (TGA) 1989

In Australia, medicinal products containing herbs, vitamins, minerals, nutritional supplements, homeopathies, and certain aromatherapy preparations are considered complementary medicines and regulated as medicines under the Therapeutic Goods Act (TGA) of 1989.18 It is the national framework for the regulation of herbs to ensure quality, safety, and performance. It is based on a risk management approach designed to ensure public health and safety and at the same time frees industry from any unnecessary regulatory burden. Australian manufacturers of all medicines must be licensed, and their manufacturing processes must comply with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice (Chapter 30). The TGA does not regulate practitioners; it regulates products, which must all be licensed.

### Canadian Natural and Non-Prescription Health Products Directorate (NNHPD) 2004

Canada is a country that enjoys free medical care and subsidized medicine. That said, its provisions apply only to orthodox medicine, which also covers supplements prescribed by naturopathic healthcare providers that are tax deductible within certain parameters.

The Canadian Natural and Non-Prescription Health Products Directorate (NNHPD) is the regulating authority for natural health products for sale in Canada. According to WHO, herbal medicines are regulated as drugs in Canada and must therefore conform to labeling and other requirements, as set out in the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations.19 This proviso means that, in contrast to requirements in the United States, large numbers of herbal medicines with indication claims are legally on the Canadian market.

To be legally sold in Canada, natural health products must have a product and site license. This requirement applies neither to health care practitioners who compound products on an individual basis for their patients nor to retailers. Canada considers traditional usage to be the use of a medicinal ingredient within a cultural belief system or healing paradigm for at least 50 consecutive years. One example is Traditional Chinese Medicine. This 50-year time span was chosen to represent two generations, allowing possible reproductive effects to be identified.

## Herbal Timeline

The herbal timeline (Table 29.2) is a continuation of events that have occurred since we left off in Chapter 2 with mention of Rene Caisse’s Essiac formula. This timeline proceeds with happenings and landmark legislation in the United States, pharmacopeas, and regulations from around the world, and the founding of notable herbal organizations (Chapter 30).

Table 29.2


It is evident from this historical overview that the United States lags behind many countries in its legal recognition and acceptance of herbal remedies for everyday use. Major reasons are politics, economics, protection of turf, and unwillingness to change. The situation fluctuates, and the herbal community has a responsibility to stay current and aware of impending legislation that might work for or against us. There is strength in numbers and in staying connected.

Regulations imposed by the FDA and the DSHEA tend to represent and favor Big Pharma at the expense of herbalists and the general public, who so frequently turn to complementary remedies. The two sides could ideally make a harmonious pairing in the interests of national health. Regardless of laws and regulations, herbal medicine always was and will be practiced.

As more herbal research is conducted, and new healing plants are discovered worldwide, particularly in our rain forests, undiscovered and wondrous remedies of the future are silently growing. Many drugs were derived from plants in the first place. A renaissance is occurring in herbal medicine, not because of herbalists already part of the chorus, but from public interest and renewed scientific inquiry into healing plants.

Pertinent issues and information are presented for 21st century herbalists hoping to get out into the real world and use their skills. Facts and figures that substantiate the dramatic upswing of herbal usage in the last 30 years or more in the United States are given; not a bad marketing tool.

Arguments for and against herbal licensure are explored, as is the advent of the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and how they are bound to affect any herbalist desiring to produce and sell herbal products. Herbalists, as members of a respected profession, have a responsibility to support and to benefit from our professional organizations.

Just as a knowledge of plant medicine is our ultimate health insurance policy, seed banks are vital ways to preserve our plant DNA. The Millennium Seed Bank Partnership coordinated by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in the United Kingdom, is one such endeavor. A collection of ideas for herbal entrepreneurship and avenues of employment is presented, followed up with a photo gallery showing actual herbalists in action.

## Worldwide Popularity of Herbalism and Other Holistic Modalities

In the United States, herbs and herbalists are enjoying an upswing in popularity. We are once again in the midst of a paradigm shift, where many traditional practitioners, doctors, nurses, and pharmacists are beginning to appreciate and embrace our buried lore. Positive attitudes and an openness to herbal medicine can be attributed to people taking responsibility for their own health and self-care, coupled with disillusionment about the medical system. In 2016 herbal supplement sales in the United States increased more than 7% from the year before. The top three best sellers were Horehound herb (Marrubium vulgare), Cranberry berry (Vaccinium macrocarpon), and Echinacea spp.1

Prestigious allopathic medical journals such as The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), and others, publish studies and articles on the benefits of healing herbs. Public interest and demand have played a role in changing the status quo of the medical and herbal fields. For example, it is no accident that the well-used and respected Physician’s Desk Reference (PDR), a collection of all prescription drugs available in the United States, now includes an herbal volume, the PDR for Herbal Medicines, though it is a very conservative take on herbal medicine. Nevertheless, it became necessary for allopathic healthcare providers, in self-defense, to understand and learn about botanicals and their possible interactions with the drugs they prescribe and the surgeries they perform.

It is telling that many of the pharmaceutical chemicals currently available to allopathic healthcare providers have a long history of use as herbal remedies. These chemicals include codeine and morphine from the Opium poppy, digitalis present in Foxglove herb, and quinine in the bark of the Cinchona tree. In the over-the-counter (OTC) scenario, we have capsicum in Cayenne pepper used in arthritis creams, menthol from Peppermint herb, and camphor from the Camphor tree featured in Bengay. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) approximately 25% of modern drugs used in the United States have been derived from plants.2

About 90% of the population of African countries and 70% in India currently use herbal medicine for some aspect of primary health care. In the United States, $17 billion was spent on alternative and complementary medicine in 1990, and that amount had doubled by 1997. Herbal medicines are common in Europe; France and Germany lead the pack in OTC sales. Herbal medicinal products have been their citizens’ first choice in the treatment of minor diseases or disorders, evidenced by the success and prestige of Commission E monographs.3

### The Eisenberg National Survey

A well-known 1997 study, the David Eisenberg National Survey, showed that one out of three people in the United States used complementary therapies. Most people paid from out-of-pocket sources, declining to share this information with their doctors. Holistic health is rarely covered by health insurance. In 2002 the most significant change revealed a 50% jump in the use of herbal supplements over the past 5 years, and that has been growing. Next up was yoga at 40%. The Eisenberg survey concluded that alternative medicine use and expenditures increased substantially between 1990 and 1997, attributable primarily to an increase in the proportion of the population seeking alternative therapies, rather than increased visits to doctors.4 These are significant and hopeful findings.

### Market Report from HerbalGram States that Herbal Sales are Up

HerbalGram: The Journal of the American Botanical Council reported that “Herbal Dietary Supplement Sales in United States increased 6.8% in 2014, marking the 11th consecutive year of growth … American consumers spent roughly $6.4 billion on herbal supplements according to aggregated market statistics provided by Nutrition Business Journal.” The top supplements in order of expenditures from 2013 to 2014 were Turmeric root, Wheat or Barley Grass, Flaxseed and Flaxseed oil, Spirulina, Milk Thistle seed, Elderberry, Maca root, Echinacea root, and Oregano herb.1 There is always some herb in vogue, a popular herb of the year. Apparently, in 2013 Turmeric root led the pack.

## The Legal Status of Herbalists in the United States

<!-- chunk -->

### Licensure and Implications

Herbalism is not regulated in the United States. At this writing (January 2020), there are no herbal licenses awarded in any state. However, state licenses are required for other medical professionals such as doctors, nurses, acupuncturists, chiropractors, massage therapists, and in certain states, naturopaths and reflexologists. No licensure means herbalists practicing clinical herbalism operate in legal shades of gray. The profession is vulnerable to unwarranted legal restrictions, making all professional herbalists more or less work outside the boundaries of the law.

Some herbalists are fine with potential licensure requirements, and others vehemently oppose any regulation whatsoever, preferring to stay off the radar, hoping they can continue to do what they have always done well in peace and quiet. Some might feel outraged or threatened, having always practiced herbalism in their communities and wish to pass on the Wise-Woman/Wise-Men traditions, give sage council, and be allowed to dispense the medicine of our plant allies freely and without fear.

Before you jump to any conclusions for or against, consider the path it takes to even obtain a state licensure requirement. When none exists, a profession usually works at it state by state, provided a group, organization, or individual is motivated to do so. It is a long process that involves lobbying, public speaking, and educating state legislators as to why licensing is even necessary, what an herbalist act (ordinance) would look like, and what the educational standards should be. This last is a sticky topic (see later section). Licensing is a trade-off, where certain liberties are exchanged for greater privileges. The ensuing section lays out some of the arguments.

### Scope of Practice

Medical doctors, chiropractors, and licensed naturopaths have the authority to diagnose, treat, or prescribe. Acupuncturists do, provided they adhere to Chinese Medicine diagnoses. Nurses do not. Exactly what a profession’s scope of practice entails is enumerated in their Practice Act. With no legal backup, herbalists must be extremely careful about being construed as practicing medicine without a license, including not diagnosing, treating, or prescribing. One way to dance around this is to use descriptions such as Chinese syndromes (Kidney Qi Deficiency), and by defining illnesses by their symptoms rather than actually naming a disease. We cannot assign a client a Western diagnosis such as the flu, pneumonia, or Alzheimer’s. We can suggest a treatment but cannot prescribe one. It’s all about using careful and correct wording.

### Educational Requirements, Herb Schools and Certifications

Licensure assures that the licensee has acquired a minimum amount of knowledge in her field to practice safely and do no harm due to lack of training. Licensure is designed to protect the public, and the state gives an examination to verify this. Once passed, the person becomes a state registered something. Licensure confirms that the practitioner has received proper training, is not a quack, or in our case (if it existed), would assure no one could claim to be a master herbalist after a paltry 2-week training, and that said herbalist will not endanger anyone’s life because of insufficient education.

It is hard to get any group or profession to agree on what an herbal education should include, much less to decide on the number of training hours. What would or should be included on a licensure examination to assure competency? Should an herbalist be required to know all traditions? Or is Western herbalism enough? What about people trained in Ayurvedic but not Western, and so on? Should they be required to study and be tested on a tradition they will never use? (Massage therapists and others have run into this exact bitter debate and dilemma.)

From a legal standpoint, lack of licensure means that titles and certificates awarded by any U.S. herb school have no legal clout, regardless of quality or hours spent in class. With licensure, schools are generally required to follow state-approved curricula. It would be up to the herbal community to make those educational recommendations. Most state licensing agencies do not have a clue what an herbalist is, what s/he does, or what an herbal education would/should look like. Whereas a licensed nurse attended an accredited college, followed a set curriculum preparing her to pass the state Nursing Board Exam, and received a license to perform nursing within a stated scope of practice. Herbalists have no such opportunity, and some would just as soon not upset the status quo.

What about the many competent herbalists who have apprenticed or are self-taught and do not have the proper credentialing on paper? They could still be recognized for their knowledge, perhaps by passing an exam to fulfill any licensure requirements. Or as with other newly formed licensures, they could be grandfathered in because they were in practice prior to the law’s inception. They would not have to return to school for a certificate and still be allowed to legally practice.

<!-- chunk -->

### Financial Aspects

Everything has a cost. Even setting up a state exam and oversight board with a paid staff involves funding. So herbalists (as other licensees) would be charged fees to obtain and maintain their license. Then there are continuing education requirements with personnel needed to monitor those. Therefore, it could be argued that licensure is just a state money-making venture, where periodic fees are charged to oversee and regulate the whole shebang.

However, with the expenses of licensure comes legitimacy. And with legal clout, third-party payment from insurance companies is more likely. It is doubtful any insurance company will reimburse a dime for herbal services rendered unless they are delivered by a licensed herbalist or are recognized under the umbrella of an already licensed acupuncturist, naturopath, or chiropractor who is additionally trained in botanical medicine.

With insurance available for herbal clients, more people could afford it, and practices would increase along with incomes. Then the insurance companies would have to be billed; and taking the time and filling out all that paperwork is itself a learning curve. Do we want to go down that rabbit hole?

Licensure would supposedly protect the public from malpractice and poorly trained herbalists. But an herbalist would then need to have (and pay for) malpractice insurance. State licensure laws require proof of that. No one wants to be sued, and, yes, herbal medicine has a very good safety record (especially compared with allopathic), but even so, it does open up another can of worms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ethics and Self-Regulation

The fact that there is no state regulation or licensure means that herbalists must regulate themselves. This is something all professions do (with or without licensure). We need to be mature enough to adhere to a self-imposed code of conduct, moral principles, values, or ethics, and do the right thing, so as not to misrepresent our knowledge or to cause harm through irresponsible practice. Self-regulation is supposed to weed out those who practice dangerous herbal medicine.

For instance, the American Herbalists Guild (AHG) has a code of ethics that lays out how herbalists should conduct themselves, including full disclosure of education, not misrepresenting skills, maintaining confidentiality, exercising professional courtesy, using quality botanicals, avoiding needless therapy, and other items. Should an infringement or complaint occur, AHG has a complaint-resolution procedure to investigate and ultimately revoke membership.5 Beyond that, there is no recourse, whereas with state licensure, a license could be withdrawn because of malpractice, and that person would no longer be allowed to practice.

Licensure can arguably be good or bad.6 As far as legalities go, at this point the best an herbalist can do in the United States is to get the very best possible herbal training, similar to the curriculum laid out in this text, and to be very conscious and careful. Lack of licensure has not stopped countless successful herbalists out there with a passion and desire to practice.

<!-- chunk -->

### Practice Herbalism Safely

To be safe, herbalists can recommend remedies, educate clients, and dispense specific herbs that are mild to medium strength and certainly not very strong or toxic plants without appropriate knowledge and experience. Err on the side of safety and refer onward and outward if unsure. This recommendation means using intuition and book learning. If you get a funny feeling, act on it. Refuse to treat and refer out to a qualified practitioner. When in doubt, refer it out. Only suggest remedies within your comfort zone. This also means sizing up your client and yourself. Do you have a trusting relationship? If an herbal side effect occurs (and someday, it inevitably will) what will you do? What will they do? In all my years of practice, I have never been sued. On the other hand, I would never have taken on a cancer patient without a physician on board, nor would I have handled a situation by myself that I felt was beyond my ability. The many reasons, pro and con, for herbal licensure are summarized in Table 30.1.

## Legal Obligations for Making and Selling Herbal Products

<!-- chunk -->

### Good Manufacturing Practice

An important area where transitions are affecting herbalists (and OTC supplement producers) in the United States concerns FDA regulations regarding the manufacture of food supplements, which includes herbal products. It is a system for ensuring that products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards. It requires having a method in place so an herb can be tracked from the ground to the consumer. Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) was put into effect in the United States by the FDA on June 25, 2007; other countries and the World Health Organization have their own versions.

Herbalists are now being considered healthcare professionals who are more noticeable and accepted than ever. Traditional folk methods of producing herbal remedies for public sale are no longer part of the modern world. Change and transitions are inevitable, and the 2000s are a new age. Setting up an apothecary from the establishment of your practice with a system in place to follow current GMP guidelines will be much easier than playing catch-up later or perhaps having to reinvest in brand new, expensive equipment.

Good Manufacturing Practice, as applied to herbalists, is beginning its baby steps in the United States. Regulators and practitioners are feeling their way, determining how to adapt it into a workable system for herbal remedy production. Acupuncture schools and Chinese Medicine apothecaries are also involved. No clear guidebook exists for herbalists yet, but organizations such as the American Herbalists Guild are presenting classes and seminars on the practical aspects of accomplishing GMP compliance. This information will inevitably become part of herb school curricula. As learning tools, their student apothecaries will have to comply.

Naturally, healing botanicals would do better having their own stand-alone category, rather than being lumped into the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (Chapter 29). Herbs are neither food supplements nor drugs. If they must be regulated, it would make more sense to have guidelines structured specifically to herbal medicine, instead of fitting a square peg into an existing round hole.

<!-- chunk -->

### Who Has to Comply, and Why?

GMP applies to any herbalist turning raw material or herb (dietary supplement) into a product sold directly to the public. If an herbalist is planning on producing and selling ingestible or topical herbal products, such as teas, tinctures, percolations, glycerites, capsules, lip balms, lotions, and so forth, GMP regulations will affect how to set up the business, whether in-house or online. The larger and more visible an enterprise, the more exposed and greater the pressure for compliance. As with licensure and standardization issues, how an herbalist chooses to use this information will be for her to decide. It is a far cry from kitchen folk herbalists who weren’t concerned with such details. The point is to be aware and informed.

Once a method is in place, it becomes routine and will just need occasional tweaking, as more efficient and easier procedures are established by trial and error. I am acquainted with two forward-thinking herb shop proprietresses, both complying with GMP, who have shared their logs and record-keeping systems with me. The particulars are uniquely individual with no single template, but both satisfy GMP inspections and requirements. Each herbalist must accomplish GMP compliance as they see fit.

The GMP inspectors themselves are going through a learning curve. It is doubtful if most FDA and health department examiners even understand what herbal medicine and remedy production are about. Some get this concept; others have nary a clue, and in such cases we must patiently and kindly educate them.

<!-- chunk -->

### Getting Down to Details of GMP Compliance

The FDA’s rationale for GMP is to ensure the supplement industry delivers “safe, accurately labeled products to the consumer.” They consider it an important tool to help ensure dietary supplement products’ “quality, purity, consistency, and safety.”7

In plain English, this means that if you purchase a pound of raw Milk Thistle seed from Mountain Rose Herbs, make it into a tincture, and then use it as one of six herbs in a client’s formula and she has a bad reaction, there must be a system to trace that herb back to its source, to determine whether, what, and where a mistake was made. Was it the fault of the grower, the harvesters, the herb company, or an error in your production methods of a perfectly fine and correctly identified and labeled herb? Or was it an individual reaction your client had to an uncontaminated, properly labeled and identified herb prepared in your shop?

This process really isn’t a bad idea. If practicing due diligence, it is very unlikely an herbalist will be sued when operating in good faith according to regulations, having built up a trusting herbalist-client relationship. Customers and clients can also purchase products with confidence, assured they are getting a pure, unadulterated, high-quality remedy containing what is stated on the label in the specified proportions. It may seem daunting, depending on your penchant for detail, but it is doable. For an herbalist GMP, broadly speaking, breaks down into these elements:

<!-- chunk -->

### Recalls

Recalls are actions taken by a firm to remove a faulty product from the market. GMP provides a way to determine exactly what the problem is and where down the line the problem occurred, so that appropriate measures can be taken. It is not a crime to make an honest mistake; but it is criminal and unethical if there is not full disclosure or there are no measures taken to rectify the situation.

One of the most notorious drug recalls in history was the so-called “Tylenol murders” in the west side of Chicago in 1982. Drug company Johnson & Johnson recalled 31 million bottles of Tylenol-branded acetaminophen capsules from store shelves. The capsules had been laced with deadly potassium cyanide. Seven people died in the original poisonings and several more from copycat crimes. Before it was over, Johnson & Johnson changed their bottle tops to tamper-proof safer designs and offered replacement products free of charge. This led to massive OTC product packaging reforms and to federal antitampering laws.8 That’s why drugs and OTC medicines are now so impossibly hard to open.

Another recall happened on February 22, 2013, when Herbalife International of America announced the voluntary recall of certain lots of its niche Instant Healthy Meal Nutritional Shake Mix packets because the label identified the product as dairy-free. This was not true, because the drink had trace amounts of milk proteins, causing severe allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. Herbalife publicized and recalled the specific lot numbers involved.9

Another example: if a small herbal business owner was found to have contaminated Licorice root tincture on her shelves, she would be able to track which actual bottles and/or formulas contained Licorice with that specific lot number and could then easily remove only that batch from her shelves. She would also have to discard the dried herb that matched that lot number, and the supplier would need to be notified as well.

## Important Herbal Organizations

Professional herbal organizations help us stay connected and keep us up to date with the latest resources, classes, gatherings, information, and opportunities we might not have known about otherwise. A professional organization also self-regulates and establishes and disseminates ethical standards for the profession. It keeps us informed of pertinent legislation such as the latest on GMP, provides prospects for networking, and gives us ways to stay linked with the herbal community. They help us promote what we love.

### The American Botanical Council

The American Botanical Council (ABC) is a nonprofit educational and research organization that states as its mission to “Provide education using science-based and traditional information to promote responsible use of herbal medicine—serving the public, researchers, educators, health care professionals, industry, and media.”10 It publishes HerbalGram: The Journal of the American Botanical Council, a peer-reviewed quarterly that posts herbal news, legislative issues, and updates on its website, and offers information databases and herbal information for its members. It also has a media education program that responds to inaccuracies and misrepresentations about herbs in the media. The ABC is an organization deserving of an herbalist’s membership and support.

<!-- chunk -->

### The American Herbalists Guild

American Herbalists Guild (AHG) is a professional organization founded in 1989 for herbalists. It encourages herbal educational opportunities, sponsors seminars, publishes a quarterly journal, and offers other member benefits. Its founding members read like a Who’s Who in American herbal medicine. AHG provides webinars and classes, and it sponsors periodic herbal conferences held in rotating, gorgeous outdoor settings, perfect for herb walks, gatherings, and celebrations. I can testify that these get-togethers will provide herbalists with an overwhelming amount of information, which can take a full year (or more) to absorb and will give opportunities to connect to the local flora and to meet and network with herbal enthusiasts from all over the country. The booths themselves are amazing.

One becomes a professional member by passing a test to become and receive an AHG Registered Herbalist membership. As described on its website, “AHG Registered Herbalist Membership exists as a way for herbalists to demonstrate a core level of knowledge and experience in botanical medicine practice that is recognizable as a meaningful standard to themselves, to the general public, and to other health professionals and institutions.”11

To earn this designation, an herbalist is required to submit three case histories, similar to those used throughout this text. Also required are three letters of recommendation and background information. If U.S. state licensure for herbalists ever comes down the pike, it is quite likely that AHG educational standards will carry a lot of weight. Its AHG, Registered Herbalist title is one of the best designations an herbalist can presently attain in the United States.

### American Herbal Pharmacopeia

The American Herbal Pharmacopeia (AHP) is a nonprofit founded by herbalist Roy Upton in 1995. Its mission is to publish critically reviewed herbal monographs, similar to, but more complex than, Germany’s Commission E. AHP also stores AHP-verified herbal samples called Botanical Reference Materials (BRMS), which are analyzed and used as a standard or baseline. Other samples may then be submitted, analyzed, and compared with the baseline plant to determine chemical authenticity and quality.

AHP focuses on Ayurvedic, Chinese Medicine, and Western herbs most frequently used in the United States. The monographs represent “the most comprehensive and critically reviewed body of information on herbal medicines in the English language, and serve as a primary reference for academicians, health care providers, manufacturers, and regulators” and provide “the most relevant information needed to comply with cGMPs.”12 The small c means current GMP and is sometimes used to indicate that GMP standards can change and must remain up to date as technology changes.

The monographs are long, thorough, and complex. A sample 64-page monograph for the aerial parts of Echinacea purpurea may be viewed on the website. The monograph contains (among many other features) beautiful color photos of the plant; compares E. purpurea to other species on the market; includes images of microscopic characteristics; gives details about cultivation, harvesting, preparation; and provides chemical breakdown charts and the scientific procedures used to isolate ingredients, not to mention the therapeutics, actions, and safety profile of the plant.13 That’s a lot of info.

### National Institute of Medical Herbalists in the United Kingdom

The National Institute of Medical Herbalists (NIMH), established in 1864, is the U.K.'s leading professional body and voluntary regulator of herbal practitioners. Notice that their name is the Institute of Medical Herbalists, a lofty designation. It sets high standards for professional education, practice, and conduct. It accredits herbal schools, maintains a member register, establishes a code of ethics and codes of conduct and practice, and self-regulates the profession by taking complaints and using disciplinary procedures. Admission to the institute is only for those who have graduated from an accredited course. It has members from all over the world.14 It also operates a mandatory malpractice block insurance program.

This organization is a little like the American Herbalists Guild in that it is a self-regulating body that sets herbal educational standards, but goes many steps further by limiting admission to qualified herbalists who have met their specifications and by providing malpractice insurance. It is also about 125 years older than the baby AHG.

## Seed Banks and Maintaining Biodiversity

Seed banks are places where seeds are stored to preserve genetic biodiversity, insurance policies for medicinal plants and food security. Climate change, natural and environmental disasters, nuclear war, extinction, hybridization, and biodiversity loss all threaten our pure plant DNA pool. In fact, the Amazon rain forest, the world's present and future medicine chest is endangered. There are hundreds of seed banks of different sizes around the world that function as backup systems in case of catastrophe. Should the unspeakable occur and an entire crop be wiped out, planters could use seed reserves to start over. One famous seed bank, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, is located on an island nearly 600 miles north of Norway. It is fortified deep under the permafrost into solid rock, known as the doomsday vault. It is under such tight security that no one person knows all the codes to open any seed package.15

The Millennium Seed Bank Partnership is an international conservation mission coordinated by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, outside London, a global resource for conservation, sustainable solutions, and research. It holds the largest concentration of seed-bearing plants on Earth, including the entire plant population of the United Kingdom and many endangered species, which have top priority for collection. The seeds are dried, frozen, and stored in deep-freeze chambers of −18° to −20°C. Some seeds do not retain viability when dried, especially those from the hot wet tropics. Therefore they cannot be banked in this manner. They are known as recalcitrant species, and studies are underway to see if they might be preserved by cryogenic storage techniques.16

Another approach to preserving biodiversity and food security is not storing seeds in underground or frozen seed banks but to keep them alive and growing cycle after cycle, a live seed bank. One such is the Yupaichani Network in Vilcabamba, Ecuador, a consortium of friends and associates working together on various stated initiatives: to protect seed biodiversity, rehydrate and coordinate reforesting, run a land collective and eco-arts school, create organic corridors, and operate an herbal medicine and seed collective. Because of its biodiversity, Ecuador is considered a living seed bank with altitudes that support species from three climate zones: the costal lowlands, the low Amazon tropical rainforests, and the high Andean mountains. The Ecuadorian group coordinates local seed saving hubs throughout their country and much of South America. Their seed saving is on a personal-neighborhood-bioregional level. They also operate the Vilcabamba Organic Market, where the vendors produce what they sell (pictured in photo gallery).17

An example of plant conservation and preservation of live plants in North America is United Plant Savers (UpS), based in Rutland, Ohio. It was begun in 1994 by founding president, Rosemary Gladstar, and encourages private cultivation, sustainable practices, and preservation of endangered wild medicinals, such as Slippery Elm, American gingeng, and Goldenseal. The group encourages the creation of botanical sancturaries across the country, where at-risk medicinal plants can be preserved and propagated. You could be part of this effort to preserve medicinal plants for generations to come.

For herbalists desiring to grow their own herbs, quality seeds are available from non-GMO heirloom seed companies specializing in organic medicinal seeds from all over the world. One such resource is Horizon Herbs/Strictly Medicinal Seeds in Williams, Oregon. They sell hard-to-find seeds and seedlings, ranging from ancient grains like quinoa and amaranth to medicinal herbs such as Comfrey root, Codonopsis Dang Shen (Downy Bellflower root), Ephedra Ma Huang (Ephedra stem), and many more. Just perusing their catalog is an education and a joy.

## What Herbalists Do

There are numerous possibilities for herbal entrepreneurship. Choose clinical herbalism, maintain private practices, or work in established clinics. Teach in or launch a school; become a guest speaker, conduct community classes, or lead herb walks. Establish and run an herb shop, orchestrating an entire business. Become a grower selling high-quality organic herbs. (We need more of those.)

Quite a few herbalists work in health food stores or pharmacies, giving consults and dispensing their wisdom to the public. Others are associated with supplement companies and manage entire herbal departments and customer education. One former student went to work for an herbal product company, helping them devise their own proprietary formulas, and another artistic herbalist is studying botanical illustrating. Herbalists with scientific backgrounds might consider conducting research studies and chemical analysis of botanicals. National Institutes of Health grants are available for botanical research.

Some innovative herbalists who love large-scale medicine making and have the wherewithal and organizational skills to become GMP certified, wholesale their own tinctures, proprietary formulas, and other botanical products to established clinics, apothecaries, and shop owners who would rather not be involved in the production process. The service includes individualized labeling and provides creative labels printed with GMP certification designation, customer’s name, and logo. This sounds like an up-and-coming business that could be in demand.

Another unique and exciting idea is to convert a camper, van, or bus into a mobile herbal clinic, equipped with on-site consulting, apothecary, and dispensary. This unit might travel around serving ethnic communities, rural neighborhoods, or Indian reservations. Or the mobile clinic could administer herbal first aid at public gatherings, concerts, marches, foot or bike races, and other events. The only thing stopping herbal entrepreneurship is lack of imagination and courage.

Public interest in and use of botanical medicine for healing are on the rise, as are market sales of herbals and other supplements. These increases are creating a growing demand for knowledgeable herbalists. Licensure does not yet exist for us in the United States, but because herbalists are increasingly being accepted as valid health care professionals, it a likely future scenario.

GMP requirements are an FDA regulation. GMP involves two main areas: (1) Having clean and sanitary medicine-making facilities similar to restaurants. (2) Having a system in place that tracks an herb from grower or wildcrafter, to production, to a consumer carrying it out the door. In the event someone gets sick from ingesting or applying a faulty product, a recall can be initiated to quickly remove it from the market in the interests of public safety.

There are many implications for and against licensure. With or without it, herbalists can self-regulate to ensure high standards and safe practice for the public. One way to reach this goal is to belong to and support professional herbal organizations. Self-regulation is the ethical path, as is preservation of our botanical bounty and resources. Conscious and sustainable herbal purchasing, wildcrafting, and seed bank maintenance will ensure there are healing plants for the seventh generation to come.

Formulas for Children’s Dosing

CLARK’S RULEa (weight-based)

Divide weight of the child in pounds by 150=fraction of adult dose.

Then multiply fraction by adult dose.

Adult Dose×(Child’s weight in pounds ÷ 150)=Child’s Dose

Example: Adult dose is 3 mL. Child weighs 35 lb. 35 ÷ 150=0.2333=fraction of adult dose. Then: 0.2333×3 mL=0.699. Round up to 0.7 mL (child’s dose)

YOUNG’S RULE (age-based)

Child’s age in years divided by age plus 12=fraction of adult dose.

Then multiply fraction by adult dose.

Adult Dose×Child’s age ÷ (Age+12)=Child’s Dose

Example: Adult dose is 3 mL, and child age is 3 y old.3 ÷ 15=0.2=(fraction of adult dose). Then, 0.2×3 mL=0.6 mL (child’s dose)

FRIED’S RULEb (Infants up to 24 months)

Age in months divided by 150=fraction of adult dose.

Then multiply fraction by adult dose to get child’s dose.

(Age in months ÷ 150)×adult dose=child’s dose

Example: Child is 4 months old. Adult’s dose is 5 mL.4 months ÷ 150=0.266 (fraction of adult dose). Then: 0.266×5 mL=0.13 mL (child’s dose)
