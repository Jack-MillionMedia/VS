This fifth edition of the Textbook of Natural Medicine (which has now been in publication since 1985) brings several new features and changes to our structure and format. We are especially excited that we are in full color for the first time, including images and figures. These dramatically improve our ability to present, in a more understandable and visually interesting way, the key concepts of and insights into the underlying causes of dysfunction and disease. We are also delighted that with all the new chapters and graphics, Elsevier has moved us back to the two-volume format. To better fit the content into two logical volumes, we changed the order (and some of the titles) of the sections. Syndromes and Special Topics moved to Section V because these fit better in Volume 2 with Section VI, Diseases. Pharmacology of Natural Medicines moved to Section IV because this fits better with Volume 1. As usual, we offer many new chapters, and we think the new chapter on sarcopenia is of particular importance. In addition to new chapters, some chapters have been renamed for better consistency, and some have been moved to sections that we felt were more appropriate. To facilitate utilization, the sections are now color coded, and we have provided alphabetical tabs to help readers in searching for specific diseases. Closely related diseases have been placed in a single chap- ter ― for example, depression, dysthymia, manic phase, and seasonal affective disorder are all located in the chapter on affective disorders chapter ― so becoming familiar with these groupings is essential for finding specific diseases. There are now 14 appendices that provide additional resources for the clinician. We worked with authors to make their writing more succinct and eliminate unnecessary content. We also reduced the length of Section VI by removing duplication of content from Section V in the therapeutics portion of the chapters. We hope you will be as pleased with the latest edition as we are. Due to the substantial increase in pages this edition, to keep down costs we had to move all of the approximately 20,000 references to the online version.

# Philosophy of Natural

# Medicine

One of the key features of the various schools of natural medicine that differentiates them from conventional medicine is their strong philosophical foundation. The basic philosophical premise of naturopathic medicine, for example, is that there is an inherent healing power in nature and in every human being. We believe that a primary role of the physician is to “remove the blocks to cure” and enhance this innate healing power within his or her patients. In many ways, this was the most difficult section of the textbook to write because, before this textbook, no comprehen- sive history of the social, political, and philosophical development of naturopathic medicine had ever been written. Even in the halcyon years of the 1920s and 1930s, the profession was never able to agree upon a concise philosophy. This situation has now changed. In this section, we provide well-documented chapters detailing the roots of American natural medicine. After a century of maturation, the naturopathic profession has now widely agreed to a comprehensive definition, set of principles, and system of case analysis that provide a systematic guide for the application of these concepts in a clinical setting. The seven fundamental principles of naturopathic medicine are as follows: The healing power of nature (vis medicatrix naturae) First, do no harm (primum non nocere) Find the cause (tolle causam) Treat the whole person Preventive medicine Wellness Doctor as teacher These principles translate into the following questions the practitioner applies when analyzing a case: • What is the first cause; what is contributing now? • How is the body trying to heal itself? • What is the minimum level of intervention needed to facilitate the self-healing process? • What are the patient’s underlying functional weaknesses? • What education does the patient need to understand why he or she is sick and how to become healthier? • How does the patient’s physical disease relate to his or her psychological and spiritual health? We have further expanded on the philosophical basis of naturopathic medicine by having these concepts addressed by several authors whose backgrounds allow each of them a unique and, we believe, complementary insight into some of the fundamental questions of the goals of health care. Although the dominant school of medicine has essentially ignored these issues, we believe that the true physician cannot function without a sound philosophical basis to guide his or her actions. Without more than a superficial understanding of health and disease, the physician is more likely to function as a tech- nician, temporarily alleviating symptoms while allowing the real disease to progress past the point of recovery. The huge and increasing burden of chronic disease in all age groups clearly validates the predictions of the founders of naturopathic medicine that primarily treating symptoms, while not addressing causes, results in increased chronic disease.

## 4SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

• Seeking a dynamic balance among the internal and external factors in a patient’s body, mind, and spirit • Addressing the web-like interconnections of internal physiological factors • Identifying health as a positive vitality—not merely the absence of disease—and emphasizing those factors that encourage a vigorous physiology • Promoting organ, cellular, and subcellular function as the means of enhancing the health span, not just the life span, of each patient • Staying abreast of emerging research—a science- and evidence-based approach

# LIFESTYLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

The building blocks of life, and the primary influences on them, are found at the base of the functional medicine tree graphic (see Fig. 1.1). When we talk about influencing gene expression, we are interested in the interaction between lifestyle and environment in the broadest sense and any genetic predispositions with which a person may have been born— in a word, the epigenome. (Epigenetics is the study of how environmen- tal factors can affect gene expression without altering the actual DNA sequence and how these changes can be inherited through generations.) Many environmental factors that affect gene expression are (or appear to be) a matter of choice (such as diet and exercise), others are very difficult for the individual patient to alter or escape (air and water quality, toxic exposures), and still others may be the result of unavoidable accidents (trauma, exposure to harmful microorganisms). Some factors that may appear modifiable are heavily influenced by the patient’s economic sta- tus—if you are poor, for example, it may be impossible to choose more nutritious food, decrease stress in the workplace and at home, or take the time to exercise and rest properly. Existing health status is also a pow- erful influence on the patient’s ability to alter environmental input. If you have chronic pain, exercise may be extremely difficult; if you are depressed, self-activation is a major challenge. The influence of these lifestyle and environment factors on the human organism is indisputable,1,2 and they are often powerful agents in the attempt to restore health. Neglecting to address them in favor of merely writing a prescription—whether for pharmaceutical agents, nutraceuticals, or botanicals—means the cause of the underlying dys- function may itself remain unaddressed and further able to contribute to the genesis of other disease conditions. In general terms, the follow- ing factors should be considered when working to reverse dysfunction or disease and restore health: • Diet (type, quality, and quantity of food; food preparation; calories, fats, proteins, carbohydrates) • Nutrients (both dietary and supplemental) • Air and water • Microorganisms (and the general condition of the soil in which food is grown) • Physical exercise • Trauma • Psychosocial and spiritual factors, such as meaning and purpose, rela- tionships, work, community, economic status, stress, and belief systems • Xenobiotics • Radiation

# FUNDAMENTAL PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES

There are certain physiological processes that are necessary to life. These are the “upstream” processes that can go awry and create “downstream” dysfunctions that eventually become expressed as disease entities. Functional medicine requires that clinicians consider these in evaluating patients so that interventions can target the most fundamental level possible. These processes are as follows: 1. Communication • Intracellular • Intercellular • Extracellular 2. Bioenergetics/energy transformation 3. Assimilation 4. Structural integrity 5. Biotransformation/elimination 6. Defense and repair 7. Transport/circulation These fundamental physiological processes are usually taught early in health professions curricula, where they are appropriately presented as the foundation of modern, scientific patient care. Unfortunately, subsequent training in the clinical sciences often fails to fully inte- grate knowledge of the functional mechanisms of disease with thera- peutics and prevention, emphasizing organ system diagnosis instead.3 Focusing predominantly on organ-system diagnosis without examin- ing the underlying physiology that produced the patient’s signs, symp- toms, and disease often leads to managing patient care by matching diagnosis to pharmacology. The job of the health care provider then becomes a technical exercise in finding the drug or procedure that best fits the diagnosis (not necessarily the patient or the underlying phys- iological dysfunction), leading to a significant curtailment of critical thinking pathways: “Medicine, it seems, has little regard for a complete description of how myriad pathways result in any clinical state.”4 Even more important, pharmacological treatments (and even nat- ural remedies) are often prescribed without careful consideration of their physiological effects across all organ systems, physiological pro- cesses, and genetic variations.5 This was notably exemplified by the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor drugs that were so wildly successful on their introduction, only to be subsequently withdrawn or substantially narrowed in use because of collateral damage.6,7

# CORE CLINICAL IMBALANCES

The functional medicine approach to assessment, both before and after diagnosis, charts a course using different navigational assumptions. Every health condition instigates a quest for information centered on understanding when and how the specific biological system(s) under examination became dysregulated and began manifesting dysfunction and/or disease. Analyzing all the elements of the patient’s story, the signs and symptoms, and the laboratory assessment through a matrix focused on functionality requires analytical thinking and a willing- ness on the part of the clinician to reflect deeply on the underlying biochemistry and physiology. The foundational principles of how the human organism functions—and how its systems communicate and interact—are essential to the process of linking ideas about multifacto- rial causation with the perceptible effects called disease or dysfunction. To assist clinicians in this process, functional medicine identified and organized a set of core clinical imbalances that are linked to the fundamental physiological processes (organizing systems). These serve to marry the mechanisms of disease with the manifestations and diag- noses of disease. Many common underlying pathways of disease are reflected in these clinical imbalances. The following list of imbalanced systems and processes is not definitive, but some of the most common examples are provided. We recommend that the organizing systems be considered in the order as shown in the following list: • Digestion • Absorption

## 5CHAPTER 1 Functional Medicine: A 21st-Century Model of Patient Care and Medical Education

• Microbiome/gastrointestinal • Respiration • Immune system • Inflammatory processes • Infection and microbiome • Energy regulation • Mitochondrial function • Toxicity • Detoxification • Endocrine • Neurotransmitter • Immune messengers • Cognition • From the subcellular membranes • To the musculoskeletal system Using this construct, it becomes much clearer that one disease and/ or condition may have multiple causes (i.e., multiple clinical imbal- ances), just as one fundamental imbalance may be at the root of many seemingly disparate conditions (Fig. 1.2). The most important precept to remember about functional medi- cine is that restoring balance—in the patient’s lifestyle and/or environ- ment and in the body’s fundamental physiological processes—is the key to restoring health.

# ANTECEDENTS, TRIGGERS, AND MEDIATORS8

What modern science has taught us about the genesis of disease can be represented by three words: triggers, mediators, and antecedents. Triggers are discrete entities or events that provoke disease or its symp- toms. Microbes are an example. The greatest scientific discovery of the 19th century was the microbial etiology of the major epidemic diseases. Triggers are usually insufficient in and of themselves for disease forma- tion; however, host response is an essential component. It is, therefore, the functional medicine practitioner’s job to know not just the patient’s ailments or diagnoses but also the physical and social environment in which illness occurs, the dietary habits of the person (present diet and preillness diet), his or her beliefs about the illness, the effect of illness on social and psychological function, factors that aggravate or ameliorate symptoms, and factors that predispose to illness or facilitate recovery. This information is necessary for estab- lishing a functional medicine treatment plan. Identifying the biochemical mediators that underlie host responses was the most productive field of biomedical research during the second half of the 20th century. Mediators, as the word implies, do not cause disease. They are intermediaries that contribute to the manifestation and/or continuation of disease. Antecedents are factors that predispose to acute or chronic illness. For a person who is ill, antecedents form the illness diathesis. From the perspective of prevention, they are risk factors. Knowledge of antecedents provides a rational structure for the organization of preventive medicine and public health. Medical genomics seeks to better understand disease by identify- ing the phenotypic expression of disease-related genes and their prod- ucts. The application of genomic science to clinical medicine requires the integration of antecedents (genes and the factors controlling their expression) with mediators (the downstream products of gene acti- vation). Mediators, triggers, and antecedents are not only key bio- medical concepts; they are also important psychosocial concepts. In person-centered diagnosis, the mediators, triggers, and antecedents for each person’s illness form the focus of the clinical investigation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Antecedents and the Origins of Illness

Understanding the antecedents of illness helps the physician under- stand the unique characteristics of each patient as they relate to his or her current health status. Antecedents may be thought of as congeni- tal or developmental. The most important congenital factor is gender: women and men differ sharply in susceptibility to many disorders. The most important developmental factor is age; what ails children is rarely the same as what ails the elderly. Beyond these obvious factors lies a diversity as complex as the genetic differences and separate life experi- ences that distinguish one person from another.

<!-- chunk -->

## Triggers and the Provocation of Illness

A trigger is anything that initiates an acute illness or the emergence of symptoms. The distinction between a trigger and a precipitating event is relative, not absolute; the distinction helps organize the patient’s story. As a general rule, triggers only provoke illness as long as the person is exposed to them (or for a short while afterward), whereas a precipitating event initiates a change in health status that persists long after the exposure ends. Common triggers include physical or psychic trauma, microbes, drugs, allergens, foods (or even the act of eating or drinking), environ- mental toxins, temperature change, stressful life events, adverse social interactions, and powerful memories. For some conditions, the trig- ger is such an essential part of our concept of the disease that the two cannot be separated; the disease is either named after the trigger (e.g., strep throat) or the absence of the trigger negates the diagnosis (e.g., concussion cannot occur without head trauma). For chronic ailments like asthma, arthritis, or migraine headaches, multiple interacting trig- gers may be present. All triggers, however, exert their effects through the activation of host-derived mediators.

determine the late effects. Intravenous magnesium at the time of trauma attenuates the severity by altering the mediator response.9,10 Sensitivity to different triggers often varies among persons with similar ailments. A prime task of the functional practitioner is to help patients identify important triggers for their ailments and develop strategies for eliminating them or diminishing their virulence.

## Mediators and the Formation of Illness

A mediator is anything that produces or perpetuates symptoms or damages tissues of the body, including certain behaviors. Mediators vary in form and substance. They may be biochemical (e.g., prosta- noids and cytokines), ionic (e.g., hydrogen ions), social (e.g., rein- forcement for staying ill), psychological (e.g., fear), or cultural (e.g., beliefs about the nature of illness). A list of common mediators is pre- sented in Box 1.1. Illness in any single person usually involves multiple interacting mediators. Biochemical, psychosocial, and cultural media- tors interact continuously in the formation of illness.

# CONSTRUCTING THE MODEL

<!-- chunk -->

## Assessment

Combining the principles, lifestyle and environment factors, funda- mental physiological processes, antecedents, triggers, mediators, and core clinical imbalances demands a new architecture for gathering and sorting information for clinical practice—in effect, a new heuris- tic to serve the practice of functional medicine. (Heuristics are rules of thumb—ways of thinking or acting—that develop through exper- imentation and enable more efficient and effective processing of data.) This new model includes an explicit emphasis on principles and mech- anisms that infuse meaning into the diagnosis and deepen the clini- cian’s understanding of the multivalent contributors to physiological dysfunction. Any methodology for constructing a coherent story and an effective therapeutic plan in the context of complex chronic illness must be flexible and adaptive. Like an accordion file that compresses and expands upon demand, the amount and kind of data collected will necessarily change in accordance with the patient’s situation and the clinician’s time and ability to piece together the underlying threads of dysfunction. The conventional assessment process involving the chief complaint, history of present illness, and past medical history sections must be expanded (Fig. 1.3) to include a thorough investigation of antecedents, triggers, and mediators and a systematic evaluation of any imbalances within the fundamental organizing systems. Personalized medical care without this expanded investigation falls short.

## The Functional Medicine Matrix Model

Distilling the data from the expanded history, physical examina- tion, and laboratory findings into a narrative storyline that includes antecedents, triggers, and mediators can be challenging. Key to devel- oping a thorough narrative is organizing the story using the Functional Medicine Matrix Model form (Fig. 1.4). The matrix form helps organize and prioritize information and also clarifies the level of present understanding, thus illuminating where further investigation is needed. For example: • Indicators of inflammation on the matrix might lead the clinician to request tests for specific inflammatory markers (such as highly sensitive C-reactive protein, interleukin levels, and/or homocyste- ine). • Essential fatty acid levels, methylation pathway abnormalities, and organic acid metabolites help determine the adequacy of dietary and nutrient intakes. • Markers of detoxification (glucuronidation and sulfation, cyto- chrome P450 enzyme heterogeneity) can determine the functional capacity for molecular biotransformation. • Neurotransmitters and their metabolites (vanilmandelate, homo- vanillate, 5-hydroxyindoleacetate, quinolinate) and hormone cascades (gonadal and adrenal) have obvious utility in exploring messenger molecule balance. • Computed tomographic scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or plain radiographs extend the view of the patient’s structural dys- functions. The use of bone scans, dual-energy x-ray absorptiome- try scans, or bone resorption markers11,12 can be useful in further exploring the web-like interactions of the matrix. • Newer, useful technologies such as functional MRIs, single-photon emission computed tomography, and positron emission tomo- graphic scans offer a more comprehensive assessment of metabolic function within organ systems. It is the process of completing a comprehensive history and physi- cal using the expanded functional medicine heuristic and then charting these findings on the matrix that best directs the choice of diagnostic evaluations and successful treatment. Therapies should be chosen for their potential effect on the most significant imbalances of the particular patient. A completed matrix form facilitates review of common pathways, mechanisms, and mediators of disease and helps clinicians select points of leverage for treatment strategies. However, even with the matrix as an aid to syn- thesizing and prioritizing information, it can be very useful to consider the effect of each variable at five different levels: 1. Whole-body interventions: Because the human organism is a com- plex adaptive system, with countless points of access, interventions at one level will affect points of activity in other areas as well. For example, improving the patient’s sleep beneficially influences the immune response, melatonin levels, and T-cell lymphocyte lev- els and helps decrease oxidative stress. Exercise reduces stress, improves insulin sensitivity, and improves detoxification. Reduc- ing stress (and/or improving stress management) reduces cortisol

levels, improves sleep, improves emotional well-being, and reduces the risk of heart disease. Changing the diet has myriad effects on health, from reducing inflammation to reversing coronary artery disease. 2. Organ-system interventions: These interventions are used more frequently in the acute presentation of illness. Examples include splinting; draining lesions; repairing lacerations; reducing frac- tures, pneumothoraxes, hernias, or obstructions; or removing a stone to reestablish whole-organ function. There are many inter- ventions that improve organ function. For example, bronchodila- tors improve air exchange, thereby decreasing hypoxia, reducing oxidative stress, and improving metabolic function and oxygen- ation in a patient with reactive airway disease. 3. Metabolic or cellular interventions: Cellular health can be addressed by ensuring the adequacy of macronutrients, essential amino acids, vitamins, and cofactor minerals in the diet (or, if necessary, from supplementation). An individual’s metabolic enzyme polymor- phisms can profoundly affect his or her nutrient requirements. For example, adding conjugated linoleic acid to the diet can alter the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor system, affect body weight, and modulate the inflammatory response.13–15 However, in a person who is diabetic or insulin resistant, adding conjugated linoleic acid may induce hyperproinsulinemia, which is detrimen- tal.16,17 Altering the types and proportions of carbohydrates in the diet may increase insulin sensitivity, reduce insulin secretion, and fundamentally alter metabolism in the insulin-resistant patient. Supporting liver detoxification pathways with supplemental gly- cine and N-acetylcysteine improves the endogenous production of adequate glutathione, an essential antioxidant in the central ner- vous system and gastrointestinal tract.

4. Subcellular/mitochondrial interventions: There are many examples of nutrients that support mitochondrial function.18,19 Inadequate iron intake causes oxidants to leak from mitochondria, damaging mito- chondrial function and mitochondrial DNA. Making sure there is suf- ficient iron helps alleviate this problem. Inadequate zinc intake (found in more than 10% of the U.S. population) causes oxidation and DNA damage in human cells.19 Ensuring the adequacy of antioxidants and cofactors for the at-risk individual must be considered in each part of the matrix. Carnitine, for example, is required as a carrier for the trans- port of fatty acids from the cytosol into the mitochondria, improving the efficiency of β -oxidation of fatty acids and resultant adenosine tri- phosphate production. In patients who have lost significant weight, carnitine undernutrition can result in fatty acids undergoing ω - oxidation, a far less efficient form of metabolism.20 Patients with low carnitine may also respond to riboflavin supplementation.20 5. Subcellular/gene-expression interventions: Many compounds interact at the gene level to alter cellular response, thereby affecting health and healing. Any intervention that alters nuclear factor- κ B entering the nucleus, binding to DNA, and activating genes that encode inflammatory modulators, such as interleukin-6 (and thus C-reactive protein), cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-1, lipoxygenase, inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor- α , or a num- ber of adhesion molecules, will affect many disease conditions.21,22 There are many ways to alter the environmental triggers for nuclear factor- κ B, including lowering oxidative stress; altering emotional stress; and consuming adequate phytonutrients, antioxidants, alpha-lipoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and γ -linoleic acid.21 Adequate vitamin A allows the appropriate interaction of vitamin A–retinoic acid with more than 370 genes.23 Vitamin D in its most active form intercalates with a retinol protein and the DNA exon and modulates many aspects of metabolism, including cell division in both healthy and cancerous breast, colon, prostate, and skin tissue.24 Vitamin D has key roles in controlling inflammation, calcium homeostasis, bone metabolism, cardiovas- cular and endocrine physiology, and healing.24 Experience using this model, along with improved pattern-recog- nition skills, will often lessen the need for extensive laboratory assess- ments. However, there will always be certain clinical conundrums that simply cannot be assessed without objective data, and for most patients, there may be an irreducible minimum of laboratory assess- ments required to accumulate information. For example, in the clinical workup of autism spectrum disorders in children, heavy-metal expo- sure and toxicity may play an important role. The heavy-metal body burden cannot be sensibly assessed without laboratory studies. In most initial workups, laboratory and imaging technologies can be reserved for those complex cases in which the initial interventions prove insuf- ficient to the task of functional explication. When clinical acumen and educated steps in both assessments and therapeutic trials do not yield expected improvement, laboratory testing often provides rewarding information. This is frequently the context for focused genomic testing.

formed to achieve an objective. For example, a business partnership forms to engage in commercial transactions for financial gain; a mar- riage partnership forms to build a caring, supportive, home-centered environment. A healing partnership forms to heal the patient through the integrated application of both the art of medicine (insight driven) and the science of medicine (evidence driven). An effective partnership requires that trust and rapport be established. Patients must feel com- fortable telling their stories and revealing intimate information and significant events. In the 20th century, contemporary medicine, traditionally consid- ered a healing profession, evolved away from the role of healing the sick to that of curing disease through modern science. Research into this transition revealed that healing was traditionally associated with themes of wholeness, narrative, and spirituality. Professionals and patients alike report healing as an intensely personal, subjective experi- ence involving a reconciliation of meaning for an individual and a per- ception of wholeness. The biomedical model as currently configured no longer encompasses these characteristics. Contemporary medicine considers the wholeness of healing to be beyond its orthodoxy—the domain of the nonscientific and nonmed- ical.25 We disagree. To grasp the profound importance of the healing partnership to the creation of a system of medicine adequate to the demands of the 21st century, an emerging body of relevant research was reviewed.26–28 As Louise Acheson, MD, MS, associate editor of the Annals of Family Practice, articulated insightfully in that journal29: “It is challenging to research this ineffable process called healing.” Hsu and colleagues asked focus groups of nurses, physicians, med- ical assistants, and randomly selected patients to define healing and describe what facilitates or impedes it.30 The groups arrived at surpris- ingly convergent definitions: “Healing is a dynamic process of recover- ing from a trauma or illness by working toward realistic goals, restoring function, and regaining a personal sense of balance and peace.” They heard from diverse participants that “healing is a journey” and “rela- tionships are essential to healing.” Research into the role of healing in the medical environment has generated some thoughtful and robust investigations. Scott et al.’s26 research into the healing relationship found very similar descriptions to those of Hsu et al.30 The participants in the study27 articulated aspects of the healing partnership as follows: 1. Valuing and creating a nonjudgmental emotional bond 2. Appreciating power and consciously managing clinician power in ways that would most benefit the patient 3. Abiding and displaying a commitment to caring for patients over time Three relational outcomes result from these processes: trust, hope, and a sense of being known. Clinician competencies that facil- itate these processes are self-confidence, emotional self-management, mindfulness, and knowledge.27 In this rich soil, the healing partnership flourishes. The characteristics of a conventional therapeutic encounter are fundamentally different from a healing partnership, and each emerges from specific emphases in training. In the therapeutic encounter, the relationship forms to assess and treat a medical problem using (usu- ally) an organ-system structure, a differential diagnosis process, and a treatment toolbox focused on pharmacology and medical proce- dures. The therapeutic encounter pares down the information flow between physician and patient to the minimum needed to identify the organ-system domain of most probable dysfunction, followed by a sorting system search (the differential diagnosis heuristic). The pur- pose of this relationship is to arrive at the most probable diagnosis as quickly as possible and select an intervention based on probable effi- cacy. The relationship is a left-brain–guided conversation controlled by the clinician and characterized by algorithmic processing and sta- tistical thinking.31,32 The functional medicine healing partnership forms with a related but broader purpose: to help the patient heal by identifying the under- lying mechanisms and influences that initiated and continue to medi- ate the patient’s illness(es). This type of relationship emphasizes shared responsibility for identifying the causes of the patient’s condition and achieving insight about enduring solutions. The healing partnership is critical to the delivery of personalized systems of medicine and to man- aging the uncertainty (choices under risk) inherent in clinical practice. In the healing partnership, the appropriate utilization and integration of left-brain and right-brain functions are found. In language, we have the fullest expression of the integration of left- and right-brain function. Language is so complex that the brain has to process it in different ways simultaneously—both denotatively and connotatively. For complexity and nuance to emerge in language, the left brain needs to see the trees, and the right brain helps us see and understand the forest.33,34 The starting point for creating a healing partnership is the patient’s experience. People, not diseases, can heal. Mindful integration of brain function is at the heart of a healing partnership. Some of the basic steps for establishing a healing partnership include the following: 1. Allowing patients to express, without interruption, their story about why they have come to see you. (Research focused on the therapeutic encounter has repeatedly found that clinicians interrupt the patient’s flow of conversation within the first 18 seconds or less, often deny- ing the patient an opportunity to finish.35) The manner in which the patient frames the initial concerns often presages later insight into the root causes. Any interruption in this early stage of narrative moves the patient back into left-brain processing and away from insight.36 2. After focusing on the chief concerns, encouraging the patient’s narrative regarding the present illness(es). Clarifications can be elicited by further open-ended questioning (e.g., “Tell me more about that”; “What else do you think might be going on?”). During this portion of the interview, there is a switching back and forth between right- and left-brain functions. • During this conversation, signs and symptoms of the present illness are distributed by the practitioner into the Functional Medicine Matrix Model form as previously described. • Analysis of the data thus collected proceeds by assessing probable underlying causes—based on evidence about common underlying mechanisms of disease—and ongoing mediators of the disease. 3. Next, conveying to the patient in the simplest terms possible that to achieve lasting solutions to the problem(s) for which the patient has come seeking help, a few fundamental questions must be asked and answered to understand the problem in the context of the patient’s personal life. This framing of the interview process moves the endeavor from a left-brain compilation to a narrative that encourages insight—based on complex pattern recognition— about the root causes of the problem. 4. At this stage, control is shared with the patient: “Without your help, we cannot understand your medical problem in the depth and breadth you deserve.” Implementing this shared investigation can be facilitated by certain approaches: a. For determining antecedent conditions, the following questions are useful: • When was the last time you felt well? When were you free of this problem? • What were the circumstances surrounding the appear- ance of the problem? • Have similar problems appeared in family members?

<!-- chunk -->

## 10SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

b. For triggers, the following question is critical: • What conditions, activities, or events seemed to ini- tiate the problem? (Microbes and stressful personal events are examples but illustrate quite different cat- egories of triggers. Triggers by themselves are usually insufficient for disease formation, so triggers must be viewed within the context of the antecedent condi- tions.) c. Mediators of the problem are influences that help perpet- uate it. • There can be specific mediators of diseases in the patient’s activities, lifestyle, and environment. Many diverse factors can affect the host’s response to stress- ors. • Any of the core clinical imbalances, discussed previ- ously and shown on the Functional Medicine Matrix Model, can transform what might have been a tem- porary change in homeostasis into a chronic allostatic condition. It helps at this juncture to emphasize again that the following issues are elemental in forming a healing partnership: • Only the patient can inform the partnership about the conditions that provided the soil from which the problem(s) under exam- ination emerged. The patient literally owns the keys to the joint deliberation that can provide insight into the process of achieving a healing outcome. • The professional brings experience, wisdom, tools, and techniques and works to create the context for a healing insight to emerge. • The patient’s information, input, mindful pursuit of insight, and engagement become “the horse before the cart.” The cart carries the clinician—the person who guides the journey using evidence, experience, and judgment and who contributes the potential for expert insight. The crux of the healing partnership is an equal investment of focus by both clinician and patient. They work together to identify the right places to apply leverage for change. Patients must commit to engage both their left-brain skills and their right-brain function to inform and guide the exploration to the next steps in assessment, therapy, under- standing, and insight. Clinicians must also engage both the left-brain computational skills and the right-brain pattern-recognition functions that, when used together, can generate insight about the patient’s story. An overview of the functional medicine model is given in Fig. 1.5.

# INTEGRATION OF CARE

Functional medicine explicitly recognizes that no single profes- sion can cover all the viable therapeutic options. Interventions and practitioners will differ by training, licensure, specialty focus, and even by beliefs and ethnic heritage. However, all health care dis- ciplines (and all medical specialties) can—to the degree allowed by their training and licensure and assuming a good background in Western medical science—use a functional medicine approach, including integrating the matrix as a basic template for organiz- ing and coupling knowledge and data. Consequently, functional medicine can provide a common language, a flexible architecture, and a unified model to facilitate integrated and integrative care. Regardless of the discipline in which the clinician has been trained, developing a network of capable, collaborative practitioners with whom to comanage challenging patients and to whom referrals can be made for therapies outside the primary clinician’s own exper- tise will enrich patient care and strengthen the clinician–patient relationship.

a culture that turned to mechanistic science as an unquestioned author- ity. The dawning of the atomic age reinforced a fundamental place for science in a society increasingly dominated by scientific discovery. In this culture, standard medicine, with its growing political and eco- nomic strength, was able to force the near elimination of naturopathic medicine through the repeal or “sunsetting” of licensure acts.2,3,12 In 1956, as the last early doctor of naturopathy (ND) educational program ended (at the Western States College of Chiropractic), sev- eral doctors, including Drs. Ralph Weiss, Charles Stone, W. Martin Bleything, and Frank Spaulding, created the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, Oregon, to keep the profession alive. However, that school was nearly invisible as the last vestige of a dying profession and rarely attracted as many as 10 new stu- dents a year. The profession was considered dead by its historical adversaries. The culture of America, dominated by standard medicine since the 1940s, however, began to change by the late 1960s. The promise of sci- ence and antibiotics was beginning to seem less than perfect. Chronic disease was increasing in prevalence as acute infection was becom- ing less predominant, and standard medicine had no “penicillin” for chronic diseases. In the late 1970s, scholars in family medicine proposed a biopsychosocial model of care in response to a prevailing perception of a growing crisis in standard medicine.13 The publication of Engel’s “The Need for a New Medical Model” in April 1977 signaled the found- ing of the field of family medicine based on a holistic philosophy. This shifting culture within standard medicine paralleled a broader social movement in support of alternative health practices and environmental awareness. Elements of the culture were rebelling against plastics and cheap synthetics, seeking more natural solutions. The publication of Rachael Carson’s Silent Spring in 1962, an indictment of chemical pes- ticides and environmental damage, marked a turning point in cultural thinking. In Silent Spring, Carson challenged the practices of agricul- tural scientists and the government and called for a change in the way humankind viewed the natural world.14 New evidence of the dangers of radiation, synthetic pesticides, and herbicides and environmental deg- radation from industrial pollution was creating a new ethic. Organic farming, natural fibers, and other similar possibilities were starting to capture attention. A few began seeking natural alternatives in medicine. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, enrollments at the National College of Naturopathic Medicine began to reach into the 20s. The 1974 class numbered 23 students. In 1975 the National College enrolled a class of 63 students.15 The profession was experiencing a resurgence. In 1978, with a desire to create a college based on science-based nat- ural medicine, Joseph E. Pizzorno, ND, LM, and his colleagues—Les Griffith, ND, LM; Bill Mitchell, ND; and Sheila Quinn—created the John Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in Seattle, Washington. With the creation of Bastyr, named after the eminent naturopathic physician Dr. John Bartholomew Bastyr (1912–1995), the profession entered a new phase. Not only did this new college double the profession’s capac- ity to produce new doctors, but it also firmly placed the profession on the ground of scientific research and validation. “Science-based natural medicine,” coined by Dr. Pizzorno, was a major driving force behind the creation and mission of Bastyr. Both Drs. Bastyr and Pizzorno had significant influence and leadership in achieving this focus. One of Dr. Bastyr’s important legacies was to establish a foundation and a model for reconciling the perceived conflict between science and the deeply established healing practices and principles of naturopathic medicine. Kirchfeld and Boyle4 described his landmark contribution as follows: Although naturopathic colleges in the early 1900s did include basic sciences training, it was not until Dr. John Bastyr (1912–1995) and his firm, efficient and professional leadership that science and research-based training in natural medicine was inspired to reach its fullest potential. Dr. Bastyr, whose vision was one of “naturop- athy’s empirical successes documented and proven by scientific methods,” was himself the prototype of the modern naturopathic doctor, who culls the latest findings from the scientific literature, applies them in ways consistent with naturopathic principles and verifies the results with appropriate studies. Bastyr also saw a tremendous expansion in both allopathic and naturopathic medical knowledge, and he played a major role in mak- ing sure the best of both were integrated into naturopathic medical education.4,16 Bastyr met Lust on two occasions and was closely tied to the nature cure tradition of Kneipp through two influential women: his mother, and his mentor, Dr. Elizabeth Peters, who studied with Father Kneipp. He effortlessly integrated the clinical theories and practices of naturop- athy with the latest scientific studies and helped create a new and truly original form of modern primary clinical care within naturopathic medicine. He spent the 20th century preparing the nature cure of the 19th century for entry into the 21st century.2,16 Today’s philosophic debates within the profession are no longer about science. They now tend to center on both sides of the earlier debate and include challenges to the nature cure tradition. A current debate, for instance, is about the role of “green allopathy” within the profession: the tendency to use botanical medicine or nutritional supplements as a simple “green drug” or pharmaceutical replacement therapy. This is in contrast to implementing the full range of healing practices derived from the nature cure tradition and within the framework of the therapeutic order construct to stimulate health restoration as the foundation for reversing disease, alongside, or instead of, botanical medicine or nutri- tional supplements. Professional consensus appears strong that the full range of naturopathic healing practices must be retained, strength- ened, and engaged in the process of education and scientific research and discovery in the 21st century.17–19

# ORIGINAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY

Through the initial 50-year period of professional growth and devel- opment (1896–1945), naturopathic medicine had no clear and concise statement of identity. The profession was whatever Lust said it was. He defined “naturopathy” or “nature cure” as both a way of life and a concept of healing that used various natural means of treating human infirmities and disease states. The “natural means” were integrated into naturopathic medicine by Lust and others based on the emerging natu- ropathic theory of healing and disease etiology. The earliest therapies associated with the term involved a combination of American hygien- ics and Austro-Germanic nature cure and hydrotherapy. Leaders in this field included Kuhne, Lindlahr, Trall, Kellogg, Holbrook, Tilden, Graham, McFadden, Rikli, Thomson, and others who wrote founda- tional naturopathic medical treatises or developed naturopathic clin- ical theory, philosophy, and texts to enhance, agree with, and diverge from Lust’s original work.20–28 The bulk of professional theory was found in Lust’s magazines, Herald of Health and The Naturopath. These publications displayed the prodigious writings of Lust but did not contain a comprehensive and definitive statement of either philosophy or clinical theory. Lust often stated that all natural therapies fell under the purview of naturopathy. Several texts were considered as somewhat definitive by various aspects of the profession at different times. These texts included Adolph Just’s Return to Nature (1896), Louis Kuhne’s The New Science of Healing (1899), and the seven-volume Natural Therapeutics by Henry Lindlahr, MD, which was published in the early 1900s. Lindlahr’s Nature Cure (1913) was considered a seminal work in naturopathic theory, laying

the groundwork for a systematic approach to naturopathic treatment and diagnosis. Lindlahr ultimately presented the most coherent natu- ropathic theory extant, summarized in his Catechism of Nature Cure, which presented a five-part therapeutic progression: 1. “Return to nature”—attending to the basics of diet, dress, exercise, rest, etc. 2. Elementary remedies—water, air, light, electricity 3. Chemical remedies—botanicals, homeopathy, etc. 4. Mechanical remedies—manipulations, massage, etc. 5. Mental/spiritual remedies—prayer, positive thinking, doing good works, etc.29 Lindlahr’s five-step therapeutic progression follows the Catechism’s disease causation model: “The primary cause of disease, barring acci- dental or surgical injury to the human organism and surroundings hostile to human life, is violation of Nature’s Laws.” The effects of vio- lation of nature’s laws on the physical human organism are also the primary causes of disease because they inhibit normal function, lower vitality, and result in tissue destruction: Primary Lowered vitality Abnormal composition of blood and lymph Accumulation of waste, morbid matter, and poisons in the system Secondary Hereditary/constitutional Fevers, inflammation Mechanical luxations Weakening and loss of reason, will, etc.29 In 1948 Spitler wrote Basic Naturopathy, a Textbook,10 and in Wendel wrote Standardized Naturopathy.11 These texts presented somewhat different approaches; Spitler’s text emphasized theory and philosophy, whereas Wendel’s text was written, as evidenced by the title, to emphasize the standard naturopathic practices of the day, with an eye toward regulatory practice. In contrast, Kuts-Cheraux’s Naturopathic Materia Medica, written in 1953, was produced to sat- isfy a statutory demand by the Arizona legislature but persisted as one of the few extant guides of that era. Practitioners relied on a number of earlier texts, many of which arose from the German hydrotherapy practitioners30–35 or the eclectic school of medicine (a refinement and expansion of the earlier “Thomsonian” system of medicine)36–40 and predated the formal American naturopathic profession (1900). However, by the late 1950s, publications diminished. The profession was generally considered on its last gasp, an anachronism of the pre- antibiotic era. During the process of winning licensure, naturopathic medicine was defined formally by the various licensure statutes, but these defi- nitions were legal and scope-of-practice definitions, often in conflict with each other, reflecting different standards of practice in different jurisdictions. In 1965 the U.S. Department of Labor’s Dictionary of Occupational Titles41 presented the most formal and widespread defi- nition. The definition was not without controversy because it reflected one of the internally competing views of the profession, primarily, the nature cure perspective: Diagnoses, treats and cares for patients using a system of prac- tice that bases treatment of physiological function and abnormal conditions on natural laws governing the human body. Utilizes physiological, psychological and mechanical methods such as air, water, light, heat, earth, phytotherapy, food and herbs therapy, psychotherapy, electrotherapy, physiotherapy, minor and orificial therapy, mechanotherapy, naturopathic corrections and manipu- lations, and natural methods or modalities together with natural medicines, natural processed food and herbs and natural remedies. Excludes major surgery, therapeutic use of x-ray and radium, and the use of drugs, except those assimilable substances containing ele- ments or compounds which are components of body tissues and physiologically compatible to body processes for the maintenance of life.41 This definition did not list drugs or surgery within the scope of modalities available to the profession. It defined the profession by ther- apeutic modality and was more limited than most of the statutes under which naturopathic physicians practiced,42 even in 1975, when there were only eight licensing authorities still active.

# MODERN NATUROPATHIC CLINICAL THEORY: THE

# PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT

Medical philosophy comprises the underlying premises on which a health care system is based. Once a system is acknowledged, it is subject to debate. In Naturopathic medicine, the philosoph- ical debates are a valuable, ongoing process which helps the understanding of health and disease evolve in an orderly and truth-revealing fashion.

## Randall Bradley, ND43

After the profession’s decline in the 1950s and 1960s, a rebirth was experienced, more grounded in medical sciences and fueled by a young generation with few teachers. The profession’s roots were neglected out of ignorance, for the most part, along with a youth- ful arrogance. By the early 1980s, it was apparent that attempts to regenerate the progress made by Lust would require the creation of a unified professional organization and all which that entailed: accreditation for schools, national standards in education and licen- sure, clinical research, and the articulation of a coherent definition of the profession for legislative purposes, as well as for its own internal development. These accomplishments would be necessary to be able to demonstrate the uniqueness and validity of the profession, guide its educational process, and justify its status as a separate and distinct medical profession. In 1987 the newly formed (1985) American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) began this task of developing a uni- fied professional organization under the leadership of James Sensenig, ND (president), and Cathy Rogers, ND (vice president). Four tasks were developed, and committees with specific chairs were delegated. One task was to pursue accreditation of our schools through govern- mental accreditation bodies, headed by Joe Pizzorno, ND. Another was to create a standard, national licensure examination, independent of the profession, headed by Edwin Smith, ND. A third was to create a peer-reviewed journal that the profession could use to demonstrate its rational basis, headed by Peter D’Adamo, ND. The fourth was a committee to head the creation of a new definition of naturopathic medicine headed by Pamela Snider, ND, and Jared Zeff ND, LAc. The “Select Committee on the Definition of Naturopathic Medicine” suc- ceeded in its 3-year project, which culminated in the unanimous adop- tion by the AANP’s House of Delegates (HOD) of a comprehensive, consensus definition of naturopathic medicine in 1989 at the annual convention held at Rippling River, Oregon.44–46 The unique aspect of this definition was its basis in definitive principles, rather than ther- apeutic modalities, as the defining characteristics of the profession. In passing this resolution, the HOD also asserted that the principles would continue to evolve with the progress of knowledge and should be formally reexamined by the profession as needed, perhaps every 5 years.44–49 In September 1996 the AANP HOD passed a resolution to review three proposed principles of practice that had been recommended as

## 14SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

additions to the AANP definition of naturopathic medicine originally passed by the HOD in 1989. These three new proposed principles were rejected, and the AANP HOD reconfirmed the 1989 AANP defi- nition unanimously in 2000. The results of a profession-wide survey conducted from 1996 to 1998 on these three new proposed principles demonstrated that although there was lively input, the profession agreed strongly that the original definition was accurate and should remain intact. The HOD recommended that the discussion be moved to the academic community involved in clinical theory, research, and practice for pursuit through scholarly dialogue.50–54 This formed the basis for further efforts to articulate a clinical theory. AANP members stated in 1987 to 1989 during the definition process: “These principles are the skeleton, the core of naturopathic theory. There will be more growth from this foundation.”46 By 1997, this growth in modern clin- ical theory was evident. The first statement of such a theory was published in the AANP’s Journal of Naturopathic Medicine in 1997 in an article titled “The Process of Healing, a Unifying Theory of Naturopathic Medicine.”55 This article contained three fundamental concepts that were presented as an organizing theory for the many therapeutic systems and modali- ties used within the profession and were based on the principles articu- lated in the consensus AANP definition of naturopathic medicine. The first of these was the characterization of disease as a process rather than a pathological entity. The second was the focus on the determinants of health rather than on pathology. The third was the concept of a ther- apeutic hierarchy. This article also signaled the emergence of a growing dialogue among physicians, faculty, leaders, and scholars of naturopathic philosophy concerning theory in naturopathic medicine. The hope and dialogue sparked by this article were the natural next step of a profession redefining itself both in the light of today’s advances in health care and with respect to the foundations of philosophy at the traditional heart of naturopathic medicine. This dialogue natu- rally followed the discussions of the definition process and created a vehicle for emerging models and concepts to be built on the bones of the principles. The essence and inherent concepts of traditional naturopathic philosophy were carried in the hearts and minds of a new generation of naturopathic physicians into the 21st century— these modern naturopathic students and naturopathic physicians began to gather to articulate, redefine, and reunify the heart of the medicine. This new dialogue was formally launched in 1996, when the AANP Convention opened with the plenary session “Towards a Unifying Theory of Naturopathic Medicine,” with four naturopathic physi- cians presenting facets of emerging modern naturopathic theory. The session closed with an open microphone. The impassioned and powerful comments of the naturopathic profession throughout the United States and Canada engaged in the vital process of deepening and clarifying its unifying theory. Dr. Zeff presented “The Process of Healing: The Hierarchy of Therapeutics”; Dr. Mitchell presented “The Physics of Adjacency, Intention, Naturopathic Medicine, and Gaia”; Dr. Sensenig presented “Back to the Future: Reintroducing Vitalism as a New Paradigm”; and Dr. Snider announced the Integration Project, inviting the profession to engage in it by “sharing a beautiful and inspiring anguish—the labor pains of naturopathic theory in the twen- ty-first century. We know what we have done, and we know there is much more … The foundation is laid. We are ready now for develop- ment and integration.”56 Days later, in September 1996, the Consortium of Naturopathic Medical Colleges (now the American Association of Naturopathic Medical Colleges [AANMC]) formally adopted and launched the Integration Project, an initiative to integrate naturopathic theory and philosophy throughout all divisions of all naturopathic college curric- ula, from basic sciences to clinical training. A key element of the proj- ect engaged the further development and refinement of naturopathic theory. The project was cochaired by Drs. Snider and Zeff from to 2003. Steering members from all North American naturopathic col- leges participated and contributed.46 Methods included professional and scholarly research, expert teams, symposiums, and training. The result was the fostering of systematic inquiry among academicians, cli- nicians, and researchers concerning the underlying theory of naturo- pathic medicine, bringing the fruits of this work and inquiry into the classroom and into scientific discussion.57 The Integration Project sustained both formal and informal dia- logue since its inception in 1996, which continues today through the Foundations of Naturopathic Medicine Institute. The work has engaged faculty and scholars of naturopathic philosophy in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and many other coun- tries where naturopathy is established or is professionalizing. It has also engaged institutional leaders and practicing doctors and faculty in all areas of the profession. Why? Naturopathic philosophy is deeply felt as the “commons” of naturopathic medicine: a place where the profes- sion meets—one that is owned by all naturopathic physicians—that reflects, holds, and deepens the heart of naturopathic medicine. The philosophy of naturopathic medicine is the foundation and heart of naturopathic medicine and consists of its heritage, knowledge base, concepts, and knowledge codification; its clinical decision making; its integration and initiation of scientific research; and its public policy positions. The philosophy remains valid by evolving with the progress of knowledge, the progress of science, and the progress of the human spirit. It is for this reason medicine is seen as an art and a science. Because naturopathic philosophy engages the intuitively felt mission of nature doctors, it is vital that the profession periodi- cally gathers to renew and revitalize progress regarding its unifying foundations. The Integration Project sparked a wide range of activities in all six ND colleges at that time, resulting in all-college retreats to share tools, retreats for training of non-ND faculty in naturopathic philosophy, integration of a basic sciences curriculum, expert-team revision of core competencies across departments ranging from nutrition to case management and counseling, development of clinical tools and semi- nars for clinic faculty, creation of new courses, and the integration of important research questions derived from naturopathic philosophy into research studies and initiatives.58 The latest effort, the Foundations of Naturopathic Medicine Institute and Project (textbook codification and symposia series; see www.foundationsproject.com) includes its development and presentation of the founding educational module on emunctorology, an essentially naturopathic science, during 2009 and 2010. This is a joint effort of faculty from several of our schools, led by Drs. Thom Kruzel, Rita Bettenberg and Stephen Myers. North American core competencies for naturopathic philoso- phy and clinical theory were developed by faculty representing all accredited ND colleges in a landmark AANMC retreat in 2000. The AANMC’s Dean’s Council formally adopted these competencies in 2000 and recommended that they be integrated throughout curricula in all ND colleges. These national core competencies included the pro- cess of healing theory, Lindlahr’s model, and the hierarchy of thera- peutics (the therapeutic order).59,60 Finally, many meetings with scholars and teachers of naturopathic theory and other faculty and leaders—formal and informal—resulted in the further development and refinement of the hierarchy of thera- peutics developed by Dr. Zeff in 1997. Drs. Snider and Zeff and worked closely with each other and then with other naturopathic theory faculty from AANMC colleges in a

series of revisions. Drs. Snider and Zeff collaborated in 1998 to develop the hierarchy of therapeutics into the “therapeutic order.” The thera- peutic order was subsequently explored and refined through a series of faculty retreats and meetings, as well as through experience with students and through student feedback. A key finding of the clinical faculty at Bastyr University was the emphasis on the principle “holism: treat the whole person” and respect for the patient’s own unique heal- ing order and his or her values as a context for applying the therapeutic order to clinical decision making.61 The therapeutic order, or hierarchy of healing, is now incorporated into ND college curricula throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. For example, an important international outgrowth of the profession’s develop- ment of theory is the adoption of the unified “Working Definition of Naturopathic Nutrition” in June 2003 by the Australian naturopathic profession (Box 2.1). The 3-year project, fostered by Dr. Stephen Myers, brought together nutrition faculty from naturopathic medi- cine colleges throughout Australia. The project was cohosted by the Naturopathy and Nutrition Panel, an independent group of naturo- paths and nutrition educators whose mission is to foster and support the development of the science, teaching, and practice of naturopathic nutrition, and the School of Natural and Complementary Medicine at Southern Cross University. The definition evolved over two retreats attended by more than 40 faculty members involved in teaching nutri- tion as part of a naturopathic medicine education. It commenced as a general agreement within the group that there was a real and distinct difference between conventional nutritional concepts and naturo- pathic nutritional theory. The general agreement was that the distinc- tion between the two had been poorly defined to date and had been the source of dissonance between the naturopathic and science faculty within the colleges. The obvious next step was to define that differ- ence to ensure that nutrition curriculum within naturopathic medi- cine colleges reflected the core elements of naturopathic nutrition. At the second retreat held in June 2003, the working definition was adopted with a recommendation that it be widely circulated within the naturopathic medicine profession to commence a dialogue aimed at both appropriate revision and broad adoption. This process created a much-needed consensus definition of naturopathic nutrition. This definition is based on the AANP defining principles and incorporates the therapeutic order theory. The AANP Definition of Naturopathic Medicine position paper was reviewed again in 2010 and reratified unanimously in 2011 by the AANP House of Delegates. “Prescription medications” were added to the single Treatment and Care section and both Naturopathic Practice sections in the 5-page paper (see www.naturopathic.org). In 2015 the World Naturopathic Federation, founded in 2015, published its first international survey results on naturopathic medicine’s core concepts and education in two white papers: The World Naturopathic Federation Report: Findings From the 1st World Naturopathic Federation Survey (2015) and WNF White Paper: Philosophies, and Principles, Theories (2017). The therapeutic order was reported in the top three (2015) and top five (2017) theory concepts utilized by the profession across the world. The results of the report stated that the AANP Definition of Naturopathic Medicine position paper and its six principles were widely accepted as written by professionalizing naturopaths in countries responding to the survey, at an average rate of 95%.62–65

# A THEORY OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE

Standard medicine, or biomedicine, has a simple and elegant paradigm. Simply stated, it is “the diagnosis and treatment of disease.” In prac- tice, this statement contains several assumptions. One assumption is that illness can be understood in terms of discrete diseases (i.e., human illnesses can be divided into identifiable entities, such as measles or specific forms of cancer, etc.). The next assumption is that “cure” is the elimination of the disease entity. The third assumption is that this is accomplished by the evidence-based application of pharmaceuticals, surgeries, or similar treatments to eliminate, palliate, or suppress the entity and its symptomatic expressions. These are so obvious that they are not commonly considered. They form the background thinking in medical decision making: “identify and treat the disease.” The elegance of this model, and the science behind it, has taken standard medicine to its highest point in history as a reliable vehicle to ease human illness, and its application has saved countless lives. The understanding of the physician, at least about the nature of pathology, has never been as complete as now. However, illness has a near-infinite capacity to baffle the physician. New diseases arise, such as Legionnaire’s disease, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and Lyme disease, and shifts occur in disease focus, such as the shift between 1900 and 2000 from acute infection to chronic illness as the predominant cause of death.66

## 16SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

Beyond these obvious changes, even with the current depth of understanding, the standard medical world often lacks the ability to effectively understand and cure chronic disease, and treatment tends to become a task of the management of symptoms and the attempt to reduce long-term damage and other consequences rather than actual cure of the illness. So, even representing an apex of human achievement as it does, standard medicine is not without its weaknesses. Its great- est weaknesses include its relatively high cost,67 its tendency to create iatrogenic disease,67 and its inability to cure chronic illness as easily as it once cured pneumonia with penicillin or tuberculosis with strepto- mycin. Compounding the problem is the growing prevalence of anti- biotic-resistant infections.68,69 Part of the reason for the failures within biomedical science is its mechanistic basis. Breaking the body down to its constituent parts has led to a fundamental ignorance of and disre- spect for the wholeness of the individual, the natural laws of physiology governing health and healing, and particularly for all things spiritual (the transpersonal domains). Inherent in the dictum—diagnose and treat the disease—is the general neglect of the larger understanding that disease is a process conducted by and within an intelligent organ- ism that is constantly attempting to heal itself, with disease manifesta- tions often being expressions of this self-healing endeavor. As noted by Pizzorno et al.,70 this intelligent organism strives for optimal function and health. Human beings “are natural organisms, our genomes devel- oped and expressed in the natural world. The patterns and processes inherent in nature are inherent in us. We exist as a part of complex patterns of matter, energy, and spirit. Nature doctors have observed the natural processes of these patterns in health and disease and deter- mined that there is an inherent drive toward health that lives within the patterns and processes of nature.” The uniqueness of naturopathic medicine is not in its therapeutic modalities or the “natural” alternatives to the drugs and surgeries of standard medicine. It is the clinical theory that governs the selection and application of these modalities, captured in the unifying defini- tion adopted in 1989 and expressed more specifically in the continuing articulation of clinical theory. That is, it is the way the naturopathic physician thinks about illness and healing. The first element of this theory is based on the first defining princi- ple: vis medicatrix naturae. It is based on the understanding that disease can be seen as a process and an entity. One can analyze the process of illness and derive some understanding. However, to do this, one needs to examine the assumptions underlying this concept. The governing assumptions of standard medicine are principally that diseases are entities and that drugs and surgery can eliminate these entities from the suffering person. These are not the governing assumptions of natu- ropathic medicine.

## Illness and Healing as Process

Naturopathic medicine can be characterized by a different model than “identify and treat the disease.” “The restoration of health” would be a better characterization. Naturopathic physicians adopted the fol- lowing elegantly brief definition of naturopathic medicine in 1989 in an AANP position paper: “Naturopathic physicians treat disease by restoring health.”45 Immediately, a significant difference is made clear: standard medicine is disease based; naturopathic medicine is health based. Although naturopathic medical students study pathology with the same intensity and depth as standard medical students, as well as its concomitant diagnoses, the naturopathic medical student learns to apply that information in a different context. In standard medicine, pathology and diagnosis are the basis for the discernment of the disease “entity” that afflicts the patient, the first of the two steps of identifying and destroying the entity of affliction. In naturopathic medicine, how- ever, disease is seen much more as a process than as an entity. Rather than viewing the ill patient as experiencing a “disease,” the naturo- pathic physician views the ill person as functioning within a process of disturbance and recovery, in the context of nature and natural systems. Various factors disturb normal health. If the physician can identify these disturbances and moderate them (or at least some of them), the illness and its effects abate. As disturbances are removed, the body can improve in function, and in doing so, health naturally improves. The natural tendency of the body is to maintain itself in as normal a state of health as is possible—this is the basis of homeostatic principles.71 The role of the physician facilitates this self-healing process. The obvious first task of the naturopathic physician, therefore, is to determine what is disturbing the health so that these causative ele- ments may be ameliorated. Disease is the process whereby the intelli- gent body reacts to disturbing elements. It employs such processes as inflammation and fever to help restore its health. In general, one can graph this process simply, as in Fig. 2.1.

## The Naturopathic Model in Acute Illness

One can see “illness as process” most easily in the common cold. Within standard medical understanding, the common cold is caused by a virus, from among a family of pathological viruses that can infect a person. The immune system responds, developing appropriate anti- bodies, which eventually neutralize the virus. There is no “cure” yet discovered, except time. Medications are used to ameliorate the symp- tomatic experience: aspirin or acetaminophen for fever, decongestants to dry the mucus discharge, and so forth. These measures are not cures; they reduce the symptomatic expression of the “cold” but often lengthen the process. In naturopathic medicine, the cold is seen not as a disease entity but as part of a fundamental process whereby the body restores itself to health. If the virus were the sole cause of the common cold, then every- one who came into contact with a sufficient dose of the virus would get the cold. Obviously, this does not happen. Susceptibility factors include immune competence, fatigue, vitality, genetics, and other host factors.72 The virus enters a milieu in which all these factors affect the process. Once the virus enters the system, and if it overcomes resistance factors (Box 2.2), one begins to see disturbance of func- tion, as illustrated in Fig. 2.1. One does not feel quite right. One may

begin to get a sore throat, the first inflammatory reaction, occurring at the point of entry of the virus into the body. The immune factors described may overcome the virus at this point, may be insufficient, or may be suppressed. All of this is mutable to some extent and is affected by host factors, such as nutritional status and fatigue, and can be influ- enced by taking immune tonics, vitamin C, and other supplements. To the individual with the condition, the “cold” may proceed into a general state of fatigue and inflammation, possibly fever followed by mucus discharge, cough, and other symptoms, as the body processes and responds to the virus and its effects; eventually, the body over- comes it and eliminates the results. In the naturopathic model, the cold is not understood so much to be a separate disease entity but a general and fundamental process of disturbance and recovery within the living body. It is a method whereby the body restores itself after a sufficient amount of distur- bance accumulates within the system. This is why the cold has no “cure.” It is the cure for what ails the body. In the naturopathic model of health, it is the support of this “adaptive response”—the restoration of balance that is the central point—through which the process is the “cure” (Box 2.3). The early naturopathic philosophers and clinicians predicted that the treatment of acute disease by suppressing symptoms (discussed in more depth later in the chapter) would result in more chronic disease. The current disease burden in the Western world certainly confirms this century-old prediction.

## The Naturopathic Model in Chronic Illness

Chronic illness arises, in general, when any or all of three factors occur: 1. The disturbing factors persist, such as a chronically improper diet, which continues to burden the body cumulatively, as the digestive processes slowly weaken under the stress of the improper or inade- quate diet. 2. The reactive potential is blocked or suppressed, often by drugs, which interfere with the capacity of the body to process and remove its disturbances. 3. The vitality of the system is insufficient, or has become too over- whelmed, to mount a significant and sufficient reaction. Again, as Lindlahr stated in Nature Cure, Chapters 2 and 4, dis- ease is caused by one or more of the following as a result of violating nature’s laws of healthy living: Lowered vitality Abnormal composition of blood and lymph Accumulation of morbid matter and poisons As any of these factors either continue to accumulate and dis- turb function or reduce the ability of the body to purge the dis- turbance, the body slides into a chronic, weakened reactive state, with possible episodes of intermittent reaction, and is perceived to be in a persistent chronic illness. Ultimately, as function is suffi- ciently disturbed, structures or functions are damaged, and chronic inflammation becomes ulceration or scar tissue formation. In terms of the allostatic model, the balance has been disrupted, and there is no more adaptive potential. Atrophy, paralysis, or even tumor for- mation73–75 may occur. All of this is the body manifestly doing the best it can for itself in the presence of persistent disturbing factors and with respect to the limitations and range of vitality influenced by the constitution, psycho-emotional/spiritual state, and genotype of the person and his or her surrounding environment (Boxes 2.4 and 2.5). Reversal of this overwhelmed condition is rarely accomplished by medicating the pathological state. This often results in the control of symptoms but with the persistence of the illness while ideally con- trolling its more dangerous aspects using higher force interventions, such as pharmaceutical drugs and surgical intervention. Reversal is more likely accomplished by identifying and ameliorating the distur- bance and, as necessary, strengthening or supporting the individual response or reactive potential. The first step in this process is to iden- tify and reduce disturbing factors.

# THE DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH

To reduce the disturbance, one must identify the disturbance. In stan- dard medicine, the first step is to identify the pathology, which is then treated. In naturopathic medicine, one must come to understand what is disturbing the health. To do this, the physician needs to understand what determines health in the first place. The physician can then eval- uate the patient in these terms and come to understand what is dis- turbing the natural state of health. Such a list could be created by any doctor, certainly any naturopathic physician. The authors propose the use of the list in Box 2.6. Some of these determinants have been discussed—those modifi- able behavioral factors such as drug and alcohol use, poor diet or frank malnutrition, lack of physical exercise, environmental and socioeco- nomic factors, and unsafe sexual practices76–79 (Box 2.7). Many of these behavioral factors have major psychological and spiritual com- ponents, and the effect can be increased stress on both the individual and the family, with all its attendant consequences.79–81 The naturo- pathic physician evaluates the patient with these areas in mind, look- ing for aspects of disturbance, first in the spirit and most generally in diet, digestion, and stress in its various aspects. In this evaluation, the naturopathic physician brings to bear a body of knowledge somewhat unique to naturopathic medicine to evaluate not solely in terms of pathological entity but also in terms of normal function and subclin- ical functional disturbance (Box 2.8). By locating areas of abnormal function or disturbance, the naturopathic physician acts or recom- mends ways to ameliorate the disturbance. As disturbing factors or insults to the system are reduced, the natural tendency of the system is to improve and optimize its function, directing the system back toward normalcy, or homeostasis. In more conven- tional medical terms, this is one of the fundamental concepts of the allostatic model.80,82–85 In naturopathic thinking, this is the removal of the obstacles to cure, which allows the emerging action of the vis med- icatrix naturae, the vital force, the healing power of nature. This is the first step in the hierarchy of healing and what naturopathic physicians may call the overarching model in the clinical theory (the process of healing) of naturopathic medicine: the therapeutic order. This process can be seen in the naturopathic model of healing in Fig. 2.1.

## Christy Lee Engel ND, Lac, Bastyr University,

The assessment order is a set of prioritized components of a vital- istic naturopathic assessment of the patient based on, or dictated by observations of the • nature, • locus, or • center of gravity of the degenerative (disease) process. This degenerative disease process is evaluated in the context of nat- ural health and healing systems, which interconnect • mind, body, and spirit; • the natural, cultural, and socioeconomic environments; • our heredity, and • how we live. These components have been recognized from ancient times through the present.86 Inclusive of conventional pathological eval- uation, the naturopathic assessment order is a guideline to iden- tifying and assessing various types, levels of, and priorities in the underlying causation of degenerative and dysfunctional conditions. The assessment order provides an ordered, nonrigid, dynamic framework (leading to the therapeutic order) for gauging the “cen- ter of gravity” of the disease process (the most efficient level at which to intervene to engage the patient’s healing response). By carefully assessing the status of the patient’s health and vitality and identifying components currently contributing to the disease process, the underlying causes become evident. These components

are assessed for presence, absence, onset, triggers, depth, duration, and modalities and for physiological, psychospiritual, mental, bio- field, organ system, and tissue targets. Components to be assessed include (1) determinants of health; (2) vitality; psychospiritual, mental, and energetic availability; and vital force; (3) physiological and energetic systems; (4) structure and musculoskeletal com- ponents; (5) the pathology itself, its biochemistry, histology, and pathophysiology; and (6 and 7) the level and strength of specific, targeted, managerial, and higher-force interventions necessary for patient safety and reduction of suffering. Using the assessment order also engages the power of the patient– physician relationship: docere. “If the whole reason for the assessment is to develop a treatment plan [suitable to the patient’s safety and health recovery], that is one way to look at it. When we add the docere experience between physician and patient, then we add the complex- ity of the two systems, the intention of the physician, the energetic of the Vis—and we have a whole new dynamic in the assessment pro- cess, which itself begins to be the treatment process,” notes Christy Lee Engel ND, LAc. The case-taking and evaluation process thus begins the treat- ment process. It is the foundation of the doctor–patient relationship. Subjective and objective data contribute to both the pathological and the vitalistic assessment. The pathological assessment is viewed as partial although valuable information within the context of the entire vitalistic naturopathic assessment. The naturopathic assessment, in effect, places the disease process, its specific pathophysiology, and its staging within the broader context of the patient’s vitality, constitu- tion, etiologic factors (never been well since), and underlying or root causes and leads to the level of intervention suggested by the therapeu- tic order. The patient’s story or patho-biography (Box 2.9) is an essential and powerful tool for making a complete naturopathic assessment. All information, subjective and objective (S, O), leads to the diagnosis and naturopathic assessment summary using the naturopathic assessment order (A) and to the treatment plan using the naturopathic therapeutic order (P).

## 20SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

# THERAPEUTIC ORDER

The naturopathic medicine therapeutic order is a natural hierarchy of therapeutic intervention based on or dictated by observations of the nature of the healing process from ancient times through the present.86 The therapeutic order is a systematic approach to engaging the patient’s healing response by working with the order of effective intervention inherent in the healing power and processes of nature. This order is simultaneously linear, holarchical, and recursive and functions as a multilayered, complex system powered by the vital force. It is either limited or increased in its efficiency by the level of the patient’s vitality. By removing obstacles to healing, establishing health-promoting factors (giving the body and spirit what it needs), and stimulating the vital force, vitality is increased, igniting the orderly self-healing processes of vis medicatrix naturae. Naturopathic physicians have long recognized (Box 2.10) that (1) the healing process is observable—a natural phenomenon (law of nature) seen consistently in health, healing, and illness (e.g., similar to laws of biology, physics, and regularities of other natural sciences); (2) “Naturopathic medicine recognizes this healing process to be ordered and intelligent” (Snider and Zeff et al., AANP House of Delegates, 1989, 2001, 2011). The principle vis medicatrix naturae guides the physician to ignite this ordered process by removing obstacles to healing (disturbing factors) and establishing a healthy inter- nal and external environment (AANP 1989). This is accomplished by establishing individualized global health determinants that “treat disease by restoring health.” Less detailed therapeutic orders also exist in tradi- tional Chinese, Tibetan, Ayurvedic, and Unani medicine theories. The therapeutic order is a natural ordering of the modalities of naturopathic medicine and their application.

plastic, in that one must evaluate the unique needs, and even the unique healing requirements, of the specific patient or situation.87 However, the nature of healing dictates a general approach to treatment. In gen- eral, this order is listed in Box 2.11. An analogy for the therapeutic order in Australian integrative med- icine is what is called the “softer option” model of patient care.88 This model recognizes that, given a choice, the patient will generally choose the softer option, provided that this does not limit a harder option if the softer option fails. By way of example, given a choice between an antibiotic and amputation for a minor cut finger, most people would choose the softer option. Expanding this range of choice to an herbal cream, antiseptic (herbal or nonherbal), and a Band-Aid; an antibi- otic; or amputation, we develop a therapeutic order ranging from the softest option (the least force) to the hardest option (the higher-force intervention). The therapeutic order can be seen as a progression of therapeutic interventions that begins with this “softer option.”

## Acute and Chronic Concerns

As discussed previously, there is an inherent drive toward health that is observable within the patterns and processes of nature. The drive is not perfect. There are times when, unguided, unassisted, or unstopped, the drive goes astray, causing preventable harm or even death in patients; the constructive healing intention89 becomes destructive pathology. The ND is trained to know, respect, and work with this drive in both acute and chronic illness, using the therapeutic order, and to know when to wait or do nothing, act preventively, assist, amplify, palliate, intervene, manipulate, control, or even suppress using the principle of the least force.90 Acute and chronic concerns are both addressed and managed using the therapeutic order.91 Acute concerns are addressed first to avoid further damage, risk, or harm to the patient. The point of entry for assessment and therapy is dependent on each patient’s need for effective and safe care, healing, and prevention of suffering and degeneration.70,91 Naturopathic physicians avoid suppression of symptoms in acute circumstances unless necessary for patients’ well-being and safety. Instead, wherever possible, therapies for acute concerns use the least force (minimizing toxic side effects, suppression of natural functions, and physiological burdens) available to intervene effectively, healing or palliating as needed. The full range of modalities, from nutrition to homeopathy, botanical and physical medicine, hydrotherapy, counsel- ing, prescriptive medication, and surgery, is available to the patient as the naturopathic physician works to apply the least force in providing effective preventive, acute, and chronic care.91

## Establish the Conditions for Health

## Identify and Remove Disturbing Factors

If one understands health to be the natural state and “disturbance” the original culprit, then identifying and reducing disturbance is the obvious first step, unless there is immediate danger to life or limb, in which case acting to reduce suffering and preserve life or limb is par- amount. In most chronic disease, neither is immediately threatened. This understanding dictates the primary treatment goal the physician must attend to: the identification and amelioration of those factors disturbing health, especially factors that most disturb health (inappro- priate diet, excessive stress, and spiritual disharmony). To understand what disturbs health, one must understand what determines health. The naturopathic physician evaluates a patient with reference to the determinants of health to discover wherein the patient’s health is dis- turbed. In this step, the physician is essentially removing the obstacles to cure and allowing the vis medicatrix naturae to do its work. Among these many possibilities, the most significant are atti- tude, diet, digestion, psychological and other stressors, and what might be called “spiritual integrity.” Humans have a transpersonal dimension and can be seen as spiritual beings. Spiritual here is not defined by religion or belief in a deity or deities; it is that compo- nent of individuals that gives rise to their inner compass, their “joie de vivre” and their internal meaning of life, their core beliefs, and their values. Perceived in this way, it can be seen that many people in society are experiencing “spiritual crises.”92 Although the general purview of the physician is the body, that instrument cannot be sep- arated from the spirit that animates it. If the spirit is disturbed, the body cannot be fundamentally healthy. Hahnemann, the brilliant and insightful founder of homeopathy, instructed physicians to attend to the spirit.93 Disturbance in the spirit permeates the body and eventuates physical manifestation.

## 22SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

for perceiving such disturbances and addressing them. At colleges of naturopathic medicine in Australia, the United Kingdom, and North America, faculty work with naturopathic medicine students to develop their ability to perceive the spiritual nature of an individ- ual as a foundational skill in addressing the spiritual crises or funda- mental needs that have a profound effect on health and well-being. Using this definition, both atheists and agnostics can be seen to have a spiritual aspect. This definition also removes spirituality from religiosity in a way that does not denigrate any individual religious belief, allowing the naturopathic clinician to explore this aspect as part of routine care. One of the oldest concepts in naturopathic medicine is the con- cept of toxemia. Toxemia is the generation and accumulation of met- abolic wastes and exogenous toxins within the body. These toxins may be the results of maldigestive processes, intermediate metab- olites, environmental xenobiotics, and colon bacterial metabolites, for example. These toxins become irritants within the body, result- ing in the inflammation of tissues and the ultimate interference with normal biochemical processes.94 The maldigestive and dysbiotic95,96 origin of these internally and externally derived toxins is the result of an inappropriate diet, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the effects of excessive stress on digestion.97 Eating a diet that cannot be easily digested or that is out of appropriate nutrient balance for the indi- vidual results in the creation of metabolic toxins in the intestines.95–98 Stress, causing the excessive secretion of cortisol and adrenaline, results in the decrease of blood flow to the digestive process, among other effects,80,82–85 which decreases the efficient functioning of digestion and increases the tendency toward maldigestion, dysbiosis, and toxemia. Physicians can now easily measure the degree of tox- emia in various ways (urinary indican or phenol98). The older con- cept of toxemia,99,100 with scientific advances in its understanding91,99 (Box 2.12), may now be productively combined with an understand- ing of the newer concept of allostasis82–85 and the historical89,100 and reemerging discussion on the inflammatory component of many, if not most, chronic diseases. Spiritual disharmony, inappropriate diet, digestive disturbance, stress, and toxemia (leading to inflam- mation) are considered primary causes of chronic illness and must be addressed if healing is to occur. Beyond these, other disturbing factors must be discerned and addressed, whichever pertain to the individual patient.101,152–154,158,159,165–171

<!-- chunk -->

## Institute a Healthier Regimen

As a corollary of the first step, once physicians have determined major contributing factors to illness, they construct a healthier regimen for the patient. Some disturbing factors can be eliminated, like inappro- priate dietary elements.110,111 Others are a matter of different choices or living differently. The basics to consider are appropriate diet, appro- priate rest and exercise, stress moderation, a healthy environment, and a sense of spiritual fulfillment.82,92,141,142,145,146,148 If this model is correct, these measures alone should result in enhanced health. The problem arises in knowing how to do these things. What is an appropriate diet? This is an area of considerable con- troversy. Physicians think about diet in many different ways. The goal of dietary improvement is to reduce the symptomatic consequences of the patient’s diet and provide optimal nutrition to the patient. The point here, regardless of how this is done, is that it is central and essen- tial for fundamental health improvement. If the diet is not correct, if digestion is not appropriate, if nutrition is not adequate, the patient cannot appropriately function or improve, and the scene is potentially set for chronic inflammatory conditions and the resetting of the adap- tive allostatic and homeostatic set points. If the diet and digestion are appropriate, the basis for improvement in other areas is enhanced. The same is true with these other fundamental elements, to which Lindlahr referred in the first element of his catechism, “return to nature”: exercise, rest, dress, and so forth.29 These have been expanded in the “determinants of health.” They create the basis for improvement. What this really means is to change the “terrain,” the conditions in which the disease has formed—not only to change but to improve the conditions so that there is less basis for the disease. Hahnemann addresses this on the first page of his Organon of Medicine.93 He identified four tasks for the physician: to understand the true nature of illness, “what is to be cured”; to understand the healing potential of medicines (whether they enhance or suppress function); to understand obstacles to recovery and how to remove them (the determinants of health); and to understand the elements that derange health and how to correct them so that recovery may be per- manent.93 Changing and improving the terrain in which the disease devel- oped is the obvious first step in bringing about improvement. This sets up the basis for the following elements to have the most beneficial effects.

<!-- chunk -->

## Stimulate the Self-Healing Mechanisms

A certain percentage of patients will improve sufficiently simply by removing disturbing factors and establishing a healthier regimen. Most require more work. Once the patient is prepared, once the terrain is begin- ning to clear of disturbing factors, then one begins to apply stimulation to the self-healing mechanisms. The basis of this approach is the underly- ing recognition of the vis medicatrix naturae, the tendency of the body to be self-healing, the wisdom and intelligence within the system that con- stantly tends toward the healthiest expression of function, and the healing “forces” in the natural environment (air, water, light, etc.). The body heals itself. The physician can help create the circumstances to promote this. Then, as necessary, the physician stimulates the system. This also requires that attention be given to the patient’s emotional state of mind because the psychological condition of the patient is often of major importance.113,114 One of the best ways to do this is through constitutional hydro- therapy, as developed by Otis G. Carroll, ND, early in the past century. This procedure is simple, involving the placement of hot and then cold towels on the trunk and back, in a specific sequence (depending on the patient), usually accompanied by a sine-wave stimulation of the diges- tive tract. This is a dynamic treatment, simple, inexpensive, and uni- versally applicable. It helps recover digestive function, stimulates toxin elimination, “cleanses the blood,” enhances immune function, and has several other effects. It moves the system along toward a health- ier state.115 Exercise often achieves similar results. Many naturopathic modalities can be used to stimulate the overall vital force. More specific approaches to stimulation, although general in effect, are applied differently to each patient and have a less general effect than those previously mentioned. Homeopathy and acupuncture116–118 are often the primary methods of such stimulation. They add little to the system; they are not gross chemical treatments. They work with what is there, stimulating a reaction, stimulating function, and correcting disturbed patterns.

## 23CHAPTER 2 A Hierarchy of Healing: The Therapeutic Order

Each method helps move the system out of its disturbed state and, with the reduction of encumbrance, helps move it toward health. Finally, exposure to the patterns, rhythms, and forces of nature is a traditional part of naturopathic medicine and the tradition of nature doctors throughout the world. As previously noted, “We exist as part of complex patterns of matter, energy, and spirit,”2 and the natural progression of these patterns, and the drive toward health inherent in them, is a natural ally for the physician. Exposure to appropriate rhythms, patterns, and forces of nature strengthens vitality and stimu- lates the healing power of nature.

<!-- chunk -->

## Support Weakened or Damaged Systems or Organs

Some systems or functions require more than stimulation to improve. Some organs are weakened or damaged (e.g., adrenal fatigue after pro- longed stress), and some systems are blocked or congested (e.g., the hepatic detoxification pathways) and require extra help. This is where naturopathic physicians use their vast natural medicinary. Botanical medicines can affect any system or organ, enhancing its function, improving its circulation, providing specific nutrition, and stimulating repair. Glandular substances can be applied to a similar purpose. Plus, there are a growing number of evidence-based “nutraceuticals”— biological compounds that enhance metabolic pathways and provide specific substances to enhance metabolic function.119–130 Naturopathic physicians can also apply specific homeopathic medications, usually in the lower potencies, which act nutritively and can stimulate specific organs or functions. This method, gener- ally referred to as drainage, can be used to stimulate detoxification of specific substances from the body in general or of specific organ sys- tems or tissues. Dr. Pizzorno’s work in Total Wellness and The Toxin Solution131,132; the work of “functional medicine” leader Jeffrey Bland, PhD; and the Textbook of Functional Medicine by Jones90 exemplify the clinical strategies applied at this level of the therapeutic order. These strategies are used to restore optimal function to an entire physiological system (immune, cardiovascular, detoxification, life force, endocrine).131,132 One can also use specific exercises to stimulate or enhance organ health. Some systems of yoga and qi gong are organ specific. Specific applications of hydrotherapy and other physiotherapy systems can be applied to enhance the function of organs or tissues. It has been the clinical experience of many naturopathic physicians that these methods, combined with an appropriate diet and a healthier regimen, along with constitutional hydrotherapy, appropriate home- opathy, and acupuncture, bring most health problems back to normal, without negative consequence, rapidly, efficiently, and permanently.

## Address Structural Integrity

Many structural problems result from generalized stress of some kind on internal systems. For example, midback misalignment or discom- fort (T1–T12) is often found associated with a history of underlying stress on the digestive organs, the enervation of which originates at those spinal segments. One can manipulate the vertebra back into proper alignment or massage contracted musculature, but until one corrects the underlying functional disturbance, there will be a ten- dency to repeated structural misalignment. In some circumstances, the singular problem may be simply structural disintegrity. One may have fallen or been hit in some fashion and simply needs the neck manip- ulated back into proper alignment and the surrounding soft tissue relaxed. There may be no dietary error or other disturbance aside from the original injury, and correction requires only simple manipulation or therapeutic massage. This is an example of the flexibility of the ther- apeutic order concept. In this case, first-order therapeutics manipu- late the cervical spine or relax chronically contracted muscles. Usually, however, the problem of structure is part of the larger problem, and such intervention becomes a fourth-order therapeutic.70 Reintegrating structure can occur in many ways, one of which is the method of “bone cracking” known to the ancient Greeks and Chinese and probably all other ancient healing cultures. However, there are nonforce manipulative systems that include many modalities of ther- apeutic massage. Some systems of exercise are designed to reintegrate and maintain normal structural relationships. Any of these might be appropriate to a specific patient. By approaching the problem in the context of the therapeutic order, one can expect structural corrections to be required only occasionally and for the results to be more or less permanent.

## Modalities, or Interventions

Having gone through the first four steps of this therapeutic hierarchy, most patients improve. The improvement is based on the sound foot- ing of the underlying correction or removal of fundamental causative elements. It is also based on the intrinsic nature of the body to heal itself using the least possible force. Most pathology improves or disappears under these circumstances, but sometimes it is necessary to address pathology. This may be the case because the particular pathology may be threatening to life or limb. Acting on this threat is imperative. It can often be done with naturopathic means, directed specifically against the pathology. Biochemical or genetic individuality also can demand an emphasis at this level of intervention. One of the major conflicts in naturopathic medicine is that some practitioners find it expedient to diagnose and treat pathology (the standard medical model) rather than pursue a naturopathic model of practice. This approach tends to be less satisfying and less productive of the most elegant outcomes and the long-term continued health of the patient. It also reduces the capacity of the physician to treat, such as in cases where there is no evidence-based treatment for the pathol- ogy in question, or where there is no clear diagnosis (i.e., no distinct pathology to treat). This approach is increasingly referred to as “green allopathy.” However, the vast body of knowledge that naturopathic education presents in this arena makes such an approach seductive, especially in a culture that more or less expects, supports, reinforces, and pays for a biomedical (“allopathic”) approach to diagnosis and treatment. It is easy to do this. The culture is accustomed to this model and often expects to encounter this in the naturopathic physician’s office. In some states, such as Oregon, Washington, and Arizona, where the naturopathic formulary includes most antibiotics and many phar- maceutical drugs, one can practice almost without distinction from a medical doctor. The typical naturopathic formulary is often sufficient to prescribe on a strictly pathological basis. The problem with this is that it is generally not as effective, espe- cially in the treatment of chronic disease. The value of naturopathic medicine in our culture is not that naturopathic physicians can func- tion almost like medical doctors, with a “natural” formulary instead of drugs. It is that they offer a fundamentally different approach, one based on the restoration of health rather than the treatment of disease. Given all of this, it still may be useful to directly address the patho- logical entity or its etiology.112,133-136 When treating an antibiotic- resistant infection, for example, it may be useful to apply botanical medicines with specific antibiotic properties, along with immune ton- ics and the more fundamental steps of this therapeutic hierarchy. In difficult cases, such as many cancers, using agents that have specific, pathology-based therapeutics may be an essential element of compre- hensive treatment. The naturopathic formulary provides a vast and increasing number of such options. One advantage of such treatment

is that, in general, when applied by a knowledgeable practitioner, it rarely adds more burden or toxicity to the system. Naturopathic pathology-based treatments still follow the dictum “do no harm.”

## Address Pathology: Use Specific Pharmacological or

<!-- chunk -->

## Synthetic Substances

About 800,000 medical doctors and osteopathic physicians in the United States are trained in the science of pathology-based treatment, using pharmaceuticals and surgery, for example. There are times when such an approach is necessary to preserve life, limb, or function. Although some naturopathic physicians, by training and by statute, may prescribe pharma- ceuticals or perform minor office procedures and surgeries, naturopathic physicians may also refer patients in need of such services to appropriate standard medical doctors (MDs) or medically trained osteopaths (DOs). In a growing number of states, NDs can legally provide an expanding range of prescription drugs. Although this is an important tool for the naturo- pathic primary caregiver, this privilege requires enhanced responsibility for the ND to prescribe those substances only as needed—and to thoroughly rely on applying the least force appropriate to effect recovery and protect patient safety. Both Dr. Lust (at the end of his life) and Dr. Bastyr recog- nized the need for NDs to have the ability to access, as needed, prescriptive medications and perform minor office procedures to function as primary caregivers. However, both admonished that the philosophy and principles of the medicine guide their judicious use—only as truly needed, based on the least force necessary to restore the patient to health. Naturopathic physicians are well trained in this regard and respect the necessity and utility of standard medical practice in appropriate situations. Some disagreement exists regarding which situations may be appropriate. The AANP has developed position papers to resolve some of these questions. In general, although recognizing the necessity of such treatment, most naturopathic physicians also recognize that such treatment often carries consequences that also must be addressed.

<!-- chunk -->

## Suppress Pathology

Sometimes it is necessary, when there is a risk of harm to the patient’s health or tissue or to relieve suffering, to suppress pathology. Medical doctors are especially trained in this art and have powerful and effective tools with which to do this. Unfortunately, suppression, because it does not fundamentally remove or address essential causative factors (e.g., dietary error) often results in the development of other, often deeper disturbance or pathology. Because much pathological expression is the result of the actual self-healing mechanisms (e.g., inflammation), sup- pressive measures, in general, work in opposition to the vis medicatrix naturae. The result of suppression is that the fundamental disturbing factors are still at play within the person, still disrupting function to some extent, whereas the suppression reduces the symptomatic expres- sion and resolution of disturbance. One simple example of this is the overuse of oral corticosteroidal anti-inflammatory and antihistaminic drugs in the treatment of acute asthma. This usually effectively opens the airways. However, prolonged use weakens the patient. If the treatment persists, the patient may become immune compromised or osteoporotic or can develop psychological disorders. These symptoms are part of the long-term effects of steroids.137 It may, of necessity, maintain breathing, but the long-term cost to the organism can be high. Suppression, although it may be lifesaving, often has serious conse- quences. With standard medical methods of care, the cure of chronic illness is often elusive. This is the benefit of the naturopathic approach: by taking a nonsuppressive course of action, based on sound physio- logical principles, one can often restore health without recourse to the potential damage of suppression. Naturopathic physicians, although recognizing the occasional necessity of suppressive approaches, generally avoid suppression, which is a primary way in which physi- cians can inflict harm, even with the best of intentions.

# THEORY IN NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE

The therapeutic hierarchy is based on the observation of the nature of healing and the inherent order of the healing process. It is part of a unify- ing theory of naturopathic medicine, an outgrowth of the principles that underlie naturopathic thinking. It provides the physician with instruc- tions that order the many therapeutic modalities used by the practice. The consensus definition of naturopathic medicine, adopted by the AANP in 1989, is a statement of identity, distinguishing naturopathic medicine from other systems of medical thought. Contained within it is a set of instructions regarding the practice of the medicine. The three con- cepts discussed here—“disease as process,” “the determinants of health,” and “the therapeutic order”—are an articulation of these instructions. They are presented as a clinical theory of naturopathic medicine. They have been crystallized, as is the definition, from the observation by nature doctors throughout time and across many traditions of the nature of health, disease, and healing. They provide the physician with instructions. These instructions include a procedure for thinking about human illness in such a way that one can approach its cure in an ordered fashion by understanding its process as an expression of the vis medica- trix naturae. It provides the framework for truly evaluating the patient as a whole being: spiritual, mental/emotional, and physical, rather than as a category of pathology. Plus, the theory of naturopathic medicine pro- vides the physician a system for organizing and efficiently integrating the vast therapeutic array provided in naturopathic medicine. Ultimately, it satisfies Hahnemann’s observation of the ideal role of medicine, that “the highest ideal of cure is rapid, gentle and permanent restoration of the health … in the shortest, most reliable and most harmless way, upon easily comprehensible principles.”93 The roots of the observations that form this theory are traceable through the mid- and early 20th century, to the traditional theory of the 19th-century European nature cure, and to the roots and theories of traditional world medicines. Hippocrates’s writings on the vis medicatrix naturae form a foundation that historically underpins the development of this theory.138,139 Finally, it is observable across many traditional world medicines that various healing orders are described. Such structures hold impli- cations for public and community health priorities and suggest the reprioritization of healthcare priorities and financing. Implications for public policy and the growing national disease debt invite exploration. Although this presentation is not comprehensive, the attempt has been made to demonstrate these roots, at least in some of their major articulations. The work presented here is a continuation of this his- torical process, which ultimately is driven by the true mission of the physician: to ease suffering and to preserve life. What Methods of Cure Are in Conformity with the Constructive Principle in Nature? Those methods which: Establish normal sur- roundings and natural habits of life in accord with Nature’s Laws. Economize vital force. Build up the blood on a natural basis, that is, supply the blood with its natural constituents in right proportions. Promote the elimination of waste matter and poisons without in any way injuring the human body. Arouse the individual in the highest possible degree to the consciousness of personal accountability and the necessity of intelligent personal effort and self-help.29

## 26SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

others have brought into being single systems whose focal features are perpetuated in Naturopathy. Jesus Christ—I say it reverently—knew the possibility of physi- cal immortality. He believed in bodily beauty; He founded Mental Healing; He perfected Spirit-power. And Naturopathy will include ultimately the supreme forces that made the Man of Galilee omnipo- tent.The scope of Naturopathy is from the first kiss of the new-found lovers to the burying of the centenarian whose birth was the symbol of their perfected one-ness. It includes ideally every life-phase of the id, the embryo, the foetus, the birth, the babe, the child, the youth, the man, the lover, the husband, the father, the patriarch, the soul. We believe in strong, pure, beautiful bodies thrilling perpetually with the glorious power of radiating health. We want every man, woman and child in this great land to know and embody and feel the truths of right living that mean conscious mastery. We plead for the renouncing of poisons from the coffee, white flour, glucose, lard, and like venom of the American table to patent medicines, tobacco, liquor and the other inevitable recourse of perverted appetite. We long for the time when an eight-hour day may enable every worker to stop existing long enough to live; when the spirit of universal brother- hood shall animate business and society and the church; when every American may have a little cottage of his own, and a bit of ground where he may combine Aerotherapy, Heliotherapy, Geotherapy, Aristophagy and nature’s other forces with home and peace and hap- piness and things forbidden to flat-dwellers; when people may stop doing and thinking and being for others and be for themselves; when true love and divine marriage and pre-natal culture and controlled parenthood may fill this world with germ-gods instead of humanized animals.In a word, Naturopathy stands for the reconciling, harmo- nizing and unifying of nature, humanity and God. Fundamentally therapeutic because men need healing; elemen- tally educational because men need teaching; ultimately inspira- tional because men need empowering, it encompasses the realm of human progress and destiny. Perhaps a word of appreciation is due Mr. John H. Scheel, who first used the term “Naturopathic” in connection with his Sanitar- ium “Badekur,” and who has courteously allowed us to share the name. It was chosen out of some 150 submitted, as most compre- hensive and enduring. All our present plans are looking forward some five or ten or fifty years when Naturopathy shall be the great- est system in the world. Actually the present development of Naturopathy is pitifully inadequate, and we shall from time to time present plans and ask suggestions for the surpassing achievement of our world-wide pur- pose. Dietetics, Physical Culture and Hydropathy are the measures upon which Naturopathy is to build; mental culture is the means, and soul-selfhood is the motive. If the infinite immensity of plan, plea and purpose of this par- ticular magazine and movement were told you, you would simply smile in your condescendingly superior way and straightway forget. Not having learned as yet what a brain and imagination and a will can do, you consider Naturopathy an ordinarily innocuous affair, with a lukewarm purpose back of it, and an ebbing future ahead of it. Such is the character of the average wishy-washy health move- ment and tumultuous wave of reform. Your incredulous smile would not discomfit us—we do not importune your belief, or your help, or your money. Wherein we differ from the orthodox self-labeled reformer, who cries for sym- pathy and cringes for shekels. We need money most persistently—a million dollars could be used to advantage in a single branch of the work already definitely planned and awaiting materialization; and we need co-operation in a hundred different ways. But these are not the things we expect or deem best. Criticism, fair, full and unsparing is the one thing of value you can give this paper. Let me explain. Change is the keynote of this January issue—in form, title, make-up. If it please you, your subscription and a word to your still-benighted friends is ample appreciation. But if you don’t like it, say so. Tell us wherein the paper is inefficient or redundant or ill-advised, how it will more nearly fit into your personal needs, what we can do to make it the broadest, deepest, truest, most inspiring of the mighty host of printed powers. The most salient letter of less than 300 words will be printed in full, and we shall ask to present the writer with a subscription-receipt for life. By to-morrow you will probably have forgotten this request; by the day after you will have dropped back into your old ways of criminal eating and foolish drinking and sagged standing and con- gested sitting and narrow thinking and deadly fearing—until the next progress paper of New Thought or Mental Science or Dietetics or Physical Culture prods you into momentary activity. Between now and December we shall tell you just how to preserve the right attitude, physical and mental, without a sin- gle external aid; and how, every moment of every day, to tingle and pulsate and leap with the boundless ecstasy of manhood con- sciously nearing perfection.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF EARLY AMERICAN MEDICINE

# WITH AN EMPHASIS ON NATURAL HEALING

To understand the evolutionary history of naturopathic medicine in this country, it is necessary to view the internal development of the profession against the historical, social, and cultural backdrop of American social history.

## Medicine in America: 1800–1875

In the America of 1800, although a professional medical class existed, medicine was primarily domestically oriented. An individual who fell ill was commonly nursed by a friend or family member who relied upon William Buchan’s Domestic Medicine (1769), John Wesley’s Primitive Physic (1747), or John Gunn’s Domestic Medicine (1830).1

## Professional Medicine

Professional medicine transferred from England and Scotland to America in prerevolutionary days. However, 18th- and early-19th-cen- tury America considered the concept of creating a small, elite, learned profession to run counter to the political and institutional concepts of early American democracy.1 The first medical school in the American colonies opened in at what was then the College of Philadelphia (later the University of Pennsylvania), and the school was dominated by revolutionary leader and physician Benjamin Rush, a signatory to the Declaration of Independence. The proliferation of medical schools to train the new professional med- ical class began seriously after the war of 1812. Between 1810 and 1820, new schools were established in Baltimore, Lexington, Cincinnati, and even in rural communities in Vermont and Western New York. Between 1820 and 1850, substantial numbers of schools were established in the western rural states. By 1850, there were 42 medical schools recognized in the United States, although there were only 3 in all of France. Generally, these schools were started by a group of five to seven local physicians approaching a local college with the idea of establish- ing a medical school in conjunction with the college’s educational facil- ities. The schools were largely apprenticeship based, and the professors received their remuneration directly from fees paid by the students.

## 27CHAPTER 3 The History of Naturopathic Medicine: Origins and Overview

The requirements for a doctor of medicine (MD) degree in late- 18th- and early-19th-century America were roughly as follows: • Knowledge of Latin and natural and experimental philosophy • Three years of serving an apprenticeship under practicing physi- cians • Attending two terms of lectures and passing of attendant examinations • A thesis Additionally, graduating students had to be at least 21 years of age.1 The rise of any professional class is gradual and marked by diffi- culties, and varying concepts existed as to the demarcation of a “pro- fessional” physician. Contrasts included graduates of medical school versus nongraduates, medical society members versus nonmembers, and licensed physicians versus unlicensed “doctors.” Licensing statutes came into existence between 1830 and 1850 but were soon repealed because they were considered “undemocratic” during the apex of Jacksonian democracy.

## Thomsonianism

In 1822 the rise in popularity of Samuel Thomson and his publication of New Guide to Health helped frustrate the creation of a professional medical class. Thomson’s work was a compilation of his personal view of medical theory and American Indian herbal and medical botan- ical lore. Thomson espoused the belief that disease had one general cause—“cold” influences on the human body—and that disease there- fore had one general remedy: “heat.” Unlike the followers of Benjamin Rush and the American “heroic” medical tradition who advocated blood-letting, leeching, and the substantial use of mineral-based pur- gatives such as antimony and mercury, Thomson believed that miner- als were sources of “cold” because they came from the ground and that vegetation, which grew toward the sun, represented “heat.” As noted in Griggs’s Green Pharmacy (the best history of herbal medicine to date), Thomson’s theory developed as follows2: Instead, he elaborated a theory of his own, of the utmost simplicity: “All diseases … are brought about by a decrease or derangement of the vital fluids by taking cold or the loss of animal warmth … the name of the complaint depends upon what part of the body has become so weak as to be affected. If the lungs, it is consump- tion, or the pleura, pleurisy; if the limbs, it is rheumatism, or the bowels, colic or cholera morbus … all these different diseases may be removed by a restoration of the vital energy, and removing the obstructions which the disease has generated … ” Thus the great object of his treatment was always to raise and restore the body’s vital heat: “All … that medicine can do in the expulsion of disorder, is to kindle up the decaying spark, and restore its energy till it glows in all its wonted vigor.” Thomson’s view was that individuals could be self-treating if they had a sincere “guide to health” philosophy and a copy of his book, New Guide to Health. The right to sell “family franchises” for the use of the Thomsonian method of healing was the basis of a profound lay movement between 1822 and Thomson’s death in 1843. Thomson adamantly believed that no professional medical class should exist and that democratic medicine was best practiced by laypersons within a Thomsonian “family” unit. By 1839, Thomson claimed to have sold some 100,000 of these fam- ily franchises called “friendly botanic societies.” Although he professed to have solely the interests of the individual at heart, his system was sold at a profit under the protection of a patent he obtained in 1813.

## The Eclectic School of Medicine

Some of the “botanics” (professional Thomsonian doctors) wanted to separate themselves from the lay movement by creating requirements and standards for the practice of Thomsonian medicine. Thomson, however, was adamantly against a medical school founded on his views. Thus it was not until the decade after Thomson’s death that indepen- dent Thomsonians founded a medical college (in Cincinnati) and began to dominate the Thomsonian movement. These Thomsonian botanics were later absorbed into the medical sectarian movement known as the “eclectic school,” which originated with the New Yorker Wooster Beach. Beach was another of medical history’s fascinating characters. From a well-established New England family, he started his medical studies at an early age, apprenticing under an old German herbal doctor, Jacob Tidd. After Tidd died, Beach enrolled in the Barclay Street Medical University in New York. Griggs2 described the following: Beach’s burning ambition was to reform medical practice gener- ally—not to alienate the entire profession by savage attacks from without—and he was convinced that he would be in a stronger position to do so if he were himself a diplomatized doctor. The fac- ulty occasionally listened to criticism from within their own num- ber: against onslaughts of “illiterate quacks” like Samuel Thomson, they simply closed ranks in complacent hostility. After opening his own practice in New York, Beach set out to win over fellow members of the New York Medical Society (into which he had been warmly introduced by the screening committee) to his point of view that heroic medicine was inherently dangerous to mankind and should be reduced to the gentler theories of herbal medicine. He was summarily ostracized from the medical society. To Beach, this was a bitter blow, but he soon founded his own school in New York, calling the clinic and educational facility the “United States Infirmary.” However, because of continued pressure from the medical society, he was unable to obtain charter authority to issue legiti- mate diplomas. He then located a financially ailing but legally chartered school, Worthington College, in Ohio. He opened a full-scale medical college; out of its classrooms, he launched what became known as the Eclectic School of Medical Theory. Griggs related the following2: Beach had a new name for his practice: While explaining to a friend his notions of combining what was useful in the old practice with what was best in the new, the friend exclaimed, “You are an eclectic!” to which, according to legend, Beach replied, “You have given me the term which I have wanted: I am an eclectic!” Cincinnati subsequently became the focal point of the eclectic movement, and the E. M. Institute medical school remained until (the last eclectic school to exist in America).3 The concepts of this sect helped form some of the theoretical underpinnings of Lust’s naturop- athy. Lust himself graduated from the Eclectic Medical College of the City of New York in the first decade of the 1900s. Despite his criticism of the early allopathic movement (although the followers of Rush were not yet known as allopaths, a term reputed to have been coined by Samuel Hahnemann) for their “heroic” tenden- cies, Thomson’s medical theories were “heroic” in their own fashion. Although he did not advocate blood-letting, heavy metal poisoning, and leeching, botanic purgatives—particularly Lobelia inflata (Indian tobacco)—were a substantial part of the therapy.

## The Hygienic School of Thought

One other forerunner of American naturopathy, also originating as a lay movement, grew into existence at this time. This was the “hygienic” school, which had its genesis in the popular teachings of Sylvester Graham and William Alcott. Graham began preaching the doctrines of temperance and hygiene in 1830. In 1839 he published Lectures on the Science of Human Life,

## 28SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

two hefty volumes that prescribed healthy dietary habits. He empha- sized a moderate lifestyle, recommending an antiflesh diet and bran bread as an alternative to bolted or white bread. Alcott dominated the scene in Boston during this same period and, together with Graham, saw that the American hygienic movement—at least as a lay doctrine—was well established.4

## Homeopathy

By 1840, the profession of homeopathy had also been transplanted to America from Germany. Homeopathy, the creation of an early German physician, Samuel Hahnemann (1755–1843), had three cen- tral doctrines: • The “law of similars” (that like cures like) • That the effect of a medication could be heightened by its adminis- tration in minute doses (the more diluted the dose, the greater the “dynamic” effect) • That nearly all diseases were the result of a suppressed itch, or “psora” The view was that a patient’s natural symptom-producing disease would be displaced after homeopathic medication by a similar, but much weaker, artificial disease that the body’s immune system could easily overcome. Originally, most homeopaths in this country were converted ortho- dox medical men, or “allopaths.” The high rate of conversion made this particular medical sect the archenemy of the rising orthodox med- ical profession. (For a more detailed discussion of homeopathy, see Chapter 39.) The first homeopathic medical school was founded in 1850 in Cleveland; the last purely homeopathic medical school, based in Philadelphia, survived into the early 1930s.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Rise and Fall of the Sects

Although these two nonallopathic sects were popular, they never com- prised more than one fifth of the professional medical class in America. Homeopathy at its highest point reached roughly 15% and the eclec- tic school roughly 5%. However, their very existence for many years kept the exclusive recognition desired by the orthodox profession from coming within its grasp. Homeopathy was distasteful to the more con- ventional medical men not only because it resulted in the conversion of a substantial number of their peers but also because homeopaths generally also made a better income. The rejection of the eclectic school was more fundamental: it had its roots in a lay movement that challenged the validity of a privileged professional medical class. The existence of three professional medical groups—the ortho- dox school, the homeopaths, and the eclectics—combined with the Jacksonian view of democracy that prevailed in mid-19th-century America, resulted in the repeal of virtually all medical licensing stat- utes existing before 1850. However, by the 1870s and 1880s, all three medical groups began to voice support for the restoration of medical licensing. Views differ as to what caused the homeopathic and eclectic schools to disappear from the medical scene in the 50 years after 1875. One view defined a sect as follows5: A sect consists of a number of physicians, together with their profes- sional institutions, who utilize a distinctive set of medically invalid therapies which are rejected by other sects. By this definition, the orthodox or allopathic school was just as sec- tarian as the homeopathic and eclectic schools. Rothstein’s view was that these two 19th-century sects disappeared because, beginning in the 1870s, the orthodox school grasped the European idea of “scientific medicine.” Based on the research of such men as Pasteur and Koch and the “germ theory,” this approach supposedly proved to be the medically proper view of valid therapy and gained public recognition because of its truth. Another view was that the convergence of the needs of the three sects for professional medical recognition (which began in the 1870s and continued into the early 1900s) and the “progressive era” led to a political alliance in which the majority orthodox school was ultimately dominant by sheer weight of numbers and internal political authority. Starr1 noted the following: Both the homeopaths and eclectics wanted to share in the legal privileges of the profession. Only afterward did they lose their pop- ularity. When homeopathic and eclectic doctors were shunned and denounced by the regular profession, they thrived, but the more they gained an access to the privileges of regular physicians, the more their numbers declined. The turn of the century was both the point of acceptance and the moment of incipient disintegration. In any event, this development was an integral part of the drive toward professional authority and autonomy established during the progressive era (1900–1917). It was acceptable to the homeopaths and the eclectics because they controlled medical schools that continued to teach and maintain their own professional authority and autonomy. However, it was after these professional goals were attained that the lesser schools of medical thought went into rapid decline.

## The American Influence

From 1850 to 1900, the medical counterculture continued to establish itself in America. From its lay roots in the teachings of the hygienic movement grew professional medical recognition, albeit a small minority and “irregular” view, that hygiene and hydropathy were the basis of sound medical thought (much like the Thomsonian transition to botanic and eclectic medicine).

## Russell Trall

The earliest physician who had a significant effect on the later growth of naturopathy as a philosophic movement was Russell Trall, MD. As noted in James Whorton’s Crusaders for Fitness,4 he “passed like a meteor through the American hydropathic and hygienic movement”: The exemplar of the physical educator-hydropath was Russell Thatcher Trall. Still another physician who had lost his faith in reg- ular therapy, Trall opened the second water cure establishment in America, in New York City in 1844. Immediately he combined the full Preissnitzian armamentarium of baths with regulation of diet, air, exercise and sleep. He would eventually open and or direct any number of other hydropathic institutions around the country, as well as edit the Water-Cure Journal, the Hydropathic Review, and a temperance journal. He authored several books, including popu- lar sex manuals which perpetuated Graham-like concepts into the 1890s, sold Graham crackers and physiology texts at his New York office, was a charter member (and officer) of the American Vegetar- ian Society, presided over a short-lived World Health Association, and so on. His crowning accomplishment was the Hygeian Home, a “model Health Institution [which] is beautifully situated on the Delaware River between Trenton and Philadelphia.” A drawing presents it as a palatial establishment with expansive grounds for walking and riding, facilities for rowing, sailing, and swimming, and even a grove for open-air “dancing gymnastics.” It was the grandest of water cures, and lived beyond the Civil War period, which saw the demise of most hydropathic hospitals. True, Trall had to struggle to keep his head above water during the 1860s, but by the 1870s he had a firm financial footing (being stabilized by tuition fees from the attached Hygeio-therapeutic College). With Trall’s death in 1877, however, the hydropathic phase of health reform passed.

## 29CHAPTER 3 The History of Naturopathic Medicine: Origins and Overview

As made evident later in this chapter, this plethora of activity was similar to that engaged in by Benedict Lust between 1896 and his death in 1945, when he worked to establish naturopathy. The Hygeian Home and later “Yungborn” establishments at Butler, New Jersey, and Tangerine, Florida, were similar to European nature cure sanitariums, such as the original Yungborn founded by Adolph Just and the spa/ sanitarium facilities of Preissnitz, Kneipp, and Just. Trall gave a famous address to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, in 1862, under the sponsorship of the Washington Lecture Association. “The true healing art: or hygienic vs drug medi- cation,” a 2.5-hour lecture purported to have received rapt attention, was devoted to Trall’s belief in the hygienic system and in hydropathy as the true healing art. The address was reprinted by Fowler and Wells (New York, 1880) with an introduction written by Trall, before his death in 1877. Trall also founded the first school of natural healing arts in this country to have a 4-year curriculum and the authorization to confer the degree of MD. It was founded in 1852 as a “hydropathic and phys- iological school” and was chartered by the New York State Legislature in 1857 under the name “New York Hygio-Therapeutic College,” with the legislature’s authorization to confer the MD degree. In 1862 Trall went to Europe to attend the International Temperance Convention. He took a prominent part at this meeting of reformers, specifically related to the use of alcohol as a beverage and as a medicine. He eventually published more than 25 books on the subjects of physiology, hydropathy, hygiene, vegetarianism, and tem- perance, among many others. The most valuable and enduring of these was his Hydropathic Encyclopedia, a volume of nearly 1000 pages that covered the theory and practice of hydropathy and the philosophy and treatment of dis- eases advanced by older schools of medicine. At the time of his death, according to the December 1877 Phrenological Journal cover article featuring a lengthy obituary of Trall, this encyclopedia had sold more than 40,000 copies since its original publication in 1851. For more than 15 years, Trall was editor of the Water-Cure Journal (also published by Fowler and Wells). During this period, the journal went through several name changes, including the Hygienic Teacher and The Herald of Health. When Lust originally opened the American School of Naturopathy, an English-language version of Kneipp’s Water-cure (or Meine Wasser-kurr in German) being unavailable, he used only the works and writings of Trall as his texts.

## Martin Luther Holbrook

By 1871, Trall moved from New York to the Hygeian Home on the Delaware River. His water-cure establishment in New York became the New Hygienic Institute. One of its coproprietors was Martin Luther Holbrook, who later replaced Trall as the editor of The Herald of Health. Professor Whorton noted the following4: But Holbrook’s greatest service to the cause was as an editor. In 1866 he replaced Trall at the head of The Herald of Health, which had descended from the Water-Cure Journal and Herald of Reforms (1845–1861) by the way of the Hygienic Teacher and Water-Cure Journal (1862). Under Holbrook’s direction the peri- odical would pass through two more name changes (Journal of Hygiene Herald of Health, 1893–1897, and Omega, 1898–1900) before merging with Physical Culture. Trall and Holbrook both advanced the idea that physicians should teach the maintenance of health rather than simply providing a last resort in times of health crisis. Besides providing a strong editorial voice espousing vegetarianism, the evils of tobacco and drugs, and the value of bathing and exercise, dietetics and nutrition, along with personal hygiene, were strongly advanced by Holbrook and others of the hygienic movement during this era. Whorton described the idea as follows4: The orthodox hygienists of the progressive years were equally enthused by the recent progress of nutrition, of course, and exploited it for their own ends, but their utilization of science hardly stopped with dietetics. Medical bacteriology was another area of remarkable discovery, bacteriologists having provided, in the short space of the last quarter of the 19th century, an understanding, at long last, of the nature of infection. This new science’s implications for hygienic ideology were profound—when Holbrook locked horns with female fashion, for example, he did not attack the bulky, ground-length skirts still in style with the crude Grahamite objection that the skirt was too heavy. Rather he forced a gasp from his readers with an account of watching a smartly dressed lady unwittingly drag her skirt “over some virulent, revolting looking sputum, which some unfortunate consumptive had expectorated.” Holbrook expanded on the work of Graham, Alcott, and Trall and, working with an awareness of the European concepts developed by Preissnitz and Kneipp, laid further groundwork for the concepts later advanced by Lust, Lindlahr, and others4: For disease to result, the latter had to provide a suitable cul- ture medium, had to be susceptible. As yet, most physicians were still so excited at having discovered the causative agents of infec- tion that they were paying less than adequate notice to the host. Radical hygienists, however, were bent just as far in the other direction. They were inclined to see bacteria as merely impo- tent organisms that throve only in individuals whose hygienic carelessness had made their body compost heaps. Tuberculosis is contagious, Holbrook acknowledged, but “the degree of vital resistance is the real element of protection. When there is no preparation of the soil by heredity, predisposition or lowered health standard, the individual is amply guarded against the attack.” A theory favored by many others was that germs were the effect of disease rather than its cause; tissues corrupted by poor hygiene offered microbes, all harmless, an environment in which they could thrive. In addition to introducing the works of Kneipp and his teachings to the American hygienic healthcare movement, Holbrook was a leader of the fight against vivisection and vaccination4: Vivisection and vaccination were but two of the practices of med- icine criticized in the late 19th century. Therapy also continued to be an object of protest. Although the heroism of standard treatment had declined markedly since mid-century, a prescription was still the reward of any visit to the doctor, and drugless alternatives to healing were appearing in protest. Holbrook published frequent favorable commentaries on the revised water cure system of Ger- many’s Kneipp. A combination of baths, herbal teas, and hard- ening exercises, the system had some vogue in the 1890’s before flowering into naturopathy. Holbrook’s journal also gave positive notices to osteopathy and “chiropathy” [chiropractic], commend- ing them for not going to the “drugstore or ransack[ing] creation for remedies nor load[ing] the blood with poison.” But though bathing and musculoskeletal manipulation were natural and non- poisonous, Holbrook preferred to give the body complete responsi- bility for healing itself. Rest and proper diet were the medicines of this doctor who billed himself as a “hygienic physician” and cen- sured ordinary physicians for being engrossed with disease rather than health.

## The Beginnings of “Scientific Medicine”

While the hygienic movement was making its effect, the orthodox medical profession, in alliance with the homeopaths and eclectics, was making significant advances. The orthodox profession, through the political efforts of the American Medical Association (AMA), first tried to remove sectarian and irregular practitioners by segregating them from the medical profession altogether. It did so by formulating and publishing its first national medical code of ethics in 1847. (In the orthodox profession formed the AMA to represent its professional views.) The code condemned proprietary patents (even carrying over into a physician’s development of surgical or other medical implements, which led to its greatest criticism); encouraged the adoption of uniform rules for payment in geographic areas; condemned the practice of con- tract work; prohibited advertising and fee-sharing even among special- ists and general practitioners; eliminated blacks and women; and, most significantly, prohibited any consultation or contact with irregulars or sectarian practitioners. The code stated the following6: No one can be considered as a regular practitioner, or a fit associate in consultation, whose practice is based on an exclusive dogma, to the rejection of the accumulated experience of the profession, and of the aids actually furnished by anatomy, physiology, pathology, and organic chemistry. In the late 1870s and into the 1880s the major sects—the ortho- dox or allopathic school, the homeopaths, and the eclectics—began to find more reason to cooperate to obtain common professional goals. These included the enactment of new licensing laws and the creation of a “respectable” medical educational system. Also at this time, the concept of “scientific medicine” was brought to America. (Although Starr differed from Rothstein regarding the causes of the decline of the homeopathic and eclectic sectarian schools, he noted that Rothstein clearly documented the 19th-century transition of medicine into a rec- ognized professional class composed of both the minority sects and the orthodox school.) This transition from conflict between the major sects resulted in the erosion of the implementation of the code of ethics; the cooperation among the sects to revive medical licensing standards; the admission of sectarian physicians to regular medical societies; and ultimately, a structural reorganization of the AMA, which occurred between and 1903.15 Once the cooperation among the three medical views began, the medical class dominated by the regular school came fully into power. The homeopathic and eclectic schools of thought met their demise finally because of two significant events: (1) the rapid creation of new medical educational standards between 1900 and 1910, culminating in the publication of the famous “Flexner Report” (1910), and (2) the effective infusion of millions of dollars into selected allopathic medi- cal schools by the newly created capitalistic philanthropic foundations, principally the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations.

## The Foundations

The effect of the monies from the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations was clearly documented7 and described in detail in Brown’s Rockefeller Medicine Men.8 The effect of the monies from these foundations, con- tributed to medical schools that met the AMA’s views on medical edu- cation and philosophy, cannot be underestimated. This process has been well documented.1,7,9,10 As discussed by Burrows,10 these educational reforms allowed the AMA to forge a new alliance with state legislators and push quickly for medical licensing designed to reward the educational and medical expertise of the newly orthodox “scientific medicine” and to the exclusion of all others.

## Medical Education in Transition

Based on the rising example of scientific medicine and its necessary connection to research, the educational laboratory, and a more thor- ough scientific education as a preamble to medical practice, Harvard University (under the presidency of Charles Elliott) created a 4-year medical educational program in 1871. The primal modern medical educational curriculum was devised and set in motion more than 20 years later at Johns Hopkins University under the leadership of William Osler and William Welch, using the resources from the origi- nal endowment of the hospital and university from the estate of Johns Hopkins.1 Other schools followed suit. By the time the AMA set up its Council on Medical Education in 1904, it was made up of five members from the faculties of schools modeled on the Johns Hopkins prototype. This committee set out to visit and rate each of the 160 medical schools then in operation in the country. The ratings used were class A (acceptable), class B (doubtful), and class C (unacceptable). Eighty-two schools received a class A rating, led by Harvard, Rush (Chicago), Western Reserve, the University of California, and nota- bly, Johns Hopkins. Forty-six schools received a class B rating, and received a class C rating. The class C schools were mostly in rural areas, and many of them were proprietary in nature.

## Flexner Report

Subsequent to the AMA ratings, the Council on Medical Education applied to the Carnegie Foundation to commission an independent report to verify its work. Abraham Flexner, a young, energetic, and noted educator, was chosen for this task by the Carnegie Foundation and accompanied by the secretary (Nathan Colwell, MD) of the Council on Medical Education, who participated in all of the commit- tee site visits. Flexner visited each of the 162 operating U.S. medical schools. The widely publicized Flexner Report put the nails in the coffins of all schools with class C ratings and many with class B ratings. Significantly, the educational programs of all but one eclectic school (in Cincinnati) and one homeopathic school (in Philadelphia) were eliminated by 1918. The eclectic medical schools, in particular, were severely affected by the report. Griggs explained this effect as follows2: Of the eight Eclectic schools, the Report declared that none had “anything remotely resembling the laboratory equipment which is claimed in their catalogs.” Three of them were under-equipped; the rest “are without exception filthy and almost bare. They have at best grimy little laboratories … a few microscopes, some bot- tles containing discolored and unlabeled pathological material, in an incubator out of commission, and a horrid dissecting room.” The Report found them more culpable than a regular school for these inadequacies: “ … the Eclectics are drug-mad; yet, with the exception of the Cincinnati and New York schools, they are not equipped to teach the drugs or drug therapy which constitutes their sole reason for existence.” The other regular schools that conducted homeopathic or eclectic programs had by that time phased them out in the name of “scientific medicine” (see also Haller3).

## Pharmaceutical Industry

During this same time, the AMA, through several of its efforts, began a significant alliance with the organized pharmaceutical industry of the United States, shaping it in a manner acceptable to the allopathic profession.1,9,11

## The New “Sects”

The period from 1890 to 1905 saw the rise of three new medical sects and several other smaller “irregular” schools that replaced those soon to pass from the scene. In Missouri, Andrew Taylor Still, originally trained as an orthodox practitioner, founded the school of medical thought known as “osteopathy” and in 1892 opened the American School of Osteopathy in Kirksville, Missouri. In 1895 Daniel David Palmer, originally a magnetic healer from Davenport, Iowa, performed the first spinal manipulation, which gave rise to the school he termed “chiropractic.” He formally published his findings in 1910, after hav- ing founded a chiropractic school in Davenport, Iowa. In 1902 Lust founded the American School of Naturopathy in New York. Although some of the following discussions are devoted to the schools of healing called osteopathy and chiropractic, only that portion of their histories related to the history of naturopathy is mentioned.12 (A full study of osteopathic medicine in America may be found in The D.O.’s by Gevitz,13 and a reasonable sketch of chiropractic medicine may be found in Kapling’s chapter in Alternative Medicine.12) As noted by Starr,1 these new sects, including Christian Science, formulated by Mary Baker Eddy,14 either rose or fell on their own without ever completely allying with orthodox medicine. Starr theo- rized that these sects arose late enough that the orthodox profession and its political action arm, the AMA, had no need to ally with them and would rather battle with them publicly. This made these sectarian views separate and distinct from the homeopathic and eclectic schools.

# THE FOUNDING OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE

<!-- chunk -->

## Benedict Lust

Lust came to the United States in 1892 at the age of 23. He suffered from a debilitating condition in his late teens while growing up in Michelbach, Baden, Germany, and was sent by his father to undergo the Kneipp cure at Woerishofen. He stayed there from mid-1890 to early 1892; not only was he “cured” of his condition, but he also became a protégé of Kneipp. Dispatched by Kneipp to bring the principles of the Kneipp water cure to America, he emigrated to New York City. By making contact in New York with other German Americans who were also becoming aware of the Kneipp principles, Lust participated in the founding of the first “Kneipp Society,” which was organized in Jersey City, New Jersey, in October 1896. Lust also attended the first organizational meeting (in mid-October 1896) of the Kneipp Society of Brooklyn. Subsequently, through Lust’s organization and contacts, Kneipp Societies were founded in Boston; Chicago; Cleveland; Denver; Cincinnati; Philadelphia; Columbus; Buffalo and Rochester, New York; New Haven, Connecticut; San Francisco; New Mexico; and Mineola on Long Island, New York. The members of these organizations were provided with copies of the Kneipp Blatter and a companion English publication Lust began to put out called The Kneipp Water Cure Monthly. The first “sanatorium” using Kneipp’s principles was organized in this country shortly before Lust’s arrival. Charles Lauterwasser, an ear- lier student of Kneipp’s who called himself a hydrothic physician and natural scientist, opened the Kneipp and Nature Cure Sanatorium in Newark, New Jersey, in 1891. In 1895 the Brooklyn Light and Water-Cure Institute was estab- lished in Brooklyn, New York, by L. Staden and his wife Carola, both graduates of Lindlahr’s Hygienic College in Dresden, Germany. According to their advertising, they specialized in natural healing, Kneipp water treatment, and Kuhne’s and Preissnitz’s principles (including diet cure, electric light baths [both white and blue], elec- tric vibration massage, Swedish massage and movements, and Thure Brandt massage). In 1895 Lust opened the Kneipp Water-Cure Institute in New York City, listing himself as the owner and Dr. William Steffens as the residing physician. At the same address (on 59th Street) in October of that year, Lust opened the first “Kneipp store.” In the originating November 1896 edition of The Kneipp Water Cure Monthly and Kneipp Blatter, he advertised his store and sanitarium as personally authorized by Kneipp. In the first part of 1896, just before his organizing of var- ious Kneipp Societies around the New York area, Lust returned to Woerishofen to study further with Kneipp. Kneipp died in Germany, at Woerishofen, in June 1897. With his passing, Lust was no longer bound strictly to the principles of the Kneipp water cure. He had begun to associate earlier with other German American physicians, principally Dr. Hugo R. Wendel (a German-trained Naturarzt), who began, in 1897, to practice in New York and New Jersey as a licensed osteopathic physician. In 1896 Lust entered the Universal Osteopathic College of New York, graduated in 1898, and became licensed as an osteopathic physician. In 1897 Lust became an American citizen. Once he was licensed to practice as a healthcare physician in his own right, Lust began the transition toward the concept of “naturop- athy.” Between 1898 and 1902, when he adopted the term naturopath, Lust acquired a chiropractic education and changed the name of his Kneipp store to the Health Food Store (the original facility to use that name and concept in this country), specializing in providing organic foods and the materials necessary for drugless cures. He also began the New York School of Massage (listed as established in 1896) and the American School of Chiropractic, all within the same facility—Lust’s Kneipp Institute. Photographs of this facility taken between 1902 and 1907, when the facility moved to another location, show a five-story building listing “Benedict Lust—Naturopath, Publisher, Importer.” He returned to Germany in 1907 to visit with Dr. Baumgarten, Kneipp’s medical successor at the Woerishofen facility, which was then run, in cooperation with Baumgarten, by the Reverend Prior Reily, the former secretary to Kneipp and his lay successor at Woerishofen. As directed by Kneipp, Reily had completed, after Kneipp’s death, Kneipp’s masterwork Das grosse Kneipp—Buch. Lust maintained con- tact with the partnership of Reily and Baumgarten throughout the early part of the 20th century. In 1902 when he purchased and began using the term naturopa- thy and calling himself a “naturopath,” Lust, in addition to his New York School of Massage and American School of Chiropractic, his var- ious publications, and his operation of the Health Food Store, began to operate the American School of Naturopathy, all at the same 59th Street New York address. By 1907 Lust’s enterprises had grown sufficiently large that he moved them to a 55-room building. It housed the Naturopathic Institute, Clinic, and Hospital; the American Schools of Naturopathy and Chiropractic; the now-entitled Original Health Food Store; Lust’s publishing enterprises; and the New York School of Massage. The operation remained in this four-story building, roughly twice the size of the original facility, from 1907 to 1915. From 1912 to 1914, Lust took a “sabbatical” from his operations to further his medical education. By this time, he had founded his large estate-like sanitarium in Butler, New Jersey, known as “Yungborn” after the German sanitarium operation of Adolph Just. In 1912 he attended the Homeopathic Medical College in New York, which, in 1913, granted him a degree in homeopathic medicine, and in 1914, he received his degree in eclectic medicine. In early Lust traveled to Florida and obtained an MD’s license on the basis of his graduation from the Homeopathic Medical College and the Eclectic Medical College of New York City.

## 32SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

He founded another “Yungborn” sanitarium facility in Tangerine, Florida, and for the rest of his life, while continuing his publications, he engaged in active public lecturing. He also continued to maintain a practice in New York City and operated the sanitariums in Florida and New Jersey. His schools were operated primarily by Hugo R. Wendel. From 1902, when he began to use the term naturopathy, until 1918, Lust replaced the Kneipp Societies with the Naturopathic Society of America. Then, in December 1919, the Naturopathic Society of America was formally dissolved because of its insolvency, and Lust founded the American Naturopathic Association (ANA). Thereafter, 18 states incorporated the association. In 1918, as part of his effort to replace the Naturopathic Society of America (an operation into which he invested a great deal of his funds and resources in an attempt to organize a naturopathic profession) and replace it with the ANA, Lust published the first Universal Naturopathic Directory and Buyer’s Guide (a “yearbook of drugless therapy”). Although a completely new version was never actually pub- lished, despite Lust’s announced intention to make this volume an annual publication, annual supplements were published in either The Naturopath and Herald of Health or its companion publication Nature’s Path (which commenced publication in 1925). The Naturopath and Herald of Health, sometimes printed with the two phrases reversed, was published from 1902 to 1927 and from 1934 until after Lust’s death in 1945. This volume documented the merging of the German and American influences that guided Lust in his development of the prac- tice of naturopathy. The voluminous tome, which ran to 1416 pages, was dedicated to: The memory of all those noble pioneers and discoverers who have died in the faith of Naturopathy, and to their courageous successors in the art of drugless healing, all of whom have suffered persecu- tion for saving human lives that medical autocracy could not save, this work is respectfully dedicated by its editor Benedict Lust, N.D., M.D., “The Yungborn,” Butler, New Jersey, U.S.A., April 1, 1918. Lust’s introduction is reprinted here in its entirety to show the pur- pose of the directory and the status of the profession in the early 1900s:

## Introduction

To the Naturopathic Profession, the Professors of Natural Healing in all its branches, the Professors of Scientific Diet, Hydrotherapy, Heliotherapy, Electrotherapy, Neuropathy, Osteopathy, Chiroprac- tic, Naprapathy, Magnetopathy, Phytotherapy, Exercise, Swedish Movements, Curative Gymnastics, Physical and Mental Culture, Balneopathy, and all forms of Drugless Healing, the Faculties of all Drugless Colleges, Institutions, Schools, and all Professors of Hygiene and Sanitation; Manufacturers of Naturopathic Supplies; Publishers of Health Literature, and Natural Healing Societies, GREETINGS: I have the honor to present to your consideration and goodwill, this Volume, No. 1, Year 1918–1919, of the Universal Naturopathic Directory, Year Book of Drugless Healing, and Buyers’ Guide. For twenty-two years past, the need of a directory for Drug- less Therapy has been felt. The medical world is in a condition of intense evolution at the present time. It is evolving from the Drug- ging School of Therapy to the Drugless School. People by the mil- lion have lost confidence in the virtues of Allopathy and are turning with joyful confidence to the Professions of Natural Healing until it has been estimated that there are at least forty thousand prac- titioners of Naturopathic healing in the United States.The motto that IN UNITY THERE IS STRENGTH is the foundation of the present enterprise. Hitherto, the drugless profession has lacked that prestige in the eyes of the public, which comes from the continuous existence of a big institution, duly organized and wielding the immense authority which is derived no less from organization and history than from the virtues of the principles that are held and practiced by such institu- tions. The public at large instantaneously respects an institution that is thoroughly organized and has its root earthed in history. The time has fully arrived when the drugless profession should no longer exist in the form of isolated units, not knowing one another and caring but little for such knowledge. Our profession has been, as it were, as sheep without a shepherd, but the various individuals that constitute this movement so pregnant with bene- fits to humanity, are now collected for the first time into a Directory and Year-Book of Drugless Healing, which alone will give immense weight and dignity to the standing of the individuals mentioned therein.Not only will the book add to the prestige of the practitioner in the eyes of his patients, but when the scattered members of our profession in every State desire to obtain legislative action on behalf of their profession and themselves, the appeal of such a work as our directory will, in the eyes of legislators, gain for them a much more respectful hearing than could otherwise be obtained. Now, for the first time, the drugless practitioner finds himself one of a vast army of professional men and women who are employing the most healthful forces of nature to rejuvenate and regenerate the world. But the book itself throws a powerful light upon every phase of drugless healing and annihilates time and distance in investigating WHO IS WHO in the realm of Drugless Therapy. A most sincere effort has been made to obtain the name and address of every adherent of the Rational School of Medicine who practices his profession within the United States, Canada and the British Isles. It is impossible at this stage of Naturopathic history, which is still largely in the making, to obtain the name and address of every such practitioner. There were some who, even when appealed to, refused to respond to our invitation, not understanding the object of our work. Many of even the most intelligent members have refused to advertise their professional cards in our pages. But we can only attribute these drawbacks to the fact that every new institution that has suddenly dawned upon human intelligence will find that a certain proportion of people who do not understand the nature of the enterprise because the brain cells that would appreciate the benefits that are sought to be conferred upon them, are undeveloped, but a goodly proportion of our Naturopaths have gladly responded to the invitation to advertise their specialty in our columns. These, of course, constitute the brightest and most successful of our practi- tioners and their examples in this respect should be followed by every practitioner whose card does not appear in this book.We take it for granted that every one of the forty thousand practitioners of Natu- ropathy is in favor of the enterprise represented by this Directory. This work is a tool of his trade and not to possess this book is a serious handicap in the race for success. Here will be found an Index of by far the larger number of Naturopaths in the country arranged in Alphabetic, Geographic and Naturopathic sections. Besides this, there is a classified Buyers’ Guide that gives immediate information regarding where you can find special supplies, or a certain apparatus, or a certain book or magazine, its name, and where it is published. The list of Institu- tions with the curriculum of each will be found exceedingly useful. Natural healing, that has drifted so long, and, by reason of a lack of organization, has been made for so many years the football of official medicine, to be kicked by any one who thought fit to do so, has now arrived at such a pitch of power that it has shaken the old system of bureaucratic medicine to its foundations.

professors of the irrational theories of life, health and disease, that are looking for victims to be inoculated with dangerous drugs and animalized vaccines and serums, have begun to fear the growth of this young giant of medical healing that demands medical freedom, social justice and equal rights for the new healing system that exists alone for the betterment and uplifting of humanity. I want every Professor of Drugless Therapy to become my friend and co-worker in the great cause to which we are committed, and those whose names are not recorded in this book should send them to me with- out delay. It will be of far greater interest and value to themselves to have their professional card included amongst those who advertise with us than the few dollars that such advertisement costs. It will be noted that there are quite a number of Drugless Heal- ers belonging to foreign countries (particularly those of the Western Hemisphere) represented in this Directory. The profession of med- icine is not confined to any race, country, clime or religion. It is a universal profession and demands universal recognition. It will be a great honor to the Directory, as well as to the Naturopathic pro- fession at large to have every Naturopathic practitioner, from the Arctic Circle to the furthest limits of Patagonia, represented in the pages of this immense and most helpful work. I expect that the Directory for the year 1920 will be larger and even more important than the present Directory and that it will contain the names of thousands of practitioners that are not included in the present work. The publication of this Directory will aid in abolishing what- ever evils of sectarianism, narrow-mindedness and lack of loyalty to the cause to which we are devoted, that may exist. That it will promote a fraternal spirit among all exponents of natural heal- ing, and create an increase of their prestige and power to resist the encroachments of official medicine on their constitutional rights of liberty and the pursuit of happiness, by favorably influencing Legislators, Law courts, City Councils and Boards of Health every- where, is the sincere belief of the editor and publisher. Having introduced the volume, Lust leads off with his article enti- tled “The principles, aim, and program of the nature cure system.” Again, this relatively brief article is reproduced here in its entirety so that one can see the merging of influences:

## The Principles, Aim, and Program of the Nature Cure

<!-- chunk -->

## System

Since the earliest ages, Medical Science has been of all sciences the most unscientific. Its professors, with few exceptions, have sought to cure disease by the magic of pills and potions and poisons that attacked the ailment with the idea of suppressing the symptoms instead of attacking the real cause of the ailment. Medical science has always believed in the superstition that the use of chemical substances which are harmful and destructive to human life will prove an efficient substitute for the violation of laws, and in this way encourages the belief that a man may go the limit in self indulgences that weaken and destroy his physical system, and then hope to be absolved from his physical ailments by swallowing a few pills, or submitting to an injection of a serum or vaccine, that are supposed to act as vicarious redeemers of the phys- ical organism and counteract life-long practices that are poisonous and wholly destructive to the patient’s well-being. From the earliest ages to the present time, the priests of medicine have discovered that it is ten times easier to obtain ten dollars from a man by acting upon his superstition, than it is to extract one dol- lar from him, by appealing to reason and common sense. Having this key to a gold mine within their grasp, we find official medicine indulging at all times in the most blatant, outrageous, freakish and unscientific methods of curing disease, because the methods were in harmony with the medical prestige of the physician. Away back in pre-historic times, disease was regarded as a demon to be exorcized from its victim, and the medicine man of his tribe belabored the body of his patient with a bag in which rattled bones and feathers, and no doubt in extreme cases the tremendous faith in this process of cure that was engendered in the mind of the patient really cured some ailments for which mental science and not the bag of bones and feathers should be given credit. Coming down to the middle ages, the Witches’ Broth—one ingredient of which was the blood of a child murderer drawn in the dark of the moon—was sworn to, by official medicine, as a remedy for every disease. In a later period, the “docteur a la mode,” between his taking pinches of snuff from a gold snuff box, would order the patient bled as a remedy for what he denominated spirits, vapors, megrims, or miasms. Following this pseudo-scientific diagnosis and method of cure, came the drugging phase in which symptoms of disease were unmercifully attacked by all kinds of drugs, alkalis, acids and poi- sons which were supposed, that by suffocating the symptoms of dis- ease, by smothering their destructive energy, to thus enhance the vitality of the individual. All these cures have had their inception, their period of extensive application, and their certain desuetude. The contemporary fashion of healing disease is that of serums, inoculations and vaccines, which, instead of being an improvement on the fake medicines of former ages are of no value in the cure of disease, but on the contrary introduce lesions into the human body of the most distressing and deadly import. The policy of expediency is at the basis of medical drug heal- ing. It is along the lines of self-indulgence, indifference, ignorance and lack of self-control that drug medicine lives, moves and has its being. The sleeping swineries of mankind are wholly exploited by a system of medical treatment, founded on poisonous and revolting products, whose chemical composition and whose mode of attack- ing disease, are equally unknown to their originators, and this is called “Scientific medicine.” Like the alchemist of old who circulated the false belief that he could transmute the baser metals into gold, in like manner the vivi- sector claims that he can coin the agony of animals into cures for human disease. He insists on cursing animals that he may bless mankind with such curses. To understand how revolting these products are, let us just refer to the vaccine matter which is supposed to be an efficient preven- tive of smallpox. Who would be fool enough to swallow the putrid pus and corruption scraped from the foulest sores of smallpox that has been implanted in the body of a calf? Even if any one would be fool enough to drink so atrocious a substance, its danger might be neutralized by the digestive juices of the intestinal tract. But it is a far greater danger to the organism when inoculated into the blood and tissues direct, where no digestive substances can possibly neutralize its poison.The natural system for curing disease is based on a return to nature in regulating the diet, breathing, exercising, bathing and the employment of various forces to eliminate the poisonous products in the system, and so raise the vitality of the patient to a proper standard of health. Official medicine has in all ages simply attacked the symptoms of disease without paying any attention to the causes thereof, but natural healing is concerned far more with removing the causes of disease, than merely curing its symptoms. This is the glory of this new school of medicine that it cures by removing the causes of the ailment, and is the only rational method of practicing medicine.

## 34SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

It begins its cures by avoiding the uses of drugs and hence is styled the system of drugless healing. It came first into vogue in Germany and its most famous exponents in that country were Priessnitz, Schroth, Kuhne, Kneipp, Rickli, Lahmann, Just, Ehret, Engelhardt, and others. In Sweden, Ling and others developed various systems of mech- ano-therapy and curative gymnastics. In America, Palmer invented Chiropractic; McCormick, Oph- thalmology. Still originated Osteopathy; Weltmer, suggestive Therapeutics. Lindlahr combined the essentials of various natural methods, while Kellogg, Tilden, Schultz, Trall, Lust, Lahn, Arnold, Struch, Havard, Davis, Jackson, Walters, Deininger, Tyrell, Col- lins and others, have each of them spent a lifetime in studying and putting into practice the best ideas of drugless healing and have greatly enlarged and enriched the new school of medicine.

## Life Maltreated by Allopathy

The prime object of natural healing is to give the principle of life the line of least resistance, that it may enable man to possess the most abundant health.

<!-- chunk -->

## What Is Life?

The finite mind of man fails to comprehend the nature of this mys- terious principle. The philosopher says “Life is the sum of the forces that resist death,” but that definition only increases its obscurity. Life is a most precious endowment of protoplasm, of the various combinations of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen, and other purely mineral substances in forming organic tissues. As Othello says, referring to Desdemona’s life, which he compares to the light of a candle— “If I quench thee thou flaming minister, I can thy former light restore Should I repent me; but once put out THY light, I know not whence is that Promethean heat That can thy light relume.” The spark of life flickers in the sockets of millions and is about to go out. What system of medicine will most surely restore that flickering spark to a steady, burning flame? Will [it be] the system that employs poisonous vaccines, serums and inoculations, whose medical value has to be supported by the most mendacious statements, and whose practitioners are far more intent on their emoluments and fame, than they are in the practice of humanity? The Allopathic system, which includes nine tenths of all medical practitioners, is known by its fruits, but it is an appalling fact that infant mortality, insanity, heart disease, arteriosclerosis, cancer, debil- ity, impoverished constitutions, degeneracy, idiocy and inefficiency have enormously increased, particularly during the last twenty-five years, that is, during the regime of inoculations, serums and vaccines. Naturopathy, on the other hand, so far as it has been developed, and so far as official medicine will allow it to act, leaves no such trail of disease, disaster and death behind it. Natural healing is emancipation from medical superstition, ignorance and tyranny. It is the true Elixir of Life. The Allopaths have endeavored to cure sick humanity on the basis of the highly erroneous idea that man can change the laws of nature that govern our being, and cure the cause of disease by simply ignoring it. To cure disease by poisoning its symptoms is medical manslaughter. Dr. Schwenninger of Germany says: “We are suffering under the curse of the past mistakes of our profession. For thousands of years medical doctors have been educating the public into the false belief that poisonous drugs can give health. This belief has become in the public mind such a deep-seated superstition, that those of us who know better and who would like to adopt more sensible, natural methods of cure, can do so only at the peril of losing practice and reputation. “The average medical man is at his best but a devoted bigot to this vain school-craft, which we call the Medical Art and which alone in this age of science has made no perceptible progress since the days of its earliest teachers. They call it recognized science! Rec- ognized ignorance! The science of to-day is the ignorance of to-mor- row. Every year some bold guess lights up as truth to which but the year before the schoolmen of science were as blind as moles.” And Dr. O.W. Holmes, Professor of Anatomy in Harvard Uni- versity, states: “The disgrace of medicine has been that colossal system of self-deception, in obedience to which mines have been emptied of their cankering minerals, entrails of animals taxed for their impurities, the poison bags of reptiles drained of their venom, and all the inconceivable abominations thus obtained thrust down the throats of human beings, suffering from some fault of organi- zation, nourishment, or vital stimulation.” And these misguided drug doctors are not only not ashamed of their work, but they have induced subservient legislators to pass laws that perpetuate the age-long scandal of allopathic importance, and the degenerative influence of the poisons, and to actually make it a crime on the part of nature doctors to cure a man of his ailment. The brazen effrontery of these medical despots has no limits. They boast of making the State legislators their catspaw in arresting, fining and imprisoning the professors of natural healing for saving human life. Legislators have no right to sit in judgment over the claims of rival schools of healing. They see tens of thousands of sick people go down to their graves by being denied the cures that the employers of nature’s forces alone can give them. It is their business to provide for the various schools of medicine a fair field and no favor. A citizen has an inalienable right to liberty in the pursuit of hap- piness. Yet the real saviors of mankind are persecuted by the medical oligarchy which is responsible for compulsory vaccination, compul- sory medical inspection of public school children, and the demands for State and Federal departments of health, all for the ostensible good of the people, but in reality for the gain of the Medical Trust.

## The Naturopaths

The Naturopaths are desirous of freedom for all schools of medi- cine. They are responsible practitioners who are willing to be exam- ined by an impartial council, appointed by and acting for the State, who will testify to the life and character of every drugless physician before he is entitled to practice medicine. Not one invidious dis- crimination should be made between the different schools of med- icine. The state should see to it that each school should have a full opportunity to do its best for the up-lifting of its citizens.

ELIMINATION OF EVIL HABITS, or the weeds of life, such as over- eating, alcoholic drinks, drugs, the use of tea, coffee and cocoa that contain poisons, meat eating, improper hours of living, waste of vital forces, lowered vitality, sexual and social aberrations, worry, etc. 2. CORRECTIVE HABITS. Correct breathing, correct exercise, right mental attitude. Moderation in the pursuit of health and wealth. 3. NEW PRINCIPLES OF LIVING. Proper fasting, selection of food, hydropathy, light and air baths, mud baths, osteopathy, chiroprac- tic and other forms of mechano-therapy, mineral salts obtained in organic form, electropathy, heliopathy, steam or Turkish baths, sitz baths, etc.

## 35CHAPTER 3 The History of Naturopathic Medicine: Origins and Overview

Natural healing is the most desirable factor in the regeneration of the race. It is a return to nature in methods of living and treatment. It makes use of the elementary forces of nature, of chemical selection of foods that will constitute a correct medical dietary. The diet of civilized man is devitalized, is poor in essential organic salts. The fact that foods are cooked in so many ways and are salted, spiced, sweet- ened and otherwise made attractive to the palate, induces people to over-eat, and over eating does more harm than under feeding. High protein food and lazy habits are the cause of cancer, Bright’s disease, rheumatism and the poisons of auto-intoxication. There is really but one healing force in existence and that is Nature herself, which means the inherent restorative power of the organism to overcome disease. Now the question is, can this power be appropriated and guided more readily by extrinsic or intrinsic methods? That is to say, is it more amenable to combat disease by irritating drugs, vaccines and serums employed by superstitious moderns, or by the bland intrinsic congenial forces of Natural Therapeutics, that are employed by this new school of medicine, that is Naturopathy, which is the only orthodox school of medicine? Are not these natural forces much more orthodox than the artificial resources of the druggist? The practical application of these natural agencies, duly suited to the individual case, are true signs that the art of healing has been elaborated by the aid of absolutely harmless, congenial treatments, under whose ministration the death rate is but five per cent of persons treated as compared with fifty per cent under the present allopathic methods.

## The Germanic Influence

The philosophic origins of naturopathy were Germanic. The most sig- nificant influences, except those of Russell Trall, the osteopathic con- cepts of A.T. Still (at this time, strictly the correction of spinal lesions by adjustment), and the chiropractic principles of D. D. Palmer, were originally Germanic. (This was well established in the January editorial in Water Cure Monthly.) The specific influences on which Lust drew for his work, in order of their chronologic contributions to the system of naturopathy, are the following: 1. Vincent Preissnitz (1799–1851) 2. Johann Schroth (1798–1856) 3. Father Sebastian Kneipp (1821–1897) 4. Arnold Rickli (1823–1926) 5. Louis Kuhne (c. 1823–1907) 6. Henry Lahman (no dates known) 7. F. E. Bilz (1823–1903) 8. Adolph Just (1859–1939). Also of note were Theodor Hahn and T. Meltzer, who, in the 1860s, were well known for their work in the movement called, in German, Naturatz or “naturism.” In photographs accompanying his article “The principles, aim and program of the nature cure system,” Lust described each of these thinkers as follows: 1. VINCENT PREISSNITZ, of Graefenberg, Silesia. Founder of Hydropathy. Born October 4, 1799. A pioneer Naturopath, prose- cuted by the medical authorities of his day, and convicted of using witchcraft, because he cured his patients by the use of water, air, diet and exercise. He took his patients back to Nature—to the woods, the streams, the open fieldstreated them with Nature’s own forces and fed them on natural foods. His fame spread over the whole of Europe, and even to America. His cured patients were numbered by the thousands. The Preissnitz compress or bandage is in the medical literature. Preissnitz is no more, but his spirit lives in every true Naturopath. 2. JOHANN SCHROTH, a layperson, not described in Lust’s directory but often talked of in later works and prominently mentioned for his curative theories in Bilz’s master work, The Natural Method of Healing. Schroth smashed his right knee in an accident with a horse and it remained stiff in spite of repeated medical treatment. At last, a priest told Schroth that Preissnitz’s methods might help, and Schroth decided to give them a try. In order to avoid frequent changing of the packs that were directed by Preissnitz, he placed several packs on top of one another, wrapping the whole portion with a woolen cloth. He left this pack on the injured knee for several hours and produced a moist heat which he theorized to cause the poisonous toxins to dissolve and be swept away. These packs are still used as part of the “Schroth cure” and have reportedly become famous for their blood-cleans- ing effect. (From an article in the March 1937 Naturopath and Herald of Health by Dr. T.M. Schippel.) As noted by Bilz, the Schroth cure, called by Bilz “the regenerative treatment,” was developed for treatment of chronic diseases through the use of an extreme diet following total fasting by withdrawing of all food and drink and then the use of totally dry grain products and the eventual reintroduction of fluids. 3. FATHER SEBASTIAN KNEIPP, of course, is much described and the photos include one of Kneipp lecturing to the multitudes at Wandelhale at Woerishofen, attending Pope Leo XIII in 1893, not- ing this is the only consultation on health care matters that Kneipp ever consented to outside of Woerishofen, though many famous and aristocratic individuals desired his counsel, and a picture of Kneipp with the Archdukes Joseph and Francis Ferdinand of Austria walk- ing barefoot in new-fallen snow for purposes of hardening the con- stitution. It was noted that the older Archduke was cured by Kneipp of Bright’s disease in 1892, and it noted that the Archduke Joseph, in appreciation of this cure, donated a public park in the town of Woerishofenat a cost of $150,000 florens. The Archduke Francis Fer- dinand, the son of Archduke Joseph, was the individual whose mur- der precipitated World War I. There is a further picture of Kneipp surrounded consultation to numerous patients. 4. ARNOLD RICKLI, founder of the light and light and aircures (atmospheric cure). Dr. Rickli was one of the foremost exponents of natural living and healing. In 1848, he established at Veldes, Krain, Austria, the first institution of light and air cure or as it was called in Europe the “atmospheric cure.” In a limited way (rather very late) his ideas have been adopted by the medical profession in America for the cure of consumption. He was an ardent disciple of the vegetarian diet and exemplified the principles of natural living in his own life. The enclosed photo shows him at the age of 97, when he was still active and healthy. He has since passed on, but his work still lives as a testimonial of his untiring efforts. He was the founder and for over 50 years the President of the National Austrian Vegetarian Association. 5. LOUIS KUHNE wrote, in 1891, The New Science of Healing, the greatest work of basic principles in natural healing. In the tradition of Natural Healing and prevention, Kuhne has been described as one who “ … advocated sun, steam baths, a vegetarian diet, and whole-wheat bread … in these relatively early days.” His renowned work constitutes the only true scientific philosophy for the applica- tion of all Drugless Methods. He was the first to give to the world the comprehensible idea of pathology and the first to proclaim the doctrine of the “unity of cure.” His book Facial Expression gives the means of diagnosing a patient’s pathological condition and deter- mining the amount and location of the systemic encumbrance. He is the founder and first Master of Naturopathy.

## 36SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

6. DR. H. LAHMAN. When the University of Leipzig expelled H. Lahman for his spreading medical sedition among the students, it added a staunch advocate to natural healing. Dr. Lahman finished his medical education in Switzerland and returned to Germany to refute in practice the false ideas of medical science. He later founded the largest Nature Cure institution in the world at Weisser Hirsch, near Dresden, Saxony. He was a strong believer in the “Light and Air” cure and constructed the first appliances for the administration of electric light treatment and baths. He was the author of several books on Diet, Nature Cure and Heliotherapy. As noted in Other Healers, Other Cures: “Heinrich Lahmann came along to stress no salt on foods and no water with meals … ” His works on diet are authoritative and his “nutritive salts theory” forms the basis of rational dietetic treatment. This work has but recently come to light in America, and progressive dietitians are forsaking their old, worn- out, high protein, chemical and caloric theories for the “organic salts theory.” Carque, Lindlahr, McCann, and other wide awake food sci- entists have adopted it as a basis for their work. Dr. Lahman was a medical nihilist. He denounced medicine as unscientific and entirely experimental in its practice and lived to prove the saneness of his ideas as evidenced by his thousands of cured patients. 7. PROFESSOR F.E. BILZ. That real physicians are born, not made, is well illustrated in the case of Dr. Bilz, who achieved his first suc- cess in healing as a lay practitioner. As a mark of gratitude, a wealthy patient presented him with land and a castle in which to found a Nature Cure anitarium. … The Bilz institution at Dresden-Rdebeul, Germany, became world renowned and was long considered the center of the Nature Cure movement. Professor Bilz is the author of the first Naturopathic encyclopedia, The Natural Method of Healing, which has been translated into a dozen languages, and in German alone has run into 150 editions. He has written many works on Nature Cure and Natural Life, among them being The Future State, in which he pre- dicted the present World War, and advocated a federation of nations as the only logical solution of international problems. 8. ADOLPH JUST, famous author of Return to Nature and founder of original “Yungborn” in Germany. Both Adolph Just’s Return to Nature and Louis Kuhne’s The Natural Science of Healing were translated into English by Lust and released through his publication house.

## The Convergence With American Influences

The Universal Naturopathic Directory was truly eclectic in its compila- tion and composition. Besides the Lust articles, the volume included “How I became acquainted with nature cure” by Henry Lindlahr, MD, ND (which was reproduced in large part in the introduction to volume 1 of Lindlahr15); “The nature cure” by Carl Strueh, MD, ND; “Naturopathy” by Harry E. Brook, ND; “The present position of natu- ropathy and allied therapeutic measures in the British Isles” by Allen Pattreiouex, ND; “Why all drugless methods?” by Per Nelson; and “Efficiency in drugless healing” by Edward Earle Purinton (a reprint of the 1917 publication, referred to earlier, which was composed of a series of articles published in The Herald of Health and Naturopath between August 1914 and February 1916). The volume also contained Louis Kuhne’s “Neo-naturopathy (the new science of healing),” in the first publication of the translation by Lust, and articles on electrotherapy, neuropathy, dietology, chiroprac- tic, mechanotherapy, osteopathy, phytotherapy, apyrtropher, physical culture, optometry, hydrotherapy, orthopedics, pathology, natural healing and living, astroscopy, phrenology, and physiology—all of which were specially commissioned for the directory from practi- tioners and authors considered expert in these subjects. Also included was a national directory of drugless physicians in alphabetical order, geographically arranged and itemized by profes- sion; biographic notes on American contributors of note; the naturo- pathic book catalog; a guide to natural healing and natural life books and periodicals; a classified list of medical works; a series of book reviews; a buyer’s guide for naturopathic supplies; and, in addition to extensive indexes, a “parting word” by Lust. The volume contained numerous advertisements for naturopathic schools, sanitariums, and individual practices, and it closed with the following note: This, then, completes Volume 1 of the Naturopathic Directory, Drugless Yearbook and Buyer’s Guide for the years 1918 and 1919. Into it, has been placed the conscientious labor of many willing hearts, hands and minds. It is their contribution to the noble cause of natural healing. It will stand as a monument to their endeavors, as well as a memorial to the great souls, the fathers of natural heal- ing, who have passed on. Let this, then, herald a new era—the era wherein man shall recognize the omniscience of Nature, and shall profit through con- forming to her laws. In the biographic sections, it is apparent that Lust owed a great deal of the feeling of camaraderie in the nature cure movement to some varied American practitioners. The most prominent of these had their biographic sections contained in the 1918 directory. Two of them deserve specific note and attention: Palmer and Still. Lust met A. T. Still in 1915 in Kirksville, Missouri, shortly before Still’s death. From their meetings, Lust noted later in the Naturopath and Herald of Health (June 1937) that Still believed that osteopathy by “compromising with medicine is doomed as the school that could have incorporated all the natural and biological healing arts.” Lust wanted naturopathy to fill this void. Lust also had a lengthy acquaintance with B. J. Palmer (the son of D. D. Palmer, the founder of chiropractic), who, following in his father’s footsteps, put Davenport, Iowa, and the Palmer Chiropractic College on the map. Lust also became connected with Henry Lindlahr, MD, ND, of Chicago (as noted in the autobiographical sketch contained in the directory16 and reprinted in volume 1 of Lindlahr15). Lindlahr was a rising businessman in Chicago with all the bad habits of the “gay nineties” era. In his 30s, he became chronically ill. He had gone to the orthodox practitioners of his day and received no relief. Then he was exposed to Schroth’s works, and in following them began to feel somewhat better. Subsequently, he liquidated all his assets and went to a German sanitarium to be cured and to learn nature cure. He returned to Chicago and enrolled in the Homeopathic/Eclectic College of Illinois. In 1903 he opened a sanitarium, which included a residential sanitarium, located in Elmhurst, Illinois; a “transient” clinic (office) on State Street in Chicago; and “Lindlahr’s Health Food Store.” Shortly thereafter, he founded the Lindlahr College of Natural Therapeutics, which included hospital internships at the sanitar- ium. The institution became one of the leading naturopathic colleges of the day. In 1908 he began to publish Nature Cure Magazine and began publishing his series of Philosophy of Natural Therapeutics, with volume 1 (“Philosophy”) in 1918. This was followed by vol- ume 2 (“Practice”) in 1919; volume 3 (“Dietetics”; republished with revisions as originally published in 1914); and, in 1923, volume (“Iridiagnosis”). The intended volumes 4 and 5 were in production at the time of Lindlahr’s death in 1927. As described in Other Healers, Other Cures17:

## 37CHAPTER 3 The History of Naturopathic Medicine: Origins and Overview

Henry Lindlahr, another American, is remembered for his convic- tion that disease did not represent an invasion of molecules, but the body’s way of healing something. In other words, he viewed symp- toms as a positive physiological response—proof that the body is fighting whatever’s wrong. Accordingly, a fever is a “healthy” sign and one should be let alone, unless it is dangerously high, of course. The effect of all these gentlemen on the development of naturopa- thy in America, under Lust’s guidance, was profound. From these beginnings, the naturopathic movement gathered strength and continued to grow through the 1920s and 1930s, having a major effect on natural healing and natural lifestyles in the United States. Along the way, Lust was greatly influenced by the writings of John H. Tilden, MD (largely published between 1915 and 1925). Tilden was originally a practicing physician in Denver who became disen- chanted with orthodox medicine and began to rely heavily on dietet- ics and nutrition, formulating his theories of “auto-intoxication” (the effect of fecal matter remaining too long in the digestive process) and “toxemia.” Lust was also greatly influenced by Elmer Lee, MD, who became a practicing naturopath around 1910 and whose movement was called the “hygienic system,” following the earlier works of Russell Trall. Lee published Health Culture for many years. In addition to John Tilden, MD, and Elmer Lee, MD, another medical doctor, John Harvey Kellogg, MD, who turned to more nutritionally based natural healing concepts, was greatly respected by Lust. Kellogg was renowned through his connection with the Battle Creek Sanitarium. The sanitarium itself was originally founded in the 1860s as a Seventh-Day Adventist institution designed to perpetuate the Grahamite philosophies of Sylvester Graham and William Alcott. The sanitarium was on the verge of being closed, however, because of economic failure, when, in 1876, Kellogg, a new and more dynamic physician-in-chief, was appointed. Kellogg, born in 1852, was a “sickly child” who, at the age of 14, ran across the works of Graham and converted to vegetarianism. At the age of 20, he studied for a term at Trall’s Hygio-Therapeutic College and then earned a medical degree at New York’s Bellevue Medical School. He maintained an affiliation with the regular schools of medicine during his lifetime, due more to his practice of surgery than his beliefs in the area of health care.4 Kellogg designated his concepts, which were basically the hygienic system of healthful living, “biologic living.” Principally, Kellogg defended vegetarianism, attacked sexual misconduct and the evils of alcohol, and was a prolific writer throughout the late 19th century and early 20th century. He produced a popular periodical, Good Health, which continued in existence until 1955. When Kellogg died in 1943 at the age of 91, he had had more than 300,000 patients through the Battle Creek Sanitarium (which he had renamed from the Western Health Reform Institute shortly after his appointment in 1876), including many celebrities, and the “San” became nationally well known. Kellogg, along with Tilden and Elie Metchnikoff (director of the prestigious Pasteur Institute and winner of the 1908 Nobel Prize for a contribution to immunology), wrote prolifically on the theory of auto-intoxication. Kellogg, in particular, felt that humans, in the pro- cess of digesting meat, produced various intestinal self-poisons that contributed to auto-intoxication. As a result, Kellogg became a near fanatic on the subject of help- ing humans return to a more healthy, natural state by returning to the naturally designed usage of the colon. He felt that the average mod- ern colon was devitalized by the combination of sedentary living, the custom of sitting rather than squatting to defecate, and the modern civilized habit of ignoring “nature’s call” out of an undue concern for politeness. Further, Kellogg concentrated on the fact that the modern diet had insufficient bulk and roughage to stimulate the bowels to proper action. Kellogg was also extremely interested in hydrotherapy. In the 1890s he established a laboratory at the San to study the clinical appli- cations of hydrotherapy. This led, in 1902, to his writing Rational Hydrotherapy. The preface espoused a philosophy of drugless healing that came to be one of the bases of the hydrotherapy school of medical thought in America. Tilden, as mentioned, was of a similar mind. He must have been to have provided natural healthcare literature with his 200-plus-page dissertation entitled “Constipation,” with a chapter devoted to the evils of not responding when nature called. This belief in the “evils” drawing away from the natural condition of the colon was extremely important to Kellogg’s work.4 Because of Lust’s interest, Kellogg’s The New Dietetics (1921) became one of the bibles of naturopathic literature.18 Lust was also influenced by the works of Sidney Weltmer, the father of “suggestive therapeutics.” The theory behind Professor Weltmer’s work was that whether it was the mind or the body that first lost its grip on health, the two were inseparably related. When the problem orig- inated in the body, the mind nonetheless lost its ability and desire to overcome the disease because the patient “felt sick” and consequently slid further into the diseased state. Alternatively, if the mind first lost its ability and desire to “be healthy” and some physical infirmity fol- lowed, the patient was susceptible to being overcome by disease. Weltmer’s work dealt specifically with the psychological process of desiring to be healthy. Lust enthusiastically backed Weltmer’s work and had him appear on the programs at various annual conventions of the American Naturopathic Association (which commenced after its founding in 1919). Lust was also personal friends with and a deep admirer of Bernarr MacFadden.19 MacFadden was the founder of the “physical culture” school of health and healing, also known as “physcultopathy.” This school of healing gave birth across the country to gymnasiums at which exercise programs, designed to allow the individual man or woman to maintain the most perfect state of health and human condition possible, were devel- oped and taught.4 Other Healers, Other Cures described it as follows15: The next Naturopathic star, after Kellogg, was Bernarr Mac- Fadden, the physical culturist who built a magazine-publishing empire (his first magazine was Physical Culture founded in 1898). MacFadden proselytizes for exercise and fresh vegetables, hardly eccentric notions. But his flamboyant efforts to publicize them and his occasional crack-pot ideas (like freezing the unemployed, then thawing them out when the Depression was over) alienated many people. Still, he was his own best advertisement. He fathered nine children by four wives and was parachuting from planes in his 80s. One of MacFadden’s admirers was that arch-foe of the medical profession, George Bernard Shaw, the longevous eccentric in his own right. Lust was also interested in, and helped publicize, “zone therapy,” originated by Joe Shelby Riley, DC, a chiropractor based in Washington, DC, and one of the early practitioners of “broad chiropractic.” Zone therapy was an early forerunner of acupressure as it related “pressures and manipulations of the fingers and tongue, and percussion on the spinal column, according to the relation of the fingers to certain zones of the body.”17 Several other American drugless healers contributed to a broad range of “-opathies” that Lust merged into his growing view of natu- ropathy as the eclectic compilation of methods of natural healing. The

## 38SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

Universal Directory also contained a complete list of osteopaths and chiropractors as drugless healers within the realm of Lust’s view of naturopathic theory. His other significant compatriots at the time of the publication of the directory were Carl Stueh, described by Lust as “one of the first medical men in this country who gave up medicine and operation for natural healing”; F. W. Collins, MD, DO, DC, an early graduate of the American School of Naturopathy (1907) who went on to graduate from the New Jersey College of Osteopathy (1909) and the Palmer School of Chiropractic (1912); another “broad chiro- practor,” Anthony Matijaca, MD, ND, DO, the naturopathic resident expert in electrotherapy and an associate editor of the Herald and Health Naturopath (the inverted name of the Lust journal at the time of the directory); and Carl Schultz, ND, DO, MD, president and general manager of the Naturopathic Institute and Sanatorium of California, essentially the second school in the country to pursue the education of physicians under the name of “naturopathy.” In Inner Hygiene: Constipation and the Pursuit of Health in Modern Society, Whorton20 offered his first assessments of the work of Lust as it related to the emergence of naturopathy in the early 20th century: Most of the drugless clan also identified themselves as practitioners of naturopathy, a system of practice that grew out of hydropathy, as well as German water-cure and nature-cure traditions. Organized in the late 1890s under the leadership of German immigrant Benedict Lust, natu- ropathy sought to cure the full scope of human ills with natural agents (herbs, water, air, sunlight, electricity, massage, and others), agents that supported and stimulated the body’s own healing mechanisms. In his extensive assessments of Lust’s work and writings in Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America, Whorton21 attempted to put the philosophic development of naturopathy in a reasonable historical context: However much a dreamer Lust was in some respects, he was an insightful realist in others. He was correct in believing that simply giv- ing nature support as it ran its course was the best one could do with many diseases in his day. He was correct in seeing self-abuse as the source of much physical, and emotional, suffering and attacked it with an ardor that MDs could not bring to the task until nearly a century later. Recent medical lamentations over the evils of smoking, sexual promiscuity, and other risky behaviors adopted in the thoughtless chase after pleasure have nothing on Lust’s jeremiads … Lust was right in reprimanding allopaths for focusing so strongly on disease as to lose sight of the importance of promoting health. He was right in appreciating the need to “individualize” the treatment of each patient—and in seeing patient self-responsibility as part of that individualization.

## The Metamorphosis of Orthodox Medicine

Naturopathy’s formative years, and in some respects its halcyon days, were from 1900 to 1917. In many jurisdictions, modern licensing laws were not yet in effect, so varied schools of healing were openly prac- ticed. By 1920, however, the American world of medicine had under- gone a sharp transition, culminating in four decades of change. A look at the structure of early medical care in the United States is instructive, even as practiced and dominated by the orthodox school, when noting the changes that occurred between 1875 and 1920. In 1875 the following was descriptive of American medical practice: • The practice, even in urban areas, sent the doctor to the patient; the “house call” was the norm. • There was little modern licensing regulation. • Hospitals were charitable institutions where persons too poor to otherwise receive health care were usually sent when ill. • The AMA, although formed in 1846 and generally representative of the professional goals of the regular or orthodox school of med- icine, had scarcely begun to make any political inroads at all. • Medical schools required little or no college education for entrance and were largely apprenticeship based and proprietary in nature, having changed little throughout the century. • Although some doctors had begun to specialize, to do so was far from the norm. The major recognized specialties were surgery, obstetrics, and gynecology. • Many different types of doctors existed, and society’s reaction to the profession neither recognized specific expertise nor necessarily rewarded professionals in medical practice well. • Although the orthodox school made up roughly 80% of profes- sional medical practitioners, the homeopaths and the eclectics were visible and respected in their own communities for their abilities and expertise, and much of the public relied on other “irregular” practitioners. By comparison, in 1920, a total metamorphosis of the medical profes- sion had occurred: • By 1920, practices had become office oriented and clinic ori- ented. • Modern licensing principles had become fully developed, and phy- sicians and surgeons were licensed in all jurisdictions. Most other healthcare providers had some licensing restrictions placed on them, if they were recognized at all. • Due largely to the introduction into surgery of the practice of antiseptic techniques and aseptic procedures and a correspondent decline in operative mortality, institutional care in the hospital became increasingly accepted. Also, clinical pathology and diag- nostic laboratory procedures had become well developed, and the hospital had become a major training and clinical research facility that was generally more acceptable to the patient. • The AMA was approaching the peak of its political power, having exercised, through its Council on Medical Education and its Coun- cil of Pharmacy and Chemistry, major effects on medical schools and the pharmaceutical industry. • The transition to research- and education-based medical schools, instead of practitioner apprenticeships and proprietary educa- tion, had become complete. All recognized medical schools had a 4-year curriculum, with an undergraduate degree or substantial undergraduate study required as a prerequisite. In addition, most schools, in conjunction with most licensing statutes, required a year’s internship. • Specialization was becoming well developed, and the number of specialty groups had increased considerably. This would continue throughout the 1930s and into the early 1940s. • Professional authority and autonomy had undergone a substantial transition, and the allopathic physician was now recognized as a medical expert. • By 1922, the last eclectic school was on the verge of closure, and in the early 1930s, the last of the homeopathic schools in the United States was also on the verge of closure. The influence of these sects on orthodox medicine had dwindled to almost nothing. Naturo- paths and other alternative healthcare practitioners had adopted the areas of expertise previously considered the territory of homeo- paths and eclectics.

## The Halcyon Years of Naturopathy

In 1924 Morris Fishbein succeeded George Simmons as editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). Fishbein had

## 39CHAPTER 3 The History of Naturopathic Medicine: Origins and Overview

joined the editorial staff of JAMA under Simmons immediately after his graduation from Chicago’s Rush Medical School in 1913. Campion pointed out the following9: Over the years, Fishbein not only established himself as the gifted editor of the most widely read medical journal in the United States; he also learned how to extend his editorial position, how to project his opinions nationwide. He became, as the saying went in those years, a “personality.” TIME referred to him as “the nation’s most ubiquitous, the most widely maligned, and perhaps most influen- tial medico.” In addition to his development of JAMA as an editorial and per- sonal voice, Fishbein also continually railed against “quackery.” Lust, among others, including MacFadden, became Fishbein’s epit- ome of quackery. When MacFadden became a wealthy man, after his publishing company included popular magazines like True Confessions and True Detective, he began campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination. In response, a physician sub- mitted, under the initials “K.G.,” a tongue-in-cheek listing of the cabinet that would exist under MacFadden, including the newly created “Secretary of Aviation” for Lust. Lust was a popular figure by this time who conducted such a busy lecture schedule and prac- tice, alternating between the “Yungborns” in Butler, New Jersey, and Tangerine, Florida, that he had become almost as well known as an airline traveler. Lust devoted a complete editorial in Nature’s Path to a response. Although Fishbein had JAMA as a personal editorial outlet, Lust had his own publications. Commencing with the Naturopath and Herald of Health in 1902 (which changed its name to Herald of Health and Naturopath in 1918), Lust continually published this and other monthly journals. In 1919 it became the official journal of the ANA, mailed to all members. Each edition contained the editorial column “Dr. Lust Speaking.” In the early 1920s, the “health fad” movement was reaching its peak in terms of public awareness and interest. As described, somewhat wistfully, in his June 1937 column, Lust announced the approach of the 41st Congress of Natural Healing under his guidance: The progress of our movement could be observed in our wonder- ful congresses, in 1914 Butler, N.J., 1915 Atlantic City, 1916 in Chicago, 1917 Cleveland, 1918 New York, 1919 Philadelphia, 1920 and 1921 again New York, and 1922 in Washington, D.C., where we had the full support and backing of the Congress of the United States. President Harding received the president and the delegates of our convention and we were the guests of the City of Washington. Through the strenuous efforts of Dr. T.M. Schippel, Hon. Congresswoman Catherine Langley of Kentucky, and eight years of hard work financed and sustained by Dr. Schippel and her powerful friends in Congress, Naturopathy was fully legalized as a healing art in the District of Columbia and the definition was placed on record and the law affirmed and amended by another act which has been fully published over and over again in the official journal of the A.N.A., Naturopath. In 1923 in Chicago, with the help and financing of the great and never-to-be forgotten Dr. Henry Lindlahr, we had a great con- vention. Not only were all the Naturopaths there but even to an extent our congress was recognized and acknowledged as official and of great importance by the medical people, particularly by the Health Commissioner of Chicago. We held a banquet, and there were discussions covering all platforms of the healing art. It was the first congress in the United States where medicine and Naturopa- thy in all its branches such as the general old-time Nature Cure, Hydrotherapy and Diet, Osteopathy, Naprapathy, Chiropractic, Neuropathy and Physiotherapy were represented on the same plat- form. The speakers represented every modern school of healing and the movement at that time was in the direction of an entirely rec- ognized and independent school of healing. There were two camps, official medicine and official Naturopathy, the medical camp hav- ing all that is good and bad in medicine and surgery and all the other schools of healing that had sold their birthright and trusted to the allurement of organized medicine, such as Homeopaths, Eclectics, Physio-medics, and the Osteopaths to a large extent. The Osteopaths were always in the wrong camp when they went on mixed boards and Dr. Andrew Taylor Still, the father of Osteopa- thy, told me in 1915 that by compromising with medicine Osteop- athy is doomed as the school that could have incorporated all of the natural and biological healing arts. The year following we had the great congress in Los Angeles which has never been duplicated. We had to meet in two hotels because the crowds ran over 10,000. The glorious banquet will never be forgotten and the congress celebrated and demonstrated that the initial and first intent of the A.N.A. to teach the public Natural Living and Nature Cure was realized. We will never for- get the glorious week in Los Angeles where the authorities and the whole city joined us. The success of that congress was largely due to the talent of Dr. Fred Hirsch, the successor to Prof. Arnold Ehret and the noble and generous Naturopaths of the A.N.A. of Cal. There was never a second congress like that. Then we had the great congresses of New York in 1925, Indianap- olis 1926, Philadelphia 1927, Minneapolis 1928, Portland, Oregon 1929, New York 1930, Milwaukee 1931, Washington, D.C., 1932, Chicago 1933, Denver 1934, San Diego 1935, and Omaha 1936. In 1925 Lust began to try to reach more of the general populace through the lay publication Nature’s Path. The Naturopath and Nature’s Path were later merged because the self-supporting advertising and subscription monies were more available by publication to the gen- eral populace than to the members of the association (The Naturopath, 1902–1927; Nature’s Path, 1925–1927; merged 1927–1933; separated 1934–1938; Nature’s Path, 1939–1945). How large a professional movement Lust inspired during this period of naturopathy’s emergence is difficult to gauge. An exten- sive government survey was not undertaken until 1965. However, as Whorton described in Nature Cures,21 naturopathy had an effect: Those were messages that had enough appeal, evidently, to allow naturopathy to expand steadily through the first decades of the cen- tury until by 1923 Lust could estimate that there were nine thou- sand naturopaths, a “vast army of professional men and women” working on all continents to “rejuvenate and regenerate the world.” His figures were undoubtedly inflated. An independent study [the work of the CCMC discussed later] put the number of naturopaths at “possibly 1500,” allowing that if the “allied groups” that advo- cated drugless healing under other names [physiotherapy, sanip- ractic] were added on the total may reach 2500. Yet whatever their numbers, naturopaths had grown into a force not to be ignored. Although Lust’s claim of 9000 naturopaths worldwide is impos- sible to assess, 5000 practitioners may be a reasonable estimate of the reach of his naturopathy in the United States by the late 1920s and into the 1930s. As Whorton21 reported, the mixer orientation within chiropractic was also becoming a growing presence. This orientation was a philosophy that tended to merge chiropractic and naturopathy in education and practice.22 Although homeopathy has undergone a small revival in recent years, very few MDs now practice it. It is currently mainly of interest to naturopaths, who earn doctor of naturopathy (ND) degrees, and to a few chiropractors. Naturopaths closely resemble

chiropractors in that they use spinal manipulative therapy and because so-called mixer chiropractors also use naturopathic methods such as heat, cold, hydrotherapy, physiotherapy, dietary supplements, and even some herbal and homeopathic remedies, which is why the traditional, or “straight,” chiropractors disparagingly call them “medipractors.” Until the middle of the 20th century, a few mixer schools offered both DC and ND degrees, either as alternatives or together after an additional semester of study. Whorton noted a “1930 survey in which some 1,800 chiropractors participated, found, for example, that 1,124 employed hydrotherapy, 1,173 used light therapy, 1,257 provided electrotherapy, and a full 1,352 trusted vibration therapy.”21 In January 1934 Lust commenced republication of the title Naturopath and Herald of Health in addition to Nature’s Path. Each volume opened with his personal column, different for each publica- tion. Both publications were issued through 1938, when the Nature’s Path again became the sole publication until Lust’s death in 1945. After the Universal Directory, Lust continued to write volumes on naturopathic principles, although he was more of a synthesizer, orga- nizer, lecturer, and essayist than a scientific documenter of naturo- pathic principles. His most enduring contributions may remain his early translations of Kuhne’s and Just’s works. During the 1920s and up until 1937, Lust’s brand of “quackery,” so labeled by Fishbein, was in its most popular phase. Although the institutional markings of the orthodox school had gained ascendancy, before 1937, it had no real therapeutic success in the treatment of dis- ease outside of the broad advancements in public health. Lust’s naturopathy, together with chiropractic and osteopathy, continued to be on the outside looking in, this lack of therapeutic advancement notwithstanding. Practitioners of all three movements were continually prosecuted for practicing medicine without a license, although they often won their cases by establishing to juries that their practices were (even according to the testimony of medical men) not the same as medicine at all. At the time, orthodox practitioners could offer little or no expectation of cure for many diseases, and the “health food and natural health” movement was generally popular. During the 1920s Gaylord Hauser, later to become the health food guru of the Hollywood set, came to Lust as a seriously ill young man. Lust, through the application of the nature cure, removed Hauser’s afflictions and was rewarded by Hauser’s lifelong devotion. His regular columns in Nature’s Path became widely read among the Hollywood set. As noted in Other Healers, Other Cures15: The last big name in Naturopathy was Gaylord Hauser, a Vien- nese-Born food scientist (as one of his early books identified him) turned to Naturopathy in his later years. He is best remembered for advising the eating of living foods, not dead foods, and for escort- ing Greta Garbo around. In addition to fresh fruits and vegetables, Hauser’s “Wonder Foods” were skimmed milk, brewer’s yeast, wheat germ, yogurt, and blackstrap molasses. The naturopathic journals of the 1920s and 1930s are instructive. Much of the dietary advice focused on poor eating habits, including the lack of fiber in the diet and an overreliance on red meat as a protein source. More than half a century later in the 1980s, the pronounce- ments of the orthodox profession, the National Institute of Health, and the National Cancer Institute finally accepted the validity of these early assertions by naturopaths that poor dietary and living habits (particu- larly smoking) would lead to degenerative diseases, including cancers associated with the lungs, the digestive tract, and the colon. The December 1928 volume of Nature’s Path was the first American publication of the works of Herman J. DeWolff, a Dutch epidemiolo- gist who was one of the first individuals to assert, based on studies of the incidence of cancer in the Netherlands, that there was a correlation between exposure to petrochemicals and various types of cancers. He saw a connection between chemical fertilizers and their usage in some soils (principally clay) that led to poisons remaining in vegetables after they had arrived at the market and were purchased for consumption. Again, it was 50 years before orthodox medicine began to accept the wisdom of such concerns. As Whorton noted in Nature Cures, naturopaths were less successful than osteopaths and chiropractors in accomplishing professionaliza- tion by the elevation of professional standards, including professional education. This occurred despite the formation of a National Board of Naturopathic Examiners of the ANA in 1940. There was constant internal bickering, which “by the 1940s had taken on a more omi- nous tone.” Although “standards at naturopathic schools were steadily raised from the 1940s on, thanks to both professional idealism and the requirements of state licensing laws,” based on “a perusal of the stat- utes of the dozen states in which naturopaths were licensed in the late 1940s,” the divisive trends within naturopathy “would not begin to be reversed until the 1970s.” Whorton21 observed that there was no misunderstanding where Lust himself stood on the need for professional standards: Obtaining their own licensing statutes was perceived by alterna- tive practitioners as a critical measure for purging incompetence and quackery from their own rank. “Where there is no official recognition and regulation,” the founder of naturopathy, Bene- dict Lust maintained, “you will find the plotters, the thieves, the charlatans … [The] riff-raff opportunists bring the whole art into disrepute.” By the time Lust said this, shortly before his death in 1945, frustrating experience had demonstrated that “that is the fate of any science—any profession—which the unjust laws have placed beyond the pale.” In following the evolution of alternative medicine over the first third of the twentieth century, it is essen- tial to keep in mind that constant battle of each system to bring itself within the pale.

## The Emerging Dominance of American Medical

## Association Medicine

In 1937 the status of conventional (allopathic) medicine began to change. The change came with the beginning of the era of “mira- cle medicine.” Lewis Thomas, in his interesting work The Youngest Science,23 compared his education and internship as a physician with his father’s life as a physician. His father believed that bedside man- ner was more important than any actual medication offered by the physician. His father went into general surgery so that he could offer some service to his patients that actually made some change in their condition. Thomas pointed out that the major growth of “scientific medicine” until 1937 advanced diagnosis rather than offering any hope of cure. This introduction of “miracle medicine,” the social effects of World War II on health care, and the death of Lust in 1945 all combined to contribute a precipitous decline for naturopathy and natural healing in the United States. (During the war, the necessity for crisis surgi- cal intervention techniques for battlefront conditions encouraged the use of morphine, sulfa drugs, and penicillin for diseases not previously encountered in civilian life by American combat soldiers. This resulted in the rapid development of higher-technology approaches to medi- cine and highly visible successes.) Lust recognized this, and his editorializing became, if anything, even more strident. From the introduction of sulfa drugs in 1937 to the Salk vaccine’s release in 1955, the American public became used to annual developments of miracle vaccines and antibiotics.

## 41CHAPTER 3 The History of Naturopathic Medicine: Origins and Overview

Lust died in September 1945 at the Yungborn facility in Butler, New Jersey, preparing to attend the 49th Annual Congress of his American ANA. In August 1945, for the official program of that congress held in October 1945 just after his death, he dictated the following remarks: What is the present condition of Naturopathy? What is its future? I can give my opinion in a very few words. For fifty years I have been in the thick of the fight to bring to the American people the Nature Cure. During that period I have had an opportunity to judge what Naturopathy has done, and can accomplish and the type of men and women, past and present, who make up the Natu- ropathic ranks. Let us take the present situation first. What is Naturopathy accomplishing? The answer to that is: “Everything.” Naturopathy holds the key for the prevention, alleviation and cure of every ail- ment, to man and beast alike. It has never failed in the hands of a competent Naturopath. Whatever the body can “catch”—that same body, with proper handling, can eliminate. And that takes in cancer, tumors, arthritis, cataract and the whole gamut of “incur- able medical” disease and ailments. During my years of practice I, personally, have seen every type of human ailment and so-called serious “disease” give way to the simple, proven Naturopathic methods. I make no exception to that statement. Now let us see the type of men and women who are the Natu- ropaths of today. Many of them are fine, upstanding individuals, believing fully in the effectiveness of their chosen profession— willing to give their all for the sake of alleviating human suffering and ready to fight for their rights to the last ditch. More power to them! But there are others who claim to be Naturopaths who are woeful misfits. Yes, and there are outright fakers and cheats masking as Naturopaths. That is the fate of any science—any profession—which the unjust laws have placed beyond the pale. Where there is no official recognition and regulation, you will find the plotters, the thieves, the charlatans operating on the same basis as the conscientious practitioners. And these riff-raff oppor- tunists bring the whole art into disrepute. Frankly such condi- tions cannot be remedied until suitable safeguards are erected by law, or by the profession itself, around the practice of Naturopa- thy. That will come in time. Now let us look at the future. What do we see? The grad- ual recognition of this true healing art—not only because of the efforts of the present conscientious practitioners but because of the bungling, asinine mistakes of orthodox medicine—Naturop- athy’s greatest enemy. The fiasco of the sulpha drugs as empha- sized disastrously in our armed forces is just one straw in the wind. The murderous Schick test—that deadly “prevention” of diphtheria—is another. All these medical crimes are steadily piling up. They are slowly, but inevitably, creating a public dis- trust in all things medical. This increasing lack of confidence in the infallibility of Modern Medicine will eventually make itself felt to such an extent that the man on the street will turn upon these self-constituted oppressors and not only demand but force a change. I may not be here to witness this revolution but I believe with all my soul that it is coming. Yes, the future of Naturopa- thy is indeed bright. It merely requires that each and every true Naturopath carry on—carry on—to the best of his and her abili- ties. May God bless you all. The effects of postwar events on osteopathy and chiropractic were completely different from the effect on naturopathy. In the early days of osteopathy, there was a significant split between the strict drug- less system advocated by A. T. Still (osteopathy’s originator) and the beliefs of many MDs who converted to osteopathy because of its therapeutic value. The latter group did not want to abandon all of the techniques they had previously learned and all of the drugs they had previously used when those therapy techniques were sometimes effective. Ultimately, most schools of osteopathy, commencing with the school based in Los Angeles, converted to more of an imitation of modern orthodox medicine. These developments led to more of an accommodation between the California osteopaths and the members of the California Medical Association. (This developing cooperation between the California Osteopathic and Medical Association was one of the major issues leading to the downfall, in 1949, of Fishbein’s edi- torial voice in JAMA.) Thus osteopathy found a place in professional medicine, at the cost of its drugless healing roots and therapies.9 Naturopathy had become an element of chiropractic education and practice at least as early as 1910 with the founding of the Peerless College of Chiropractic and Naturopathy in Portland, Oregon.22 From this point on, naturopathic education developed in two tracks: schools of naturopathy owned and operated by naturopaths and chiropractic schools that had naturopathic curricula in addition to the core chiro- practic programs. These latter schools were a central part of the mixer orientation within chiropractic.22,24 Initial assessments of schools of naturopathy occurred in the 1920s and 1930s. These assessments came from those within, or allied with, allopathy and were therefore hardly unbiased, but much of the infor- mation in these assessments seemed credible. The progression of edu- cation in naturopathy would be expected to have been similar to that of chiropractic, if somewhat smaller in scale. In this regard, Wardwell noted22: Wiese and Ferguson25 identified 392 different chiropractic schools as having existed in the United States. When those for which there is no evidence of more than a year of operation are eliminated, the number is reduced to 188. Most of them probably produced few graduates—the number of schools increased rapidly to their largest between 1910 and 1926, and then contracted, particularly during the depression of the 1930s and World War II. The history of schools of naturopathy followed much the same pat- tern. Whorton21 noted in Nature Cures that this was the case. The oper- ators of these schools seemed, at least on the surface, aware of the kind of criticisms to which proprietary trade and professional schools were subjected: limited facilities, limited resources, and an emphasis on col- lecting revenue versus providing a full professional education.22,24 The leading operators of schools of naturopathy sought, at least on paper, to respond to these criticisms. By letter agreement dated October 7, 1922, four of the most identifiable leaders of naturopathy—Benedict Lust, Joe Shelby Riley, F. W. Collins, and Henry Lindlahr—com- mitted to the formation of the Associated Naturopathic Schools and Colleges of America and committed themselves, as “the Presidents of Naturopathic Schools in the United States of America,” to specific edu- cational minimums “on and after January 2, 1923”: “all matriculants must have a primary school education26 and all naturopath courses must be composed of 4 years of 6 months each.” Additionally, the let- ter provided that “time allowance or credits may be given to practi- tioners in the field who desire to take up the naturopathic courses, and to licensed physicians of other methods of healing,” with the amount of such credit being left to each school’s discretion. In the summer and fall of 1927 representatives of the AMA’s Council on Medical Education and Hospitals conducted inspec- tions—unannounced and incognito—of schools of “chiropody, chiropractic, naturopathy, optometry, osteopathy, physical ther- apy, as well as a large number of institutions.” From these inspec- tions, several reports were generated, including the Council’s report on “Schools of Chiropractic and Naturopathy in the United States,”

which appeared first as part of the Council’s Annual Report, 1928, and later as reprinted in JAMA. The report identified 40 schools of chiropractic and 10 schools of naturopathy and detailed the inspections of “some schools of Chiropractic and of Naturopathy”: Palmer School of Chiropractic (a straight school); National College of Chiropractic (a mixer school that was reported as hav- ing recently purchased and assimilated Lindlahr College of Natural Therapeutics); Los Angeles College of Chiropractic (another lead- ing mixer school); the combined American School of Naturopathy, Inc. and American School of Chiropractic, Inc. (Lust’s own New York City schools, although Lust was observed to have been “in Florida” at the time of the inspections); and the Naturopathic College and Hospital of Philadelphia. The reports were predictably negative with regard to facilities, resources, and the clearly propri- etary nature of the establishments. Louis Reed of the Committee on the Costs of Medical Care (CCMC), in discussing “naturopathic schools,”24 relied heavily on this report from the AMA’s Council and observed that “in 1927, according to the American Medical Association, there existed twelve naturopathic colleges with not over 200 students. These fig- ures would probably hold good for the present time.” Reed also concluded that there were “a considerable number of miscella- neous drugless healers of a type similar to chiropractors practice in this country” as of 1932 and that “the naturopaths form the larg- est group of these practitioners. … Of these various cults, only the naturopaths and the sanipractors have any considerable member- ship. Many of the (other) cults are really part of the naturopathic group.”24 As to numbers of drugless practitioners, Reed observed that “only the roughest estimate can be made—probably there are about 2500,” of which naturopaths “number possibly 1500,” and saniprac- tors—“only the name distinguishes sanipractors from the naturo- paths”—numbered some 500 in their Washington state “stronghold.” Reed also observed that as of 1932: “A few states—Connecticut, Florida, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, Washington and the District of Columbia—provide for licensing of naturopaths as limited prac- titioners. … In addition to those mentioned, certain states (Alabama, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Wyoming) make (other) provision for the licensing of drugless or limited practitioners.”24 Reed’s work for the CCMC, although clearly biased against all of the healing philosophies he identified as “medical cults” (a la Fishbein), principally osteopathy, chiropractic, and naturopathy, was the only work that attempted to survey the presence and effect of these schools of healing in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s.27 A decade later, in April 1945, another work of this kind appeared in the Rhode Island Medical Journal. The article, “Naturopathic Legislation and Education,” was written by the Rhode Island Medical Society’s executive secretary, John E. Farrell, to set out some of the society’s rea- sons for opposing legislation that would license naturopathy in Rhode Island. The article noted that according to the 1942–1943 Report of the Committee on Education of the ANA, 13 schools of naturopathy in the United States met the criteria of the ANA; the article went on to make a lengthy “Report on Schools” through visits to most of the identified schools.28 The predictable criticisms of these schools as underfinanced, underresourced, and proprietary in nature appeared once again, although by actual detail of description, National College (Chicago) and Western States (Portland) seemed to be well-established, func- tioning mixer schools of chiropractic and naturopathy. The effect on chiropractic of the post–World War II years was somewhat different. Because of educational recognition under the G.I. Bill, the number of chiropractors in the country grew substantially, and their effect on the populace grew accordingly. The sect eventually grew powerful enough in terms of numbers and economic clout that it could pose a legal challenge to the ortho- dox monopoly of the AMA. However, in the immediate postwar years, the AMA gained tremendous political clout. Combined with the American Legion and the National Board of Realtors,29 these three groups posed a powerful political triumvirate before the U.S. Congress. These years, called the years of the “great fear” in Caute’s book by that name,30 were the years during which to be unorthodox was to be “un-American.” Across the country, courts began to take the view that natu- ropaths were not truly doctors because they espoused doctrines from “the dark ages of medicine” (something American medicine had apparently come out of in 1937) and that drugless healers were intended by law to operate without “drugs” (which became defined as anything a person would ingest or apply externally for any remedial medical purpose). In this regard, the Washington State Supreme Court case of Kelly v. Carroll31 and the Arizona State Supreme Court case of Kuts-Cheraux v. Wilson document how sig- nificant limitations were placed on naturopaths under the guise of calling them “drugless healers.” In the state of Tennessee, as a reaction to the 1939 publication of the book Back to Eden by herbalist Jethro Kloss, court action initiated by the Tennessee State Medical Association led first to the publish- ers being forbidden to advertise the book for any therapeutic purpose. They were allowed only to acknowledge that it was in stock. Then, after a serious licensing scandal during the war years, the Tennessee State Legislature declared the practice of naturopathy in the state of Tennessee to be a gross misdemeanor, punishable by up to 1 year in jail. Although it was under considerable public pressure in those years, the ANA undertook some of its most scholarly work, coordinating all the systems of naturopathy under commission. This resulted in the publication of a basic textbook on naturopathy (Basic Naturopathy, published in 1948 by the ANA32) and a significant work compil- ing all the known theories of botanical medicine (as commissioned by the ANA’s successor after its 1950 name change to the American Naturopathic Physicians and Surgeons Association), the Naturae Medicina, published in 1953.33 Naturopathic medicine began splinter- ing when Lust’s ANA was succeeded by six different organizations in the mid-1950s. The primary organizations among these were the successor to the ANA, which underwent a name change in 1950 to the American Naturopathic Physician and Surgeon’s Association and subsequently changed to the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) in 1956, and the International Society of Naturopathic Physicians formed under the leadership of M. T. Campenella of Florida shortly after Lust’s death, with its American offshoot, the National Association of Naturopathic Physicians. In the face of the AMA’s determination to eliminate chiroprac- tic, and with it, naturopathy—healing philosophies that were linked through the mixer orientation within chiropractic (during the 1930s and through the 1960s the majority camp within a divided chiroprac- tic)—naturopathy went through a period of decline described by Hans Baer (see Bibliography). Walter Wardwell was a sociology professor who became an early leader in what developed as a subspecialty in the 1950s: medical sociol- ogy. His earliest work, starting with his doctoral dissertation (1951) at Harvard, focused on chiropractic as an example of a marginalized health profession (see Bibliography). As early as his doctoral disser- tation, Wardwell discussed naturopathy as an adjunct discipline to

## 43CHAPTER 3 The History of Naturopathic Medicine: Origins and Overview

chiropractic in the context of the continuing division of chiropractic into mixers and straights. As he later noted34: Comparison of the survival of chiropractic with that of osteopathy and naturopathy is a quite different matter which does not involve metaphysical or epistemological differences between them. Fur- thermore, the overlap in theory between chiropractic, osteopathy and naturopathy is very great. Differences between osteopathic and chiropractic manipulative treatment appear to be more a matter of who applies the technique rather than differences in technique itself. The distinction between chiropractors and naturopaths is even more blurred because they often trained at the same schools and sometimes they studied both fields simultaneously. As recently as 1948, three of the currently accredited chiropractic colleges offered N.D. (Doctor of Naturopathy) and D.C. (Doctor of Chiropractic) degrees. In this context he described naturopathy as a school of healing that became extinct as two historical factors converged: the death of Lust in 1945, leaving naturopathy without its “founder,” and the mandate in the early 1950s by the major mixers’ professional group, the National Chiropractic Association (NCA), that it would no lon- ger accredit chiropractic schools that granted degrees in naturopathy: In the case of naturopathy, chiropractic’s victory is nearly complete. Although there may still be up to 2000 naturopaths in practice35 with naturopaths licensed in a few states, and one small school in Portland, Oregon, still offers naturopathic degrees, none of the schools that formerly offered both chiropractic and naturopathic degrees currently does so. With practically no new recruits entering the profession, naturopathy must disappear. By the late 1970s, Wardwell had learned of efforts in the Pacific Northwest to keep naturopathy alive. In his chapter in the Handbook of Medical Sociology, Wardwell noted this presence in the Northwest (which had received no mention in the first two editions in 1963 and 1972)36: The accrediting of chiropractic colleges is encouraging uniformity, not only in curricula but in scope of practice. Those colleges that formerly offered the Doctor of Naturopathy (N.D.) as well as the D.C. degree have ceased doing so, leaving naturopathy with only one remaining small college in Portland, Oregon. In his masterwork, Chiropractic: History and Evolution of a New Profession (1992),22 Wardwell devoted substantial attention to the effect of naturopathy on the mixer orientation within chiropractic and traced naturopathy’s final educational decline to the untimely death in 1954 of William A. Budden, DC, ND, the president of the Western States Chiropractic College (WSCC; Portland, Oregon). After Budden’s death, the WSCC continued to teach naturopathy until but dropped its ND degree program in 1956. This was the last resis- tance to the position of the accrediting committee of the NCA, and no chiropractic ND programs remained. Wardwell observed, though, that the seeds of a naturopathic reemergence had been planted in the Northwest after Budden’s death and that naturopathy might survive. The last ND diplomas were granted at the WSCC in 1958 to stu- dents who were enrolled in the ND program at the time of Budden’s death. Brinker37 noted the following: Political pressure from the chiropractic profession had begun in the late 1940s to force chiropractic schools to relinquish programs granting naturopathic degrees. After threatening loss of accredita- tion, the National Chiropractic Association finally forced Western States College to drop its School of Naturopathy in 1956, and it became exclusively Western States Chiropractic College. Efforts to keep naturopathy alive through education and licensure were examined by two reports prepared in 1958, a time when the Utah legislature was reexamining naturopathy’s licensure in the aftermath of a case from the Utah Supreme Court that had dealt its practicing NDs a crippling blow. The first was A Study of the Healing Arts With a Particular Emphasis Upon Naturopathy (November 1958), prepared as “A Report to the Utah Legislative Council” by legislative council staff. As part of its work, the staff conducted inquiries of and site visits to seven schools accredited by the Utah Naturopathy Examining Board as of August 1957. Separately, the Bureau of Economic and Business Research38 of the University of Utah (BEBR) undertook a study focusing on schools that had granted naturopathy degrees and produced Survey of Naturopathic Schools (“Prepared for the Utah State Medical Society,” December 1958). Preparation of the study was, as noted in the title, undertaken by the university research program at the request of the state medical society, but the preparation of the study was independent, and “no attempt was made by that group to influence the results of the study” (Foreword and Acknowledgements). The BEBR study, done with the requested cooperation of investi- gators from five other universities located in various sections of the United States, surveyed all of the schools listed by Utah licensees as schools of graduation or schools attended, using records maintained by the Utah Department of Business Registration.10 Because the state of naturopathic education in the 1950s is relevant, some observations from this study are worth noting39: One of the most important results to emerge from this study is that there are virtually no schools now teaching naturopathy. Of the 26 schools investigated during this study, only 9 were still in existence in the fall of 1958. Of these nine, only three are now granting naturopathic degrees, and two others are teaching naturopathy. Of the three schools granting ND degrees, the study found that one school, Sierra States University in California, began offering a “postgraduate” ND degree after the most highly respected chiro- practic program in the country, Los Angeles College of Chiropractic, had discontinued its ND degree program in 1948. National College of Naturopathic Medicine (NCNM), the Oregon school, had—in 1957, its first year of operation—four ND students who were start- ing at NCNM and 60 enrolled “postgraduate” DCs pursuing ND degrees. The school had been recognized by the Utah examining board but had not yet granted degrees. The third school granting ND degrees as of 1957 to 1958 was the Central States College of Physiatrics in Eaton, Ohio, essentially the one-man operation of H. Riley Spitler, author of Basic Naturopathy (published by the ANA in 1948). This school granted a doctor of mechanotherapy (DM) degree, recognized in only Ohio and Alabama by law, or an ND degree to anyone who sought licensure in a state where an ND degree would qualify a graduate for licensure. The course of study for both degrees was the same, and the school had graduated students in the previous 2 years. Its ND degrees were recognized in Utah. By 1955, the AANP, as it ultimately became known, had rec- ognized only two schools of naturopathic medicine, the Central States College of Physiatrics in Eaton, Ohio, under the leadership of H. Riley Spitler, and Western States College of Chiropractic and Naturopathy located outside Portland, Oregon, under the leader- ship of W. A. Budden. Budden was a Lindlahr graduate and among the group that took over control of the Lindlahr College after Lindlahr’s death in the 1920s. He moved west in 1929 when the northwestern states, including Oregon, became a bastion for natu- ropaths in this country.

This state of affairs was accurately described by Homola40 in his book on the history and evolution of chiropractic: As of 1958, only five states (Arizona, Connecticut, Oregon, Vir- ginia and Utah) separately classified and provided licensing provisions for the naturopath. A few states, however, did permit licensing of drugless healers following examination by [a] board. (A good number of states have repealed their laws licensing natu- ropaths in recent years.) Chiropractic schools that employ the use of physiotherapy teach a course that is very similar to the practice of naturopathy. Likewise, the three or four naturopathic schools still operating today have a curriculum similar to that of many chiropractic colleges. In fact, at least four chiropractic colleges awarded naturopathic degrees along with the chiropractic degree before they came under the jurisdiction of the national Chiroprac- tic Association. With the approval of this organization, the schools were prohibited from issuing naturopathic degrees. This practically amounted to a death-dealing blow to the profession of naturopa- thy.40 In 1967 the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; the Public Health Service; and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) published Public Health Service Publication No. 1758, State Licensing of Health Occupations. With the assis- tance of the Council of State Governments, the NCHS collected data regarding the licensure of health professionals at the state level. “Chapter 8: Naturopaths” recorded the available data for the naturopathic profession as of the mid-1960s. In summary, the NCHS identified five states and the District of Columbia as licens- ing naturopaths as of 1967: Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii, Oregon, and Utah. California and Florida were identified as renewing exist- ing licenses but granting no new licenses. The publication reported that by 1965, California had renewed 66 licenses and Florida, 136. Licenses in effect by state were as follows: Arizona (100), Connecticut (47), Hawaii (14), Oregon (148), and Utah (42). No numbers were provided for the District of Columbia. The report stated the following41: In addition to Doctors of Naturopathy (ND) there are other limited branches of medicine; these have not been included in the study. In the State of Washington the Drugless Therapeutics Examining Committee functions (for such licensure). The Ohio law states which branches are to be specified on certificates issued by the State Medical Board to limited practitioners. No attempt has been made to collect information on these drugless healers who are few in number. Active state practitioners were also numbered (although the reason for the differentiation is not clear), as follows: Arizona (53), Connecticut (29), Hawaii (13), and Oregon (121). Given the existence of approximately 50 practitioners at the time in Washington, and some practicing in Idaho under a decision of the Idaho Supreme Court, there appear to have been perhaps as many as 600 to 700 remaining naturopaths practicing at the end of the 1960s.42 According to documentation provided to the federal Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1968 by the again-remaining professional association—the National Association of Naturopathic Physicians—only 17 degrees were granted from 1960 to 1968. By 1968, this association had 168 members and estimated that there were perhaps 500 “active” naturopaths in the United States. Congress adopted Medicare in 1965. The legislation covered payment for the services of physicians (essentially MDs and DOs), hospital services, and “other therapeutic services” that would commonly be provided through these conventional means. As Wardwell reported,22 in 1967, Congress directed the secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), Wilbur Cohen, to study the inclu- sion services of “additional types of licensed practitioners.” The sur- geon general and other HEW staff prepared the resulting Independent Practitioners Under Medicare using advisory committees only (Wardwell served on the Expert Review Committee for Chiropractic and Naturopathy), which actually had little input. This report doc- umented the ebb tide of naturopathy’s “period of decline,” as Baer later labeled it.43 The section of the report Naturopathy concluded that as of 1968: Naturopathic theory and practice are not based on the body of basic knowledge related to health, disease, and health care which has been widely accepted by the scientific community. Moreover, irrespective of its theory, the scope and quality of naturopathic edu- cation do not prepare the practitioner to make an adequate diag- nosis and provide adequate treatment. Considering the state of the profession in 1968, these negative assessments were hardly unexpected.

# THE MODERN REJUVENATION

After the counterculture years of the late 1960s and feeding of an American disenchantment with organized medicine that began after the miracle-drug era faded, exposing some of orthodox medicine’s lim- itations, alternative medicine began to gain new respect. Naturopathic medicine underwent an era of rejuvenation as a late-1970s consumer interest in more “holistic” medicine began to emerge. As succinctly described in Cassedy’s44 Medicine in America: A Short History, this phenomenon, which was not limited to naturopathic medicine, was consistent with the modern and continuing “search for health beyond orthodox medicine”: It should not have been surprising to anyone that certain orga- nized therapeutic sects continue to exist in mid–twentieth century America as successful and conspicuous alternatives to regular medicine. This is not to say that they offer the same threats to the medical establishment or play the same roles as their nine- teenth-century counterparts had, as complete therapeutic sys- tems. But they do continue to hold a strong collective appeal for individuals who mistrust or are somehow disenchanted with mainline medicine. They have appealed also to antiauthoritar- ian sentiments that flourish throughout society. Moreover, as earlier, they satisfy various needs that regular medicine continues to neglect or ignore. The same author, in describing the post–World War II decades and the changing fortunes of such healing theories as naturopathic medi- cine, observed as follows: The period also brought about the renewal or updating of certain previously widely used therapies and considerable experimenta- tion with others, some of them exotic. To an extent this trend rep- resented the rediscovery by trained physicians, nurses, and other regular health professionals of certain values and older styles of therapy. The participation of such professionals proved to be an essential ingredient in the rebirth of several such therapies. How- ever, the major reason for the new successes was the wide-spread active interest and involvement of America’s literate lay people in the search for more personal or humane forms of treatment. As another author, John Duffy,45 observed in From Humors to Medical Science:

## 45CHAPTER 3 The History of Naturopathic Medicine: Origins and Overview

Since health is too closely related to cultural, social, and economic factors to be left exclusively to doctors, American lay people have always engaged in do-it-yourself medicine, resorted to “irregulars and quacks,” and supported health movements. As a result of the current fad for physical fitness, our streets are beset by sweat-suited individuals of all ages doggedly jogging their way to health and long life. In addition, stores selling “natural” foods are flourish- ing, physical fitness salons have become a major business, and anti-smoking and weight-loss clinics and workshops are attract- ing thousands of individuals bent on leading cleaner and leaner lives. And those for whom physical activity in itself is not enough are seeking physical and mental well-being through faith healing, yoga, and a host of major and minor gurus. When neither mental effort nor physical exercise can solve medical problems, the sceptics of modern medicine can always turn to the irregulars. A recent estimate places a number of Americans who have relied on an irregular practitioner at some time in their lives at 60 million, and, aided by the high cost of orthodox medicine, irregular medical practice appears to be on the rise. At the beginning of this period of rejuvenation, the profession’s educational institutions had dwindled to one, the National College of Naturopathic Medicine (which had branches in Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon), which was founded after the death of R. A. Budden and the conversion of Western States College to a straight school of chiropractic. Kruger’s15 book Other Healers, Other Cures described it as follows in 1974: Today, Naturopaths in seventeen states are licensed to diagnose, treat, and prescribe for any human disease through the use of air, light, heat, herbs, nutrition, electrotherapy, physiotherapy, manip- ulations, and minor surgery. At present, one can earn an D.N. [a misnomer, actually—N.D.] degree at the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Seattle and Emporia, Kansas, [where, by contract, the first 2 years of the 4-year medical education were then taught], or the new North American Naturopathic Institute in North Arlington, New Jersey [there is also a school in Mon- treal]. The four-year curriculum covers many standard medical courses—anatomy, bacteriology, urology, pathology, physiology, X-ray reading etc.—but also includes botanical medicine, hydro- therapy, electrotherapy, and manipulative technique. The public, by the late 1970s, was particularly ripe for another rejuvenation of naturopathy’s brand of “alternative” health care. As described in Murphy’s Enter the Physician: The Transformation of Domestic Medicine, 1760–1860, when discussing this cyclical rejuvena- tion in the mid-20th century46: Contemporary crusaders still stress prevention as the layperson’s primary duty, but a growing chorus is calling for every person to assume the newly proactive role in his or her own health care. What would this entail? There are probably as many answers to this question as there are respondents, but it is striking to note how many of the solutions would have been familiar to our ancestors who lived between 1760 and 1860. One recurring idea, for instance, is that each person knows his or her own constitution history the best and therefore has a duty to communicate that knowledge to medical personnel. Another is a refur- bished concept of vis medicatrix naturae, the belief that many diseases are self-limiting and therefore do not require much medical interven- tion—and certainly not the amount or the sort to which contemporary Americans are accustomed. Most significantly, today’s analysts are calling on professionals and nonprofessionals to build and nurture a healthcare partnership very much like that envisioned by 19th-century health pub- licists: a partnership based on mutual respect, clear understanding, and faithful execution. In that scenario, both as it originally evolved and in its updated version, it is the doctor who directs treatment, but crucial to a successful outcome are the informed and responsible actions of the patients, other caregivers, and the patient’s family and friends. In 1978 the John Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine was formed in Seattle, Washington, by Joseph E. Pizzorno, ND (found- ing president), Lester E. Griffith, ND, and William Mitchell, ND (all graduates of the National College of Naturopathic Medicine), and Sheila Quinn, who felt that it was necessary to have more institutions devoted to naturopathic care and the teaching of naturopathic thera- peutics. To differentiate Bastyr from the other “irregular”45 schools, Pizzorno coined the term science-based natural medicine and developed the curriculum to implement it. Bastyr’s cofounder and first president, Joseph Pizzorno, recognized that “anecdotal and unverified ‘cures’, particularly when associated with unusual therapies do our cause little good.” Consequently, instruction at the school “concentrated more on the scientifically verifiable aspects of natural medicine and less on the relatively anecdotal nature cure aspects.”21 In Other Healers, Unorthodox Medicine in America,47 a volume writ- ten to provide “a scholarly perspective on unorthodox movements and practices that have arisen in the United States” (from the editor’s pref- ace), author Martin Kauffman, a modern expert in homeopathy from the Department of History at Westfield State College, detailed Bastyr’s homeopathic requirements to graduate: In 1978, three naturopathic practitioners in Seattle founded the John Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine. During the sixth quarter all students at that school are required to take 44 hours of course work in homeopathy, after which they may elect another 66 hours and up to 238 hours of clinical homeopathic instruction. The significance of the naturopathic schools to the resurgence of homeopathy is demonstrated by the fact that “about one third of the graduating class specialized in homeopathic practice, a total of about 50 each year in all.”47 During the late 1970s, other naturopathic doctors also recognized the need to establish educational institutions for students of naturo- pathic medicine; subsequent efforts included colleges in Arizona (the Arizona College of Naturopathic Medicine), Oregon (the American College of Naturopathic Medicine), and California (the Pacific College of Naturopathic Medicine). Unfortunately, none of these three survived. As public demand for natural healing grew in the 1980s and 1990s, the emerging profession continued to grow a breadth and quality of educational opportunity for those seeking accredited doctorate-level programs in naturopathic medicine. With thriving enrollments at Bastyr and National College, the Council on Naturopathic Medicine was founded in 1978 to establish and oversee educational standards, and today it is recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education as the national accrediting agency for pro- grams leading to the doctor of naturopathic medicine (ND or NMD) or doctor of naturopathy (ND) degree. To further build on the cor- nerstone of accredited education and ensure educational quality, in 1986 the Naturopathic Physician Licensing Examination became the first national board examination for graduates; today, graduates must pass a two-part medical examination in biomedical and clinical sci- ences before they are eligible to use the title “ND.” This examination is modeled after the conventional medical board examination for allopathic graduates, the U.S. Medical Licensing Exam, which assigns the “MD” license. This training was described in detail in a report

## 46SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

from 2001 by the University of California San Francisco Center for Health Professions: “Naturopathic physicians are typically trained in a wide array of alternative therapies including herbology, homeopa- thy, massage, hydrotherapy, physical medicine, behavioral medicine, Traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, acupuncture, and nutrition therapy, as well as clinical practices such as minor surgery, pharmacology and obstetrics.”48 With educational standards set, throughout the 1990s and 2000s, a select group of new programs and institutions attained accreditation status with the Council on Naturopathic Medicine: Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine and Health Sciences, Tempe, Arizona; the College of Naturopathic Medicine at the University of Bridgeport, Connecticut; the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine, Toronto, Ontario; and, in 2011, the Boucher Institute of Naturopathic Medicine, British Columbia, Canada. The establishment of multiple geographic locations for this type of education paves a solid future for the profession, providing hundreds of newly graduated naturopathic doctors every year in the United States and Canada. There are favorable commentaries on the current state of naturo- pathic medicine. Other Healers, Unorthodox Medicine in America47 is a volume written to provide “a scholarly perspective on unorthodox movements and practices that have arisen in the United States.” As described in the Encyclopedia of Alternative Health Care by Olsen49: While naturopathic medicine is now legal (in several states), many naturopaths practicing in other states are old-timers, practicing under their original “drugless therapy” licenses, issued before laws prohibiting new naturopathic practices went into effect. In cooperation with regional associations, the AANP has won licensure and scope-of-practice protection at a steady rate on par with the growth of schools accredited by the Association of Accredited Naturopathic Medical Colleges. As of 2011, 15 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, five Canadian provinces, and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands regulate the naturopathic pro- fession (Box 3.1). Baer’s interest in the evolution of chiropractic as a philosophy of healing led him to Wardwell’s work and to Wardwell’s earlier scholar- ship, which had been tied to the mixer orientation within chiroprac- tic. Baer took note of his descriptions of naturopathy as a near-extinct philosophy. Predictions of extinction were consistent among the assessments of social scientists in the 1970s and continued into the mid-1980s. Twaddle and Hessler, Rosengren, Whorton, and most notably, Wardwell all discussed naturopathy as a once-observable but marginalized philosophy of health and healing at odds with the con- ventional medical claims of a scientific medicine (see Bibliography). These social scientists placed naturopathy’s demise sometime in the 1950s when chiropractic severed its open naturopathic link by termi- nating ND programs. Baer, before Wardwell, took special note of Bastyr and the profes- sionalization represented by its scientific medicine–based curriculum and the publication of a John Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine project, The Textbook of Natural Medicine. In his 1992 Medical Anthropology article43 “The Potential Rejuvena- tion of American Naturopathy as a Consequence of the Holistic Health Movement,” Baer detailed his own view of Naturopathy’s “three stages of development” noted at the outset of this chapter. Besides relying on material covered in the original chapter of “The History of Naturopathic Medicine,” which first appeared in 1985, Baer covered much of the new material regarding the emerging (1900–1930s) and declining (1940– 1970s) stages of naturopathy. Baer particularly broke new ground with his recognition of a “potential rejuvenation” of naturopathy as naturopathic medicine and his recognition that the profession had knowingly or unknowingly adopted a recognized survival strategy as a matter of organizational policy: professionalization. Baer also advanced a theory regarding the “potential rejuvenation” as tied to the emergence in the 1970s of holistic medicine. Holistic medicine, as a philosophy of healing, had a cultural affinity with the eclecticism inherent in naturopathic philos- ophy. In his 2001 book50 Biomedicine and Alternative Healing Systems in America, Baer updated this view of the status of naturopathic medi- cine in a chapter entitled “Naturopathy and Acupuncture as Secondary Professionalized Heterodox Medical Systems.” With the passage of the additional 10 years, Baer observed50: Unlike chiropractic, which no longer poses a serious threat to biomedicine because of its status as a specialty emphasizing spi- nal manipulation, a rejuvenated naturopathy finds itself in direct competition with biomedicine because both systems claim to pro- vide a comprehensive approach to health care. As osteopathy and chiropractic did earlier, naturopathy … [is] increasingly incorporating the theory and social organization of biomedicine. [N]aturopathy with [its] reductionist philosophy and [its] focus on individual responsibility for healthy living may well undergo further growth in an era of growing health costs.

# THE 21ST CENTURY AWAITS

Baer carried his examination of the sociopolitical aspects forward in his 2001 article “The Sociopolitical Status of U.S. Naturopathy at the Dawn of the 21st Century,”51 which examined the state of natu- ropathic medicine as it prepared to enter the 21st century. Although “professionalized naturopathy has undergone tremendous growth and legitimization since the late 1970s, nevertheless, it finds itself in a tenuous situation at the dawn of the twenty-first century in that its strength is confined primarily to the Far West and New England; it faces increasing competition from the partially professionalized and lay naturopaths; and it faces the danger of being overshadowed by a powerful biomedical system that is increasingly incorporating aspects of holistic health into its own practice.”

## 47CHAPTER 3 The History of Naturopathic Medicine: Origins and Overview

He offered no definitive answers to these questions of natu- ropathic medicine’s future, but he also highlighted areas needing further attention by social scientists: continued exploration of the reasons for naturopathy’s decline and rejuvenation and continued study of the naturopathic profession in recognition of its state of professionalization. In closing, Baer observed: “In sum, while changes in the popu- lar ideas about health and healing unleashed the social forces that enabled professional naturopathy to get back on its feet, those same social forces may overwhelm its core claim to being a unique, natural approach to healing.” Whorton expressed the view that in many respects the transition from the marginalized naturopathy to the professionalized naturo- pathic medicine has now been accomplished.52 He traced his view of this transformation as part of the larger transformation “from alter- native medicine to complementary medicine” on the part of osteopa- thy, chiropractic, and naturopathy. Whorton described the factors that allowed this transformation even after the death of Lust in 1945: the issue of the “field’s lack of a scientific basis” was determined internally when the “died-in-the-wool believers in ‘nature cure’” were outlasted by the “liberal practitioners belonging to the so-called western group, naturopaths concentrated in the western states who recognized the validity of mainstream medicine’s scientific foundation and sought to incorporate biomedical science into their own system and apply it under the guidelines of naturopathic philosophy.” As Whorton noted, “a key figure among the pseudomedicals was John Bastyr—a practitioner in Seattle since the 1930s, and particularly well- known for his advocacy of natural childbirth.” Bastyr, Whorton noted, “recognized the necessity of naturopathy staying abreast of advances in biomedical science and applying those advances ‘in ways consistent with naturopathic principles.’”21 Bastyr was directly involved with the forma- tion and maintenance of the NCNM during the years of naturopathy’s decline and lived to see much of “the short history of John Bastyr College [of Naturopathic Medicine] ... the most compelling illustration of the triumphant rebirth of naturopathy as naturopathic medicine.”21 Bastyr has been called the “father of modern naturopathic medi- cine” by Pizzorno, ND,52 the moving spirit behind the professional- ization of naturopathic medicine and the founding president of Bastyr University. No individual has carried the practice of NDs in the United States in the way that Lust did, but Bastyr and the others profiled by Kirchfeld and Boyle in Nature Doctors kept naturopathy alive during its decline in the 1950s and 1960s so that it could, in time, reemerge. The movement continues to grow, and thus the effect of natural healing has come full circle. In an era where the statistical number of persons born who are expected to contract cancer, now recognized as a degenerative disease, has increased rather than declined and where the incidence of other degenerative diseases (arthritis, arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, etc.) has increased in direct relation to the lengthen- ing of life expectancies produced by improved sanitation and nutri- tion (although speciously claimed by AMA medicine to be the result of their therapies), the early teachings of Lust, Lindlahr, and others appear to have more validity than ever.

## 49CHAPTER 4 The History of Naturopathic Medicine

This work is greatly indebted to the “shoe leather” of Eric Blake, ND, of Portland, Oregon (and to Mitchell Stargrove, ND, also of the Portland area, who introduced this author to Eric’s work). Eric had spent many hours about 15 years ago researching the stacks of material in the NUNM “rare book” room with an eye to what Benedict Lust either did not tell us or any off-track items that were buried in Lust’s publications. This led to many hours of conversation and correspondence between this author and Eric that led down the path of a new historical synthesis. Second, the John Bastyr archives at Bastyr University then opened up material that Dr. Bastyr had saved from this era that had been in boxes, unexplored. Chief among these was a collection (not complete) of the publications of the Western American Naturopathic Association (ANA)/American Naturopathic Physicians and Surgeons Association/ American Association of Naturopathic Physicians from 1947 to 1954. Dr. Bastyr was a protégé of Dr. Robert V. Carroll Sr., who had brought Bastyr into the world and practice of naturopathy, as these records documented. (Thanks are owed to the staff of the library at Bastyr University, especially Jane Saxton and Linda Tally.) Third is the archive materials at the W.A. Budden Library of the University of Western States (UWS) in Portland, Oregon. The UWS is the modern successor to Dr. Budden’s Western States College where Dr. Budden was president from 1929 to 1954. What was not already digitized and accessible on the UWS website was scanned and made available to this author by the archive librarian, Katie Lockwood. She also deserves a large credit for advancing this historical work product. Fourth is two resources on the history of the UWS and of chiropractic: the history of the UWS by Lester Lamm, DC, and the history of chiroprac- tic education by Keating, Rehm, and Callender, which includes the detailed minutes of the Council on Education of National Chiropractic Association, within which Dr. Budden participated, operated, and influenced.1 Fifth, and finally, a massive amount of newspaper archive material has been digitized and made available. Coupled with search-engine capacities, a completely buried panorama of natural healing history has gone through a supernova process. Armed with these voluminous materials, the questions “Who were the naturopaths?” and “What hap- pened to them?” can at last start to be answered.

## Editors’ Note: This is the second of two chapters documenting the ori-

gins and evolution of naturopathic medicine. Although these were written to stand alone, a full understanding requires reading both chapters.

# PART ONE: WHO WERE THE NATUROPATHS?

Natural healing advanced a science-based alternative to the American med- ical profession of the 20th century; this alternative philosophy started first as naturopathy as promulgated by Benedict Lust, and then its concepts and practice evolved into naturopathic medicine primarily through the work of three early pioneers: Henry Lindlahr, William C. Schulze, and Walter B. Cannon, all medical doctors disenchanted by conventional medicine mov- ing in what they considered the wrong direction. By the early 1950s, natural healing—an alternative to conventional medicine practiced by chiroprac- tors and naturopaths—reached its peak. Practitioners were spread across the United States, and their common philosophy was based on a belief in the vital force—the inherent healing power within all of us. The leader- ship of W.A. Budden and Robert V. Carroll was critical to the professional growth of natural healing from the mid-1930s to the early 1950s. They led a professionalization movement within natural healing that brought these practitioners to the peak that was reached in the post-WWII United States.

# IN THE BEGINNING

In the early 20th century there was medicine as practiced by medical doc- tors (“MDs”) and as represented in the United States by the American Medical Association (AMA). The AMA became, over the first 75 years of the 20th century, one of the most powerful political interest groups in US history and became known as “organized medicine.”2 There were alternatives that emerged early in the 20th century, pri- marily in the form of chiropractic, naturopathy, and other “drugless’ schools of healing as well as in the work of MDs who diverged from the AMA’s concept of “scientific medicine.” Scientific medicine was based on Louis Pasteur’s “germ theory.”

## Germ Theory and Conventional Medicine

At the turn of the 20th century, as Howard Berliner (1985) has doc- umented, straight germ theory (germ x causes disease y) became established as the core concept of “scientific medicine” in American allopathic medical education. At the time, the major rivalry in American medicine was between allopaths (about 60% of medical practitioners) and homeopaths (about 30%, the balance being Eclectics and physio-medicalists). Once the substantial resources of the Rockefeller philanthropies were put behind scientific medical education based on germ theory— with the full consent of the AMA—American medicine became syn- onymous with the germ theory. This, the Flexner Report (1910), and medical research devoted to finding pharmaceuticals to defeat germs to “cure” disease were all funded by Rockefeller philanthropies and led to what is considered to be the dominant paradigm in American medicine.3 As Berliner documents, this was largely the result of a determination to put the Rockefeller philanthropic resources behind this concept of “scien- tific medicine” not, at the time, any clear clinical superiority on the part of the allopathic philosophy. As of the period in which this took place, largely 1900 to 1920, there was no clinical validation for scientific medicine in terms of the discovery of specific pharmaceuticals of demonstrated efficacy.

## Be’champ, Bernard, and the Alternatives to Germ Theory

The concept of an alternative to the germ theory of disease traces to two French contemporaries of Louis Pasteur: Augustine Be’champ and Claude Bernard. Pasteur’s work asserting microbes as the cause of disease has been well documented and lauded and does not need to be reproduced here. Be’champ’s theory was, put as simply as possible in the biological sense, that “germs” are always present in our environment and do not “cause” disease. Disease is related, rather, to the physiology of the host, the human (or mammalian) body, not to the germs per se. What we observe in microbiology relative to disease is the resultant by-product of the body’s failed attempt to reject a pathogenic microbe, a function that a healthy body’s autoimmune system should accomplish.4 Bernard’s work in physiology was much celebrated in the 19th cen- tury. As noted by Charles Gross (1998): “Today the fame of Claude Bernard rests primarily (if not entirely) on his idea that the mainte- nance of the stability of the internal environment (milieu interieur) is a prerequisite for the development of a complex nervous system.” But as noted by Gross and others, although Bernard advanced this idea between 1854 and his death in 1874, it “had no impact for over 50 years after its formulation.” Why did this “insight that the ‘constancy of the internal environment is the condition for the free life’ (have) no signif- icance (indeed no meaning) for biologists for more than 50 years?” One major reason was that “Pasteur’s new bacteriology and its omnipresent, omnipotent germs, were dominating the biomedical Zeitgeist.”5

## The Early Integrators

In the pre-WWII years, the work of three MDs that diverged from germ-theory orthodoxy became central to the emergence of integra- tive medicine. These three MDs are Henry Lindlahr, William Charles Schulze, and Walter B. Cannon.

## Henry Lindlahr and Integration in Clinical Practice

The standard biography of Lindlahr is that of Kirchfeld and Boyle in Nature Doctors.6 His own therapeutic philosophy is set out in his four-volume work Natural Therapeutics, published in 1923 and repub- lished in 1975 as edited by Jocelyn Proby, DO.7 The four volumes are Philosophy, Practice, Dietetics, and Iridiagnosis. Lindlahr started his own school in Chicago in 1914 and built a substantial sanitarium, clinic, and college operation as well.8 A central tenet of Lindlahr’s work, in spite of his medical training, was that the allopathic approach to healing was wrong. There were, he said, “two principal methods of treating disease. One is the combative, the other the preventive… The slogan of modern medical science is, ‘Kill the germ and cure the disease’… The combative method fights disease with disease, poison with poison, and germs with germs.”9 On the other hand, “The preventive method does not wait until dis- ease is fully developed and gained ascendancy in the body, but concen- trates its best endeavors on preventing, by hygienic living and natural methods of treatment, the development of disease.”10 In Philosophy, he states: “It is the intent of this volume to warn against the exploitation of destructive combative methods to the neglect of pre- ventive constructive and conservative methods. If these teachings con- tribute something toward this end they will have fulfilled their mission.” His work is consistent with Walter Cannon’s physiological insights, and a decade before Cannon’s Wisdom of the Body was published, he wrote in Philosophy: The diet expert, the hydrotherapist, the physical culturist, the adjuster of the spine, the mental healer and the Christian Scientist, pay little attention to the pathological conditions or the symptoms of disease. Each of these, in accordance with his theory of disease and cure, regulates the diet and habits of living on a natural basis, promotes elimination, teaches correct breathing and wholesome exercise, corrects the mechanical lesions of the body, or establishes the right mental and emotional attitude, and, in so far as he suc- ceeds in doing this, builds health and so diminishes the possibility of disease. The successful doctor of the future will have to fall in line with the procession and do more teaching than prescribing.11 Lindlahr strongly advocated for Be’champ’s theories, especially in his Philosophy volume. He had discovered Be’champ’s work, he said, through the earliest work of Ethel Douglas Hume.12 Specifically, Lindlahr noted that he had then “made a careful study of [Be’champ’s] last work, entitled The Blood, in which he summarizes the mycrozymian theory of cell life.” From this study, Lindlahr found “a rational, scientific explanation of the origin, growth and life activities of germs and of the normal living cells of vegetable, animal and human bodies.”13 At two points in Philosophy, Lindlahr discusses at length the understanding of Be’champ’s work that he has gained from his own intense study of Be’champ’s writings and how from his own clinical observations and experience, and from Be’champ’s work, he comes to advance three primary manifestations of disease. These manifestations of disease are (1) lowered vitality (vitality is the body’s strength of positive resistance and recuperative power, the “vital force” of cellular function); (2) abnormal composition of blood and lymph; and (3) accumulation of waste, morbid matter, and poisons in the system.14

## William Charles Schulze and Integration in Medical

## Education

Schulze was an MD (of Rush Medical College) who, in 1914, purchased the National School of Chiropractic and broadened its curriculum to include the basic sciences as well as “physiological therapeutics” and mech- ano-therapy.15 The name was changed in 1920 to the National College of Chiropractic (NCC). His most enduring influence may have come from acquiring and merging Lindlahr’s school after Lindlahr’s untimely passing in 1924 and in his mentoring influences on W.A. (Alfred) Budden, DC, ND, of Portland’s Western States College and, later on, Joseph Janse, DC, ND, the postwar president of National College (1945–1983).16 As Keating and Rehm noted about Schulze: Part of the Schulze legacy is the tradition of broad-scope, “ratio- nal chiropractic,” or what Palmer called “mixing.” As an MD, Schulze had been trained in medical and presumably some minor surgical procedures, but he had apparently committed himself to “drugless healing” early in his career. However, drugless healing, which involved a variety of naturopathic methods, was anathema to the Palmer branch of the profession. The physician-chiropractor would quickly run afoul of the adiagnostic, nontherapeutic, sub- luxation-only forces in the profession.17 Schulze sought “to promote a professionalism among students and doctors which could rival that of medical competitors,” and under Schulze, the NCC introduced laboratory courses in pathology, biochem- istry, bacteriology, and toxicology, together with a “strong commitment to diagnostic training,” all in response to the adoption in the late 1920s of the Basic Science Law. The NCC adopted the motto “four ways to beat the basic science law”: (1) Study basic science. (2) Study basic science. (3) Study basic science. (4) Study basic science. Schulze came under much criticism from the “straights” in chiropractic, and this only increased after he purchased the Lindlahr School of Natural Therapeutics from Henry Lindlahr’s estate and transferred “the entire student body and the better part of the faculty” to the NCC.18 In 1928 this part of the National school was formed into the National College of Drugless Physicians, which was National’s ND degree program. The National College of Chiropractic Journal became a voice that extended beyond the NCC itself by the early 1920s, becoming a pro- fessional voice as well, challenging B.J. Palmer’s “straight” chiroprac- tic philosophy as well as the antagonism of Morris Fishbein, MD, the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). This voice was first found under the NCC secretary, A.J. Forster, MD, DC, and then “under the editorship of William Alfred Budden, DC, ND, an English immigrant and former economics instructor at the University of Alberta who graduated from the NCC in 1923.”19 From the mid-1920s, Schulze was involved more in the professional activities than in the day-to-day operations of the NCC, and always in the “mixer” camp—first in the American Chiropractic Association (ACA) and then starting in 1930 in the successor National Chiropractic (NCA). Schulze then followed a busy, nationwide speaking schedule in the early 1930s, advocating consistently for the broad-scope profes- sional values of the NCA as taught at the NCC/NCDP. At the annual meeting of the NCA (May 1934), Schulze—a regular speaker at these annual meetings—noted in his speech that at the time, “har- mony among Chiropractors and Drugless practitioners, especially the Naturopaths, was good to look upon.”20 In 1934 Dr. Schulze joined a convention tour coined “the Northwest Circuit” organized by C.O. Watkins, DC, of Montana that had its speakers speak at NCA-affiliated conventions held in Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana, Washington, British Columbia, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. The Washington stop was for the meeting of the Northwest Chiropractors Association and was a gathering of attendees from Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Northern California, and British Columbia in September.21 The last full year that Dr. Schulze was actively engaged was 1934; he was in ill health for much of 1935 and passed away in September 1936. When he passed away, one of the very many appreciation letters hon- oring his productive life was sent by Dr. Robert Carrol as the president of the Washington State Naturopathic Association, saying, “The entire drugless profession has lost a friend and teacher.”22 In 2002 Rehm and Keating noted as Dr. Schulze’s great accom- plishment, “Schulze created an intellectual environment that would be

rivalled in the middle age of the profession only at Budden’s Western States College.”23

## Walter B. Cannon and Integration in Medical Research

Cannon did extensive research in physiology, his area of teaching at Harvard. He concurred with Bernard’s concept of the “internal environment” of the human body and coined the term homeostasis to describe the body’s need to respond physiologically to the exter- nal environment to maintain a stable internal environment, which he described as a primary function of the central nervous system.24 His concept was that through what he called the “wisdom of the body,” mammalian forms such as the human body “may be confronted by dangerous conditions in the outer world and by equally dangerous pos- sibilities within the body, and yet continue to live and carry their func- tions with relatively little disturbance,” something that Hippocrates had called vis medicatrix naturae. In a distinctive passage in The Wisdom of the Body, Cannon set forth a concept that became central to the postwar chiropractor-naturopaths: The fathers of medicine made use of an expression, “the healing forces of nature,” the vis medicatrix naturae. It indicates, of course, recognition of the fact that processes of repair after injury, and of restoration to health after disease, go on quite independent of any treatment that the physician may give … In the first place, the well-trained physician is acquainted with the possibilities and limitations of self-regulation and self-repair in the body. He is instructed in that knowledge and employs it not only for his own intelligent action but also as a means of encour- agement for the patient who looks to him for counsel … Again, the physician realizes better than the layman that many of the remarkable capacities of the organism for self-ad- justment require time—all of the processes of repair belong in that class—and that they can play an important role in restoring the organism to efficiency only if they are given the chance that time provides … Furthermore the physician realizes that he has at his com- mand therapeutic with which he can support or replace the phys- iological self-righting or self-protective processes we have been considering … Finally a great service which the physician renders is the bringing of hope and good cheer to his patients. He has seen at work in many cases the restorative processes of the organism … When we are afflicted and our bodily resources seem low, we should think of these powers of pro- tection and healing which are ready to work for the bodily welfare.25 Lindlahr was the greatest direct influence on the post-WWII phi- losophy of natural therapeutics, the central core of “drugless” or “non- medical” philosophy. Lindlahr’s and Cannon’s work have a remarkable consistency between them, although Lindlahr was largely influenced by Be’champ and Cannon by Bernard. Together they advanced the work of these two 19th-century French scientists into the 20th century, and in doing so, they advanced a scientific basis for an “alternative” to the germ theory that was at the core of conventional “scientific medicine.” Schulze pioneered the education of physicians in a professional “drug- less” therapeutics consistent with the theoretical work of Lindlahr and Cannon.

# THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY

The shaping of America’s modern healthcare landscape began in what historians call the Progressive Era—roughly 1900 through the end of World War II in 1919. At the turn of the 20th century, the AMA had begun the elevation of allopaths over homeopaths and Eclectic physicians—all MDs—and had completed this process by the end of the Progressive Era, aided by the 1910 Flexner Report and the efforts of the Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations (see previous discussion). By the early 1920s, what had become the AMA’s monopoly structure within the medical profession was in place.26

<!-- chunk -->

## Drugless Healing

But as homeopaths and eclectics disappeared, a wide range of prac- titioners known as “drugless healers” emerged. In this period the licensing structure that became a critical part of the AMA’s monop- oly structure had not been fully adopted across the United States, and these drugless healers, probably several thousand of them, were to be found in practice. The practitioners of manipulation modalities— including osteopaths and chiropractors, but others as well, such as mechanotherapists and naprapaths—were “drugless.” So were myr- iad others, including practitioners of neuropathy, physcultopathy (physical culture), sanipractic, food science, suggestive therapeutics, and Swedish movement. Some of these drugless healing practitioners were specifically regional; naprapaths were almost exclusively found in Illinois, where D.J. Palmer protégé Simon Oakley had founded his school, and sanipractors were originally exclusive to the state of Washington before advancing their presence into British Columbia in Canada.27

## Benedict Lust

In 1902 Lust originated his use of the term naturopathy and began his development of a theory and philosophy of health and healing “to describe the eclectic compilation of doctrines of natural healing that he envisioned was to be the future of natural medicine.” Lust launched his career as the progenitor of naturopathy, adopting that name for his eclectic brand of natural therapeutics and placing the term natu- ropath firmly in the title of his monthly publications, which continued under his status as editor and publisher until his death in 1945.28 One of the anomalies of Lust’s work was that for at least 30 years, there was no firm definition of naturopathy; rather, Lust clearly attempted to incorporate all methods of “drugless healing” and “natural thera- peutics” into his philosophy of naturopathy. This included the original concept of osteopathy devised by Dr. Still and chiropractic as devised by D.D. Palmer. In Lust’s view, these were all pieces of naturopathy, linked together by not being “allopathic medicine.”29 This “drugless” label could only incorporate Still’s osteopathy in its original form, which did not incorporate a materia medica, as described, for instance, in Charles Hazzard’s Principles of Osteopathy (3rd edition, 1899).30 Where chiropractic was concerned, Lust’s natu- ropathy became clearly allied with the “mixer” philosophy, and both Lust and the mixers were in conflict at the time with the “straights” led by B.J. Palmer.31

## Naturopathy and Chiropractic

Precisely when chiropractic and naturopathy first became melded into a symbiotic relationship is historically murky. D.D. Palmer did not—at least as historically reported—practice or teach naturopathy or openly associate himself with it. His son, B.J., was adamantly opposed to any- thing that would dilute the purity of “straight” chiropractic. Benedict Lust, the historical progenitor of naturopathy in America, taught and endorsed chiropractic very early in the 20th century, but it was Solon Langworthy, an early student of D.D.’s, who opened the second identi- fiable school of chiropractic in 1903 and based its curriculum on mix- ing nature cure with chiropractic. Palmer was the originator of chiropractic, of course, but he adopted a kind of “Johnny Appleseed” approach to his spinal manipulation insights, “planting” the concept of chiropractic adjustment more than

anything else. He was traveling constantly after 1902 and granting the right to practice and to educate others in his methods to recipients of his written “diplomas.” It was B.J. Palmer, the son, who adopted a proprietary interest in chiropractic after his graduation from D.D.’s instruction in 1902, much as Lust did in naturopathy. Both chiropractic and naturopathy could best be described as social movements in the field of health and healing in their first two decades of evolution. It was not until the 1920s that others began to work at the professionalization of chiropractic and naturopathy, and many of the most influential of these who became connected with naturopathy were chiropractic “mixers,” becoming known in time as the chiropractor-naturopaths or “DC, NDs.”

## Nature Cure and the Vital Force

Benedict Lust’s vision of drugless healing, although it continued to “expand,” as noted by Susan Cayleff, was always intended to be con- sistent with Germanic 19th-century “nature cure.” As noted by Henry Lindlahr is his 1915 book Nature Cure, the original concepts were cred- ited to Vincent Preissnitz.32 As noted by Lindlahr, nature cure became “the idea of drugless healing [which] spread over Germany and over the civilized world.”33 Citing Lindlahr, Susan Cayleff summarized American nature cure’s idea of human sickness this way: Henry Lindlahr, MD, a leader in naturopathic philosophy, explained the five specific conditions that caused disease; lowered vitality; abnormal composition of blood and lymph, resulting mainly from wrong eating and drinking; accumulation of waste, producing morbid matter and poison in one’s system; mechanical lesions, that is pressure, tension or strain on nerves and nerve cen- ters caused by luxations (dislocations) of bony structures or strain- ing of muscles and ligaments; and discordant or destructive mental and emotional attitude. These conditions more or less remained the core of naturopathy for decades.34 Treatment by means of nature cure theory relied on the body’s own drive to maintain health—to achieve what Walter Cannon later called “homeostasis”—by recognition of what was labeled the “vital force.” The work of F.E. Bilz, a German MD, was very influential in this regard. Bilz first published his synthesis of German nature cure in Germany in 1898, and in 1901 he published Natural Method of Healing: A Complete Guide to Health (translated from the latest German edition) as the English language version of his work.35 Bilz noted: “[I]t is known that we cannot heal a disease with the remedy we apply, but that it is the vital force within us which heals, and that we need but aid it, [and] our position becomes a far easier one.”36 This “vital power,” the “power of healing,” Bilz said, “resides in man himself … divine nature placed it there at the creation of each being.’’ Adopting this concept, Lindlahr noted that all healing must “econo- mize vital force” because it is the vital force that “is the Supreme power and intelligence, acting in and through every atom, molecule and cell in the human body which is the true healer, the vis medicatrix nature which always endeavors to repair, to heal and to restore … ”37

# GENESIS OF POST–WWI PROFESSIONALISM

To understand the DC, NDs and their professionalization requires going beyond the career of Benedict Lust and the natural living and healing movement that he founded. It also requires more historical background. The committed professionalization process that followed began in the late 1920s and continued through the first years after WWII. The focus was on moving the educational process and the clinical practice of both naturopathy and chiropractic past the “founder’s grip” of Benedict Lust and B.J. Palmer by means of the creation of stable residential colleges and stable state and national professional organizations. This task was compounded with regard to both of these professions by the committed drive by organized medicine in the United States (primarily in the form of the AMA and its state and local constitu- encies) toward medical dominance. To respond to the determination of medicine to achieve this dominance, a resistance based on the core values of “Americanism” was required, along with personal resilience and tenacity.

## A Short Course in Medical Dominance

Medical dominance is best understood by reference to the book of this same name by Australian sociologist Evan Willis.38 The subject can be supplemented by a very useful work by another sociologist, Saul Rosenthal, A Sociology of Chiropractic.39 These sociologists argue that organized medicine has had as a goal since at least 1900 the achievement of medical dominance in domains: achievement of complete control over its own work (autonomy), achievement of complete control over the work of others in health care (dominion), and achievement of complete control over all matters of public policy within the health domain (medical sovereignty). Willis’s argument is sophisticated and extensive; indeed, his discus- sion of the subject is a book-length treatise. But the short version as it relates to the “exclusion” of “alternative” practices like chiroprac- tic and naturopathy can be summarized. Relying on earlier work by Howard Berliner and others, he demonstrates that medicine’s domi- nance was achieved through the allopathic claiming of the mantle of “science” for its work. This was done through the adoption of the germ theory of disease.40 This, in turn, had two advantages, as Willis argues: first, individual clinical skill became less important than extensive schooling within a laboratory and hospital-based system (“clinical skill” versus “clinical science”), and second, health became an individual scientific problem, not a social, environmental or lifestyle problem.

## The “Great Trade”

In the United States, this manifested itself in the early 20th century as “the Great Trade” described by Fredric Wolinsky: “[B]y 1925, the AMA had gained a monopoly over the production and licensing of physicians. This included the power to determine what the curricu- lum should be, how many students should be admitted, which stu- dents should be admitted, and how many faculty there should be for each student. Thus 1910 marked a trade of importance between society (as represented by state and federal governments) and the AMA. The trade gave the AMA the exclusive right and sole power to regulate the medical profession. In return, the AMA was to give society the best and most efficient medical care system possible. Society has clearly lived up to its part of the bargain … ”41

## American Exceptionalism

“American exceptionalism” or “Americanism” has been analyzed extensively in the book of the same name by Professor Seymour Martin Lipset, one of the most distinguished US academicians. Professor Lipset gives this synopsis of Americanism: “The American Creed can be described in five terms: liberty, egalitarianism, individualism, pop- ulism and laissez-faire.”42 Medical dominance strikes at each of these five values, all in the name of “scientific medicine.” It is based on using the power of the state to enforce the “great trade” as public policy, the antithesis of pop- ulism. It is corporatist, not individualist and laissez-faire. It creates a

favored class of medical professionals over serving egalitarianism, and by the exercise of the power of the state, it constrains the liberty of the patient as a consumer.

## A Time to Build a Profession: The 1930s

The drugless healing concepts of nature cure became, by the 1930s, the philosophical basis for a professional alternative to conventional medicine in the form of the chiropractor-naturopaths, the “DC, NDs.” By the mid-1930s, as Susan Cayleff notes, Benedict Lust came to aban- don “therapeutic inclusivity” and declared that a clear and fixed pro- fessional identity was necessary.43 For some others who had already formed a professional identity and founded schools and colleges, this moment of self-reckoning came not a moment too soon. It was time to bring all of this into focus as a professional identity once and for all.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Move Toward Professionalization

By the 1930s, the concept of “drugless healing” began to change, and significantly. The majority within osteopathy was moving to add mate- ria medica to osteopathic manipulation and prescribing in line with allopathic thinking and the germ theory.44 The majority within chi- ropractic were “mixers,” perhaps 70% of chiropractors.45 And within naturopathy, the amalgamation period of the previous 30 years was giving way to identification as naturopaths and abandonment of other drugless labels.46 In the case of osteopathy, the conflict between the originalists and the modernists played out within the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) in the form of battles over “standards” applicable to the osteopathic colleges. Among chiropractors, two professional associations emerged by the early 1930s, the National Chiropractic Association (NCA), which was the association for the “mixers” within chiropractic, and the B.J. Palmer–led Chiropractic Health Bureau, which in 1941 became the International Chiropractic Association—the organization of the “straights.” From the AMA’s perspective, the “straights” were the most easily labeled as a “healing cult.” The straights stood politically for 18-month schooling directed toward identifying “subluxations” of the spine and resolution by manual spinal adjustment as the treatment for all human ailments. A high school education was considered sufficient as a pre- requisite for a “straight” chiropractic education. The NCA had adopted a 4-year residency education requirement by the end of the 1930s, led by the Metropolitan Chiropractic College, Western States College (WSC or Western States) and the National Chiropractic College. A leader in consistently upgrading educational standards within the NCA was W.A. Budden of Western States. Within naturopathy, the transition in the 1930s was more complex. As pointed out by Susan Cayleff, by 1935 Benedict Lust moved away from considering all drugless healers part of naturopathy, regardless of how they identified themselves. After three decades, he instead declared that all naturopaths needed to identify as such, encourag- ing all remaining drugless healers to openly join the naturopathic movement.47 Kirchfeld and Boyle assert that Lust had gone beyond the establishment and popularization of the American naturopathic movement by the end of the 1920s and “must be credited with four other accomplishments.” These were founding the American School of Naturopathy, founding the ANA, his publications, and “the legal status of naturopathy attained as a result of his efforts,” which they call “the most tangible of his efforts.” They note that “it is difficult to separate the success of Lust’s organizations from that of his publications.”48 By the early 1930s, the success of Lust’s efforts must be deemed “qualified.” A 1927 survey by a committee of the AMA of all “schools of chi- ropractic and naturopathy” found Lust’s combined American School of Chiropractic and American School of Naturopathy to be a night school program operating classes for 3 hours each weeknight for a 4-year, 9-months-per-year course. No catalog was published due to expense, but the school was described in Lust’s monthly publications. The school as of 1927 and forward was not established to function in the era of the Basic Science Law, and moreover, neither chiropractic nor naturopathy was licensed in New York. In 1935 Lust was found guilty of illegally (under New York law) issuing diplomas awarding a “doctor” degree without a lawful state charter. It is true that Lust’s ongoing influence was from his publications and from his continued popularization of naturopathy through his travels and his speeches. Through this popularization, others were able to obtain legal status for naturopaths in several states, but this was largely accomplished by others in the movement. Lust’s own operations were in New York (school and publications), New Jersey (his first Yungborn Sanitarium) and Florida (second Yungborn Sanitarium). Of these states, only Florida granted naturopaths rec- ognized legal status, and this was accomplished by others in the movement. By the 1930s, an alternate vision formed within the ANS and within some of the NCA schools that offered ND degrees in addition to DC degrees. As Lust’s influence declined during WWII and after his passing in 1945, others came forward with a competing vision of the relationship between chiropractic and naturopathy, of naturo- pathic education, and of nonmedical clinical practice. How this came about is a piece of history that has not been well documented before. The story centers on a few men and women, the most prominent of whom are W.A. (Alfred) Budden of Western States College, with its Schools of Chiropractic and Naturopathy, and Robert V. Carroll of the ANA.

## Budden’s Early Career and Arrival in Oregon

W.A. Budden, DC, ND, educated at Schulze’s National College and later a Pacific Northwest (NW) transplant, was a leader in the pro- fessional development movement of drugless physicians. Over time, Budden acquired several staunch allies in this effort. The alliance of DCs and NDs in the Pacific NW began through the efforts of Dr. Budden and took root during the remarkable Oregon ballot campaign of 1934. This alliance continued to grow in the after- math of the ballot fight, as Dr. Budden lived by what he considered to be the lessons of this formative campaign. This ballot campaign of 1934 was Dr. Budden’s brainchild. Budden himself had come west from Chicago to Portland, Oregon, steeped in a “mixer’s” amalgam of core chiropractic, physiotherapy, and Lindlahr’s natural therapeutics. Budden attended Schulze’s National College from 1922 to 1924. Upon graduation as a DC, he joined the faculty and in 1925 succeeded the college’s previous dean and school journal editor.49 It was at this time that National purchased and absorbed Lindlahr’s College of Natural Therapeutics, the premier drugless school of the time. Budden was integrally involved in the integration of the Lindlahr programs into national as the college’s ND degree program. As an edu- cator and administrator at National through the 1920s, Budden also authored a textbook for use at National: Physiotherapy: Technique and Treatment.50 In 1929 Budden moved to Portland, and his career as an educator began in earnest. When Budden arrived in Portland in 1928, he purchased the Pacific Chiropractic College for cash; in 1933 the Pacific College was reincor- porated and renamed the Western States College. Western States’ core mission was “for the purpose of operating a college that would offer

## 54SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

DC and ND degrees together with training nurses and health techni- cians and maintain clinics and hospitals.”51 When he arrived, Budden also networked with both Oregon’s chi- ropractors and naturopaths. Chiropractic had been licensed first in Oregon in 1915; licensure for naturopathy was more recently estab- lished, in 1927.52 He spoke at the Oregon Chiropractic Association’s 22nd Annual Meeting in July of 1929, and then in July of 1930, he spoke at the annual meetings of both the Oregon Chiropractic Association and the Oregon Naturopathic Association. These speaking appear- ances became a tradition carried out many times with each group over the years until his death in 1954.53 Oregon adopted a Basic Science Law in 1933.54 Dr. Budden’s initial view was that the Basic Science Law was the medical profession’s cre- ation intended specifically to blunt the rise of any competition to MDs, specifically that of DOs, DCs, and NDs. But Budden’s first effort was to try to craft a political response to a political problem. As Budden later related the history of this effort, “October, 1933, saw the formulation of a joint legislative committee to manage the drafting of and the campaign for an amendment to the constitution of Oregon regulating the practice of the healing arts.” The Joint Legislative Committee (JLC) was the joint committee of the Oregon Association of Chiropractic Physicians and the Oregon Naturopathic Association, and as Dr. Budden described, it was “composed of an equal number of chiro- practors and naturopaths.”55 The first action of the JLC was to work with legal counsel to draft what became known as the “Healing Arts Amendment,” a proposed amendment to the Oregon Constitution by citizen’s initiative.56 As the news report in The Oregonian, Portland’s and Oregon’s largest news- paper, reported, “petitions for this measure contained approximately 47,000 signatures against the 26,667 required by law. The completed petitions were brought to Salem [Oregon’s capital] by a caravan of automobiles.”57 On Election Day, after an exhaustive 6-month effort, the bal- lot measure went down by a 3-to-1 margin. This attempt to curtail medical dominance in Oregon was, on the surface, not successful. Nonetheless, Dr. Budden, over time, took heart from what he con- sidered to be the “lessons learned” from the campaign.58 Moreover, he gained some considerable respect for his willingness to engage in politics and the tenacity with which he could wage a political cam- paign even with limited resources, and this would be to his advantage over the years.59 These were lessons that he seemed to take to heart and that ani- mated him for the next 20 years of his career as an educator and a consummate professional. From these “lessons learned,” Dr. Budden committed himself to several things. He accepted the basic sciences as a necessary part of a “nonmedical” physician’s education, although he continued to argue that professional examinations were best given to candidates by each profession’s licensing board. He actually, in time, came to view the Oregon examinations as quite fairly conducted, and his students gained a high passing rate as the curriculum focused on these subjects as part of the core education in both chiropractic and naturopathy.60 He continued an extensive public-speaking schedule, regularly appearing through the 1930s, the war years, and in the postwar era before lay audiences like the HEL and the Biochemistry League as well as holding speaking events at Western States and giving weekly radio talks. He continued at all times to commit his WSC programs to pro- vide a sound and thorough education to his students in both the School of Chiropractic and the School of Naturopathy. He worked tirelessly to improve the standards for all similar colleges and took the lead at every turn in increasing the coursework and prerequi- sites required.61 These alliances and friendships were important to the WSC and to professional development in the Pacific NW. Dr. Budden, and his DC, ND allies, built stability into the education and organization of chiro- practic and naturopathy, especially in the western United States and the Pacific NW, but much of their work is forgotten today. One of these alliances will be discussed here as part of Dr. Budden’s efforts to secure strength and stability for both chiropractic and natu- ropathy in the Pacific NW and at WSC: that with Robert Carroll, DO, ND, of Seattle.

## Robert V. Carroll, ND—Leader of NDs in Washington

One of the strongest leaders and professional organizers in his own right was Robert V. Carroll Sr., DO, ND. Dr. Carroll had built the naturopathic profession in Washington. Licensing in Washington was granted under the Drugless Healing Act of 1919. Licenses were actu- ally issued for the practice of sanipractic, a drugless school unique to Washington.62 But Carroll, although his license said “Sanipractic,” was determined to build a distinct identity professionally and allied early with Benedict Lust’s ANA.63 Robert V. Carroll (Sr.) was also educated in Chicago after WW I, graduating from the American College of Osteopathy and the Lindlahr College of Natural Therapeutics (both Lindlahr schools) in 1923. Carroll finished his studies with Lindlahr and his school faculties just a year before Lindlahr’s sudden death from an infection in late March of 1924. Lindlahr’s signature is on Carroll’s Doctor of Natural Therapeutics diploma,64 and Carroll spoke often in later years of hav- ing been a student of Lindlahr himself. Carroll moved west to Washington right after graduation, stopping for a year to practice with his brother, O.G., in Spokane before mov- ing on to Seattle.65 By 1930 he had begun the process of professional organization in Washington, founding the Washington Association of Drugless Physicians and serving as its president for 8 years, with the organization’s name changing to the Washington State Naturopathic Association in 1934.66

## The Beginning of the Budden–Carroll Alliance

The complete origin of Carroll’s association with Dr. Budden and his support for Western States is unclear. Both Drs. Carroll and Budden studied in Chicago at about the same time. Dr. Budden made an alliance with the DCs and NDs in Oregon in the early 1930s and as a leader in the drugless professions in Washington. Dr. Carroll had his own connections with the Oregon NDs. Yet still, any connection that they had before the 1934 Ballot Campaign is not yet documented. But in the immediate aftermath of the campaign, they joined forces, as reported by Benedict Lust. In February 1935, the same month that the Chiropractic Journal published Dr. Budden’s “Medical Propaganda” article detailing B.J. Palmer’s efforts to defeat the Oregon Ballot Campaign, Lust used his “Dr. Lust Speaking” platform in the Naturopath and Herald of Health67 to similarly interfere in professional efforts in the Pacific Northwest (subtitled “Schisms”): Word has come to us of a meeting that was called for Portland, Ore., in December last for the purpose of the “unification and coor- dination of Naturopathy and Chiropractic.” This went out on the letterhead of the Washington Naturopathic Association with head- quarters in Seattle and was signed by the president, Dr. Robert V. Carroll.

## 55CHAPTER 4 The History of Naturopathic Medicine

Another letter from the Western States College of Portland signed by Dr. A. Budden, calls for a meeting to be held in Seattle on Jan- uary 12th to put the “finishing touches” on an organization to be known as the International non-Medical Alliance. Let us say right here and now that we are against any alliance between Naturopaths and Chiropractors. (Naturopath and Herald of Health, February 1935, p. 34) Lust went on to say that alliances with the chiropractors in California and elsewhere had helped chiropractors and hurt naturo- paths and that furthermore, there should only be the ANA to speak for naturopaths and no other associations or groups that purport to represent naturopaths. “We have no fault to find with Dr. Carroll or Dr. Budden. We are however utterly opposed to the formation of other organizations that would usurp the prerogatives and program of the A.N.A. This organi- zation has stood the test of time.”

# NATURAL HEALING AT ITS PEAK

In March 1952 Henry J. Schlichting Jr., ND, appeared before the 42nd annual convention of the Oregon Association of Naturopathic Physicians in Portland, Oregon. At the time, Schlichting was the president of the American Naturopathic Physicians and Surgeons Association (ANPSA).68 Schlichting was quoted as saying that two major national issues facing naturopaths were that alternative schools got no tax support and that naturopaths could not be admitted to tax-supported hospitals. This created “a heavy demand on our profes- sion and the lay public to meet rising … costs.” Schlichting was reported to have told the convention, “Despite these problems the profession ‘is making definite progress on a national scale as evidenced by licensing in over 20 states,’ [and] insur- ance companies are recognizing naturopaths ‘because they are getting satisfactory results.’”69 Although the “licensing in over 20 states” was a generous count, there was no question that at the time Schlichting was speaking, the natural healing alternative was at its peak. Schlichting was from Midlands, Texas, a West Texas city where all major oil companies had a presence in a state where there were almost 500 licensed naturo- paths.70 Specific licensing of naturopathy was in place in 8 states (out of 48); 2 states had naturopaths practicing under drugless licensing, and about a dozen other states had broad, “mixer” licensing of chi- ropractors. In other states, naturopaths were fairly openly practicing without licensing but consistently pursuing legislation. Natural healers were practicing in about 40 of the 48 states.71

## What Is the Vital Force?

What bound this natural healing profession together was a belief in the vital force and a resistance to “suppressive drugs,” those pharma- ceuticals that relieved symptoms without treating the underlying dis- ease state. Between the mid-1930s and the early 1950s—separate from Benedict Lust and his publications—this doctrine of the vital force became central to natural healing in a manner most consistent with Walter Cannon’s concept of homeostasis: Yet, we must ever keep in mind that there is no disease to be cured; there are only sick people to be healed … The physician must support the inherent nature of the patient by whatever means … By supporting the inherent power—the vital force—we re-establish a harmonious functioning of the disordered parts or functions. It is not the physician that cures, but the indwelling vital force that heals. Since it is the vital force that heals, we must seek those methods and do for the patient those things which will best support the nat- ural healing powers of the particular person; we must be careful to do nothing that would interfere with that healing force. If we are not to interfere with the workings of the vital force in its attempt to heal, then we must carry on our practice in confor- mity with … the laws of nature. The mere use of a naturopathic method or modality does not mean you are practicing Naturopathy in conformity with its prin- ciples and philosophy. If such methods are used as a suppressive treatment, the physician is practicing Allopathic and not Naturo- pathic medicine. As naturopathic physicians we must work … in accordance with natural law.

## Credit to Budden and Carroll

The leadership of W. A. Budden and Robert V. Carroll was critical to the professional growth of natural healing from the mid-1930s to the early 1950s. Their alliance had begun formally in late 1934.73 From 1935 forward, Budden was the trailblazer in natural healing education. Robert Carroll became a trailblazer in the professional organization of natural healers, and through a network of common associates, they each supported the work of the other. Budden accepted the basic sciences as a necessary part of a “nonmedical” physician’s education, although he continued to argue that professional examinations were best given to candidates by each profession’s licensing board. He actually, in time, came to view the Oregon examinations as quite fairly conducted, and his students gained a high passing rate as the curriculum focused on these subjects as part of the core education in both chiropractic and naturopathy.74

<!-- chunk -->

## Education

He continued at all times to commit his WSC programs to provide a sound and thorough education to his students in both the School of Chiropractic and the School of Naturopathy. He worked tire- lessly to improve the standards for all similar colleges and took the lead at every turn in increasing the coursework and prerequisites required.75 But it must be understood that Dr. Budden considered chiroprac- tic and naturopathy as complementary, as part of a complete package, and his friends and allies were like-minded; they were “DC, NDs.” Emblematic of this view are two events that took place in the mid-1930s: WSC joined in the school alliance known as the “Affiliated Universities of Natural Healing,” and Dr. Budden recommitted Western States to a broad natural healing, drugless, progressive curriculum. The first of these, the affiliation, was the brainchild of Homer G. Beatty, DC, ND, the president of the University of the Natural Healing Arts (UNHA) in Denver, Colorado. The four schools that were advertised in 1935 as being “affiliated” were Western States and the UNHA, joined by the Metropolitan College of Chiropractic and Physiotherapy of Cleveland, Ohio, and the University of the Healing Arts of Hartford, Connecticut. These schools were affili- ated in recognizing that the goal of “a regular standard, four years of nine months each, course in Chiropractic and allied subjects is warranted by our profession and offered by the … school members of this affiliation.”76

## 56SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

The commitment to curriculum was significant, and WSC was a leader in this area, especially in naturopathy. Western States was, as of 1933, located at 538 S.E. Alder Street, Portland, and remained at this location until late 1939. The WSC Schedule of Classes and Hours, first printed in May 1933 and in use throughout the college’s stay at the S.E. Alder location, set out a curriculum for both the chiropractic and naturopathy programs of 4000 hours of total study over 4 school years, each consisting of 8 months of residential attendance. The school year was September through July of the following year.77 The programs had 2750 hours of common study, starting with the basic sciences, and then “upper-class” requirements of 1250 hours specific to each program. Both courses of study had coursework in physiotherapy, electrotherapy, and hydrotherapy, with the major dif- ferences between the programs being the chiropractic coursework in clinical neurology versus the naturopathy coursework in herbology and biochemistry. In actual practice, students enrolled in the chiropractic program and then added the naturopathy program as provided for in the sched- ule: “After receiving either the D.C. degree or the N.D. degree, the other degree may be secured by an additional 4 months’ work; both degrees cannot be awarded within the regular course.” The graduating class of July 1937 was typical, with seven DC graduates, four of whom also received the ND degree.78 And Dr. Budden was firm in his commitment to a broad natural healing education and a corresponding view of the DC and ND pro- fessions. In 1935 he wrote to the Chiropractic Journal to object to the idea that “coagulation of tonsils and dehydration of hemorrhoids” were construed as surgery and therefore not defensible as part of chi- ropractic. He said, “Western States College stands foursquare behind the members of the profession who are engaged in the practice of electrotherapy as a part of chiropractic.”79 As the Schedule of Classes and Hours noted, under Oregon law, chiropractic was “that system of adjusting with the hand or hands the articulation of the bony frame- work of the human body, and the employment and practice of phys- iotherapy, electrotherapy and hydrotherapy.” As Dr. Budden’s letter went on to say: “There is no reason to back down or retreat from the position we have already established.” And he did not, either in the classroom, in clinical practice, or in any public forum. And finally, he made friendships and alliances deeply within both the chiropractic and naturopathic professions of his day. His chiro- practic contributions and their effects on the DC profession have been written about elsewhere, but his naturopathic contributions and their effects have not been written about, and so some attention to his efforts in naturopathic education and professionalism will be paid here. He is known as a great chiropractic educator, one of the classic “schoolmen,” but he is also remembered “as a great naturopath.”80

## A Profession

When Benedict Lust criticized the alliance formed by Budden and Carroll in late 1934, he was well aware of the Oregon Ballot Campaign and how hard the DC, ND alliance had fought in that 1934 effort. To emphasize the “push” that was necessary in that fight, Budden had addressed the 1934 Oregon Naturopathic Association annual meeting in June on the fight ahead. And through A.R. Hedges, DC, ND, and others in the ND community (which may have included Washington’s Carroll) and to boost interest, the ONA had Lust come out from New York for the meeting.81 Carroll, by all accounts of the events of the next 15 years of activities within the naturopathic profession, was frustrated by Lust’s interfer- ence in the political situation in the Pacific NW. What Lust had said struck at the very philosophy of the WSC with its School of Chiropractic and School of Naturopathy. Over the next 15 years, Carroll did three things: he wrested control of the ANA out of the hands of Lust, the “president for life,” he made it a much more professional organization, and he backed Dr. Budden and Western States at every turn in the process.82 At the 1935 ANA convention in San Diego, Carroll pushed through a new constitution and supporting bylaws modeled on those perfected by the AMA. The state associations would have House of Delegates members based on the membership size of each state. The Board of Directors and Officers would be elected annually, and the Board would conduct much of the business of the ANA, primarily through its Executive Committee. Lust was elected again as president, but the “president-for-life” status was effectively rescinded.83 From this point forward, there were more voices within the ANA. Gradually, Robert Carroll took control of the reins of the naturo- pathic profession. The final split from the personal grip of Benedict Lust occurred in 1942. The annual convention of the ANA was sched- uled for June 1942 in Chicago. The news of this location for the annual meeting had been released at the 1941 annual convention in St. Louis and continually publicized since November of that year.84 By the spring of 1942, Lust came to realize that he was to be challenged for the presidency of the ANA by a group led by Carroll that was seeking a more committed professional development within naturopathy. This group was largely from states that had licensing laws of some kind in place for naturopaths.85 As these naturopaths met in Chicago and elected Frederick Dugdale of Portland, Maine, as their president, Lust and his close associates, Jesse Mercer Gehman of New Jersey and T.M. (Teresa) Schippell of Washington, D.C., hurriedly convened their own meeting in Atlantic City, New Jersey. This meeting of about 70 naturopaths from the east- ern United States, almost entirely from unlicensed states, was declared the convention of “the real ANA.”86 Even though Lust would contest the validity of what he called the “pseudogroup” of “pseudo Naturopaths,” until he passed away in the late summer of 1945—and his eastern followers would continue this even longer—it is clear that Dr. Carroll and the Western group acted within the full authority of the constitution and bylaws of the associa- tion and were in the “right” in this dispute. In any event, as Schippell wrote at the time, the western “insurgents” led by Robert Carroll had been working to “attract many outstanding naturopaths to their ranks, (and bring) in many state organizations to their membership” and had many “well-known practitioners.”87 Carroll assumed the presidency of the western ANA at the July convention and held the office for 3 years, until July 1949.

## The Merging of Efforts

Carroll was a friend of Western States as president of the ANA and afterward as the group’s past president. In many ways, Western States came to have a favored status among schools that were connected with the teaching of naturopathy where Dr. Carroll and the western ANA were concerned. As the western ANA grew in stature, it began to make three goals clear: to unify all naturopaths in one professional organi- zation (which meant unity with the smaller eastern group left after the death of Benedict Lust in 1945), to advance the goal of a naturo- pathic profession based in licensed states, and to develop its own clear educational standards. Unity was supposed to take place at the strong and successful Salt Lake City convention in July 1948, during Carroll’s presidency. It did not. But professionalism was much advanced by the creation of a strong committee and organizational structure that Carroll ushered in and by the enlistment of quality professionals like Alton C. Johnson, DC, ND, of California—the author of Principles and Practice of Drugless Therapeutics—into the western ANA membership.

And the ANA adopted Budden’s model of a 4-year, 36-month residence course of study as its educational standard, passing a resolution at its July 1949 convention in Houston, Texas, against recognizing any school that (1) offered any of its instruction by cor- respondence; (2) offered diplomas rather than a course of instruc- tion; (3) offered to grant multiple degrees for the same course of instruction; (4) granted any advanced standing or transfer credit that was based on study at schools not recognized by the ANA, the American Osteopathic Association, or the National Chiropractic Association.88 This was done as some of the last business conducted under Carroll’s presidency. In December 1949, the Journal of the American Naturopathic Association first published its list of approved schools, listing three schools that would require basic science credits from an outside institution of higher education and Western States as the only school offering residency education in all 4 years of the required curriculum. Moreover, Carroll strengthened the connections between the Oregon DC, ND community and Western States with the west- ern ANA. Carroll personally quelled unrest among some of the ND community and Western States in the postwar years. He vis- ited a regular meeting of the Oregon Naturopathic Association in December 1947 while ANA president, together with his successor as president of the Washington State Naturopathic Association (Dr. Helena Winters of Kelso, Washington). He then made another visit to the ONA monthly meeting a year later in December 1948. As reported in Oregon Pioneer, unrest began in the fall of 1948 within the ND community around Western States that the school was becoming known more as a chiropractic school, or a school of “chi- ropractic and drugless physicians,” outside of the college. Carroll made the purpose of his 1948 visit as ANA president to express his support for Dr. Budden and Western States as Budden saw fit to operate the college.89 After leaving the presidency in July 1949, Carroll remained active— somewhat more behind the scenes—in matters of the ANA and the Pacific Northwest. The largest issue for the Western ANA for 1950 was the unfinished business of unification with the remaining naturopaths in the eastern group, and for the year between the annual conventions of 1949 and 1950, this was almost all-consuming. Additionally, legal issues arose in Washington State in 1950 regarding the 1919 Drugless Healing Act under which the naturopaths in that state were licensed. These legal issues threatened to do severe damage to the profession’s legal status.90 Unification under the Western group’s national structure was achieved in St. Louis in 1950, although the amalgamation remained messy until the very end. Then, Dr. Robert V. Carroll, a true giant within the naturopathic profession and a friend of Western States College until the end, passed away suddenly in April 1951.91

## Firming Up the Curriculum—Chiropractic and

<!-- chunk -->

## Naturopathy

From the time that Dr. Budden opened the “new” or “converted” Western States College in 1934, the curricula in both the School of Chiropractic and the School of Naturopathy showed his imprint.92 The primary philosophy-of-practice texts were Joy Loban’s Technic and Practice of Chiropractic, a text authored in 1915 by a leading fac- ulty member from the National College program, and in naturopa- thy, Otto Juettner’s A Treatise on Medical Practice (the Art and Science of Non-Medical Therapeutic Methods), a text by a leading Eclectic and physio-medical practitioner. Juettner’s work was first published in 1916 and republished by Benedict Lust’s New York publishing house.93 The other practice texts in use for the 1930s were Goldthwaite’s Body Mechanics and Marlin’s Manipulative Treatment for nonspinal adjustive technique, Grieve’s Modern Herbal for knowledge of herbal remedies, Luke’s Manual of Natural Therapy for hydrotherapy, Kovac’s Electrotherapy and Light Therapy for electrotherapy, Sherman’s Chemistry of Food and Nutrition for dietetics, and Boyd’s Preventive Medicine for hygiene and public health. The eclectic nature of these texts shows Budden’s wide knowledge of the subject areas included in the Western States curricula, but the use of Loban and Juettner’s works also reflects the fact that although the professions had grown signifi- cantly since WWI, the available scholarship had not. This began to change at the end of the 1930s with the publication in 1939 of Homer G. Beatty’s (of the University of the Natural Healing Arts in Denver) Anatomical Adjustive Technique and Alton Johnson’s first edi- tion of The Principles and Practice of Drugless Therapeutics. Also published in 1939 by the National College of Chiropractic was Chiropractic Principles and Technic by Biron, Wells, and Houser of the NCC faculty; this was the first real advancement of the work begun at NCC by Joy Loban in the much earlier days of the profession. And in the late 1930s, John Robinson Verner’s The Logic and Science of Chiropractic first appeared. However, the onset of WWII not only slowed the progress of the colleges, but also the rationing of all materials, including paper, made the widespread use of these new works of scholarship problematic. For 1940 to 1941, the 1938 to 1939 WSC catalog simply had the additional date “1940 & 1941” stamped on the cover; no new catalog appears to have been printed until 1944, and no changes were made to the curric- ula for the duration of wartime.94 The 1944 catalog, which was used through 1947, included as new texts added to the curricula those by Beatty (added in anatom- ical adjustment); Biron, Wells, and Houser (added in palpation); and Johnson (1st edition; added in electrotherapy).95 Also, Rational Bacteriology by chiropractic scholars Verner and Weiant was added to the more standard text by Zimmer in bacteriology.

## New Developments in Postwar Scholarship

It was not until the fall term of 1947 that new scholarship began to appear in use at an accelerated pace at Western States. The Logic and Science of Chiropractic by Verner (3rd edition, 1946) was added to the curriculum in chiropractic; in naturopathy, Thomas Lake, DC, ND’s Treatment by Neuropathy and the Encyclopedia of Physical and Manual Therapeutics was added. This latter work was a lengthy treatise pub- lished in 1946 on what was more generally known as mechanotherapy by a chiropractor-naturopath of some substantial reputation based in southeastern Washington State.96

## Dr. Budden on Chiropractic and Naturopathy

The first postwar catalog published was entitled “Bulletin of the Western States College, Announcement of the School of Chiropractic and School of Naturopathy.” The college symbol was now a hand hold- ing a torch with the peroration fiat lux, or “let there be light.” For this first postwar catalog, Dr. Budden penned his own descrip- tions of chiropractic and naturopathy, both as to Pacific NW history and as to philosophy. This material became a constant in WSC’s post- war catalogs into the mid-1950s.97 Prospective students and interested parties were given this intro- duction to the WSC School of Chiropractic: School of Chiropractic, Founded 1908. The history of Chiropractic is largely the history of its schools. This is particularly true in the Northwest, where the energy and vision of the founder brought forth the D.D. Palmer School of Chi- ropractic in Portland, Oregon.

## 58SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

As early as 1908 Dr. Palmer, together with Dr. LaValley, opened the doors of this pioneer institution. Since that day Portland has been the seat of Chiropractic learn- ing in the Northwest. Always an institute devoted to this purpose has stood in the Rose City. The Western States College is therefore the lineal descendant and beneficiary of all that has gone before. It is carrying on the work of the founder as he would have desired it, in this modern manner. Chiropractic literature also found its birthplace in Oregon. The original text, “The Chiropractic Adjuster,” by D.D. Palmer, was published in Portland.” This was the introduction to the School of Naturopathy: School of Naturopathy, Founded The Latins spoke of it as the Vis Medicatrix Naturae—a reme- dial force or impulse. The Germans called it Natur Heiling, the remedial impulse of Nature, the self-recuperative power of the bodily system, independent of medicine. It has been described, also, as the capability of living tissue, ani- mal or vegetable, to remedy and remove disease, or to repair the healing power of nature. United in man with the dynamics of the mind, this matchless force constitutes the basis of naturopathic therapy. To intelligently enlist it in the fight against disease is the whole art of non-medical healing. These two short pieces, authored by Dr. Budden, contain his syn- opses of chiropractic and naturopathy and present the central core of his nonmedical philosophy.

## More Curriculum and Postwar Scholarship

By the fall term of 1949, as the Western States Class of 1953 was entering school, the full flowering of postwar scholarship in both chiropractic and naturopathy was available, and Dr. Budden took advantage of the newest works in crafting his curriculum for each program. Through the course of the college terms from fall to spring 1953 when the class of 1953 was in attendance at WSC, the chiropractic and naturopathy students were educated in two additional new works of nonmedical scholarship: Janse et al., Chiropractic Principles and Technic, 2nd edition, and H. Riley Spitler’s newly published Basic Naturopathy. This latter text was commissioned and published by Carroll’s western ANA with the intention of providing a definitive text in naturopathy. The schol- arship is thorough and sound, and it holds up well today as “cut- ting-edge” work in its time.98 Budden paired Spitler’s text with a classic from the Eclectic–phys- io-medical school of medical philosophy, Clymer’s Nature’s Healing Agents: The Medicines of Nature (2nd edition, 1926) based on an adap- tation of the Thomsonian System. This combination of Verner, Janse, Spitler, and Clymer plus the coursework in dietetics, physical fitness, body mechanics, electrotherapy, physiotherapy, and hydrotherapy demonstrated the clear imprint of Schulze and Lindlahr on Budden’s conception of the nonmedical physician.99 It cannot be overstated that Budden’s students were the broad- scope chiropractors and naturopaths of the postwar era. The WSC stu- dents Budden produced kept these professions alive, especially in the Northwest, for the next 30 years, into the mid-1970s. This postwar era was the zenith of the period when WSC was the pacesetting educational and scholarship beacon in chiropractic and naturopathy. This postwar period was the WSC era when WSC was the intellectual environment that would be rivaled in the middle age of the professions perhaps only at National College.100

## First Connections

Another of the friends and allies Dr. Budden first grew close to pro- fessionally during the 1930s was A.R. Hedges, DC, ND, of Medford, Oregon. Medford is a smaller city about 275 miles due south of Portland, located just north of the Oregon–California state line. In 1930 when Portland’s population was just over 30,000, Medford’s pop- ulation was just over 11,000, and the “greater Medford” population (within a 5-mile radius of the city center) was just under 17,000.101 A.R. Hedges had been practicing as a drugless physician in Medford since 1911. His advertisements for his practice with his wife Louisa for their “chiropractic-naturopathic” offices had appeared in the Medford Mail-Tribune as early as 1913.102 Both A.R. and Louisa appeared in Benedict Lust’s Universal Encyclopedia Directory and Buyer’s Guide— Year Book of Drugless Therapy for 1918–1919 as active drugless healers in Oregon. Whether by coincidence or not, Dr. Hedges did not appear on the statewide Oregon scene as a leader in either chiropractic or naturop- athy until 1929, just as Dr. Budden was arriving on the scene as well. From here on, the professional arc of these two DC, NDs intersected continually. At the June 1929 annual meeting of the Oregon Chiropractic Association (OCA), the forerunner of the OACP, Hedges was named by the OCA president to the convention’s resolutions committee. This is the first time he appears in any news coverage of OCA affairs. It was at this conference that Dr. Budden gave his first of many addresses to the Oregon profession. Although it is not clear that the two first met each other at this meeting, Dr. Budden drove down to Medford in March 1930 for a Saturday evening meeting of the Southern Oregon Branch of the OCA held at Dr. Hedges’s home in Medford. The Southern Oregon Branch was the professional busi- ness section for the southwestern region of the state between annual meetings of the OCA.103 Budden was in the company of the OCA’s president and the sec- retary of the state Board of Examiners, both doctors from Portland. Plans were being made for the next annual meeting, which was to be held in Medford for the first time. The upcoming legislative session and legislative planning were also discussed.104 Dr. Budden would attend meetings of the Southern Oregon Branch many more times over the years. By the next summer, Hedges was named to his first 3-year term on the Oregon Board of Naturopathic Examiners, serving from 1930 to 1933. Over the course of the 1930s, Dr. Budden and Dr. Hedges crossed paths many times during the professional activi- ties of both the OCA/OACP (the progressive “mixer” group of the state) and the naturopaths of Oregon. This was particularly true during the 1934 Ballot Campaign, in which Dr. Hedges actively participated.105 It would be during the war and postwar years that the associa- tion of Drs. Budden, Carroll, and Hedges would have its greatest import for Western States College. But before moving the story forward into the war years, it is necessary to introduce W. Martin Bleything.

## Dr. Wallace Martin Bleything

Dr. Wallace Martin Bleything first appeared on the Oregon scene in 1937 when he was on the speaker’s roster for the 1937 annual meeting of the Oregon Association of Chiropractic Physicians, the successor to the Oregon Chiropractic Association. This was a meeting held at WSC that also featured Dr. Carroll as a speaker, and the 1937 WSC com- mencement was held in conjunction with this event.

## 59CHAPTER 4 The History of Naturopathic Medicine

The subject of Bleything’s speech on this occasion is not known from the news clip available, but at the time, Bleything was work- ing for a research laboratory in Los Angeles. In 1941, just before the United States entered WWII, Bleything appeared as a speaker before an osteopathic postgraduate meeting in Amarillo, Texas, giving a series of talks on endocrinology, a subject for which he was listed as a “nation- ally-known expert.”106 Just after war broke out, he was awarded his Master of Chiropractic degree from the California Chiropractic College of Oakland, California.107

## Hedges and Bleything—the War and After

As America went to war, Hedges’s professional profile continued to rise as a physician who had been in practice for 30 years. In July 1942 he was elected vice president of the Oregon Association of Chiropractic Physicians, and in December of that year he was named once again to the Oregon Board of Naturopathic Examiners to finish a term (through July 1, 1943) for a member of the Board who had passed away.108 In July 1944 he was elected the OACP president at the annual meeting, and he served as president until July 1946. The vice presi- dent elected with him in 1944 was another DC, ND, J. W. Sargent, who had worked with Hedges and Budden going back to the Ballot Campaign if not longer.109 In fact, there was clearly considerable overlap in the 1930s and 1940s between the OACP and the Oregon Naturopathic Association. In 1946 as his successor as OACP president was being elected, Hedges was reappointed to a full 3-year term on the Oregon Board of Naturopathic Examiners.110 In 1949 at the July convention of the ANA in Houston, Hedges was elected second vice president (VP), taking office as Carroll stepped down as president. By November 1949, his hometown Medford news- paper was reporting on his travels across the country in his national position.111 Hedges was now positioned to protect the interests of WSC with the national ANA as well as Carroll, and he continued to do so. Hedges served as second VP of the western ANA for 1 year until July 1950; then, as part of the newly unified ANA, he was elected first VP and twice reelected, serving as first VP from 1950 to 1953. At the 1951 annual meeting, the association had gone through a name change to the American Naturopathic Physicians and Surgeons Association. Hedges wrote the editorial in what was now the Journal of the ANPSA explaining the long story behind the earlier schism, unification, and the reason for the name change.112 He also wrote a series of editorials in the association journal eloquently explaining the difference in core philosophy between the allopaths on one hand and naturopaths and chiropractors on the other; the difference between viewing the physical organism as operating in “conformity with the laws of chemistry” versus the view that the body “is in a vital realm, presided over by a vital force” that maintains life; and the difference between treating symptoms with suppressive means versus “supporting the vital force” to “regain har- monious function” and “to do nothing that would interfere with that healing force.”113 In July 1953 he was elected president, and he was reelected July 1954, serving until mid-1955. This was all capped off for Dr. Hedges when he appeared before the Oregon Naturopathic Association annual meeting in March 1954 as national president.114 Throughout these years, Hedges succeeded Carroll in guarding the interests of the Western States program at both the state and national levels. In the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic dropped its ND degree pro- gram. In 1949 the Metropolitan College of Chiropractic closed. Then in 1950, Homer Beatty of Denver’s University of the Natural Healing Arts suddenly passed away, and the National College of Chiropractic dropped its ND degree program. Through these events, the other legit- imate, 4-year residency programs were lost. As the largest and stron- gest organization of naturopaths, the ANPSA had a vested interest in the existence and success of WSC. That brings matters back to Dr. Budden and WSC as the war ended in 1945. Dr. Wallace Martin Bleything, known most often as W. Martin Bleything or Martin Bleything, appears to have been linked pri- marily to Western States in the postwar era. As the war came to a close, Western States was hanging together but uneasily, as already described. With peace came the wave of returning veterans and a postwar boom of interest fueled by the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, or the “G.I. Bill.” About 2.2 million returning veterans used their G.I. Bill benefits to attend colleges or universities, the classification attained by Western States through the Veteran’s Administration, which certified institutions of higher education.115 As Lester Lamm described the circumstances of Western States in Oregon Pioneer: The shortage of students produced by the Great Depression and made worse by World War II disappeared almost overnight, leav- ing the college with a completely new challenge: what to do with more applicants than the institution could manage. The G.I. Bill filled college and university classrooms across the nation, and the Western States College was the fortunate bene- ficiary of escalating applications and enrollment numbers. The explosion of growth was unanticipated and the college was not pre- pared for the magnitude of the student influx it experienced. The makeup of the student population was also challenging. Students demanded the administration provide them with a higher quality education, in a more appropriate facility.116 The school resolved the facilities space problem in late 1946 by pur- chasing a building on S. E. Alder in Portland, a former lodge building. As A.E. Homewood described it, “this was far from ideal, or a place of beauty, but did offer the necessary space for expansion.”117 Qualified faculty was another matter. The size of the new student population surpassed the method of Dr. Budden doing a lot of instruction sup- plemented by local practitioners. Enter, among others, Dr. Bleything. Bleything had a varied and colorful background, but most relevant to Western States, he had grown up in Portland, then moved to Seattle shortly before World War I. Interrupted by service during the first war, he had studied chemistry and then worked and studied at Grace University Hospital, a homeopathic and drugless physician training program combined with a sanitarium maternity ward run largely by a homeopathic, fully licensed MD. John Bastyr, DC, ND, after whom Bastyr University is named, had interned there, and Dr. Robert Carroll had been on the sanitarium staff, both during the 1930s. Between 1932 and 1942, Bleything had worked at a research laboratory in Los Angeles as a colloidal chemist, as well as graduating from chiropractic college.118 Bleything arrived at WSC in 1947 and joined the faculty in first- and second-year basic sciences and in third- and fourth-year prac- tice courses in chiropractic. He got licensed in Oregon as a DC and became a member of the OACP. Within another year, he got licensed as an ND and joined the ONA. By 1951 he had been recruited by A.R. Hedges to take over as editor of the Journal of the American Naturopathic Association and had become the lead faculty member in instruction in the naturopathy program at Western States (while still continuing with the basic sciences). Again, Western States had connections deep into the national affairs of naturopathy and was the example naturopaths always turned to when the education of NDs was challenged.119

## The Western State College Class of

By 1946 the way was now clear for the Western States programs and the chiropractic and naturopathic professions to establish themselves in peacetime. In the fall quarter of 1949, the Western States class of 1953 entered the college. By the time the class of 1953 graduated, the majority had finished with both DC and ND degrees, and the gradu- ating class of the School of Naturopathy was the largest class of ND degree holders ever at WSC. It was also the largest such class anywhere for another 30 years—until the John Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in Seattle graduated its first full class in 1982. The class of 1953 would make its mark in keeping alive both broad-scope chi- ropractic in Oregon and elsewhere and naturopathy in Oregon, Washington, and the Canadian province of British Columbia for that same 30-year period. In the immediate postwar period, 1946 to 1952, the AMA—or organized medicine—was consolidating its power within the US healthcare system. Medical dominance was present, but as a threat to alternative practitioners, it was not yet at full throttle. This was, look- ing back historically, because of the AMA’s obsession with the threat that organized medicine called “socialized medicine”—a healthcare system controlled by the federal government.120

## The AMA and President Truman

Universal health care—a totally government-funded healthcare sys- tem—was a pronounced political goal of President Harry Truman. The political and public relations machinery of the AMA was almost entirely directed at this “threat” to the “American Way” for all of President Truman’s postwar term in office. While organized medicine was politically preoccupied, chiropractic and naturopathy were able to advance. President Truman left office in January 1953, and by the sum- mer of 1953, the AMA was starting a national campaign to eliminate chiropractors and naturopaths as competitors, but until then, battles were fought on a state-by-state basis.121 As previously discussed, the National Chiropractic Association (NCA)—the chiropractic “mixer” group—was directing its accredited colleges to shut down any of their nonchiropractic degree programs, specifically any ND degree programs. After National Chiropractic College complied in 1950, Dr. Budden was the lone holdout in main- taining a naturopathy program. The push in this direction was led by John Nugent, the “Flexner of Chiropractic.” In meetings of the education council of the NCA, Dr. Budden was merely resistant; behind closed doors, Dr. Budden and Dr. Nugent had loud, if per- sonally respectful, disagreements about this subject. Dr. Budden was unyielding.122 And so the postwar period of 1946 to 1952 was a period of pro- fessional development in natural healing and of advances in clinical science and in serious scholarship. But in DC, ND education, Western States was alone after 1950. This was, at the same time, WSC’s most fruitful period under Dr. Budden fueled by the G.I. Bill—the only pub- lic funding program for DC and ND education until the rise in the 1980s of student loan and Pell Grant funding.

## Enter the Class of

By the fall quarter of 1949, the college had settled into a former lodge building at 4535 S. E. 63rd Street. The curriculum was set as well, and the students were expected to attend straight through for three quar- ters plus summer term in each of the first 3 years of attendance, and two quarters in the fourth year. The schedule started the first week of October and went through the end of July of the following year; the fall, winter, and spring quarters were each 3 months long, and sum- mer term was the month of July. Each regular term was 300 classroom hours of instruction, and summer term was 100 hours, for a total of 1000 hours the first year. This increased to 1160 for the second year, 1260 for the third year, followed by a fall and winter term fourth year of 940 hours. Degree completion for either the chiropractic or naturo- pathic degree came at the end of the spring quarter the fourth year.123 The first 2 years were intense with the basic sciences curriculum (as such programs are today) together with either Introduction to Chiropractic or to Introduction to Naturopathy, followed by Principles of either discipline included in the first 2 years. The students largely lived and breathed this coursework for 4 years, with most of the social activities that the students had being activities like clubs and dances at the college. This class of 1953 was mostly veterans, a bit older, a bit more ready to get to work and on with life, and mostly married. And they were from throughout the country and from British Columbia, Canada. There were eight each from Oregon and Washington; three from California; two each from Missouri, North Dakota, Minnesota, and British Columbia; and one each from Nebraska, Illinois, Michigan, Colorado, Montana, and Ohio. There were five women in the class and two African Americans, one of whom, being from Miami, had come the farthest from home to study at Western States. Emblematic of the initiative of this class of 1953, class members started a monthly news publication entitled The Synergist: Western States College Voice of the Student Body, “published in the interest of UNITY among all interested drugless healing arts.”124 This monthly publication is virtually a journal of this class of 1953, disappearing as a monthly when the class of 1953 graduated and surviving as a bimonthly only for another year or so. But while this class was enrolled at WSC, it was their voice. Another aspect of the quality of WSC and its student body, and the class of 1953, particularly, was its racial integration. Two members of this class that entered in the fall of 1949 were male African American students who graduated with the class of 1953. One of these students came completely across the country, from Miami, Florida. Jackie Robinson “broke the color barrier” in baseball in 1947. President Truman desegregated the American Armed Forces by Executive Order in 1948. The Warren Court did not strike down the segregation con- cept in public education until 1954. The enrollment of these two stu- dents and their integration into the graduating class of 1953 speaks volumes about the progressiveness of Dr. Budden, of WSC, of the stu- dents of the class of 1953, and of the city of Portland in general. The members of the class participated in two designated “fraterni- ties,” Sigma Phi Kappa, a chiropractic fraternity founded in 1912 and chartered at Western States in 1948, and Phi Nu Sigma, a naturopathic fraternity started at Western States modeled on Sigma Phi Kappa. Phi Nu Signa announced in The Synergist for February 1953 that it was starting the process of “expanding its sphere of influence by providing for and inviting practicing Naturopathic Doctors to join its ranks to help promote Naturopathy and naturopathic principle and practice.” This last item seemed to be a parting gift from the leaders of the class of 1953 to the fraternity and also a way to stay involved themselves as new NDs.

## As Reported in The Synergist

The initiative of the class of 1953 becomes clear in looking at its own documentation of itself and of the larger WSC student body in The Synergist. By the time of the class of 1953 commencement ceremonies in March and July of 1953, The Synergist was publishing regular news submitted for publication by both the OACP and the ONA. This pro- vided the student body with a regular source of professional news, and The Synergist became a publication subscribed to by the professions as well.

## 61CHAPTER 4 The History of Naturopathic Medicine

In the postwar era, Western States became a fixture of natural heal- ing under Dr. Budden. The Synergist captured this in documenting the professional activities and meetings that took place at the college and the participation of Dr. Budden, the faculty, and student body in these events. As an example, The Synergist for May 1952 recapped the annual OANP meeting that had been held at WSC in March 1952, at which the featured keynote speaker had been Henry J. Schlichting Jr., ND, national president of the ANPSA.125 The same edition of The Synergist reported the complete program for the annual meeting of the Oregon Association of Chiropractic Physicians to be held at WSC the first week of June that year. Dr. Schlichting, it was reported, had given an open speech to WSC students and staff, to physicians, and to the public, as well as a speech to the convention banquet. The Synergist reported in the column “Naturo-News” authored by Dr. R.A. Rombaugh of Independence, Oregon, that Dr. Schlichting “lauded the pioneers and early educators and complimented Dr. W.A. Budden, Western States College Director on the fine job in building the College to today’s high level of stan- dards.” The schools Dr. Schlichting said, were “the life blood of any profession.” Another initiative of the class of 1953 was an annual WSC picnic. The first reported “WSC Annual Picnic” was to be held Sunday, June 15, 1952, but was postponed a week due to inclement weather. But when it was held on June 22, 1952, as reported in The Synergist for July 1952, it left all attendees and participants “looking forward to the picnic next year.” More impressively, the picnic was attended by both members of the Oregon Association of Naturopathic Physicians and the Washington Association of Naturopathic Physicians, as reported in the Journal of the American Naturopathic Physicians and Surgeons Association (vol. 5, no. 2, June 1952).

## More Professional Matters for Dr. Budden

Three other events of interest occurred during 1953 that affected the class and were noted in The Synergist. First, the Oregon chiropractic scope of practice came under assault again, from the medical profes- sion on one side and the “straight” chiropractic group on the other. A breakfast meeting of the Oregon Joint Legislative Council held Saturday, March 7, 1953, was broadcast on radio and moderated by radio commentator (and future Oregon governor) Tom McCall. The specific subject was pending Senate Bill 134, yet another bill to strip obstetrics and minor surgery from the Oregon chiropractic scope of practice.126 Dr. Budden appeared with another physician from the OACP rep- resenting the Joint Legislative Committee of chiropractors and natu- ropaths. The medical view was provided by representatives of the Multnomah County Medical Association, both of them clinical pro- fessors at the University of Oregon Medical School, one in OB/GYN and one in general surgery. When asked by McCall about the fact that Palmer College did not teach these subjects as “The Fountainhead” of chiropractic, Budden related some of the history of “straights” and “mixers” and told the audience that one major issue was that the Palmer school did not wish to go to the expense of teaching these sub- jects even though it had adopted a 4-year curriculum in 1953. By the following Tuesday, the Oregon Chiropractic Research Association—the Oregon “straight” organization, a group in Oregon about one-fourth the size of the OACP—had issued a strongly worded communique to the radio station that broadcast the discussion and to The Oregonian newspaper. The statement said that the OCRA had nothing to do with the pend- ing legislation and no interest in it, but it took offense at Budden’s char- acterization, noting that Palmer devoted 4485 class hours to “straight” adjustment technique and that Budden “attempted” to teach a laundry list: spinal adjustment, obstetrics, surgery, eye-ear-nose-throat prac- tice, proctology, proctology, removal of tonsils (by electrotherapy), administering anesthetics, use of hypodermics, electrotherapy, hydro- therapy, physiotherapy, “and such” in 4240 class hours.127 In the long run, once again, no legislation was passed, altering the Oregon scope of practice.

## Some Positive Developments

What did pass at the insistence of Dr. Budden and Western States College, and with the support of both professions, was House Bill (NDs) and 272 (DCs) increasing the educational requirements to high school plus 2 years of college credit from an accredited college or uni- versity. This was noted in an approving editorial in The Synergist for February 1953, penned by Appa Anderson. Finally, it was noted in The Synergist for March 1953 that as pres- ident, Dr. A.R. Hedges was bringing the American Naturopathic Physicians and Surgeons Association convention to Portland that summer, in July. The general chairman for the convention was WSC’s Professor W. Martin Bleything.128

## 1953 for the Class of ‘53

The April 1953 issue of The Synergist contained a column by the edi- tor of the O.A.C.P. Journal; this column had by now become a regular presence in The Synergist. The editor was A.C. Johnson, WSC class of 1951. He paid a special tribute to the class of 1953, saying “without reservation, I would like to praise a universally qualified and most ambitious group.” He paid special tribute to those “from this group, (that) have become the working force that has published The Synergist during these past four years,” and closed with: “To the class of '53, and with gratitude to you who have done so much to keep the college, the students, and the profession interested and united, we, the profession, wish you God speed in the gratifying endeavor that awaits you.” And then this remarkable class prepared to graduate and pass into the history of Western States. For some comparison, in June 1949, WSC graduated 36 DC degrees and 16 ND degrees, with 11 graduating with dual degrees. In March 1950, WSC graduated 29 DC degrees and 2 ND degrees. In March 1951, 21 DCs graduated and 4 ND degrees. In March 1952, 31 DCs and 1 ND graduated. The class was scheduled to graduate in March 1953, and most were graduating as DCs. Because there was interest expressed among class members in receiving dual degrees, a special spring quarter sched- ule had been arranged, focused exclusively on ND therapeutics. The Synergist had reported this development from time to time over the 1952–1953 school year. It was noted in the March 1953 publication: “much of the class will be around after Graduation to take a post-grad- uate course in Naturopathy, so we really won’t be saying our good- byes for a while” This course for DCs required a full spring quarter of coursework in Cyriax’s Text-book of Orthopaedic Medicine, Volume II on massage therapy, Mausert’s Herbs for Health, and Spitler’s Basic Naturopathy in a course designed by Drs. Budden and Bleything. The class of 1953 had two commencement ceremonies, one in March and one in late June. In March, 33 DCs and 2 NDs gradu- ated, with 7 DCs also receiving the BTS degree and 1 ND receiving the BTS degree. In July, at a special commencement at the end of the spring quarter, 33 NDs were graduated, and 1 received the BTS degree. Twenty-six of these degrees went to DC graduates from March 1953, three went to March 1952 DC graduates who returned for the spring quarter course, and six ND degrees were received by ND candidates who finished studies in June with the extra quarter’s work. The late-June ND degree ceremony was staged as an evening event on the second night of the ANPSA convention, as reported in the Journal of the ANPSA for September 1952 (vol. 6, no. 6). “The

commencement address was delivered by that outstanding authority on nutrition of the University of Missouri, William Albert Albrecht, Ph.D. Dr. Albrecht’s address was indeed inspiring, not only to the graduates but to all in attendance.” And, as the reporter noted: “It was indeed an inspiration to see this fine young group of naturopathic physicians entering the profession. The profession needs more young naturopathic physicians to assure its future.”129

## Some Stalwarts of

Joseph Boucher, the ND degree graduate who had been student body president for 1952 to 1953, received the William J. Gallagher award as the outstanding graduate of the class of 1953, with Appa Anderson being noted by Dr. Budden in announcing the award as a close second. And then the class of 1953 left Western States to conquer the world. But this class was the fruition of all that Dr. Budden and the chiroprac- tic and naturopathic professions had built at Western States in the face of challenges and opposition. Dr. Budden died unexpectedly in August 1954, less than a week after returning from attending his last NCA meeting.130 By the time the class of 1953 finished its first year at Western States, the ND program was the only remaining ND program in the United States.131 Within years of the death of Dr. Budden, the ND program at Western States was discontinued; courts had restricted the legal scope of practice in Washington and Arizona; and licensing of NDs was lost completely in Texas due to actions by the courts and in South Carolina, Utah, and Florida by legislative action. How this happened is another piece of his- tory still to be told, but a great deal of it curbed broad-scope or “mixer” practices in those states, and a large factor was medical dominance, what the educators and physicians discussed here had battled for years. Things did not improve until at least the 1980s, another part of the story yet to be told. But that should in no way diminish what was done at Western States College and in both its School of Chiropractic and its School of Naturopathy. From the class of 1953, Joseph A. “Joe” Boucher, ND, BTS, became a giant of Canadian naturopathy in his own right,132 Appa Anderson stayed at Western States for an impressive career of her own in chiropractic radiology,133 and Professor W. Martin Bleything was one of the founders of today’s National University of Natural Medicine, together with one of his fellow faculty members and a for- mer Western States student from the class of 1952.134 Ralph M. Failor, who—along with his wife Hazel—received a DC degree in March and an ND degree in July, would succeed Dr. Budden as president of WSC. He would in time become a big part of the history of WSC.135 What happened was remarkable and needs to be better known.

# PART TWO: WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?

## Moving On

There may be no more exemplary story in the development of natu- ral healing among chiropractor-naturopaths than the story of Henry J. Schlichting Jr., of Midland, Texas. Schlichting was trained as a chiro- practor in Oklahoma and moved to Texas in 1941, setting himself up as a naturopath. At the time, neither chiropractors nor naturopaths were licensed in Texas. Schlichting became a leader within natural heal- ing professionals, first within Texas and then nationally. He became a trusted ally of both Robert Carroll and of Dr. Budden at Western States College. He and his Texas naturopaths achieved licensed status in 1949. In the early 1950s, all looked bright, and then it all turned dark. On the evening of July 17, 1953, the commencement for 37 recip- ients of the degree of doctor of naturopathy took place in the audi- torium at Western States College in Portland, Oregon. This special commencement was scheduled as the Tuesday night program for the 1953 annual convention of the American Naturopathic Physicians and Surgeons Association, as the immediate past president of the ANPSA Henry J. Schlichting Jr. of Midland, Texas, was in attendance.136 As Schlichting had said a year earlier in a speech at WSC, the pros- pects for naturopaths seemed good as this WSC class of 1953 gradu- ated, most of them as DC, NDs. But the forces of medical dominance were building, starting back home in Texas, even as Schlichting was attending the convention in Portland. Within 6 years, natural healing in the United States would be much diminished. No career demon- strates this as clearly as that of Schlichting, a remarkable man and phy- sician who, by the end of the 1950s, had been barred by the State of Texas from practicing his chosen profession and who had lost almost everything. When the class of 1953 graduated from Western States, the lead- ership of the naturopathic part of the natural healing professions was in Henry Schlichting’s hands as the president of the ANA, with A.R. Hedges in line to become Schlichting’s successor. There were head- winds, though, just beginning to be felt.

# HEADWINDS

Some of these headwinds had been building within the naturopathic movement itself since the 1930s. Benedict Lust criticized Dr. Budden and Dr. Carroll in early 1935 for proposing a continuing alliance based in the Pacific NW between broad-scope chiropractors and naturopaths. The 1935 annual ANA convention a few months later in San Diego was a crossroads event for ND as a profession. Lust opened the convention with a presidential address that seemed to mark a “scofflaw” phase in Lust’s career as the head of the naturopathic movement. He told the convention that he had been prosecuted—and persecuted—for issu- ing diplomas to “doctors” from the American School of Naturopathy without a New York State charter to do so. The State of New York, he charged, was operating as an arm of the AMA’s “Medical Trust.” Only naturopaths, he told the convention, could decide who deserved to be called naturopaths, not the state or the Medical Trust. Naturopathy needed to be accepted by the public to be legitimate, not by the state. But for the first time, Robert Carroll brought a countervailing view to an ANA convention. These countervailing visions of the future of naturopathy were the visions that played themselves out over the next 10 years within the ANA. The ANA could not be a movement run by a permanent leadership but needed to truly be a professional organi- zation seeking to advance a natural healing profession. In adopting a new constitution and bylaws proposed by Carroll, the ANA accepted Carroll’s vision of the future over Lust’s vision from the past. By 1937 Carroll was comfortable that the ANA was in a good place; now it was time for the profession to accept that fact. At the end of 1937, as the chairman of the Executive Committee of the ANA, Carroll issued “An Appeal to All Naturopaths.” He opened by saying that he for some time he had been “alarmed and rather disappointed with the seeming indifference of many of the Drugless Physicians to our National Association.” “Progressive Naturopaths,” he said, were committed to the goal, through the ANA, that “our profession will take its place as a scien- tific body of learned naturopaths.” With science on its side, progressive naturopaths could, for example, “tell the world just why Sulfanilamide is detrimental to the human body, and in just what kind of cases it is fatal or contraindicated—This must be our objective if we ever hope to merit the respect of the public and our educational institutions.” Changes had been made in the ANA in 1935 “to pull our profession out of the adoles- cent state, which we have seemingly been unable to pass.” As part of the change in ANA structure, the leadership of the ANA also gained some input into submission of ANA professional material in Naturopath and Herald of Health in exchange for ANA dues monies

being used to support Lust’s costs of publication. Using this position, Carroll had an article by Dr. Budden on the effects of the Basic Science Laws published in NHH. The article also appeared in one of the leading chiropractic journals.

<!-- chunk -->

## Revisiting Basic Science

This article was written in Budden’s inimitable style and was written only a couple of years away from the Oregon 1934 ballot fight that marked Budden’s initial response to Oregon adopting its Basic Science Law. In a classic Americanism argument, Budden pointed out that a “whole generation of college-bred men and women” would be good national policy as there “should be more and evermore of our youth attending institutes of higher learning, and provisions should be made to make this possible.” But there were policies that were intended to work against “Americans who value democracy” and that had the “sin- ister objective, nothing less than the establishment of exclusive privi- leges in education.” This was where, Budden argued, the Basic Sciences Laws were directed. They were designed as a test of university-level sciences divorced from the application of the sciences to drugless, nonmedical professions. This was at a time when “the drugless world had devel- oped its own schools and colleges; institutions of learning peculiar to human therapeutics from the non-medical standpoint, well-equipped and staffed by competent teachers.” “Drugless schools,” he pointed out, “have no state support and few endowments; they must depend on contributions from alumni and upon tuition.” And as “a great national magazine (had) brought to light the unpleasant truth [was] that more people gave allegiance to physiological and drugless methods than to purely medical treat- ments.” If “the drugless schools continued to flourish and to increase in value to the community and the country at large, it soon be too late to attack them. Thus the basic science idea was born.” Budden went on to argue that “it is important to note that in most states, and in the state of Oregon in particular,” the sciences called the basic sciences—anatomy, chemistry, physiology, pathology and public health—were already taught and tested on for chiropractic and natu- ropathy. The purpose of the “extra” examination seemed to Budden to be an attempt to raise a barrier to drugless, nonmedical students of chiropractic and naturopathy with a clear ulterior and undemocratic motive: to keep these practitioners out of the marketplace: “Proponents of the law maintain that by this arrangement, which they contend is fair to all alike, the public is assured of a higher grade of practitioner. The police power of the state should be wielded to protect the public: not one particular group of physicians. The way of safety for the citizen is not in uniformity of thought in the healing arts, but in diversity.” Dr. Budden had come to be recognized by Robert Carroll as one of the leading “schoolmen” in natural healing. Although Budden was very concerned about “a board composed of university lecturers or Deans, men who know nothing of drugless practice and care less, prej- udiced even before they occupy positions on the basic science board,” he came to believe within less than 10 years of dealing with the Oregon board that the examinations were fairly held—which will be addressed later in this chapter. A similar set of countervailing visions to those playing out within naturopathy played out within the National Chiropractic Association. In 1939 the influential broad-scope (or “liberal”) chiro- practor from Montana, C. O. Watkins, DC, argued in an influential article137 that chiropractors should not favor separate licensing and degree status for naturopathy; rather, chiropractic statutes should be sought legislatively, recognizing that naturopathy was incorporated within a broad conception of “liberal” chiropractic and should be recognized as such. In the article, Watkins noted that nationwide, there were “16,000 chiropractors, 95 per cent using other than straight Chiropractic” and “2000 naturopaths, many of them holding Chiropractic licenses who could also be considered liberal chiropractors.” Furthermore, Watkins noted, the NCA had considered the issue of backing naturopathic leg- islation and decided on a different policy: “That the NCA oppose any plan that would cause the passage of separate physio-therapy laws or naturopathic laws to cover liberal chiropractors, but rather favor liber- alization of Chiropractic legislation where it desirable to legalize liberal practice.” Looking back through the lens of historical hindsight, it seems that these policy differences fostered a diffusion of energies that would have been better spent seeking recognition for natural healing in the most expansive way possible, wherever possible.

## And Scandals

Although most developments that have been discussed thus far were positive, in the 1940s, there were scandals involving practitioners iden- tified as “naturopaths” as well. In 1938 a group of liberal chiropractors that identified themselves as chiropractor-naturopaths had formed the American Naturopathic Association of Michigan. Their leaders were charged with bribing members of the Michigan state legislature during the 1939 and 1941 legislative sessions. The charges alleged that bribes had been paid in an effort to get a naturopathic law enacted, and reports of the investigation by an inquiry judge, including the charges brought and the trials and guilty pleas in the case, dominated upper Midwest headlines from late 1944 through the end of 1945. A much bigger scandal—one that received much wider and more sensational coverage—emerged in Tennessee. By the time the events there had played out, the courts had laid the groundwork for the assault on naturopaths that took place 10 years later in the mid-1950s. Organized naturopathy came to Tennessee in December 1937 when the ANA of Tennessee was chartered. Guy W. Cheatham, DC, ND, had established the Nashville College of Chiropractic and Naturopathy ear- lier in the 1930s, and the school and the ANA of Tennessee operated in an unlicensed vacuum for several years while Cheatham was active in the NCA efforts on chiropractic education and in ANA national affairs. George A. Floden, DC, ND, of Los Angeles, California, was affiliated with Cheatham’s college and lectured there on a regular basis. Matters in Tennessee changed significantly and abruptly in when the Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives, backed by the Crump political machine based in Shelby County (Memphis), pushed through a naturopathic licensing law over the veto of the state’s governor. A 1946 investigation suggested that two naturopaths who later were named to the naturopathic licensing board funneled several thousand dollars to the Speaker (one bookkeeping entry showed $7835 for “1943 legislature”), their golfing buddy, in the form of “friendly” golfing bets. By 1946 the examining board, which by statute kept its own books and records of licenses issued, had issued 917 Tennessee licenses to “naturopaths” from as far away as California, Alaska, Mexico, Canada, and South Africa. The number could actually have been more than 1000 licenses issued, as the books and records of the examining board “disappeared” from the offices of one of the board’s members while the records were under subpoena by state prosecutors. But investigation showed that some diplomas and licenses were sold as a package: $1500 for a diploma and $1500 for a license. In December 1946, 27 indictments were issued by a grand jury in Nashville. Those charged included Guy Cheatham DC, ND, and his California associate George Floden, DC, ND, along with a California associate of Floden. Two Texas NDs who lectured at Cheatham’s Nashville College were charged as well, and in the grand jury’s 34-page

## 64SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

indictment, it was alleged that all schools of naturopathy in Tennessee were “diploma mills.” Cheatham had, admittedly, issued “naturopathy” diplomas to earlier chiropractic graduates of his college so that they could apply for naturopathy licenses after the 1943 statute went into effect. In all, 17 defendants submitted nolo contendere (“no contest”) pleas and were fined between $100 and $1000. The largest fines of $1000 went to two of the three members of the licensing board that the prose- cutor said were “to blame for the conspiracy.” Charges against Flodden and his California associate were dropped when the State of California denied extradition to Tennessee on the charges. More importantly in the long run, the 1947 Tennessee legislature repealed the naturopathy act, criminalized any future practice of natu- ropathy in Tennessee, and invalidated all existing licenses to practice naturopathy in that state as of January 1947. Ten practitioners—all members of the ANA of Tennessee and all “clean” of any taint from the indictments—filed suit, seeking a declaration by the courts that the repealer statute was constitutionally invalid because it deprived them of their valid property interest in their licenses to practice without due process and without any finding that naturopathy itself was a threat to the health and welfare of the citizens of Tennessee. A chancery court (trial-level) judge agreed, holding that the legis- lature did not have the constitutional authority to rescind the right to practice a legalized profession and to revoke, carte blanche, an entire class of professional licenses from practitioners who were without fault. A request to enjoin any enforcement of the statute through prosecutions for practicing medicine without a license was denied as beyond the authority of the court. But before 1947 was over, the Tennessee Supreme Court had reversed this judgment. The Supreme Court held that the allegations of massive fraud in issuing licenses were serious enough to justify a sweeping response under the state’s constitutional police powers, without the necessity to review each license in question. Moreover, the Tennessee court held that it was well within the police power of the state legislature, under the same constitutional police powers, to repeal an entire class of professional licenses—especially in the healthcare domain—at any time, within its reasonable discretion. That is, where licensing was concerned, the legislature taketh, and the legislature taketh away. The plaintiff naturopaths petitioned the US Supreme Court for review of the case and of the Tennessee Supreme Court’s holding on these constitutional issues. Review was denied. The table was set for a later broad assault on the licensing of natural healers across multiple states in the 1950s.

## And Repercussions

The mischief and the stain originating in Tennessee spread quite quickly as well. In early 1947 as the scope of the Tennessee scandal was emerging and as the Tennessee legislature was repealing the Tennessee licensing law, investigations of licensing of naturopaths began first in Connecticut and then in South Carolina. In Connecticut, the state health commissioner—by state law a position held by an MD—with- held licenses from 28 applicants who had been approved for licensing by the Connecticut Board of Naturopathic Examiners starting in because none of the applicants had passed state licensing examinations, neither the basic science examination nor the naturopathic licens- ing examination. All of the applicants had been approved based on a Connecticut healing arts licensing reciprocity statute. All of the appli- cants sought reciprocity based on licenses issued in South Carolina—a state with no basic science examination. In 1946 three applicants brought suit in two actions against the health commissioner seeking a court order directing that their licenses be issued immediately (through a writ of mandamus or “mandate”). Both applicants had failed the basic science examination more than once and then presented South Carolina licenses to the Connecticut Board, which had approved reciprocity applications. The applicants prevailed first in chancery (trial) court, then in the Connecticut Supreme Court. The courts—the chancery court in June 1946 and the Connecticut Supreme Court in April 1947—held that the health commissioner served in a ministerial capacity, that is, the health commissioner had no discretion in issuing licenses when the Naturopathic Board had approved the applications. The courts also found that the reciprocity statute allowed the approval without examination, but the Connecticut Supreme Court agreed with the trial court that the health commis- sioner was trying to protect the public interest. The Connecticut Supreme Court noted further that if evidence showed that the appli- cations were fraudulent or the actions of the Board were taken in bad faith, members of the Board should be removed from office. Based on the issues developed in the court proceedings, the Connecticut police—which had the responsibility for licensing back- ground checks—began an investigation into the reciprocity appli- cations that lasted 6 months. This led in turn to an overlapping investigation by the state police in South Carolina. A clear pattern was documented: applicants from schools not recognized by South Carolina (which recognized only the National College of Chicago and Metropolitan of Cleveland as of 1947), primarily applicants with diplo- mas from Lust’s American College of New York, had obtained licenses in Tennessee between 1943 and 1946, and then been licensed in South Carolina without examination. Twenty-four applicants had then applied for licensing in Connecticut, again based on reciprocity. An investigation done in South Carolina by two Connecticut police detectives disclosed that only four applicants had actually spent any time practicing in South Carolina, and no time had been spent in Tennessee. The South Carolina Board had suspended the practice of accepting reciprocity applications from Tennessee in February 1947 when the Tennessee legislature out- lawed naturopathy, but in 1947 and 1948, legislative pressure built up on the Board, and ND licensing in the state was under threat of repeal. By 1949 the repeal threat had been survived—for the present. Much of this was a result of Connecticut adopting a Basic Science Law when only National, Metropolitan, Western States, UNHA of Denver, and Los Angeles College—all chiropractic colleges with ND degree programs—had legitimate 4-year residency programs with a basic sciences curriculum. How had this been worked through by these colleges? By 1944 Dr. Budden’s view of the Oregon Basic Sciences Examining Board had changed based on 10 years of experience with the Board and its examinations.

## More Basic Science

In the October 1944 issue of The National Chiropractic Journal, Budden offered his updated assessment of the Oregon Basic Science Law in the article “Effects of Basic Science Law in Oregon.” By this time, Budden noted that “we should like to make it clear … that we—the faculty and myself—have had some ten years of experience with the prepa- ration of students for this test and, as a consequence, we feel that we make speak with some authority.” This notwithstanding that “public and candid discussion of the merits and demerits of basic science leg- islation has been regarded as a species of treason to Chiropractic (and Naturopathy).” But strictly directed to the Oregon experience, the Basic Science Law in general had shown his students to be ready join “one of the learned profession,” passing an examination given by a board of college and university professors chosen by the Board of Higher Education that “conducts its affairs with equity and intelligence (with) examinations

that are fairly held and the papers fairly marked.” From all the evi- dence Budden had observed—and from a success rate of 25 out of students passing the examination the first time (83.33%)—Budden believed “that if a student follows the courses covering the required subjects as they are given in the accredited schools, faithfully and with diligence he will pass the test.” He still noted that the public health part of the examination was based totally on the medical approach to the subject, requiring that the faculty had to teach students both “traditional” public health and the nonmedical alternative thinking. But he felt this was a price to pay in order that a higher level of nonmedical education was achieved, medi- cal propaganda about a low level of nonmedical education was “wiped out,” success on the examinations favorably influenced the courts and the legislature, and there was more favorable treatment of the non- medical professions by the outside the medical domain “all-around.” Finally, Budden noted that “of late efforts have been made to cir- cumvent the law by setting up very dubious and possibly illegal ‘reci- procity.’” This, he said, was self-defeating: “There is only one way; to qualify enough candidates to show that the level of education makes two [licensing] examinations for the right to practice the healing arts preposterous.” In this thinking, as in many respects, Dr. Budden was almost years ahead of his time.

## Dr. Schlichting

Henry J. (Hank) Schlichting Jr. was born in Fowler, Kansas, in and was raised—or, as he put it, “reared”—in Weatherford, Oklahoma. By 1938, at age 23, he had graduated from Oklahoma City’s Carver Chiropractic College and relocated to Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle, where he joined “Dr. Roy G. Moore’s Chiropractic Hospital—Serving the Entire Southwest” as “Assistant Specializing in Dislocations and Fractures.” By the fall of 1941, he had relocated to Midland, Texas, and opened his own practice, the Modern Health Clinic. He adver- tised himself as “Dr. Henry Schlichting, Jr., Naturopathic Physician Specializing in Fractures and Dislocations.”138 How Schlichting came to call himself a naturopath is somewhat unclear. In the mid-1930s there was no licensing in Oklahoma or Texas for either chiropractors or naturopaths. Carver Chiropractic College in Oklahoma City taught obstetrics, minor surgery, and a broader use of adjustive technique than “straight” chiropractic. Texas was mostly dominated by straights through the influence of the Texas Chiropractic College in San Antonio. Although Schlichting’s early training was in chiropractic, and he was first in chiropractic practice in the Amarillo, Texas, area when he settled in Midland in 1941, he allied himself with the naturopaths in Texas and always called himself a naturopath.139 Also, by the fall of 1941, he had joined the newly formed ANA of Texas. At the organization’s first statewide convention in Dallas— attended by more than 500 initial members—he was elected secre- tary-treasurer. This quick ascension into the leadership ranks of the naturopaths of Texas led in turn to his connection with the western ANA group and with Robert V. Carroll.140

## Dr. Schlichting and the Western ANA

The 1942 convention of the ANA in Chicago was boycotted by Benedict Lust, Jesse Mercer Gehmann, T. J. Schippell, and their allies that became the eastern group. They held a “rump” convention of about 75 eastern naturopaths in Atlantic City in anticipation of the Chicago convention electing someone other than Lust as ANA pres- ident. In Chicago, Fredric Dugdale of Portland, Maine, was elected president. The president of the ANA of Texas, which since its for- mation in 1940 had delivered the biggest state representation to the ANA, was H. A. Brown of Canyon, Texas. He was elected first VP of the national ANA under Dugdale (Robert Carroll stayed as chairman of the Board of Directors), and in 1944 Brown was elected national president. When Carroll succeeded Brown as ANA president in 1946, he tapped Schlichting as his secretary.141 What made Schlichting stand out to Robert Carroll must be guessed at, but Carroll was a superb leader and organization man, and he recruited many significant naturopaths into the profession and into the western ANA. He recruited John Bastyr and many others in Washington State into naturopathy before moving on to the national stage. Schlichting had much to commend him: he became a strong ally of Harry Brown in the Texas ANA, an organization that grew to more than 400 members, most of whom also joined the national ANA; he was a talented writer and speaker; and he was a strong organization man. Once he was placed as national secretary by Carroll, Schlichting brought all of these talents to the national ANA. He continued to advance naturopathy in Texas, and he built a busy, thriving practice in Midland. Throughout the 1940s he advertised specializing in frac- tures and dislocations. Midland was a western Texas oil town, and oil roughneck work was notorious for its physical toll. The Carver tech- niques emphasized minor surgery and a “structural” approach to chi- ropractic. This became known in chiropractic as the Carver Technique, and as it evolved, it became one of the roots of naturopathic physical medicine.142

## More Background on Clinical Practice

Willard Carver “opened the Carver-Denny School of Chiropractic in Oklahoma City in 1906, which in 1908 became the Carver Chiropractic College Carver’s philosophy gave equal importance to any anatomi- cally produced ‘nerve occlusion,’ whether or not related to the verte- bral column, while his structural approach to biomechanics became more ‘holistic’ than B.J.’s [Palmer] segmental one-bone-out-of-place approach.”143 Carver established four chiropractic schools, in New York City; Washington, D.C.; and Denver in addition to Oklahoma City. It was the Denver school that became most significant to natural healing edu- cation and clinical technique. As Walter Wardwell described the rele- vant history: “Homer G. Beatty (1897–1951), who had graduated from Carver’s Oklahoma school in 1922, became the dean of the Colorado school in 1923 and its president in 1924, serving until his death in 1951.” In 1939 Beatty published Anatomical Adjustive Technique. By 1935 the school was reorganized as the nonprofit University of the Natural Healing Arts, which offered three doctoral degrees, D.C., N.D. and D.P.T. [Doctor of Physical Therapy], the last requiring 3 years of study rather than the 4 required for the others.”144 Homer G. Beatty, DC, ND, is a part of the story of the profession- alization of natural healing for several reasons. He was a part of the educational efforts of the National Chiropractic Association from its commencement in the early 1930s. He adopted the 4-year residency educational model for the UNHA DC and ND degree programs in lockstep with Budden at Western States. Although Colorado did not adopt licensure separately for NDs, his ND program at UNHA pro- vided about half of the licensed NDs in the neighboring state of Utah by the mid-1950s. And perhaps most importantly, his book Anatomical Adjustive Technique, which described methods of treatment by manual adjustment for the entire anatomy, became a cornerstone for natural physical medicine. It was this type of clinical technique that was used by Schlichting in his West Texas practice. These clinical techniques were supplemented by the treatment methods illustrated in Alton Johnson’s Principles and Practice of Drugless Therapeutics, the first edition of which was also published in 1939. Johnson, another DC, ND, covered physiotherapy,

electrotherapy, and hydrotherapy—in addition to adjustive tech- nique—in his book on clinical science for natural healers. Both of these works were integrated by Budden into the postwar curriculum at Western States, and both Beatty and Johnson became members of the western ANA after the war. In Johnson’s case, he was recruited by Carroll and Schlichting to attend the 1948 western ANA convention in Salt Lake City and prevailed upon by them to accept the chairmanship of a new ANA committee on physiotherapy. In this position, Johnson wrote or edited a regular physiotherapy column in the journal of the association for several years (while also writing regularly for the journal The Scientific Chiropractor), and in the early 1950s he served a 3-year term on the national association’s Board of Directors.145 These were the clinical techniques at the center of Schlichting’s clinical practice during the 1940s when he established his practice and became a leader in the national movement of natural healers. He also became a civic leader in Midland, as a prototypical American joiner of voluntary civic associations: the Lions Club, the Jaycees, the Toastmasters, and various civic improvement efforts. Dr. Schlichting, or “Doc” to the citizens of Midland, practiced and lived very visibly in his adopted hometown, as many members of the western ANA did in the 1940s before natural healing came under assault by the AMA in the 1950s.

## Back to the National Scene

As a national officer by 1946, Schlichting found himself in the middle of the dispute over control of the American Naturopathic Association, chartered in Washington, D.C. by Benedict Lust in 1919. After the “pseudo-group insurrection” of 1942, Lust remained embittered and denied the legitimacy of the “western ANA” until his death in August 1945. But for these 3 years, the nation was at war, and many were diverted from much of civilian life. The westerners largely built a communication network, held annual meetings, and waited out the war. Peacetime would come, and by circumstance, when it did, Benedict Lust had died. Then in peacetime, internecine warfare broke out among the naturopaths, as both Carroll and his western group and the eastern group led by Jesse Mercer Gehmann, T.M. Schippell, and a new face, Paul Wendel, laid claim to the “ANA.” Working with Carroll, Schlichting and a few others built up their Western “pseudo- group” while defending their right to being “the real ANA” and while constantly pushing the concept of unifying all naturopaths within one organization.146 Looking through the historical record, it seems clear that Robert Carroll had followed a methodical campaign to make the ANA into a true professional organization and that he had done so by amend- ing the ANA constitution, bylaws, and governing structure. The west- ern group had every right to be recognized as the legally constituted ANA organization as WWII ended, and Carroll’s ANA represented the broad-scope practitioners from the urban areas of about 20 states, including all of the licensed states. The eastern group that survived Lust, though, continued his dispute of their claim of legitimacy from 1946 to 1950, and the issue was a constant distraction.147 Through 1946 and 1947 the western group, for various reasons— including a postwar paper shortage—struggled to produce a monthly publication for its membership. During this time the leadership com- municated with members through a series of “Dear Doctor” news- letters that Schlichting sent out from his Midland, Texas, office as “American Naturopathic Association, Inc., Office of the Secretary.” In January 1948, at long last the Journal of the ANA debuted, and the western ANA became a more established presence on the cultural, political, and professional scene. With much anticipation of a “Unity Convention,” the group convened in July 1948 in Salt Lake City, Utah, for its annual meeting. Although the organization had grown in strength and presence—and more than 300 naturopaths attended the meeting from about 20 states—“unity” was not achieved, and Carroll passed the reins of the presidency to Schlichting.148 As of the summer of 1948, there were ND degree programs at National College of Chiropractic in Chicago, UNHA in Denver, Western States in Portland, and Metropolitan College in Cleveland, Ohio, that were legitimate 4-year residency colleges, as well as a pro- gram at the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic that was in a state of flux, although soon to be disbanded completely by the National Chiropractic Association. Schlichting took the presidency from Carroll at a time when the future for chiropractor-naturopaths looked promising.149 A historical note here is in order. Almost all of the naturopaths in the western group were chiropractors who had branched out in classic “mixer” fashion. With the exception of Robert Carroll him- self, who had been a direct student of Henry Lindlahr and who had begun to call himself a “naturopath” instead of a drugless healer in the early 1930s, a historical tracking of every ND leader from the postwar era leads back to an early chiropractic college. As just two examples (Schlichting’s education has been covered), Harry Riley Spitler (the lead editor of Basic Naturopathy) graduated from Ross Chiropractic College in Fort Wayne, Indiana, before WWI, and John Bastyr (after whom today’s Bastyr University is named) graduated from the Seattle Chiropractic College in the early 1930s. Spitler was also on the faculty of the Metropolitan College from the mid-1930s until WWII. Also, in several states, “mixers” became identified as naturopaths because chiropractic “straights” took control of chiro- practic licensing. Washington, South Carolina, Utah, and Texas were such states.150

## Dr. Schlichting Becomes President

When Schlichting took over as president of the western ANA, things were at a critical juncture for natural healers, whether they identi- fied as chiropractors or naturopaths both nationally or back home in Texas. Schlichting, while running a busy, growing practice and emerging as a civic leader in Midland, was up to the task of growing the ANA as an organization and achieving legal recognition for natu- ropaths in Texas. In doing so, he followed Robert Carroll’s model: practice openly and proudly as an “ND” and “Dr.,” be a civic leader, push constantly for recognition for naturopaths and legitimate ND school programs, and do everything possible to unify the profession within the ANA.151 As the incoming president in 1948, Schlichting had set the ANA convention for Houston, Texas, to take place coinciding with the open- ing of Houston’s newest—and in keeping with the mottos of Texas “biggest and best”—luxury hotel. As 200 Texas naturopaths joined with 200 out-of-state naturopaths for the ANA’s largest convention, Schlichting was able to announce to the attendees that the Texas leg- islature had passed a Texas licensing law as part of a legislative “deal,” and the governor of Texas was signing off on the legislation. Within years, Texas was the home to more than 400 licensed NDs—the largest licensed state in terms of numbers and the largest source of Western ANA members.152 The nature of the “deal” became critical within just a few years. The Texas State Medical Association wanted Texas to adopt a Basic Science Law. The Texas chiropractors wanted a licensing law for “straight” chi- ropractic. An earlier law had been struck down by the Texas Supreme Court for violating a provision of the Texas Constitution that prohib- ited giving preference to any “school of medicine.” And the growing naturopathic group of 500 and counting wanted recognition. A group of legislators brokered a deal: a Basic Science Law would be adopted

## 67CHAPTER 4 The History of Naturopathic Medicine

first; then, subject to it, a chiropractic law crafted to withstand chal- lenge would be adopted; and finally, a pending naturopathic bill would be adopted.153 The Basic Science Law passed both houses of the Texas legislature handily, the chiropractic law was adopted by slightly tighter margins, and then the naturopathic law passed the state House fairly comfort- ably. But then, in a harbinger of things to come and with its Basic Science Law in hand, the state medical association tried to kill the deal with a push against the ND bill in the state Senate. The bill, after much delay, passed the state Senate by one vote, 23-22, in July 1949, while the profession was in Houston for its convention.154

## The Late 1940s and Professional Growth

Under Schlichting’s leadership as national and state leader—and soon as a member of the first naturopathic licensing board in Texas— the profession continued to grow. But as noted earlier, the number of schools started to decline. Los Angeles dropped its program, and Metropolitan closed up in 1949. National dropped its program in under pressure from the National Chiropractic Association. Suddenly in 1951, Homer G. Beatty, DC, ND, of the UNHA in Denver passed away and with him, in short order, so did another ND program; only Western States under Dr. Budden was left.155

## In Memoriam—Robert V. Carroll, Sr.

And then suddenly in March 1951, Robert V. Carroll—Schlichting’s mentor and the true “father” of the modern naturopathic profession passed away. As Schlichting and the editors of the Journal of the ANA memorialized Robert Carroll’s life and career156 In MEMORIAM Dr. Robert V. Carroll, Sr., died Friday, May 11th, of internal hem- orrhage followed by coronary embolism. He died as he lived, sud- denly and dramatically. There had been no prior illness. He went from excellent health to death in twenty-four hours. The naturopathic field has lost one of its greatest fighters. His was not the fight for individual stature; his was the fight for rightful and legal recognition of Naturopathy. He did not aspire to a statue, a pedestal or plaque exhorting his name in superlatives; his desire was to see naturopathy reach its honored place in the sun and to be a proud member of that profession. Now, his three score and ten has been completed. His earthly body has been laid away, but his spirit will march on. He has left a high mark on the wall. When we can measure up to it, his dream will have come true. The world has lost a man, the nation, a citizen, and naturopathy, a leader. But in our hearts each of us knows that the loss cannot be described in words alone. He admired and respected the qualities in others that fired them to opposition. In his heart he had only friends, agreeing friends and disagreeing friends. All will miss him. In the 1950s Henry Schlichting and the naturopaths faced challeng- ing times that could not be foreseen in 1951. Robert Carroll’s leader- ship and vision would be missed.

## 1947–1950 and Forward

When Robert V. Carroll passed away unexpectedly in May of 1951, the natural healing profession that he had helped build with 20 years of diligent work was trending upward. When Dr. Carroll passed from the scene, national leadership was then held by Henry J. Schlichting Jr., of Midland, Texas, and by A.R. Hedges of Medford, Oregon. Educational leadership was in the hands of W. A. Budden of Western States College, Portland, Oregon, and Joseph Janse of National College of Chicago, Illinois. Texas had licensed naturopaths and chiropractors in 1949 as part of a legislative “deal” in which the Texas legislature also adopted a Basic Science Law. In 1950 the Georgia legislature had licensed naturopaths, and the Nevada legislature had also adopted licensing statutes in 1951. In the negative column at the time of Carroll’s passing, National College had dropped its formal ND degree program in 1950 under pressure from the National Chiropractic Association’s Council on Education, and the governor of the state of Nevada had vetoed the Nevada legislation just after the legislature adjourned. Joe Janse would proudly call himself a DC, ND, well into the 1960s and preside over a broad, “liberal” chi- ropractic curriculum at National, but the National College decision reduced legitimate, 4-year residency ND education to only Western States.157 In Texas, Henry Schlichting—“Doc” to the Midland, Texas, community—sat on a three-member naturopathic board that had processed and accepted more than 400 applications for licensing on a “grandfather” basis that was part of the 1949 legislation. Texas became both the largest state membership base for the western ANA and the largest licensed state in naturopathy. The natural healers seemed to have weathered the Tennessee scandal by 1951 and to have absorbed the lesson that H. Riley Spitler called “Remember Tennessee.”158 Naturopathy in Connecticut159 could have suffered much more than it did in the aftermath of the Tennessee scandal, but the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled in April 1947 that the Connecticut State Board of Naturopathic Examiners—not the state commissioner of health, a medical doctor—was the legal decision maker in licens- ing. As early as 1942 the health commissioner had delayed the issu- ing of licenses approved by the Board when the approval was under the licensing reciprocity statute and from South Carolina, a state with no Basic Science Law and that approved schools that were not on the Connecticut Board’s approved schools list. The commissioner’s posi- tion was that the reciprocity statue required licensing by a state with licensing requirements comparable to those in effect in Connecticut. By 1946, when this issue emerged into public awareness, licenses issued in Tennessee—where the diploma mill and licensing fraud scandal was first coming to light—also started appearing in reciproc- ity applications. By the time two applicants, both with diplomas from Lust’s American School in New York (which had lost its state charter in 1935) and with licenses from South Carolina and Tennessee, prevailed in the Connecticut Supreme Court, the legislature had repealed the reciprocity statutes at the urging of the governor, and the state attorney general had begun a review of all existing licenses to determine whether evidence of fraud existed in the application process. The Board revoked 17 licenses on its own, and the attorney gen- eral revoked several more after a trial that focused on the scandal in Tennessee and the loose practices in South Carolina in its own han- dling of the reciprocity issue. Extensive testimony was introduced by the attorney general’s office about the Tennessee licensing scandal from depositions taken in Tennessee, and also about the extent to which South Carolina “rubber stamped” reciprocity application in 1945 and 1946 supported by Tennessee licenses. In the long run, the Connecticut Board emerged with its licensing authority intact for applicants who graduated from properly approved schools and after successful passage of licensing examinations. The same proved to be true in South Carolina but only after the Board there went through a major legislative scrutiny process and adverse publicity of its own.160 During the 1947 South Carolina legislative session, the state House of Representatives passed a “concurrent resolution” asking

## 68SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

for an inquiry into “examinations and personal qualifications required of applicants to practice naturopathy in this state and the propriety of granting licenses therefore.” During the 1948 legislative session, the full resolution was addressed between the House and the Senate (which was more favorable to the naturopaths), instructing the state Naturopathic Board to clean up its own house and report to the legislature by the 1949 session. As reported in the press, “The assembly … asked the State Board of Examiners to look into this situation, remedy it if possible.” In February 1949, the Board reported to the legislature “that it had revoked a number of reciprocity licenses, giving the holders a chance to regain them by taking state examinations … Most did and were rel- icensed … But at least one holder of a license refused to accept the board’s order and has brought court action against it.” The Board requested stricter licensing laws and stronger disciplinary powers, and the legislature obliged.

## After the Scandals

These two states were the most directly affected by the Tennessee scan- dal. Connecticut was “purged” by the actions of state authorities; South Carolina was purged by aggressive action of the State Naturopathic Board. Licensing in both states survived the Tennessee infection. As a reflection of post-Tennessee reality, the 1949 licensing of naturopaths in Texas included a specific reference in its “grandfather” provisions that provided that licenses issued in the state of Tennessee were not to be considered for any purpose, recognizing that the Tennessee legisla- ture had acted to invalidate any licenses that had been issued.161 With a substantial base to work with in Texas, Schlichting decided that the naturopaths should address their own education issues by establishing a legitimate 4-year residency college within the state to be supported primarily by the Texas profession. Lack of “Class A natu- ropathic colleges,” Schlichting wrote in announcing the founding of SCNM to the profession, “is a threat to the perpetuation of our pro- fession.” In 1951 the Southern College of Naturopathic Medicine (SCNM) was chartered, and an agreement was made with the newly named Texas Southmost College—a 25-year-old institution previ- ously known as Brownsville Junior College and located in Brownsville, Texas, to serve as the home for SCNM. The administrative offices for were located in a building on the Texas Southmost campus, and the premed and basic science courses for SCNM students were taken through cross-enrollment at Texas Southmost. The first major event sponsored by SCNM was a 2-week postgraduate seminar cosponsored with the Texas Naturopathic Physicians Association and held on the Texas Southmost campus.162

## A Change of Identity

The summer of 1951 was eventful for the naturopaths for several rea- sons. Meeting in Miami Beach, Florida, the western ANA changed its name to the American Naturopathic Physicians and Surgeons Association (ANPSA), reelected Dr. Schlichting as its president, and established its corporate charter and located its headquarters in Des Moines, Iowa. The reasons behind this organizational restructuring were explained in articles by Schlichting and by A.R. Hedges in the September 1951 issue of what was now the Journal of the ANPSA. The changes were necessitated, they said, by the last resistance to the newly unified ANA continuing to lay claim to the name American Naturopathic Association. The group felt strong enough to take on a “post-Lustian” identity in representing the natural healing professions. Robert Carroll would likely have never accepted this one step. He proudly carried the banner of the ANA and felt—correctly—that he was entitled to do so. But Schlichting and Hedges felt that the pro- fession could use the new strength that came with licensed status for naturopaths in Texas, added to the existing licensed states, to support a modern profession, a reinvigorated educational system and a staunch commitment to the vital force. Carroll had always preached the value of science in explaining the theory of natural healing and the value of sup- porting work like Cannon’s vision of homeostasis. Schlichting preached the value of a professional identity as “family physicians” in a general family practice that included minor surgery and obstetrics. The new professional organization, he pointed out, was formed to “promote the public health and to perpetuate and advance the science, art and practice of the naturopathic school of medicine; to accomplish such objectives by attaining high standards of naturopathic education and by constantly stimulating and furthering the profession’s inter- est in and knowledge of the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of … disease and ill health.” As things trended upward for scientific natural healing in 1951, it was through this vision.163

## Medical Dominance Arises

But all of this began to change dramatically in 1953, and what seemed so promising at the beginning of the 1950s was totally eroded by the end of the decade. No developments demonstrated this as much as the history of natural healing in Texas over just 10 short years. The force of medical dominance began to rear its head in 1953 at the annual convention of the AMA. A resolution was introduced by the Alabama delegation to the House of Delegates to attack chiropractic and natu- ropathy at their “weakest point,” their school and colleges. At the behest of AMA leadership, this topic was referred to the AMA educational committee rather than passed on by the House of Delegates. The educational committee felt that the AMA should refrain at the time from weighing in directly on the schools and colleges of other profes- sions for political reasons, but the sentiment of the resolution was taken by AMA leadership as a strong interest by the medical profession in moving politically against these remaining “healing cults.” The matter was passed back to the state medical societies to deal with at the state level, with the full support of the national association.164 Historian Monte Poen called the AMA “the country’s richest and most influential post-World War II lobby.” In assessing the powerful effect of the AMA’s lobbying, Poen (from his research in the 1970s) noted that “As to the role played by organized medicine, I have become more impressed by the medical community’s ability to influence pub- lic opinion” in the post-WWII 1940s and 1950s.165 At the state level, organized medicine used its ability to influence public opinion to sway the views of mainstream newspapers, gov- ernment officials, and state legislators. This was important because professional legitimization is established in the United States on a state- by-state basis. This has been true since 1889 when the US Supreme Court decided Dent v. West Virginia. The history of this first medical licensing case is the subject of James Mohr’s Licensed to Practice: The Supreme Court Defines the American Medical Profession.166 Dent, the petitioner in the case, was an Eclectic physician at a time in history when there were three schools of medicine: the Regulars (called “allopaths” according to Samuel Hahnemann), the homeo- paths (as homeopathy was conceived by Hahnemann), and the Eclectics (which included the physio-medicalists). The Regulars in West Virginia founded the West Virginia Medical Society in 1867 and were the moving force behind the state licensing law adopted by the state legislature in 1882. By adopting legislation that required educa- tion at a Regular school, the licensing law barred practitioners from the two other schools of medicine from practicing in West Virginia. As David Korostyshevsky summarized the key aspects of the sit- uation in his review of Mohr’s book in the Journal of the History of Medicine167:

## 69CHAPTER 4 The History of Naturopathic Medicine

Grounding his analysis in both legal and medical historiographies, Mohr argues that while the American public supported public health efforts to control epidemic disease, medical licensing was not a popular reform. It was instead “a consciously engineered policy, drafted and passed through the concerted efforts of a specific subset of physicians, the elite Regulars” of the Medical Society of West Virginia (156 of Mohr). Mohr also challenges the interpretation that medical licensing was a response to the growing complexity of scientific medicine. Because scientific medicine did not produce tangible results until the 1930s, the push for medical licensing is a consequence of economic and political factors, not strictly scientific ones. Finally, Mohr shows that the Supreme Court upheld a ver- sion of medical licensing that relied on the quality of a physician’s education as the only measure of competence. Because the Regulars were the largest of the three schools of medi- cine in 19th-century America, the Dent decision allowed the Regulars to achieve the elimination of the two other schools on a state-by-state basis, which, by the early 20th century, went a long way toward elimi- nating the other schools.

# THE BEGINNING OF THE END

## The Texas Medical Wars

All of this became relevant to events in Texas just as the naturopaths under Schlichting’s leadership had begun to achieve success profes- sionally and to create an educational institution that would fill the void left by the NCA decision to require chiropractic schools to abandon the training of naturopaths. As Schlichting transferred the presidency of the ANPSA to Hedges in 1952, he focused even more on his posi- tion as secretary of the Texas State Naturopathic Examining Board.168 After Robert Carroll’s unexpected passing, Budden and Hedges further advanced natural healing in Oregon—and tried to secure natural heal- ing throughout the Pacific NW. Schlichting tried to do so in Texas at the same time, hoping to secure the Southwest (Texas in addition to Arizona) for natural healing as well. The success of the naturopaths in Texas was targeted by the Texas Medical Association and the Texas Medical Board in 1953. The med- ical campaign against the naturopaths began in a remarkable way. When the 1949 legislature adopted the Texas Naturopathic Act (Article 4950d, Vernon Codified Statutes), its passage was during the term in office of Texas Attorney General Price Daniel (1947–1953). When Schlichting, as secretary of the Texas State Board of Naturopathic Examiners, sought guidance from the attorney general (AG) on the “grandfather clause” of the Naturopathic Act in 1952, that guidance was provided under AG Opinion V-1486, dated July 29, 1952, directed to Schlichting as a state official seeking a necessary interpretation of state law. Such guidance to state officials was—and is—a function of the AG’s office under the Texas Constitution and Texas law. In 1953 Price Daniel—later a US Senator (1953–1957), governor of Texas (1957–1963), and justice of the Texas Supreme Court (1971– 1978)—was succeeded as AG by John Ben Shepherd. Shepherd’s office received a letter requesting consideration of two questions challenging naturopathic validity under the Texas Constitution from the criminal district attorney of San Antonio, Texas.169 That district attorney was considering bringing action against naturopaths in Bexar County, Texas, if the Naturopathic Act should be invalid. This action was being requested by the county medical society and state medical association. In this situation, the Texas AG can—on a discretionary basis— serve a unique function, that of “an alternate Supreme Court.”170 This function is discretionary, but with the matter under consideration by a new AG, briefs were solicited by the AG’s office and submitted on the issue. In spite of “three very able briefs” arguing in favor of the enforceability of the Naturopathic Act, G Opinion S-60, dated June 29, 1953, was issued, finding the act to violate the Texas Constitution: “SUMMARY: The Naturopathic Act, Article 4590d. V.C.S. violates the provisions of Art. XVI, Sec. 31 of the Constitution of Texas in that it gives a preference to one segment of the healing arts. To rule otherwise would require a holding that the Act is uncertain and indefinite and thus unconstitutional. State Ex. Rel. Halsted, 182 S.W. 2d 479 (Tex. Crim. 1944).” The complete loss of naturopathy in Texas and the end of the Texas career of Henry J. (“Doc”) Schlichting Jr., ND, would not be final for another 5 years. But this was the beginning of the end, and in the next 5 years Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, and Utah would be lost as well. Medical dominance as wielded by organized medicine was under way. The fallout for naturopaths in Texas after the AG Opinion S-60 issued in July 1953 developed slowly at first. The 1953 session of the Texas legislature had just ended 2 months earlier, so there was no immediate opportunity to seek legislative relief. At the same time, although AG Opinion S-60 had considerable meaning, it was not the same as a decision by the courts. Schlichting and the Texas NDs worked quietly behind the scenes to take stock of the situation and to plan how to proceed. Judging by the material in the Journal of the ANPSA and the Texas newspapers, a decision was made by the Texas Naturopathic Physicians Association not to publicize the problems created for the Texas NDs by the attorney general’s opinion.

## Back to Education: WSC and Natura Medicina

Events for naturopaths for the rest of 1953 largely took place outside of Texas. After the very successful ANPSA convention in Portland and the Western States commencement for the ND class of 1953, the news at the end of the year was the 5-years-in-the-making publication of Natura Medicina. Within the first year of work on Basic Naturopathy, it became apparent to the primary editors—H. Riley Spitler and Pers Nelson of Connecticut—that inclusion of medicinal substances used in naturopathy would need to be reserved for later so that Basic Naturopathy would be focused on and confined to theory. President Robert Carroll of the ANA appointed a committee in April of 1947 to prepare a textbook on medicinal substances in use in naturopathy. The committee was formally designated the Natura Medica, Formulary, and Therapeutics Committee. The committee first convened to arrange committee assignments at the 1947 convention in Detroit; A.W. Kuts- Cheraux had been appointed committee chair. Originally the sections for inclusion were vitamins, cell salts, botanicals, and endocrines.171 Correspondence was sent out by the committee to gather information from “the men in the field,” as Kuts-Cheraux reported to the convention in Salt Lake City. Several complications that emerged from this survey of the profession were outlined by the committee chair in this report: (1) many of the botanicals in use had not been “subjected to the usual chemical analyses, alkaloid and glucoside determination … physiological properties and pharmacological action is very vague”; (2) many favorite botanicals had been identified by practitioners in “homely lay terms”; (3) “many agents endorsed by some practitioners were condemned by others as of no value”; and (4) a major issue that had not been “satisfactorily settled” had been the inclusion of Harrison Act narcotics that had been legalized by the Florida courts for use. Five more years would be required to bring all of the committee’s work to its fruition.

## 70SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

The end product was worth the wait in general terms; the book was cutting edge in its contents and scope.172 In addition to Kuts-Cheraux, there were major contributions to the work by Dr. Herbert Clough on the formulary of selected botanicals and by Dr. Helena Winters of Kelso, Washington, on vitamins and tissue cell salts (with assis- tance from Dr. H. Riley Spitler, chief author of Basic Naturopathy). Reinforced by the entirety of the book’s approach to natural medi- cine was what had become the organizing philosophy of naturopaths in clinical practice: health and healing were emphasized rather than conventional medicine’s prevention and treatment of disease, the vital force and homeostasis were a critical core element of the philosophy, and suppressive pharmaceuticals with their side effects were to be avoided. But it arrived at an unfortunate time, just as the assault on naturo- paths and chiropractors by organized medicine was getting under way. The textbook, for instance, arrived too late to be put into use at Western States during the 1953–1954 school year. Dr. Budden’s unexpected death in August 1954 kept the textbook from ever being incorporated into the curriculum. And as events would play out, this cutting-edge work arrived as the naturopathic profession was con- tracted severely by governmental action in the mid-1950s. When Dr. Budden passed away, a remarkable force of nature, a remarkable liberal chiropractor, and a great naturopath was lost to the world and to natural healing. The Journal of the National Chiropractic Association for September 1954 had “A Tribute” by J.J. (John) Nugent, DC, director of education: Dr. W. A. Budden, director of the Western States College of Chiro- practic, Portland, Oregon, died suddenly in Portland on August 1, exactly one week after his return from a meeting of the Council on Education of the National Chiropractic Association. Dr. Budden was one of the pioneer leaders in chiropractic education … As much as any man in our profession, he espoused and introduced high educational standards in our schools. An important and forceful representative of our interests, his authoritative voice was respected and listened to in our legislative halls … To many, Dr. Budden’s passing will mean that a great chiro- practor, thinker, and educator has passed into history. And it is so! He was one of chiropractic’s great … He was a vigorous and indomitable fighter for truth as he saw it for freedom of the individual, and, above all, for intellectual integrity … We will miss him sorely, the … profession has suffered an irreparable loss … Dr. Budden was born a gentleman, and lived and died by that high code. We shall not forget him! What was true for chiropractic was true for naturopathy as far as Dr. Budden’s career and commitment were concerned. Both profes- sions owe a deep debt to Dr. Budden that should not be overlooked and certainly not forgotten. Events were building to a devastating outcome: the naturopaths were going to lose Western States College as an educational base and Texas as a professional base. When Dr. Budden died in August 1954, Western States itself was at a critical juncture. In the 6 months before Budden passed away, the three issues that would cause such trou- ble for Western States after his death had begun to appear on the horizon.

## WSC and Hard Times

First, the postwar boom fueled by the G.I. Bill was coming to an end. It is difficult to overstate the effect on the chiropractic colleges generally, and Western States specifically, of the G.I. Bill adopted by Congress as the Serviceman’s Readjustment Act of 1944. One of the main pro- visions of the act was the funding of higher education for those who elected this benefit. The funding available covered all of the costs of higher education: tuition, fees, and textbooks. This was true at public and private liberal arts universities and colleges but also true at WSC. By the time the act expired, almost 3 million veterans had attended institutions of higher education nationally, paid for by the federal government.173 Second, the new matriculation requirements that Budden had established at WSC and had convinced the Oregon legislature to put into law were taking effect. In an article entitled “The Aspects of Two Years Preprofessional Study as an Entrance Requirement,” published in the Journal of the National Chiropractic Association in March 1954, Budden noted that “economically, the schools … that follow the two- year plan must expect to experience an, at least temporary, set back in revenue, and it would certainly be unwise … for an institution to venture in [this] direction unless its financial underpinning is of the caliber to absorb the shock through the lean years.” Third, the issue of Dr. Budden continuing the WSC of Naturopathy began to become a serious irritation within the Council on Education (COE) of the NCA. Indeed, there is every indication that only Dr. Budden’s personal standing within the NCA and the COE kept the issue from becoming a more persistent matter while he was alive. At the semiannual meeting of the COE held February 11 to 13, 1954, in San Antonio, Texas, Budden raised the subject himself. The minutes for Friday afternoon, February 12, 1954, reflect that “Dr. Budden asked for a frank and open discussion on the Naturopathic issue.”174 The conversation continued for the rest of the afternoon and again the next morning, as reflected in the minutes. Dr. John Nugent “reminded Dr. Budden that the Western States College was the only remaining school on the accredited list that still conducted a course in Naturopathy.” Dr. Budden set out his position on the matter. It was better to “sustain a reputable school of naturopathy” to establish an educational standard that legislatures could look to. Legislation in both Idaho and South Dakota that would have diluted educational stan- dards substantially had been defeated by pointing to Western States as the baseline for naturopathic education. On that note, the afternoon adjournment was taken. When matters picked up the next morning, “Dr. Budden gave a complete review of the history of naturopathy and asked the Council to give him concise opinions and expression of decision” that he could share with the WSC Board of Directors so that “future poli- cies of Western States College could be determined.” Budden was reminded that at the midyear meeting in 1950, both Dr. Janse of National, together with his administrator, and Dr. Budden had been told to discontinue courses in naturopathy. Dr. Budden’s Canadian protégé Dr. A.E. Homewood (dean of the Canadian Memorial College of Chiropractic [CMCC], chartered in 1945) “inquired as to the atti- tude of the Council” if the CMCC initiated courses in naturopathy “to accommodate those Provinces in Canada that sustained naturopathic laws?” Budden also inquired “whether the Council had the right to remove a college from the accredited list if it continued to conduct a naturopathic course?”

a degree or otherwise; (2) Dr. Budden was advised to tell the directors of the Health Resource Foundation as the governors of WSC that “rec- ommended that the course and school of naturopathy as conducted at Western States College be discontinued as soon as obligations and commitments could be fulfilled or terminated”; and (3) the council “does have the right to remove a college from the accredited list if a naturopathic program was operated concurrently with the chiroprac- tic program at an accredited school.” Three weeks later Dr. Budden presided over the 1954 commence- ment for a class of four ND degree recipients and 26 DC degree recip- ients, 13 of whom also received the BTS degree.175 This was the state of matters when Dr. Budden passed away suddenly in August of that year—1954.

## Back to Texas

In 1954 Schlichting left most of the national efforts to A.R. Hedges, who had the advantage of working from Oregon and so of having a stable licensing situation around him. The year was spent in Texas get- ting ready for the 1955 legislative session and weathering a summer of bad news that was beyond the profession’s immediate control. Harry Hoxsey was a controversial figure before naturopathy was licensed in Texas in 1949, if not widely known outside the Southwest. After being pursued in the Midwest and charged with practicing medicine without a license for the use of his Hoxsey cancer treatment, Hoxsey opened his Dallas cancer clinic, which grew to a substantial patient volume by the early 1950s.176

## The Texas Medical Wars

Relevant to naturopathy in Texas, Harry Hoxsey applied for licens- ing in 1950 under the grandfather provisions of the Texas law, and under the statute, he was deemed qualified to be licensed. First Carroll, and then Schlichting, kept Hoxsey away from the ANA/ANPSA, although Hoxsey had his supporters. But in 1954 when Hoxsey was in the national headlines and consistently reported on in the Dallas newspapers, he was called “the Dallas Naturopath who runs a cancer clinic,” and headlines like “Dallas Naturopath Enjoined from Claiming Cancer Cure” appeared. Hoxsey, with the backing of a Pennsylvania state senator, had opened a cancer treatment clinic in the Miners Hospital in Spangler, Pennsylvania. The facility was run by the United Mineworkers Union, and the senator was the hospital’s administrator. Convinced of Hoxsey’s success in cancer treatment the full backing of the facility was arranged. But at this point, the federal government moved in to bar the ship- ment of Hoxsey treatment preparations from Texas to Pennsylvania and the use of the “drugs” in that state. Several months of publicity about the legal dispute joined together “naturopath” and “fake can- cer cure” in news coverage. None of this would prove helpful when the Texas legislature went into session in January 1955 and the Texas Naturopathic Physicians Association (TNPA) sought to have legisla- tion passed that would overcome the AG’s objection to the naturo- pathic law adopted in 1949. The TNPA legislative committee under Schlichting’s chairmanship hired a well-placed executive secretary who had been the executive director of the Texas American Legion to pursue a legislative fix to the licensing situation. New legislation was prepared with the assistance of former legislators who were practicing attorneys with an eye to resolv- ing the AG’s constitutional concerns. The legislation—House Bill 6—was introduced in the state House of Representatives in January at the start of the legislative session. It was quickly passed out of the House Public Health Committee, catching the medical profession off- guard. Then, just as quickly, members of the House started receiving a “flood of protests [that] began to pile up on legislators’ desks.” In mid-February, the bill was sent to the State Affairs Committee by a 92-46 vote of the House, where the legislation died.177

## More Hard Times at WSC

After Dr. Budden’s sudden passing, the leadership of the governing board of WSC—the Health Research Foundation (HRF)—fell to Dr. Milton Higgens of Couer d’Alene, Idaho. Dr. Higgens was himself a DC, ND, although Idaho had not licensed naturopaths. Dr. Higgens had been the Idaho representative to the NCA for several years and had been a friend and colleague of Dr. Budden and a director of the HRF for many years as well. Higgens realized in short order that the HRF would have to succeed Dr. Budden in setting WSC policy and that he would need to find someone to take over day-to-day management of WSC as well.178 In December 1954, Dr. Ralph Failor, DC, ND, a Portland-based alumnus of WSC (a class of 1953 member) signed on to do this job. As correspondence between Dr. Failor and Dr. Higgens demon- strates that Failor was established at WSC as more of a senior VP; he managed the college day to day on-site but with tightly constrained authority. He wrote full letters to Dr. Higgens once or twice a week and sought and accepted guidance from Dr. Higgens constantly. Dr. Higgens’s guidance came in responsive correspondence, also once or twice a week. The Failor–Higgens correspondence from December 1954 through April 1955, has three constant themes: on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis finances were very tight; the prospects for the future were very bleak; and the chiropractic and naturopathic professions were no help, although they were always “supportive”—lots of “thoughts and prayers.” The professions were particularly frustrating to Dr. Failor. As of April 1955, Dr. Failor had met with the “liberal” DCs of Oregon and Washington as well as the NDs from both states and the NDs from British Columbia. The DCs in Oregon were “supportive” but more concerned that the NCA needed to help the practicing profes- sion more than anything. Legislative matters kept arising, and Dr. Budden was not around to address these anymore. The Washington NDs and “liberal,” NCA-connected DCs needed WSC’s structural appearance for their purposes, more than the actual institution; both professional groups needed to be able to cite WSC as the “model” for DC and ND education but took the existence of the college for granted. Nothing highlighted this more than a proposal from the Oregon NDs when Dr. Failor met with their leadership to ask for financial help. As communicated by Dr. Failor to Dr. Higgens: “They asked if we would accept money sufficient to put out a Naturopathic cata- logue. I said yes we would. Then, they said, well that is contingent on your [sic] writing the catalogue as we want it written.” Meetings with the Washington NDs focused on the NDs submitting legislation that would use the WSC curriculum as an educational model. Dr. Failor had received contact from both the Florida and South Carolina ND Boards asking for catalogs from WSC to document that an ND educational institution did exist. Dr. Failor wrote to Dwight James, the national executive secretary, to clarify the situation; on behalf the national AANP, Mr. James offered “that the word phytotherapy instead of Herbology, and Naturopathic Medicine instead of non-medical was to be almost a must in the new issue [of the catalogue].” By the end of the spring term in 1955, Dr. Failor had become frus- trated and dismayed by what he saw as WSC’s financial status and even more so with what he saw as WSC’s financial prognosis. As early as February 1955, Dr. Failor was recommending to the trustees of the Health Resource Foundation that governed WSC that the doors be closed, but the Board refused this assessment.

## 72SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

As Western State’s historian Lester Lamm described the situation in the first academic year after Dr. Budden’s death: Unfortunately for Dr. Failor, he unknowingly accepted the leader- ship position at the beginning of one of the most troubling periods in the college’s history. The deluge of postwar students that cre- ated the boom period dried up overnight, leaving the college to face almost insurmountable financial difficulties. In response to student demands for a better education in better facilities, the college had moved to a new campus in 1947. It had retooled its curriculum, increased its admission requirements, added new faculty and staff, and assumed additional obligations in anticipation of a financially robust future. In short, by 1955, the college was overextended. The peak year of G.I. Bill college enrollment nationally was 1947. Across the country. institutions of higher education scrambled to accom- modate demand, adding and improving facilitates and faculty. As Lamm noted, WSC was part of this great national response to a newly created marketplace for higher education that became a core piece of the post- war American middle class. This cumulative effect on Western States was borne out by a March 1955 report by Dr. Failor to the HRF Board: At a meeting of the board a month later, Dr. Failor shared a com- pilation of enrollment data from the previous four years. The trend was beyond alarming; it prognosticated doom. 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1 1950–511.1.1.1.1.1.1.2 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3 1951–521.1.1.1.1.1.1.4 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5 1952–531.1.1.1.1.1.1.6 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.7 1953–541.1.1.1.1.1.1.8 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.9 Spring 19551.1.1.1.1.1.1.10 Only 24 students were projected to enroll in the fall class. The declining enrollment through 1953 to 1954 was consistent with the G.I. Bill wave effect, and by the fall of 1954, it was known that the G.I. Bill benefits were scheduled to expire in June 1956 and were not expected to be further extended by the Congress. This meant that students who enrolled after the fall term in 1952 would at some point have to pay their own way. For the entering class of 1954–1955 (the class of 1958), the numbers were further depressed by the new 2-year college attendance prerequisite. Dr. Failor reported that of 49 solid applications for admis- sion in the fall term of 1954, 30 were advised that they did not meet the entrance requirements, and only 19 students could be accepted.

## Dr. Failor and WSC’s School of Naturopathy

Some of this was undoubtedly foreseen by Dr. Budden, and it seemed like Dr. Budden had been forced to navigate the choppy seas of being a DC, ND “schoolman” for 25 years. What his plan might have been, though, no one seemed to know. The HRF Board was now two mem- bers who had worked with Dr. Budden for years plus Dr. Budden’s replacement directly recruited by Dr. Nugent of the Council of Education of the NCA. They continually instructed Dr. Failor to stay the course and carry out Dr. Budden’s vision. It was hard, though, for Dr. Failor to see the way. As Dr. Lamm reports: Dr. Failor met with a number of naturopathic trade organizations throughout the Pacific Northwest over the subsequent months to solicit support. Most in the naturopathic community voiced sup- port of the college, but little in the way of direct financial backing ever materialized. What did materialize, however, was the natu- ropaths’ growing resentment for the lack of representation on the HRF board and at the college. The naturopathic community had not gotten over being ignored when they first brought their con- cerns about equitable representation to Dr. Budden in 1948. Dr. Failor’s appeal to the naturopaths for support only widened the rift between the two disciplines. Dr. Budden had always been in a position to speak to the natu- ropaths as one of them. This personal relationship earned over years was gone. Unlike 1948, Robert Carroll was not around to tell the naturopaths to “buck up” and support the only school that they had. In May 1955, matters came to a head at a special meeting of the HRF Board with the naturopaths of WSC, plus members of the natu- ropathic and chiropractic professions from Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia—those most affected by developments at WSC. This meeting followed a meeting on the evening of Thursday, May 12, 1955, of Dr. Failor, Dr. Higgens, and Dr. Williamson, the secre- tary of the HRF Board of Trustees. Also present by invitation were two well-placed DC, NDs, Drs. Ralph Hill and Ross Elliott. The discussion focused on the “paramount” financial issues: that monthly revenue was $4000, whereas expenses were $500; with faculty underpaid, fixed costs deemed “excessive,” and “old, delinquent accounts” also deemed excessive. Further discussed was that the HRF trustees were constantly accused of falsifying the financial status (i.e., “crying poor”), carrying out a “silence campaign” (i.e., refusing to provide specifics publicly), and that “Dr. Higgens was trying to close the College.” Also, the various DC and ND professional interests in Oregon and Washington were discussed as they affected WSC. These interests were summarized in the meeting minutes: “Chiropractic: O.A.C.P. Liberals—want controls; Advertisers—want controls; Straights—want no part; Naturopaths: Nature Group—want no part; Medical Group— want shots and medicine included in the Naturopathic Curriculum at College (Not permissible under our Charter.).” In short, the profes- sional groups either wanted much more say where the college was con- cerned or had no interest in the affairs of the college. Drs. Higgens and Williamson decided, according to the minutes, to “call a meeting of the Full Board for Saturday, May 14th, 1955.” In addition to the HRF Board, it was determined that the professional groups, specifically including the OACP and “officials of the natu- ropathic Physicians,” would be invited to provide “council [sic] and suggestions.” On the afternoon of May 14, the meeting took place. Unfortunately, a reading of the minutes of the meeting can only be summarized as “things went badly.”

## Naturopathy in the Cross Hairs

Dr. A.R. Hedges—then finishing his third year as the president of the national naturopaths (now named the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians [AANP])—could not attend due to a fam- ily illness. This was unfortunate, as from the notes of the meeting, it appeared that Dr. Higgens and Dr. Hedges got along, but most tell- ingly, it appeared that Dr. Higgens and Dr. Bleything did not—or at least that Dr. Bleything was suspicious of Dr. Higgens’s longtime mem- bership in and connections with the NCA and Higgens’s friendship with Dr. John Nugent of the NCA. One of the issues that had the naturopaths most agitated was the attitude of the Council on Education of the NCA. As Dr. Lamm reports: Sensitive information contained in correspondence and conversa- tions between WSC and the Council on Education had been leaked to the naturopaths. Most alarming to the naturopaths was the suggestion that WSC would be denied accreditation from NCE if it didn’t discontinue offering the ND degree … A letter from the CE was read to the attendees, which clearly described its position

<!-- chunk -->

## 73CHAPTER 4 The History of Naturopathic Medicine

regarding the relationship between the two professions. Even though the letter contained no threat from the CE to deny WSC accreditation, it was clear a “divorce” was being encouraged. The attitude that drove the Council on education—made up of the other NCA “schoolmen”—was summarized by Dr. Higgens as “[the] Association felt that WSC was taking too many Chiropractic students and making Naturopaths of them.” Higgens told the naturo- paths at the meeting that Dr. Nugent—even though as the director of education for the NCA he reported to the Council, and was therefore “the Messenger”—was “recommending against great pressure that we continue Naturopathy at WSC, is fighting the battle for us in the NCA.” And in fairness, Dr. Budden did not take chiropractic students and make them into naturopaths; he took students and made them into chiropractic and chiropractic-naturopathic physicians. And as Higgens told the meeting, there “is no difference between Chiropractic and naturopathy, in this state [Oregon] where most men have two licenses—most do not know which they are practicing under.” Events over the next year would bear out what Higgens said about Dr. Nugent. Although Dr. Nugent generally did not favor dual-degree programs, he had been a staunch friend and admirer of Dr. Budden as a schoolman and honored Dr. Budden’s vision after Budden was gone. The rest of the schoolmen on the NCA Council had tolerated Budden’s position while he was alive, on the Council and in their midst. They were not inclined to be tolerant after Dr. Budden could no longer argue the case himself. Bleything told Higgens at the meeting that if naturopaths were on the Board of the HRF and therefore had more say about the future of WSC, the naturopathic profession would contribute to the college. The overriding concern appearing in the meeting minutes was that the NCA Council would threaten to strip WSC’s accreditation unless the naturopathy program was dropped and that because the HRF Board was three chiropractors now, they would abandon the ND program if the threat was made. Higgens acknowledged that this could materialize as soon as the July NCA meeting. Bleything told the meeting, and Higgens, that if the HRF Board was expanded from three to five and the new seats were given to the naturopaths to fill, the naturopaths would commit finan- cial resources to WSC, as the matter had been put before the Oregon Naturopathic Physicians Association, stating, “If Naturopathic profes- sion gets representation on that Board you will get $10,000 without bowing to Nugent or anybody else.” Higgens was openly resistant to expanding the Board, but when the meeting ended at 5:45 that after- noon, the HRF founders group convened to Dr. Failor’s office, and by six they announced that they had voted to expand the HRF Board to five members, at least two DCs and two NDs. Dr. Higgens had become the dominant player in the present and future of WSC since the passing of Dr. Budden. He was dedicated to the continuing existence of Western States as a chiropractic college, accredited by the National Chiropractic Association. From his corre- spondence with Dr. Failor, it is apparent that although he had his own dedication to the School of Naturopathy, he had no expectations that the naturopathic profession would be of any financial help in the effort to keep the school open. He had learned through Dr. Failor’s efforts not to have expectations of the Oregon DCs as well. As an executive director of the NCA, he did have expectations of the NCA Council on Education and the NCA generally. Critical to him, as a result, was maintaining NCA accreditation. On June 4, 1955, the 46th Annual Commencement of the Western States College of Chiropractic and Naturopathy was held. In spite of financial pressures, WSC was still open, and in spite of the critical obser- vations by the Council of the NCA, 22 doctor of chiropractic degrees and 1 doctor of naturopathy were awarded (along with three X-Ray Technician Certificates and two Laboratory Technician Certificates). The NCA met in early July, and although the Council minutes from that meeting reflect no on-the-record discussion of the WSC natu- ropathy program, immediately after the Council meeting, the HRF reversed itself and reinstated the three-member Board provision. For whatever reason, no financial commitment to WSC ever materialized from the naturopaths, and as of the 1955–1956 school year, the matter remained unresolved, with the naturopathy program under a cloud.

# THE END

Things remained as dire as they had been during the main school year as the summer term was to begin. Dr. Failor had advised Dr. Higgens in correspondence that Dr. Bleything would organize and run the sum- mer term on a no-pay basis. Bleything and others who similarly vol- unteered taught the summer term, and on September 27, 1955, 13 of the DC graduates from June received their ND degrees, and the lone ND graduate from June—Canadian Robert Fleming—received his DC degree. But neither the school nor the naturopathy program was out of the woods. Dr. Lamm writes: By the July 23, 1955, meeting of the HRF board, it was apparent to the trustees that continuing an affiliation with the naturopaths would be problematic if WSC was to achieve accreditation. At the meeting it was said, ‘We are privileged to continue naturopathy … [until] we can gracefully work out a solution.’ … It was clear by the reaction of the naturopaths that financial support for the college would not be found with them. How or why this “was clear” based on events between May 19 and July 23 does not seem clear. It seems that before the addition of two new members to the Board could be implemented, and presumably based on issues that arose during the NCA meeting in Atlantic City, July 4–8, 1955, the Board withdrew the one condition that the natu- ropaths put on their financial support for WSC. (The minutes of the Council on Education meeting during this NCA annual convention do not reflect any on-the-record discussion of the naturopathy pro- gram. Dr. Failor was present and participated in the 3 days of Council meetings, which focused considerable attention to the 2-year college preparation admission requirement.) How or why the naturopaths let the established WSC naturopa- thy program be discontinued is lost in the fog of history. It is clear that the naturopaths associated with Western States trusted Dr. Budden and worked well with the Oregon Association of Chiropractic Physicians, the Oregon NCA affiliate. Indeed, as Dr. Higgens observed, the professions in Oregon had substantial overlapping membership. But Dr. Failor, as a DC, ND, asked for help that was not forthcom- ing: “Dr. Failor met with a number of naturopathic trade organiza- tions throughout the Pacific Northwest over the subsequent months to solicit support. Most in the naturopathic community voiced sup- port of the college, but little in the way of direct financial backing ever materialized.” So the determination of whether to continue the naturopathy pro- gram or not was left to the HRF Board and its dealings with the NCA Council, which was hostile to the naturopathy program. Again, in fair- ness, Dr. Higgens told the Washington NDs in January and again in March that they should dispatch a representative or representatives of their own to the NCA Council to present the naturopathy program as an integral part of Western States and ask that both WSC’s ND pro- gram and its accreditation be maintained as they had been during Dr. Budden’s lifetime. But they never did so.

## The End, Part

Matters came to a head during the midyear NCA Council meeting in Toronto, Canada, February 15–17, 1956, as reflected in the meeting minutes. In September 1955, as the 1955–1956 school year had begun, Dr. Higgens had stepped in to try to at least stabilize WSC’s finances: In response to a clearly desperate situation and in an effort to bring about financial stability, Dr. Higgens stepped forward on Sept. 8, 1955, and committed his personal assets by securing a $39,000 mortgage on behalf of the college and took out a $10,000 life insur- ance policy, naming the college as beneficiary. This was not the first time Dr. Higgens had reached for his checkbook to rescue the college, nor would it be the last. Regardless of the deteriorating situ- ation at the college, and perhaps in spite of it, he was committed to doing everything possible to guarantee survival of WSC. If WSC had been Dr. Budden’s school for 25 years, it was now firmly Dr. Higgens’s school, governed by him and the two fellow chiro- practors on the HRF Board. At the meeting in May 1955, Dr. Higgens had been openly questioned about his personal commitment to con- tinuing WSC as a School of Chiropractic and Naturopathy. By the time of the February 1956 NCA Council meeting, it seems apparent that Dr. Higgens’s commitment was to maintain an NCA-accredited School of Chiropractic, even—or perhaps especially—if that meant dropping the Naturopathy program at WSC. Although Dr. Failor, as the day-to-day manager of WSC in-the-trenches would have welcomed the financial support of the naturopaths and could have saved the Naturopathy pro- gram if support had been forthcoming, when support never material- ized, the decision was really that of Dr. Higgens. The minutes of the February NCA Council meeting tell the story. Dr. Failor had advised that he could not attend and represent WSC “because of pressing responsibilities at the college.” And, one assumes, because of the cost of attending the meeting. The meeting was scheduled for 3 days, Wednesday, February 8, through Friday, February 10, 1956. The “first point of consideration placed before the Council from the prepared agenda was the matter of the Western States College of Portland, Oregon, still conducting a course in naturopathy” (emphasis provided). The Chair of the Council (Dr. Thure Peterson) read an “extended statement” prepared by Dr. Nugent and sent to Dr. Higgens “in relation to the matter.” The posi- tion set out in the statement was to advise Dr. Higgens and the HRF Board that the Council “considers it inopportune for any of the accred- ited colleges to seek to sustain a naturopathic course.” The Council further “encouraged the board to consider the neces- sity of discontinuing the course as soon as possible, even at cost and sac- rifice of certain advantages that it might represent” (emphasis provided). Council member Dr. Hendricks noted that it was time for Western States to join Los Angeles and National and “discontinue its affiliations with the naturopathic profession.” Failure to do so “would constitute an embarrassment to the Council.” Then Dr. Nugent spoke, and it was apparent that he—regardless of personal feelings on naturopathic programs—felt bound to try to honor the lifelong commitment of his friend and colleague Dr. Budden: Dr. Nugent sought to advise the Council that relinquishing the naturopathic course by Western States College would impose on the college and its board of trustees tremendous economic prob- lems and rob it of certain allegiance … It was the conviction of Dr. Nugent that a decision by Western States College to discontinue the naturopathic course would deal a severe blow to naturopathy and that unless the profession were to organize its own school it might well represent the demise of the profession … With Western States out of the picture of naturopathic education only two schools would be left that issued naturopathic degrees and these were institutions of minor quality and influence; namely the Great lakes College of Mechanotherapy and in Dayton, Ohio, and Spitler College of Naturopathy in Eaton, Ohio. These observations by Dr. Nugent came straight from Dr. Budden’s long-stated positions expressed during many talks on the subject with Dr. Nugent and others in NCA leadership. In deference to Dr. Budden, Dr. Nugent set this entire argument out for the Council. He then communicated that these may not be the concerns of the cur- rent HRF Board governing WSC. Dr. Nugent told the Council that “upon the death of Dr. Budden, he [Dr. Nugent] had been asked by Dr. Higgens to help manage the Western States [College] and to help solve the naturopathic situation … that Dr. Higgens, personally, had invested thousands of dollars in the Western State College [because of his intimate friendship with Dr. Budden], yet he was ready to sacrifice the same if the naturopathic problem could be resolved; that he, Dr. Higgens, was anxious to have the Western States College sever its asso- ciation with naturopathic education.” After all was considered “it was the general disposition of the Council that patience should be exercised in relation to the circum- stances of Western State College,” as through “the death of Dr. Budden … the present administration and board of trustees of the college had inherited many compromising and not readily solved problems.” Dr. Nugent advised the Council that he was certain that before the Council meetings concluded, “he would obtain word that “a definite deci- sion to eliminate the naturopathic course at Western States had been consummated.”

## And Naturopathy Is Finished at WSC

And so it was. As the Council convened on the morning of Friday, February 10, the Council was to hear the report of the Council on Educational Standards (Accrediting Committee). The Accrediting Committee proposed that the Council adopt a resolution that Western States “beginning September 1, … should seek to discontinue students for training in naturopathy” and “terminate its commitment to those naturopathic students enrolled.” Dr. Nugent advised that he had spoken several times to Drs. Higgens and Failor since Wednesday morning, and that they understood that this step would be necessary “although it would involve extended financial loss and … the college might not be able to survive.” Further that they had announced the day before during an all-school meeting that the decision had been made to discontinue the naturopathic course.” The Council meeting minutes note that the Council had received a copy of “A Statement of Policy on Western States College” that con- stituted the formal announcement of the decision to all concerned, and that the Council had responded through the Council secretary, Dr. Janse, acknowledging the “courage and integrity” that this decision had required. Within a short period of time, the naturopaths associ- ated with Western States determined to start an independent naturop- athy program, initially intended to provide an ND program for WSC’s DC graduates who were desirous of an ND degree. In July, three NDs previously associated with WSC, Drs. Bleything, Spaulding, and Stone, chartered an Oregon not-for-profit corporation, the National College of Naturopathic Medicine (NCNM). But this separation was the kind of “divorce” that left both parties worse off. Dr. Higgens had clearly hoped that the NCA would lend financial assistance to WSC with the “naturopathic issue” resolved. Instead, WSC suffered a severe enrollment decline and financial dis- tress for almost 15 years, with average DC class sizes of 12 to 15 and a total enrollment of 50 to 60. The NCA responded with “hopes and

prayers,” restricted accreditation, and suggestions that WSC should be merged with either Los Angeles or National—the two stronger pro- grams with which they had a historical affinity. Meantime, the NCNM proved to be a difficult proposition, as the ND profession of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia tried to build a 4-year residency program. It was 15 years before the program— moved to Seattle in terms of actual facilities—began to have decent attendance in the early 1970s. And all of this had taken its toll on Dr. Failor, DC, ND, as well. As Dr. Lamm reports: Dr. Failor approached the Oregon Association of Chiropractic Phy- sicians (OACP) with his doubts that the college could survive beyond July 1, 1956. The total student population was 73 and a number of disgruntled students announced their plans to transfer to the new naturopathic program starting in the fall. Dr. Higgins appealed to the National Chiropractic Association to support a policy compelling all chiropractic colleges to adopt a two-year, pre-professional college education admissions requirement. The NCA refused to budge. By summer 1956, frustration with lack of support from the NCA, CE, OACP, NDs and DCs; compounded by the student, staff and faculty discontent on campus and a worsening financial situation at the college was more than Dr. Failor was willing to tolerate any longer. He submitted his letter of resignation to the HRF. Even though he had repeatedly recommended closure of the college and left the institution saddened and disappointed, he was effective in instituting stopgap measures that kept the college solvent. Without Dr. Failor’s efforts, the college would have closed. The educational structure of naturopaths had been severely dam- aged. And in Texas, the profession began to suffer damage as well.

## Back to the Texas Medical Wars

The full story of the 1955 Texas legislative session where the naturo- paths were concerned would not be told until the legislature recon- vened in 1957, but by now, it had become well known that the AG had determined the old law unconstitutional. After the legislature recessed without action, the state comptroller refused to pay any further warrants issued by the existing Naturopathic Examining Board given the AG’s ruling, effectively putting the Board out of business.179 In January 1956, using legal counsel retained by the TNPA, the Board filed suit against the comptroller asking the court to uphold the statute and order the comptroller to pay its bills. In May 1956, the district court judge hearing the case ruled in favor of the Naturopathic Examining Board and against the comptroller rep- resented by the AG. The district court upheld the statute as constitu- tional as to the licensing and registration of naturopaths and directed the payment of warrants issued by the Board. The comptroller’s office filed an appeal, and the matter began working its way through the Texas appellate courts. In 1957 matters played themselves out badly for the Texas natu- ropaths in a very public way.180 The 1957 Texas legislative session began in late January 1957. At the time, the appellate case on the constitutionality of the 1949 statute was pending. Henry Schlichting had been succeeded as president of the TNPA by Howard Harman of San Antonio. The naturopaths were trying in this session to once again get legislation passed that would deal with the AG’s opinion. At the end of February, Dr. Harmon went to the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives with a tape recording on which a member of the Texas House appeared to solicit a bribe to withdraw legislation that would repeal the 1949 law and ban naturopaths from practicing in Texas. This led to House investigative committee proceedings, a grand jury investigation, an indictment against the legislator, and the legislator’s conviction. All of this played out between March 1957 and September 1957, with constant newspaper coverage throughout the state of Texas. It also had two unfortunate effects: few legislators wanted to have any- thing to do with the naturopaths while this was going on, and first the House investigative committee and then the grand jury dug up the story of the naturopaths’ activities during the 1955 legislative session. What emerged was that the naturopaths had raised a “war chest” of as much as $52,000 for the 1955 session and had spread around among members of the legislature perhaps as much as $37,000 or more to try to get legislation passed. In 2018 dollars, this would be $480,000 dollars raised and $345,000 passed out in legislative “cash gifts.” It was rumors of this type of largesse that drew the interest of a young member of the House of Representatives to Harmon as TNPA president while he was in Austin—the state capital—for the 1957 session. The bribe solicited was $5000 total, $3000 for the representative and $2000 to share “with others.” In 2018 dollars, this would be $45,000 total, $28,000 for the representative, and $17,000 to “share.” The naturopath caught up in the inquiry into the 1955 legislative activities of the Texas Naturopathic Physicians Association was Henry J. Schlichting Jr.

## Texas Medical Wars Continued—1957

While the 1957 Texas legislative fireworks were playing out, the legal process was playing out at the same time.181 In late January 1957, as the legislative session was getting under way, the Texas Court of Appeals upheld the AG’s opinion and reversed the district court. The court held that the 1949 Naturopathic Act was unconstitutional, as the AG’s opinion had concluded. The legal effect, as stated by the court, was to completely undo the legislative gains that the naturopaths had been granted under the 1949 “deal” that had given the medical profession a Basic Science Law: “The judgment of the Trial Court is reversed and judgment is here rendered declaring the Naturopathy Act, Art. 4590d V.A.C.S., void” (emphasis provided). In February, Dr. Howard Harmon of the Texas Naturopathic Physicians Association tape-recorded House of Representatives mem- ber James Cox soliciting a bribe and took the recording to the Speaker of the House. In March, a legislative investigative committee was con- vened by the Speaker and—after an emotional “farewell” address to the House—Cox tendered his resignation, which was accepted by the governor. In April, a grand jury was convened, which took testimony about the bribe allegations and also about another matter that had emerged during the legislative hearing: allegations of a “slush fund” that had been used by the TNPA during the 1955 legislative session to “educate” House members with regard to legislation proposed by the TNPA after the AG’s opinion had been issued in 1953. If these assertions about the size of the “slush fund” and the extent of “educational” efforts were true, it had been for naught in 1955. The remedial legislation had been reported out of the House Public Health Committee early in the 1955 session—allegedly as a result of the TNPA “education” efforts—only to die before going any further. When the bill was quickly pushed through the committee process, the medical association took note, and before the matter could come to the House floor for a vote, a “flood of protests” from MDs “began to pile up on legislator’s desks,” and the bill stalled. As the House investigation was proceeding in April, the statements of a “mystery witness” were produced by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). The committee abruptly stopped its hearings and referred the matter to the grand jury. In mid-April, the grand jury heard from other NDs appearing before them about the “mystery wit- ness,” who was identified as Henry Schlichting Jr. Other NDs told the

press that “Schlichting was the only person who knew how the asso- ciation’s money was spent during past sessions of the legislature.” On April 30, 1957, the grand jury heard from Schlichting, who had given a lengthy interview and sworn statement to the Texas DPS the week before. After his appearance, Schlichting steadfastly gave “no comment” statements to the press, and never did he disclose what he testified to, nor the details of what the TNPA had done with its “slush funds” and “educational” efforts over many years. Another ND who appeared before the grand jury told the press that Schlichting “held his hand on the purse strings since 1943 and still does [in 1957].” But whatever Schlichting disclosed to DPS investigators and the grand jury in March and April of 1957, no indictments were ever issued against anyone accept Representative Cox for soliciting the bribe from Dr. Harmon. But the entire Harmon–Cox–naturopaths bribery affair had a dampening effect on both the 1957 legislative session and the natu- ropaths as an interest group desperately needing legislative action. In an extensive two-part investigative report,182 a reporter for the El Paso Herald-Post noted for the “Frantic Fifty-Fifth” legislative session that lobbyists had gone into hibernation when “the naturopaths got cute with their tape recorders” as the legislature began “shaking with a severe case of capital J jitters resulting from the naturopath tape recording in the Representative Cox bribery scandal.” Just as signifi- cant for the naturopaths was the direct effect on them: You won’t find any naturopaths trying to influence legislation during these nervous days. They’re now on the inactive list as far as lobbying is concerned—maybe because they figure they’ve raised their share of turmoil this session, or because they’re too busy tes- tifying before the Travis County Grand Jury, whose deliberations are being watched with such big interest by the legislators … Dr. Howard Harmon, the naturopath lobbyist whose tape recording brought about the Cox indictment, hasn’t eased the situation any with his forecast that half a dozen lawmakers besides Representa- tive Cox have ample reason to worry.183 In so many ways, these developments could not have come at a worse time for the naturopaths in Texas. On May 1, 1957—the day after Schlichting appeared before the grand jury as the “mystery witness”— the Texas Supreme Court refused to hear the writ of error (appeal) by the Naturopathic Board of Examiners from the court of appeals deci- sion against the 1949 Naturopathy Act. On June 12, 1957, the Texas Supreme Court rejected a request for rehearing of the application for a writ of error, leaving the naturopaths without any further relief at the state-court level. Within 60 days, the naturopaths applied for relief from the US Supreme Court; throughout these various legal steps, the Texas courts stayed enforcement of practicing medicine violations pending the final legal determination of the validity of the 1949 law. In October, former representative Cox went on trial for bribery, and the newspapers throughout the state had the naturopaths on the front pages again. After the testimony of Dr. Harman and the play- ing of the recording that Harman had produced, Cox was found guilty as charged. On November 12, 1957 the US Supreme Court declined review of the Texas court decisions on the 1949 naturopathy law.

## Texas—The End

On December 3, a massive statewide series of legal actions was taken across 27 Texas counties184 coordinated by the Texas AG, who vowed to “run the naturopaths out of Texas.” In the first “test case” arising out these actions taken in the name of the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners, an injunction was entered on December 9 against Henry Schlichting, enjoining him from continuing to practice naturopathy in the state of Texas without a license to practice medicine. Multiple other injunctions were entered against naturopaths in other counties across the state. For good measure, the AG asked for—and received—an injunction against the continued existence and activities of the Texas Naturopathic Physicians Association.185 The naturopaths in Texas—about 450 of them—were in fact out of business. The case against Schlichting was appealed, and an accelerated review was granted by the Texas Supreme Court. Arguments were heard by the court in January 1958, and a decision was handed down on February 19, 1958. The Texas Supreme Court upheld the injunction against Schlichting. The US Supreme Court later denied review. The Texas career of Dr. Henry J. Schlichting Jr., naturopathic physician, was over.186 Schlichting stayed on in Midland, where he had built a solid rep- utation as a citizen, for another 7 years, practicing as an audiologist working for one of the largest hearing aid companies in the United States. His hearing clinics were regularly advertised, and his appear- ances at out-of-state gatherings of naturopaths were mentioned in the Midland and Pacific NW newspapers. Then, in 1965, he left his adopted home state of Texas and established a naturopathic practice in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1973 at the age of only 58, he died suddenly at home on a Sunday afternoon. He was taken back “home” to Midland as his resting place.187

## Three More States Fall: 1955 to

With both WDC and the state of Texas lost to naturopathy, the decline of natural healing accelerated. Licensing was lost in Georgia and in South Carolina, both in 1956. In Utah and Florida—after an extensive review of the profession and its lack of educational institutions—pro- hibitions were put in place against any further issue of licenses as of 1957. In Florida, after a successful court challenge to the initial action, new legislation was passed in 1959 reinstating the ban on further licenses. In all of these cases, three issues turned the tide against natu- ropaths: no legitimate school, declining numbers nationally (from no new graduates and 450 licenses gone in Texas), and intense opposition to natural healing by the AMA and its state constituencies. Naturopaths were first licensed in Florida in 1927.188 At that time, Benedict Lust had for some years operated his second Yungborn Sanitarium in Tangerine, Florida, in the Tampa Bay region of the state. The legislation adopted defined naturopathy as a “drugless” law, con- sistent with pre-1939 concepts of that term: “The use and practice of psychological, mechanical and material health sciences to aid in puri- fying, cleansing and normalizing human tissues for preservation or restoration of health … employs heat, light, water, electricity, psychol- ogy, diet, massage and other manipulative methods.” Naturopaths were licensed in South Carolina in 1937 under the leadership of M. S. Dantzler of Spartanburg. South Carolina was a state where the early chiropractic movement was dominated by “straights,” and the “mixers” became naturopaths to achieve their own identity before the legislature. The original 1937 law was modeled directly after the Florida statute. (“The use and practice of psychological, mechani- cal and material health sciences to aid in purifying, cleansing and nor- malizing human tissues for preservation or restoration of health … employs heat, light, water, electricity, psychology, diet, massage and other manipulative methods”).189 In 1941—on the eve of WWII—the statute was amended with this addition: “The use and practice of phytotherapy, minor surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, autotherapy and biologicals shall be a part of and included in the practice of naturopathy.” The difficulties weath- ered by naturopaths in South Carolina from 1947 to 1949 after the Tennessee scandal have been discussed. Significantly, these problems were resolved by giving the state Board more enforcement powers so that the Board could better police the profession.

## The Florida Saga Begins

In Florida, naturopaths in the greater Miami area of the state pushed to have the law interpreted to allow the right to prescribe drugs after the 1939 regulations were put in place at the federal level. Using the courts, this effort was successful in 1947 in convincing the Florida Supreme Court to interpret the reference to “phytotherapy” in the Florida statutes to include all drugs derived in any way from plant ori- gins, including morphine and opium derivatives. In 1949 this created a significant—and predictable—backlash.190 In early April 1949, the State Board of Health, through its five-mem- ber governing body, adopted a resolution urging legislative action regarding “the licensing and practice of naturopathic physicians,” with a finding that: “The board has information that the practice of naturopathy including the licensing of naturopathic physicians, and the treatment of patients of licensed naturopathic physicians is being conducted in such a manner as to be detrimental to the public health of Florida.” The next day, legislation was introduced in the Florida Senate to make the practice of naturopathy unlawful in the state, and the bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Public Health. Pending the hearing by the committee on the bill, the State Health Officer, a med- ical doctor, picked up the attack on licensed naturopaths, who at the time numbered 239. The concerns expressed were that naturopaths had been “drugless physicians” who opposed drugs as contrary to the natural maintenance of health and natural methods of healing, that naturopaths had no training in the use of materia medica, that no other state allowed such practices by naturopaths, and that the state of Tennessee had just determined that much of naturopathic educa- tion was a fraud, yet some Tennessee licensees were among the NDs in Florida now using drugs. On April 19, 1949, the Florida Naturopathic Physicians Association ran a quarter-page ad in the Miami Herald, Florida’s largest newspa- per. The ad was entitled “NATUROPATHS ANSWER THE ATTACKS OF THE STATE BOARD OF HEALTH, An Open Letter to: Wilson T. Sowder, M.D., State Health Officer.” In this “open letter,” the NDs defended their record of having “used narcotic drugs under Federal Government regulation [for] several years during which they did not abuse or misuse the privilege.” The letter further defended the way in which NDs designated their practices; conformed to the laws, including the court decisions on prescription authority and naturopathic educa- tional standards established under the law; and questioned the good faith of an MD as “promoting monopolistic legislation … of the American Medical Association” rather than serving “the people of Florida.” The Senate committee held an all-day hearing the next day and heard a carefully marshaled presentation on these issues, including hearing the testimony of Harry Avery—the Tennessee investigator— as well as a state narcotics investigator and a regional federal narcot- ics inspector. The naturopaths were represented by legal counsel who was allowed to question the witnesses who appeared. More than NDs attended the session. Although both narcotics inspectors argued against the NDs having prescription authority, both acknowledged under questioning that there had been no reported narcotic violations against Florida naturopaths. As the hearing closed, the sentiment of the committee seemed to be that although tighter regulation would be in order, the bill outlawing naturopathy was too much. But the record was mixed. Most of the NDs had been licensed before the Basic Science Law had been adopted. Of the 239 licensees only 22—all from National College in Chicago— had passed the BSL examination. Many practitioners had diplomas from Lust’s American College of Naturopathy; it was admitted into the record that Lust had been charged in 1934 with operating an unchar- tered school in New York. As the hearing closed, the committee chair put into the record a stack of 700 telegrams and 50 letters opposing the bill and 5 letters supporting the bill. The committee voted at about 8 o’clock in the evening to not report the bill out to the Senate by a vote of two “for” and seven “against.” One takeaway was important, though: one of the “for” votes was from State Senator Leroy Collins of Tallahassee. In the late 1950s, Collins was to become Florida’s governor.191 The staff reporter who covered the hearings—indeed, the story of the Board of Health position on naturopaths—also contributed a lengthy four-part series on naturopaths in Florida. The one school represented in Florida among the licensed NDs that was clearly legitimate was the National College of Drugless Physicians—the Lindlahr school— founded in 1908 and part of the National College of Chiropractic. About 40 alumni were practicing in Florida, and “even the critical state medical societies that have commented on naturopathic schools don’t charge that this college doesn’t offer full four-year training, even though they do complain that it does not offer a four-year course devoted exclusively to naturopathy” (emphasis provided).192 At the conclusion of the reporting on the legislative matters and the general investigation of naturopaths in Florida, the reporter concluded the series with these observations: “Better regulation, rather than pro- hibition is probably the answer. If naturopaths were not permitted … drugs; … prominently identified themselves as naturopaths; if stricter examination of schools … [was] required—the public and naturopa- thy would be benefitted.”

## The Three-State Region

Geographically Georgia and South Carolina share a long common bor- der, South Carolina to the east and Georgia to the west. The common border cuts a line through a common rural area. The Georgia news- papers covered the reports out of South Carolina through the to 1949 events, and in 1950, the Georgia naturopaths had general leg- islative support built up for establishing a licensing board that could “cull the quacks” from the state. The acceptance of this idea in South Carolina was noted, and the Georgia legislature followed suit. Then in 1955, issues arose in both South Carolina and Florida. Geographically “in the middle,” Georgia was affected as well. The South Carolina issues started when the state AG ruled that the law did not allow the naturopaths to prescribe drugs, specifically plant-based narcotics such as opium derivatives. The NDs frankly pushed things too far when they took the AG to court over the issue. Although they won the first rounds of the legal battle, the state medical association used the prospect of NDs claiming prescriptions rights, including to narcotics, to raise the issue of these practices being a threat to public safety.193 The prescription of such plant-related drugs had first arisen in Florida in the 1940s, and the courts in Florida had held that the NDs had these prescription rights. But this issue raised conflict in Florida in 1955 as well through a series of investigative articles in the Miami Daily News entitled “Who Are the Naturopaths?” The articles—four in number—raised the same questions being raised in the South Carolina legislature: Where did these naturopaths go to school, and how has it come to pass that they can prescribe drugs and do minor surgery?194 In South Carolina and Florida, these questions in 1955 and 1956 pro- voked no acceptable answers. The National College program had been closed in 1950, the Western States program in early 1956. After the scare in 1949, the Florida NDs went on with business as usual. In fact, when the 1955 Miami News investigation was reported in November 1955, the only school pointed to by the Examining Board as approved was Western States. Then the program was discontinued in February 1956. Leroy Collins was now the governor of Florida, and the Miami News investigation called him out by name for his legislative opposition to

naturopaths in Florida. Governor Collins commissioned a report from the State Bureau of Narcotics on the state of naturopathy. When the report documented that things had not seemed to have changed since 1949, he announced that one of his legislative priorities for 1957 was outlawing naturopathy in Florida.195 In 1955 South Carolina outlawed naturopathy; in 1956 Georgia outlawed naturopathy; in 1957 Florida outlawed the issuing of any new licenses to practice naturopathy. When the original legislation was struck down by the Florida courts, the 1959 legislature renewed the ban on issuing further licenses. Ultimately, the bans in these three states and Texas were upheld by the courts as within the police powers of state leg- islatures. In the meantime, things were not going well out West either.

## Utah

## The Early Days

In Utah the authorization to legally practice naturopathy first appeared in 1925 when the legislature passed legal authority for an examining board for physiotherapy and naturopathy under the Utah Department of Registration.196 The governor at the time vetoed the measure on the basis that such practices were authorized to be licensed under the state medical board as treatment by a practitioner without the use of medicine or surgery. In October 1934, there were 15 naturopaths registered with the Department of Registration through the authorization of the medical board. Finally in 1937, a separate naturopathic board was authorized by the legislature, and the legislation was signed into law this time around. In 1939 legislation was passed into law raising the educational standards for naturopaths to require 4 years of post–high school education. In each legislative session after 1939—1941, 1943, and 1945—legis- lation was proposed but not passed to allow for “practicing as a natu- ropathic physician and surgeon, including obstetrics.” But in 1946, it emerged that the naturopathic examining board had been conduct- ing a supplemental examination for obstetrics and minor surgery in addition to a basic naturopathy examination just as the medical board had done before the examination authority had been transferred. These supplemental licenses were then issued by the Department of Registration to license holders.

## Utah Opens Up

This only became publicly known in September 1946, when a second AG opinion issued in May 1946, was publicly issued and reported by the Utah newspapers.197 The story was this: In January 1946, a new department director had asked for an opinion from the AG whether naturopaths could be licensed to practice surgery and obstetrics. The AG’s Letter of Opinion answered the question no, as both surgery and obstetrics were the practice of medicine, not naturopathy. In so answering, the opinion noted that there was no such thing as “minor surgery”; under Utah law, surgery was surgery. In May, a second AG opinion letter was sent to the Department of Registration with the recognition that since 1939, naturopaths had been examined in “minor surgery and obstetrics,” and upon suc- cessful passing of the tests, they had been issued licenses to practice. This opinion noted that the statutes “were not free of ambiguity,” and therefore the practice of the Department would be deemed an exist- ing “administrative interpretation” of the law, effective until either the legislature modified the statutes or the courts ruled otherwise. Moreover, the opinion went on to state that although licensed natu- ropaths could not use or prescribe drugs, those licensed to practice obstetrics and surgery could use and prescribe those drugs that “were recognized requirements in obstetrics or minor surgery.” The opinion further stated that although naturopaths could not use drugs in general practice, they could keep on hand or prescribe drugs for communicable diseases or emergencies (e.g., antidotes for poisons) in practice. And so, as a matter of statutory interpretation, Utah became a state that allowed very broad practices to naturopaths. The legislature never did adopt any statutory language that modified the statutes interpreted by the AG, and the courts never reviewed the matter; this was the status quo until September 1955. In 1955 the Utah Board of Health—not the Department of Registration—requested a new AG opinion on the same statutory issues. At the time, the Department of Registration listed 82 naturopaths, of whom 66 were authorized for obstetrics and minor surgery.198

## And Shuts Down Again

The 1955 AG opinion reviewed the same licensing statutes as the opinions and came to a completely different conclusion. Naturopaths could not be licensed to do obstetrics and minor surgery nor pre- scribe drugs. Under this new opinion, the Department gave notice in November 1955 that it would be canceling all of the licenses issued to naturopaths to practice obstetrics and minor surgery, effective January 1, 1956. The naturopaths appealed to the courts but lost before the Utah Supreme Court in June 1956.199 In the 1957 legislative session, legislation was passed that would have allowed the continued practice of obstet- rics, minor surgery, and the prescription of drugs to “reinstate the status quo.” This legislation was vetoed by the governor after the session ended. Also, legislation was passed to fund and commission a study of the education and practices of naturopaths for the use of the 1959 legisla- tive session. The report was devastating in its assessment of the state of naturopathic education in 1959. Essentially, the only school in exis- tence was the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, Oregon, which at that time was in its early, rudimentary stage. Based on this assessment, no legislative relief was granted to licensed naturo- paths in Utah, who were now firmly reduced to practicing without any obstetrics, minor surgery, or prescription rights.200 The 1959 legislature did pass a Basic Science Law. Naturopaths were authorized to take the midwifery examination and become licensed midwives as well as NDs but only after taking the BSL examinations. Also, naturopaths could take the obstetrics and minor surgery exam- inations as given by the medical board (not their own licensing board) but only after passing the BSL examination (this according to another AG opinion requested by the naturopathic board in 1961). And finally, from yet another 1961 AG opinion, naturopaths were not licensed to do spinal adjustment because by law, naturopaths were separate from chiropractic. From this point, naturopathy in Utah went into a long decline as existing practitioners retired from practice and new practi- tioners were scarce.201

## Washington State Under Siege

In Washington, naturopaths had been in practice under the Washington Drugless Healing Act of 1919 since Robert V. Carroll had founded the Washington State Naturopathic Association in 1934. Before that time, all drugless practitioner licenses listed “Sanipractic,” and practitioners either called themselves “drugless physicians” or “Sanipractors.” Sanipractors used the initials “SP” for Sanipractic Physician. Licenses continued to be issued for “Sanipractic,” but many practitioners demonstrated their alliance with Carroll—and through Carroll’s WSNA, their alliance with the national ANA—by using the initials “ND” in practice. After adverse court decisions in 1947 (drugless healers cannot prac- tice surgery or obstetrics), 1950 (drugless healers are not “doctors” and are not allowed standard malpractice defenses), and 1957 (drugless healers can be prosecuted for practicing medicine without a license for using “Dr.” or “physician,” conducting physical examinations), the Washington naturopaths were completely unsuccessful in getting any legislative relief over the intense opposition of the medical pro- fession. The NDs obtained 53 signatures on a petition submitted to

the Washington licensing department under the Drugless Healing Act and at least gained the right to be licensed to practice “Naturopathy” in Washington. For about 10 years, this obtained a little legal relief for them from some of the bad case law that applied to “Sanipractors.”202

## A Dismal State of Affairs: The 1960s

This once proud and vigorous natural healing movement that existed from after WWII for about 10 years had gone into such decline—as described here—that the naturopaths’ self-reported state as of showed a professional movement almost gone.203 In 1968 consideration was given by the US Department of Health and Human Services to the request by the National Association of Naturopathic Physicians to have naturopaths accepted as independent practitioners under Medicare. As part of this process, a lengthy questionnaire was completed and submit- ted by John W. Noble, DC, ND. Noble was a 1937 graduate of Western States College of both the School of Chiropractic and the School of Naturopathy. As of 1968, Noble was a licensed ND in Oregon, practicing in Portland. He was NANP president and also maintained the adminis- trative offices of the National College of Naturopathic Medicine, which had recently moved its main instructional facilities to Seattle. As of 1968, he reported that the NANP had 168 members from Washington (26), Idaho (26), Connecticut (24), Oregon (20), California (17), Kansas (16), and New York (7). Of these states, Washington, Idaho, Kansas, and New York were not considered licensed states, so almost half of the NANP membership came from unlicensed jurisdictions. Noble reported on behalf of NCNM that from 1960 to 1967, 16 students had graduated, and as of 1967/1968, 7 were enrolled. According to the 1965 US government publication State Licensing of Health Occupations, there were 351 licenses in effect in Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and the District of Columbia—the states still issuing licenses.204 Also, 202 licenses were renewed in Florida and California—states that were not issuing new licenses as of 1965. This was a total of 553 active licenses. Together with identifiable practitioners in the unlicensed states, there may have been 700 or so identifiable natu- ropaths, some practicing in extremely restrictive circumstances.

## A Future Resurrection

It would not be until the mid-1970s that this serious decline of natural healing in the United States would begin to be reversed and not until the late 1980s that natural healing would return to an equivalency with the profession that was built between the mid-1930s and the early 1950s by Carroll, Budden, Schlichting, and the others discussed here. That was not, obviously, from lack of commitment or effort on their part.

As noted in the author’s personal correspondence with Gerald Farnsworth, DC, ND, of British Columbia, Canada (June 2015). He was a personal and professional friend and colleague of Joseph Boucher, ND, WSC class of 1953, and the brother of Earl Farnsworth, ND, class of 1955. 82. The Oregonian, Monday, June 11, 1934, reports on the meeting from the week before, noting that Harold Hulme of the campaign was reelected secretary-treasurer, that Dr. Budden had passed out diplomas for the post- graduate course as well as speaking on “The Dawn of Medical Freedom,” and that Dr. Benedict Lust of New York was the principal banquet speaker. 83. A lot of the story up to 1943 is told—from Dr. Lust’s point of view—in the Naturopath and Herald of Health (NHH) volumes for July 1942, “Dr. Lust Speaking,” and January 1943, “The American Naturopathic Associ- ation Its Purposes and Objectives.” Any other volumes of NHH and any other sources will be noted. 84.

inanimate. It was their contention that the only difference between life and nonlife was the degree of complexity of the system. Mechanism has several other distinctive characteristics. Its most obvious is that it is reductionistic. Reductionism is often used as a syn- onym for mechanism. Mechanistic science is also characterized by an emphasis on linear causality. Without this emphasis on reductionism and linear causality, Western science and medicine would proba- bly have not been so successful. As the 20th century advanced, each new discovery in biological and medical science reinforced the argu- ments for mechanism, until, by the middle of the century, the biol- ogy community had almost exclusively embraced the philosophy of mechanism. Mechanism is the philosophical foundation of biomedical science and conventional medicine. It is especially visible in the treatment modalities of surgery and most pharmaceuticals. Mechanistic medicine identifies disease and its accompanying signs and symptoms as simply the result of a disruption of normal chemical reactions and physical activities. Such disruptions are caused by the direct interference in these reactions and activities of a “pathogenic agent.” (For the pur- poses of this discussion, the expression “pathogenic agent” refers to any known or unknown etiological agent, influence, or condition; exam- ples are microbial agents, autotoxins, genetic defects, environmental toxins, non–end-product metabolites, and physical and emotional stress and trauma.) A living organism, then, is simply a very complex machine that, as a result of external agents and influences and “wear and tear,” breaks down. Because the signs and symptoms of disease are thought to be caused only by these mechanical disruptions and inter- ference with reactions, they are considered to be completely destruc- tive phenomena and are therefore to be eliminated. Disappearance of the signs and symptoms indicates that the pathogenic agent and its resulting disease have been eradicated or, more likely, controlled. The goals of mechanistic medicine tend to be the quick removal of the signs, symptoms, and pathogenic agent. Mechanistic medicine is being practiced in cases in which the inten- tion of the therapy is to intervene in the perceived mechanism of the disease and/or to relieve the symptoms. Examples would be the use of antihistamines to relieve rhinitis, vitamin B 6 to help carpal tunnel syndrome, emergency care for traumatic injuries, coronary bypass surgery for blocked arteries, and insulin in juvenile-onset diabetes. Mechanism is also being used when an identified pathogenic agent is directly attacked or eliminated; for example, the use of antibiotics or the isolation of a patient from a particular allergen. Clearly, mechanis- tic medicine can be very effective in achieving its goals. In the presence of modern medical technology, it is easy to see how this philosophy came to dominate biology, medicine, and the attention of the public. However, the unsolved problems of mechanistic medicine—partic- ularly those of chronic degenerative disease; authoritarianism, which alienates patients from responsibility for their own health; and the ris- ing cost of health care—suggest that there are limits to the mechanis- tic perspective and explain why vitalism has not disappeared and is in resurgence.

## Vitalism

The philosophy of vitalism is based on the concept that life is too well organized to be explained simply as a complex assemblage of chemical and physical reactions (i.e., a living system is more than just the sum of its parts). This is in contrast to the mechanist’s contention that “the only difference between life and non-life is the degree of complexity.” Throughout the 19th century, the debate between vitalism and mechanism was carried out mostly by biologists and, in medicine, between the “regular” doctors and those doctors who would now be called alternative. In the medicine of the 19th and early 20th centuries these would have been homeopathic, hydrotherapy, nature cure, and eclectic doctors—all medical doctors with equivalent credentials under the laws of the time. Although the specific terms of “vitalism” and “mechanism” were not necessarily the nomenclature of their debate, the perspectives were the same. Interestingly, through most of the 19th century this debate within the medical community was distinctively not based on science as we currently think of it. The “regular” doctors of the era, as represented by the American Medical Association, were still strongly influenced by Galen’s theory of disease of the four humors with its imaginary anat- omy and physiology, bleeding, leeches, mercury, and other horrific treatments. Both the homeopaths and eclectic doctors argued based on

## 82SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

empirical evidence; on the other side, the regular doctors argued based on a dogmatic theory that was more than 1500 years old and unsup- ported by any evidence. Harris Coulter produced the seminal work on this debate in his three-volume book, The Divided Legacy. The debate between vitalism and mechanism within the field of biology is well documented within the biology journals of the time. This was an era of amazing discoveries about how life functioned. Naturally, this is where the focus of this debate took place for biolo- gists. As the secrets of cellular metabolism were revealed, this debate lurched from one specific argument to the next. The issue was where in the living organism did “God” have direct control. For example, at one point it was argued that the “seat of the soul” was the cell. As the cell was better understood, the place that was the point of God’s interven- tion was postulated to be the nucleus. As research further revealed how the organelles functioned, the vitalistic biologists gave up ground until vitalism as a distinct philosophy in biology was finally abandoned. The error that doomed the vitalistic-oriented biologists was that they were all reductionistic in the same way as the mechanistic biol- ogists. Reductionistic science seems completely able to learn how life functions from a biochemical and biophysical perspective. Eventually, all of the individual chemical and physical reactions that are found in the processes of life will probably be identified. However, the vitalistic biologists missed the most essential aspect of vitalism: holism. In naturopathy’s early years there were few interactions between it and the academic and research worlds. The great authors and prac- titioners came to naturopathy through “conversion,” in other words, most had been cured of some health problem by a natural cure and felt naturopathy and curing the sick was now their calling. There is no evi- dence that these naturopaths even knew that this debate between vital- ism and mechanism was going on in the biology literature. Research in this early era of naturopathy consisted of observing nature and apply- ing these observations to treating patients. This led to a deep appreci- ation of “nature’s” desire for balance and order (what a physiologist would call homeostasis). This holistic perspective, combined with the results of the naturopathic treatments, was the empirical evidence that drove their understanding of health and disease. It was only in the latter half of the 20th century that the field of naturopathic medi- cine began to converge with the academic and research worlds. Since the 1970s this convergence has moved at breakneck speed, until today there is no longer any real distinction (although this is not evident in some of the politically motivated diatribes against the field of natural medicine). However, by this time the academic and research worlds had long since forgotten about vitalism. An organism’s unique complexity—as demonstrated by its abil- ity to grow and develop, respond to stimuli, reproduce, and repair itself—requires a level of organization and coordination that suggests a distinct quality that is not readily explained by mechanism. This is studied extensively by all medical students in physiology class as the “normal” homeostatic process common to all living organisms. However, the tendency in conventional medical school is to put the concept aside when the student moves on to study pathology and the clinical sciences. Yet up to the point of death, maintaining homeostasis is a prime, if not the primary, driving force in all living organisms. To think that homeostasis is only an important factor in “normal” phys- iological processes and has no relevance in pathology is to ignore all of the basic sciences. All life is attempting to return to this ideal state whenever injured or ill. The only point in the life cycle that an organ- ism is no longer “trying” to maintain homeostasis is death. Reductionistic science has done a wonderful job elucidating the functions of the various components of life, but it tends to focus the researcher and the physician on the disease process as an isolated phe- nomenon rather than the result of a complex reaction of the whole organism to a pathological agent. Fortunately, the debate between the vitalistic and mechanistic perspectives in the modern era focuses on the more relevant and holistic general concepts. Although modern vitalism is inherently holistic in its view, there is no conflict with the findings of biomedical science. What is significant is not the individual biochemical or biophysical reactions, but the fact that they are all coor- dinated to such a degree as to produce the special activities of a living organism. Because there is no inanimate counterpart to this level of complexity and organization, homeostasis is the most dramatic general argument in favor of vitalism. A less dramatic argument supporting the vitalistic perspective is the “problem of entropy.” Entropy is the tendency of any closed system to find equilibrium, that is, the state of least organization. In other words, systems tend to run down and become less complex over time. In defiance of this universal rule, life, up until the point of death, consis- tently creates more complex systems out of simple ones. To do this, life actively pursues external matter and energy to incorporate into itself while also selectively eliminating byproducts from its use of this matter and energy. When the problem of entropy is examined on the molecular level, the same individual chemical processes and elements may be found in both animate and inanimate systems. In the inanimate system, how- ever, there is a constant move toward a state of chemical equilibrium. This type of system cannot maintain an unstable chemical state and always seeks stabilization. Even after the addition of external exciting energy, the system returns to the simplest, least reactive state possi- ble. The animate system is virtually the opposite. It is continuously in a state of dynamic chemical instability, actively seeking energy to maintain this instability and consistently moving to more complex and more organized states (and back again). It is only at the onset of death that an animate system begins to move toward equilibrium, and, of course, then it is no longer animate. The third general argument in favor of a vitalistic view of life is evolution. For evolution to exist as a force in nature, generations of living organisms have to survive long enough to grow, reproduce, and then evolve. For this survival to take place, the organisms’ homeostatic and repair processes must be consistently directed toward maintain- ing a state of balance with the external environment (i.e., health). Any organism that does not behave biochemically and physiologically in this manner dies and cannot evolve. Thus the phenomenon of evolu- tion, as the action of countless living organisms over eons, multiplies life’s antientropic quality and is incompatible with a mechanistic view of living systems. These easily observable examples of life’s “special quality” suggest an “organizing force” that goes beyond what is possible from mere chem- istry. This quality that makes life unique should not be mistaken as a metaphysical concept, although an argument for or against such con- cepts is not intended here. The point is only that vitalism is a medical philosophy based on observable scientific phenomena. Unfortunately, a definitive definition of this quality (in the old literature called the “vital force,” defense mechanism, or simply “Nature”) will have to wait for vitalistically or holistically oriented researchers. Reductionistic research has not provided much clarification of these special qualities of life—just ask a modern reductionistic biologist to explain how homeostasis works. They can describe what happens on a biochemical and biophysical level, but they cannot describe why it happens. At this point in the discussion, not many mechanistic practi- tioners would have reason to be uncomfortable. However, the conflict becomes evident with examination of the premises on which the prac- tice of vitalistic medicine is based. What truly separates vitalism from mechanism and makes it useful as a medical philosophy is its perspec- tive on disease and its associated symptoms.

## Meaning of Disease

Vitalism maintains that the pathogenic agent does not directly cause most symptoms accompanying disease; rather, they are the result of the organism’s intrinsic response or reaction to the agent and the organ- ism’s attempt to defend and heal itself. Symptoms, then, are part of a constructive phenomenon that is the best “choice” the organism can make, given the circumstances at any particular time. Symptoms can be further described as arising from two situations. The first and most common situation is when the symptoms are from what would traditionally be called a “healing reaction”—the organ- ism’s concerted and organized attempt to defend and heal itself (i.e., the organism’s homeostatic process). These healing reactions produce what can be called “homeostatic symptoms.” Examples are fever and inflammation in infections, almost any reaction of the immune sys- tem, and many of the symptoms of chronic disease. This interpretation of symptoms is generally ignored by mecha- nism. Instead, it views a symptom as the result of a destructive process and focuses on intervening by relieving the symptom or manipulat- ing the pathological mechanism. Mechanistic medicine is therefore most often working contrary to homeostasis and the organism’s attempt at healing (this is usually its intent). When this therapeutic approach is effective, vitalists call the result a “suppression” (Box 5.3). This approach to health care is so pervasive that most people, lay and professional alike, still think nothing of suppressing mild fevers with antipyretics. In contrast, vitalism considers these homeostatic symp- toms to be the product of a constructive phenomenon and therapeuti- cally stimulates and encourages this directed healing process. In contrast, vitalism considers these symptoms to be the product of a constructive phenomenon and therapeutically stimulates and encourages this directed healing process. Rather than simply trying to eliminate a pathogenic agent, as mechanistic therapy might, vitalism focuses more on augmenting the organism’s resistance to that agent. That is not to say that vitalists object to removing the agent, only that it should be done in the context of simultaneously increasing resis- tance (in other words, decreasing susceptibility). The importance of this approach becomes evident when one recognizes that disease is only possible when both a pathogenic agent and a susceptibility to that agent are present. Healing reactions can take several forms. In the first type, an organ- ism’s response to a pathogenic agent does not produce symptoms. When the organism is capable of easily defending itself from the agent, no symptoms are perceivable. This is a common homeostatic process and is demonstrated when a potential pathogen, such as β -hemolytic streptococcus, is cultured from a healthy person’s throat. However, when the organism is more susceptible or the relative strength of the pathogenic agent is greater, a threshold is reached and symptoms become perceivable. Successful healing reactions of this type include vigorous acute diseases that quickly resolve. The early naturopaths would have called these acute reactions “healing crises.” As the sus- ceptibility of the organism increases relative to the strength of the pathogenic agent, there is a greater likelihood that the healing attempt will not be successful. When such a reaction is unsuccessful but vig- orous, death may result, unless there is timely application of vitalistic or mechanistic therapy. Examples of this situation are acute bacterial meningitis and cholera. When the healing attempt is feeble and therefore ineffective, the reaction usually goes into the “chronic disease” stage. Vitalists observe that suppression seems to increase the likelihood that the reaction will be forced to go into such a chronic stage. In this situation the reaction is “smoldering,” and most often the organism cannot overcome the

## 84SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

pathogenic agent unassisted. It just “holds its own,” and as the organ- ism’s general health decreases over the years, the reaction gradually degenerates, producing symptoms that become less homeostatic as it moves to an end-stage pathology. Palliating the symptoms during this phase of the disease contributes to the declining health over time because palliation means that the underlying susceptibility or problem is not being addressed in a curative manner. If the organism can be therapeutically stimulated to produce a more vigorous healing reac- tion, it can often successfully complete the original healing attempt. This augmented reaction is another example of a naturopathic healing crisis and would also be called an “aggravation” by the vitalists who practice homeopathic medicine. Intervening mechanistically by relieving symptoms does little to stimulate or encourage the healing response; it usually actually inhib- its the healing response. In contrast, vitalistic therapies can be very effective in helping these healing reactions, because the goals of such therapies are precisely the same as those of the organism. Thus it is thought that vitalistic medicine works because, by honoring this pro- cess and thereby strengthening the whole organism, it encourages a more effective healing effort. Ideally, the organism is then able to accel- erate and complete its reaction against the pathogenic agent, leading to the permanent disappearance of the symptoms as it returns to a state of health. It would be naive to say that every stage of the healing reaction is positive and in the best interest of the organism or that no symptoms should be palliated. The modern vitalist acknowledges that palliative intervention is sometimes necessary. In contrast, it is important to note that routine mechanistic intervention can encourage its own worst- case scenarios. When mechanistic therapies successfully suppress an organism’s chosen healing reaction, a less effective and less desirable response is often produced. Therefore when suppression occurs, it can lead to a more complicated medical situation. Consequently, the very practice of mechanistic medicine tends to reinforce its practitioner’s conviction that such intervention is usually necessary. It should be noted, however, that not all mechanistic intervention leads to sup- pression. It happens less often when the pathogenic agent can be read- ily eliminated, such as the use of an antibiotic in nonrecurring acute bacterial infections, or when relatively noninvasive therapies are used, such as natural medicines. The second type of symptom-producing situation occurs when the organism produces symptoms in response to an organic lesion that arises from the direct pathological influence of a pathogenic agent. These could be called “morbid symptoms,” examples of which are symptoms from the mass of an invasive tumor, shortness of breath from emphysema, and pain of an injury or myocardial infarction. It should be mentioned that even these symptoms are the result of the organism’s overall effort to maintain homeostasis, and homeostatic symptoms are also often present. In addition, a morbid symptom is not necessarily without utility. For instance, pain is valuable as an indi- cation of tissue damage. As can be seen, many, if not most, of these situations involve end-stage disease. Here mechanistic therapies can be very positive when the goals of the therapy do not conflict with those of the organism. There are instances when invasive mechanistic intervention will probably be required to save “life and limb.” These include such conditions as birth and genetic defects, serious traumatic injuries, crisis situations, overwhelming infections, and many malignancies. Unfortunately, mechanistic intervention does not guarantee a success- ful outcome either. Even in these situations, however, the effective- ness of vitalistic and natural therapy should not be underestimated, and their concurrent use will certainly augment any mechanistic intervention. The concept of homeostatic and morbid symptoms can be a useful tool to help the understanding of the healing and disease processes, but in many situations it may not be possible to categorize the type of symptoms produced. A rough rule of thumb, however, would be that virtually all symptoms accompanying reversible or functional diseases are homeostatic. In contrast, many of the symptoms associated with traumatic injury and end-stage pathology would be morbid symptoms.

## Scientific Medicine

Although mechanism and vitalism represent opposing perspectives, the systems of medicine that represent these philosophies can be success- fully tested and examined with the scientific method.1 That is not to say that the philosophy of vitalism has been unquestionably proven—only that the validity of vitalistic interventions can be scientifically demon- strated. If a therapy can be proven effective, the effectiveness implies the accuracy of the philosophy on which it is based. Unfortunately, very few of the vast resources of the biomedical community have been directed toward investigating vitalistic medicine. Conventional medicine, as the dominant health care system and a representative of mechanism, has claimed for itself the title “scientific medicine.” However, it is inherently no more or less scientific than vitalistic medicine. A system is scientific only when it has met the cri- teria of the scientific method. This method requires the collection of data through observation and experimentation and the formulation and testing of hypotheses. Nonprejudicial science can effectively study any system, but the researcher must understand the system’s particular paradigm. Experiments on a vitalistic therapy based on a reductionistic and mechanistic model are not going to be constructed to show suc- cess, or if they do show success, it will be entirely fortuitous. The criteria of the scientific method can be met by vitalistic medi- cine, but only when the researchers recognize that it cannot be studied as though it is reductionistic or based on a simplistic model of linear causality. When the experimental model acknowledges the complex- ity of a living system in a social context (i.e., holism and circular cau- sality/feedback loops), vitalistic medicine proves to be both verifiable and reproducible and, thus, scientific. Unfortunately, because of its current political and economic dominance, conventional medicine is in the position to dictate (through economic and publication con- trol) that research, and therefore the scientific method will be applied primarily to itself. The result is that most conventional practitioners dismiss vitalistic medicine, along with all alternatives, as unscien- tific. Ironically, most vitalistic physicians also have extensive training in mechanistic and/or conventional medicine. Generally, they are capable of practicing mechanistically and do so to greater or lesser degrees.

# NATUROPATHIC PHILOSOPHY

## Vis Medicatrix Naturae

Naturopathic physicians assert that all true healing is a result of vis medicatrix naturae (the healing power of nature). Unfortunately, some people in the field of alternative medicine (including some naturopathic physicians and students) have mistakenly translocated this concept to the therapy. These practitioners tend to operate as though this “heal- ing power” is an intrinsic property of the natural therapy or medicinal substance itself. In contrast, proponents of vitalism and naturopathic medicine have always understood that the “healing power of nature” is an inherent property of the living organism. Vis medicatrix naturae is the living organism’s “desire” and ability to heal itself. As mentioned, the homeostatic process best exemplifies this. Historically, naturopathy is a vitalistic system of medicine. However, over the past 130 years its eclecticism has allowed it to incorporate a

<!-- chunk -->

## 85CHAPTER 5 Philosophy of Naturopathic Medicine

number of therapies that can function mechanistically. What makes these mechanistic therapies acceptable, given naturopathic medicine’s vitalistic foundation, is the emphasis on meeting each patient’s prag- matic health care needs. So the application of vis medicatrix naturae in practice is constantly adjusted depending on the situation at hand. Ideally, naturopathic practice involves only the use of therapies that support the organism and encourage its intrinsic healing process to work more effectively while avoiding the use of medicines and proce- dures that interfere with natural functions or have harmful side effects. Natural medicines and therapies are therefore preferred, because when they are used properly and in appropriate circumstances, they are the least harmful, least invasive, and best able to work in harmony with the intrinsic natural healing process. In addition, their constituents have been encountered in nature for millions of years. This long period of exposure has enabled the body to develop metabolic pathways capable of effectively using, processing, and detoxifying these medicines. The total organism is involved in the healing attempt, so the most effective approach to diagnosis and treatment is to consider the whole person. In addition to physical and laboratory findings, important con- sideration is given to the patient’s attitude, psychological and spiritual state, social circumstances, lifestyle, diet, heredity, and environment. Careful attention to each person’s unique individuality and suscepti- bility to disease is critical to the proper evaluation and treatment of any health problem. Naturopathic physicians contend that most disease is the direct result of the ignorance and violation of what would be traditionally called “natural living laws.” These general lifestyle rules (including diet) are based on the concept that there is an environment (both inter- nal and external) that optimizes the health of an organism. Analysis of the lifestyles of Paleolithic and healthy primitive and modern cultures gives naturopathic physicians and their progenitors many clues as to what a healthy lifestyle should involve. Throughout most of modern history, biomedical science has focused primarily on researching the sick. Recently it has finally begun to evaluate what constitutes a healthy lifestyle. To no one’s surprise, this lifestyle looks like the same one advocated by naturopaths for the past 130 years. A healthy lifestyle could be generalized to include the following: • Consuming natural unrefined foods • Getting adequate amounts of exercise and rest • Living a moderately paced lifestyle • Having constructive and creative attitudes • Connecting to other people socially • Being present to the spiritual aspects of life • Avoiding toxins and polluted environments • Maintaining proper elimination It is also important to control these areas during illness to remove as many unnecessary stresses as possible and to optimize the chances that the organism’s healing attempt will be successful. Therefore patient education and responsibility, lifestyle modification, and pre- ventive medicine are fundamental to naturopathic practice. Although the practice of naturopathic medicine is grounded in vis medicatrix naturae, it also recognizes that mechanistic intervention in the disease process is sometimes efficacious and, at times, absolutely necessary. Therefore naturopathic physicians treat patients with a wide variety of vitalistic and mechanistic therapeutic modalities. It is the circumstances and the goal of the therapy that ultimately deter- mines which approaches are used. Naturopathic physicians have a long-standing tradition of integrating the best aspects of traditional, alternative, and conventional medicine in the interest of the patient. As appropriate, patients are referred to other health care practi- tioners. Whenever possible, every effort is made to use all treatment techniques in a manner that is harmonious with the naturopathic philosophy.

## Natural Medicines and Therapies

Traditionally, medicines administered and prescribed by naturopathic physicians have been primarily natural and relatively unprocessed. Four categories of natural medicines can be defined. The first consists of substances found in nature that have been only minimally processed. Examples include, but are not limited to, foods, clean air and water, and whole herbs. The early “nature cure” prac- titioners used this category primarily. The second category involves agents extracted or made from naturally occurring products. Although these medicines have undergone processing, their constituents are still in the form found in the original natural substance. These first two types of natural medicinal substances have synergistic constituents that allow their use at lower doses with a resultant broader and safer therapeutic index. Examples of this category are tinctures and other botanical extracts (some of which are standardized on one or more constituents known to be clinically effective), homeopathic medicines, glandular extracts, and other substances of animal origin. The third category of natural medicines comprises those highly processed medicinal substances that are derived from a natural source. Often everything has been removed from such substances but the iden- tified active ingredient, and they no longer have any synergistic constit- uents. Examples of these are the many new nutraceuticals made from plant substances, constituents of biochemical pathways, enzymes, amino acids, minerals, vitamins, and other food extracts. The fourth category that may be considered natural are those man- ufactured medicines that are presumed to be identical to naturally occurring substances. They have the advantage of being less expen- sive and are typically available in higher concentrations. Examples of these manufactured natural medicines include bioidentical hormones, synthetic vitamins, and analogues of plant and animal constituents. However, their use is a compromise because: • It is difficult to determine whether they are the equivalent of the natural product. • They lack natural synergistic components. • They may include contaminants from the manufacturing process; these contaminants are often chemically and structurally similar to the desired medicine but generally interfere with the normal path- ways rather than enhance them. Naturopathic physicians also use many natural physical therapies. What makes a therapy natural is that it is derived from a phenomenon of nature and is used to stimulate the body to heal itself. Examples of these phenomena are air, light, heat, electricity, sound, and mechani- cal force. Some of these natural therapies are mechanical and manual manipulation of the bony and soft tissues (naturopathic manipulative therapy), physiotherapy modalities (e.g., electrotherapy and ultra- sound), hydrotherapy, and exercise therapy. Naturopathic physicians also use lifestyle modification, counseling, and suggestive therapeutics. These therapies are all discussed in more detail in other chapters.

## Family and Specialty Practice

Naturopathic physicians, like other types of primary care providers, develop practices that meet their personal interests and skills. Although most are engaged in general and family practice, some also specialized in particular therapeutic modalities and/or types of health problems. In all situations, however, the emphasis is still on treating the whole person. The practice of family medicine requires the use of some med- icines, techniques, and devices that are not natural but belong among the comprehensive family practice services offered by the naturopathic profession.

In the modern era of naturopathic medicine many states have expanded the scope of practice so that naturopathic physicians now practice much like other primary care practitioners with pharmaceu- tical prescribing rights. However, naturopathic physicians generally approach the use of pharmaceuticals differently than conventional physicians. They are seen as temporary interventions to be used to sup- port the patient while other, more vitalistic natural therapies are used to help the patient recover his or her health with the ultimate goal of no longer needing the pharmaceutical. Many naturopaths have also developed advanced expertise in spe- cific natural therapeutic modalities. These practitioners have usually invested in postgraduate training, such as that available through res- idencies. Three therapeutic specialties that merit mention are natural childbirth, acupuncture, and homeopathy. There is also a growing trend of specializing in organ systems (e.g., gastroenterology) or dis- eases (e.g., cardiology).

# THE PHILOSOPHICAL CONTINUUM

When the various healing systems are examined and placed on a phil- osophical continuum, mechanism and vitalism are on different ends of the same health care spectrum. Both ends of this health care continuum have their strengths and weaknesses. Mechanistic medicine is effective for trauma, crisis care, end-stage disease, and many acute disorders. However, it is clearly a failure for most chronic disease. Conventional medicine considers most chronic diseases incurable. Vitalistic medi- cine, in contrast, has its most dramatic successes with chronic disease and is effective with many kinds of acute disease. It is not very effective with trauma and crisis care or with end-stage disease, although it can be a very useful complement to conventional medicine. As can be seen, both ends of the health care spectrum are necessary if every patient’s health care needs are to be met. Although aspects of naturopathic medicine (e.g., constitutional hydrotherapy) and conventional medicine (e.g., chemotherapy) rep- resent the archetypes of vitalism and mechanism, the space between the ends of this spectrum is a gray area within which both naturo- pathic and conventional physicians operate on a continual basis. Naturopathic physicians integrate vitalistic therapies with mechanistic therapies, but it is not possible for everyone to be experts in everything. The vast majority of naturopathic or conventional physicians cannot learn and competently practice all types of health care. Consequently, to effectively meet society’s health care needs, it is necessary to create an integrated/collaborative health care system. Such a system would have both vitalistic and mechanistic practitioners working together in the same clinical settings. The trends of popular culture and biomedical science that are finally beginning to study alternative medicine suggest that the creation of an inte- grated health care system is now well under way. However, it takes no great skill for a mechanistic medical doctor to switch from giving a synthetic drug for a disease to giving a natural medicinal substance (both mechanis- tically oriented interventions) without understanding vitalistic thinking. If naturopathic medicine becomes just another mechanistic system using natural medical substances to treat disease (instead of a system identified with treating the whole person vitalistically), it will lose its unique niche in an integrated health care system. To survive and thrive in this new envi- ronment, naturopathic medicine must keep its vitalistic roots. With a thor- ough grounding in vis medicatrix naturae, modern naturopathic medicine will flourish and achieve a leadership position as the dominant health care paradigm shifts to the integrated medicine of the future.


The practice of naturopathic medicine can be summarized most simply as helping the body–mind heal itself in the least invasive, most funda- mentally curative manner possible. This approach is not tied to any particular therapy or modality, but rather is oriented to a rational blend of vitalistic and mechanistic principles working with the whole person and educating the patient in the ways of health. As naturopathic knowledge of health and disease grows, new ther- apies and approaches to health care will be added as they satisfy the principle of vis medicatrix naturae. With integration of the larger health care system, naturopathic medicine’s place is assured as the profession that truly understands each unique human being’s power to heal.

1. A thorough review of all health care modalities in use today reveals some that could be considered metaphysical. These include such things as prayer, faith healing, psychic healing, healing touch, touch for health, and medical dowsing. Generally speaking, the actual operator of the therapy must call on God or have some special endogenous skill or “power” that goes beyond intellectual knowledge. This makes these modalities “operator-dependent” and, thus, cannot be validated separately from the practitioner—greatly increasing the difficulty of their scientific verifica- tion. Consequently, these modalities are not historically relevant to this discussion of medical philosophy.

people to heal.3 Unfortunately, the most modern abuse of the concept of the placebo comes from biased critics of alternative medicine who have chosen to label the beneficial effects of these therapies as merely from the placebo. These critics dismiss the science of natural healing as an imaginary phenomenon and the last resort for quack doctors who have no real medical treatments to offer their patients.8 The most interesting aspect of the placebo literature is the explo- ration of the extent of the potential of the mind to influence human health. The “power of placebo” draws on the innate ability of the body to spontaneously heal itself, a fundamental principle of naturopathic medicine. This point separates the care delivered by naturopathic phy- sicians from the pharmaceutical and surgical approaches of current medical “standard-of-care” procedures. If common medical texts on internal medicine or ambulatory care are examined, the word heal- ing is not found in the index. Except for the diagnostic evaluation of “self-limiting diseases” and “spontaneous regression,” the ability of the human organism to self-right and repair from a state of acute or chronic disease is not explored in modern medicine except under the designation “placebo response.” The placebo response therefore represents all the “unknown” variables that conspire to heal a patient despite pharmaceutical and surgical intervention. Although it seems to be a natural area to develop in clinical and hospital settings, the funda- mental separation of mind and body in conventional medical thinking may be slowing down a standardization of care that actively engages the hopes and beliefs of all patients undergoing treatment.

# PLACEBO RESPONSE

The placebo response represents the power of the mind, through inten- tion, to effect (1) a change in oneself, (2) a change in those around one, and (3) a change in the environment in which one lives. Intention has been observed to affect machines9 and remote biological systems.10 Distantly influenced systems include another person’s electrodermal activity, blood pressure, and muscular activity; the spatial orienta- tion of fish; the locomotor activity of small mammals; and the rate of hemolysis of human red blood cells. Prayer, an example of intention, has been extensively studied as a therapeutic healing modality.11 One study showed a dramatic result in cardiac intensive unit recovery when patients were prayed for by someone at a distant location.12 Patients in this study were 5 times less likely to require antibiotics, 3 times less likely to experience pulmonary edema, 12 times less likely to require endotracheal intubation, and significantly less likely to experience car- diac mortality. Our biological systems must conform to the laws of physics. Modern physics has investigated the effect of an observer on the system observed. It has been shown that an electron will acquire a definite axis of measurement in the process of measurement. Bell’s theorem sup- ports the idea that our universe consists of particles unified instantly as an indivisible whole; our biological homeostatic systems cannot be analyzed in terms of independent parts. The interconnected nature of our biological systems has been known for thousands of years; the ancient Buddhist concept of “interdependent phenomena” or Prat ī tyasamutp ā da accurately describes this paradigm. The Buddhist concept of interconnectedness and interdependency does not imply a Newtonian billiard-ball effect of a cause or causation, but rather an interdependent “held” state of a plurality of conditions and causes. The idea that a healing response can be generated without genuine causation, such as drug treatment, seems to violate the laws of biolog- ical systems. Comparing the healing response generated by a thought or intention might not violate the laws of physics, but it has a difficult place in a medical philosophy of cause and effect driven by pharma- codynamics. Interestingly, humans are not the only organisms to be affected by the placebo response; it has been observed in Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster through cell signaling indicating a phenotypic response to sensory input, which shows that the placebo phenomenon is not ignoring cause and effect—it merely indicates the potential for more subtle self-regulation than that refer- enced in modern medical standards of care.13 Our current medical system is gradually shifting with the develop- ments in modern physics. These modern ideas of biological systems are diametrically opposed to Cartesian paradigms that our internal and external environment consists of separate parts joined by local connections. Medicine must take a “quantum leap” to catch up with the knowledge we possess about our environment through quantum physics. We can see clearly that it is impossible for a doctor to observe a patient without that observation having an effect on the health of the patient. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin postulated, and Rupert Sheldrake proved, the possibility of a “morphogenetic field” for the subliminal communication to all members of our species.14 The effect of human thought on other members of society has been described in human society since the beginning of our earliest cultures. Naturopathic physicians believe that the body has a powerful ability to maintain health and repair to a healthy state after disease by virtue of its inherent power of vitality. This homeostatic healing mechanism has been selected by nature in the same way that the organs that we consider to be vital to our survival have been selected. Healing happens unaided by simply maintaining an environment that does not obstruct the path of cure. Because the placebo literature documents the philosophical foun- dations of the naturopathic healthcare model, it is important to review the full scope of this subject. Integrating known placebo initiators in clinical practice is essential for good patient care.

# WHY STUDY THE PLACEBO EFFECT?

For hundreds of years, physicians have watched their patients respond to therapies with a wide range of results. Some patients recover fully, whereas others, with apparently identical diseases and therapies, wither and die. Today, a skilled physician can correctly diagnose the condi- tion of a patient by applying the sophisticated techniques of modern medicine. Then, an appropriate therapy, the efficacy of which has been thoroughly proven in research and clinical trials, can be prescribed. Through this process the patient will have received the best care avail- able through current medical technology. However, if the diagnosis, therapy, and therapeutic interaction do not stimulate the hope, faith, and belief of the patient, the chances of success are measurably dimin- ished. In the literature on the placebo effect15; psychoneuroimmunol- ogy6; and psychosomatic,16 behavioral,17,18 and psychiatric19 medicine, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that the beliefs of both the patient and the doctor, and their trust in each other and the process, generate a significant portion of the therapeutic results.20 The placebo and its effect are not separate from any aspect of the therapeutic interaction, nor are they “nuisance variables” muddying a clear clinical picture. Rather, they send the physician a strong message: it is a patient’s own belief system that mobilizes the inherent healing powers of the mind. By studying the placebo effect, a physician is better able to fully harness this power to trigger internal healing mechanisms. Yet despite the quantity of documentation, the placebo effect remains one of the most misunderstood areas in modern medicine. The physician should always strive to stimulate self-healing, or the placebo effect, as fully as possible to maximize its potential for heal- ing. Someday physicians will be able to explore the deepest recesses of the unconscious to directly access therapies that assist the body in the

restoration of internal homeostasis. The optimal model for health care is the marriage of appropriate medical technology with the factors that have been shown to generate the placebo effect. This exciting scenario shines on the horizon as the health care of the future. Because the doctor–patient relationship is such fertile ground for stimulating the healing response,21–23 it serves a physician well to com- prehend the nature of the placebo phenomenon to fully realize this potential for healing.

# HISTORY OF PLACEBO

Both the modern physician and primitive medicine men and sha- mans of the past used ineffective therapies to stimulate healing in their patients. As Shapiro observed, “the true importance of placebo emerges with a review of the history of medical treatment.”24 It was noted that the historical therapies of the medical profession and tra- ditional healers, “purging, puking, poisoning, puncturing, cutting, cupping, blistering, bleeding, leeching, heating, freezing, sweating, and shocking,”25 worked because of the placebo effect. Although these practices might seem ludicrous in retrospect, all of these therapies were once considered effective. As an embarrassing epilogue, the placebo lit- erature shows that ineffective procedures are just as pervasive in mod- ern medicine as in the jungle hut of the shaman. We must therefore ask ourselves how unfounded medical therapies can survive peer-reviewed literature and centuries of cultural acceptance. The power of the patient’s belief in the potential for a cure has been consistently observed throughout history. Both Galen and Hippocrates recognized the strong effect of the mind on disease and recommended that faith, treatment ritual, and a sound doctor– patient relationship could provide important therapeutic results.26 Recognition of the power of positive expectation was recorded fre- quently in the medical literature of the 17th and 18th centuries. It was in the 18th century that the use of placebos was first defined as a “commonplace method of medicine.”27 As the importance of drug therapy grew in the 19th century, the term placebo became identified with medicines involving substances that resembled drugs. However, in the 1940s, because of the increase in double-blind research, it became associated with inert substances that were used to replace active medication.

# ORIGIN OF THE TERM PLACEBO

The original Latin meaning of placebo is “I shall please.”28 Although the term had a purely medical application in the first half of the 20th cen- tury, its meaning has been subject to various interpretations through- out the past several hundred years. Before the 1940s, placebos were pharmacologically inactive sub- stances, such as saline and lactose pills, used to satisfy patients that something was being done for them—in other words, the doctor was “pleasing” the patient. The 1940s and 1950s saw an explosion of the use of double-blind experimental procedures to evaluate the growing number of new drugs and medical procedures. Suspicion arose that all medical therapies contained an element of the placebo phenomenon.29 This new understanding pressed the scientific community to offer new, far broader definitions. Shapiro25 offered the classic definition of a placebo: Any therapeutic procedure (or that component of any therapeutic procedure) which is given deliberately to have an effect, or unknow- ingly has an effect on a patient, symptom, syndrome, or disease, but which is objectively without specific activity for the condition being treated. The therapeutic procedure may be given with or without the conscious knowledge that the procedure is a placebo, may be an active (non-inert) or inactive (inert) procedure, and includes, therefore, all medical procedures no matter how specific—oral and parenteral medications, topical preparations, inhalants, and mechanical, surgical, and psychotherapeutic procedures. The pla- cebo must be differentiated from the placebo effect which may or may not occur and which may be favorable or unfavorable. The placebo effect is defined as the changes produced by placebos. The placebo is also used to describe an adequate control in research. A more accurate definition would be the following: The placebo effect is the process of a physician working with the self-healing processes of a patient. The placebo response is healing that results from the patient’s own natural survival and homeostatic defense mechanisms. Modern placebo definitions extend to its nature, properties, and effects. A placebo can be known or unknown, active or inactive, pos- itive or negative in results (placebo effect vs. nocebo effect), and can extend to all forms of diagnostic or therapeutic modalities,30 as further defined in Box 6.1.

# CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS OF “KNOWN” PLACEBO

# THERAPY

One of the more dramatic examples of the placebo effect reported in the medical literature involved a patient with advanced lymphosar- coma, which Klopfer31 reported was highly susceptible to the patient’s faith in an experimental drug called Krebiozen. When the patient was started on the drug injections, his enthusiasm was so intense that “The tumor masses had melted like snowballs on a hot stove, and in only a few days, they were half their original size!”31 The injections were continued until the patient was discharged from the hospital and had regained a full and normal life, a complete reversal of his disease and its grim prognosis. Within 2 months of this recovery, reports that the drug Krebiozen was ineffectual were leaked to the press. Learning of this report, the patient quickly began to revert to his former con- dition. Suspicious of the patient’s relapse, his doctors decided to take advantage of the opportunity to test the dramatic regenera- tive capabilities of the mind; a single-blind study was performed on the patient using pure placebo. He was told that a new version of Krebiozen had been developed that overcame the difficulties described in the press, and some of the drug was promised to him as soon as it could be procured.

## 90SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

With much pomp and ceremony, a saline water placebo was injected, increasing the patient’s expectations to a fevered pitch. The recovery from his second near-terminal state was even more dramatic than the first. Tumor masses melted, chest fluid vanished, he became ambulatory, and he even went back to flying again. At this time he was certainly the picture of health. The water injec- tions were continued because they worked such wonders. He then remained symptom-free for more than 2 months. At this time, the final American Medical Association announcement appeared in the press—“nationwide tests show Krebiozen to be a worthless drug in the treatment of cancer.” Within a few days of this report, the patient was readmitted to the hospital in extremis. His faith was now gone, his last hope had vanished, and he succumbed in less than 2 days.31 Other famous placebo case studies are one reported by Cannon32 on “voodoo death” caused by belief and one reported by Kirkpatrick,33 who documented the spontaneous regression of lupus erythematosus resulting, in part, from the patient’s belief in the removal of a curse.

## Other Clinical Observations

Belief sickens, belief kills, belief heals.34 Evans35 and Beecher36 reviewed, between them, 26 double-blind stud- ies on the efficacy of active analgesic drugs in the treatment of pain. Independently, they concluded that 35% of patients with pain expe- rienced a 50% reduction in their symptoms after placebo medication. These were particularly remarkable results when viewed in the context of Evans’s observation that with a standard dose of morphine, only 75% of the patients experienced a 50% reduction in pain. In calculating the efficiency index of placebo analgesia, a method often used to deter- mine the relative efficiency of drugs, placebo was 0.56 as effective as a standard dose of morphine. This prompted Evans to remark, “Thus, on average, placebo is not a third as effective as a standard injection of morphine in reducing severe clinical pain of various kinds but is in fact 56% as effective.”35 As discussed previously, the placebo phenomenon has been eval- uated in a wide variety of clinical settings in addition to pain man- agement (Box 6.2). When a phenomenon such as the placebo effect has been observed to be active in diverse clinical situations, such as surgery, drug therapy, psychotherapy, and biofeedback, and over a range of physical and mental symptoms, the conclusion that it must be a factor in all aspects of medicine is inescapable. In addition to the variety of positive effects that placebos produce are the nocebo effects, perceived as counterproductive to the therapeu- tic goals. Widely ranging negative side effects to placebos have been reported in the medical literature.37 These side effects are frequently consistent with those of the medication that patients believe they are getting. For example, the studies that measure the effects of a supposed aspirin usually show nocebo effects of ulcerlike pain.38 One study showed that suggestion seems to be a primary cause of nocebo reac- tions, in contrast to the strong conditioning component found in the placebo response.39 In homeopathy, aggravations and ameliorations are commonly seen when a placebo is given to fend off a patient’s need to take a med- ication while the homeopathic physician is waiting to see whether a high-potency remedy will effect a cure. Homeopathic doctors report that placebos can cause anxiety and loneliness as well as calmness and immediate relief from insomnia.40

# PLACEBO MYTHS

An investigation of the understanding of placebos found in the current medical literature revealed the misconceptions that prevail about the nature of placebo therapy and its effectiveness.40 A study undertaken to examine doctors’ and nurses’ attitudes about the efficacy and use of placebos showed that both groups underestimated the number of patients who could be helped by placebo.41 Physicians showed a con- sistent pattern of placebo use, as follows: • Placebos were used to prove the patient wrong through the diag- nosis of psychogenic symptoms in patients who were thought to be exaggerating, imagining, or faking their symptoms. • Placebos were used in the treatment of alcoholic, psychotic, and demanding patients who were disliked by the staff of the hospital. • Placebos were used as a treatment in situations in which standard treatments failed or the patient was getting worse. These misconceptions regarding the nature of the placebo accounted for its widespread misuse in patients who were perceived as uncooperative or who were suspected of malingering. Myths about placebos continue to hinder a full understanding of the power inherent in this aspect of health care. The most common myths are discussed here.42

<!-- chunk -->

## Myth

“Because placebos tend to be physiologically inert, it is not possible for them to have an effect on physiological homeostasis.” Fact: Research shows that placebos have a wide range of effects (Table 6.1) that are found throughout all aspects of human physiology.

<!-- chunk -->

## Myth

“Placebos are useful only with symptoms that are associated with psy- chological or psychosomatic complaints. Patients who need a placebo are hypochondriacs with vivid imaginations and need to be palliated with something to please them.” Fact: Placebos have been shown to be effective in the care of all types of patients, with a consistent level of positive results for a wide variety of accurately diagnosed diseases. Beecher20 was one of the first to compile a listing of the thera- peutic effectiveness of placebo, thereby uncovering the wide range of therapeutic applications that were previously thought to be lim- ited only to pain control. He concluded, “there is too little scientific as well as clinical appreciation of how important unawareness of these placebo effects can be and how devastating to experimental studies as well as to sound clinical judgement lack of attention to them can be.”20

## 91CHAPTER 6 Placebo and the Power to Heal

The large and ever-growing number of studies on placebos and double-blind research (Box 6.3) supports the following assertion made by Beecher20 30 years ago: Many “effective” drugs have power only a little greater than that of placebo. To separate out even fairly great true effects above those of placebo is manifestly difficult to impossible on the basis of clinical impression. Many a drug has been extolled on the basis of clinical impression when the only power it had was that of a placebo.

## Myth

“The placebo effect is found only with substances that are inert.” Fact: The placebo phenomenon has been observed across a wide spectrum of medical disciplines including surgery,43 drug therapy,44 and biofeedback.45

<!-- chunk -->

## Myth

“The patient who responds to placebo therapy can be characterized as someone who is of a typical neurotic disposition.”41 Fact: Although many studies have tried to impute a personality type, disposition,45,46 or certain epidemiological class47 to the patient who responds to placebo, this has yet to be well demonstrated because, in the right circumstances, any person can become a pla- cebo reactor.48,49 After reviewing the bulk of the research on this subject, Bush50 and Wolf and Pinsky51 concluded that the attempts to pigeonhole per- sonalities into a clinical profile ignored the complexity of the human mind. Gliedman et al.52 similarly reported that age, sex, marital status, social class, and intelligence were unimportant factors in determining a patient’s response to placebo. Wolf summarized that attempts to iden- tify placebo reactors need to identify the nature of the symptom being treated, the motivation of the patient and physician, the nature of the test agent, its mode of administration and the life situation of the subject at the time he is tested. The significant point here is not the apparently conflicting findings of investigators with respect to placebo reactors, but rather that in any given situation, responses to a placebo may vary as compared to any other situation and the significance of situations to human subjects cannot be precisely duplicated.51

# PHARMACODYNAMICS

The physiological response of the “inert and inactive” placebo extends into the realm of drug pharmacodynamics. Dose–response time curves, cumulative effects (increasing therapeutic efficacy with repeated doses),53 variable strengths of analgesia based on a patient’s drug expectation,54 drug interactions,51,55 and carryover effects46,56 have all been demonstrated. The effects of placebos are so pronounced that some observers have suggested that they can exceed the effects attributable to potent pharmacological agents.51

## Packaging and Delivery

Several studies found that the effectiveness of placebo therapy depends on the mode of delivery.57 For example, one study found that green tablets improved anxiety and yellow tablets improved depression,58 whereas another study found that blue capsules were more sedative and pink capsules were more stimulating.59 Placebo injections appeared to be more effective than oral administration after oral placebo has failed to relieve the patient’s symptoms.38

## Placebo Interactions

Benson60 wrote that the patient’s belief was also a powerful force in determining the level of relief afforded by the placebo. An increase in patient expectation enhances the physician’s ability to elicit a placebo response. Even if patients know that they are receiving placebos, the expectation and relief brought about by the therapeutic interaction

provide positive results.61 The importance of expectation was further demonstrated by the observation that the greater the stress level of the patient and the greater his or her need for assistance, the greater the effectiveness of placebo.62 This was seen even in patient responses to psychotropic drugs: d-lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate 25 (LSD- 25) could have no effect if the patient was told that the drug was a placebo.45,63 Patients, such as war heroes, who had severe injuries but did not have great mental suffering attached to their pain needed less pain medication than persons with similar injuries who had pain that engendered anxiety and connoted disaster.64

# PLACEBO HEALING MECHANISMS

When animals or humans can react to their own deviations from homeostasis and when these deviations set off restorative processes, therapeutic intervention, including placebo, has an already existing substrate of recovery for exploitation.17 A human being has an intrinsic ability to “self-right”—vis medica- trix naturae (the healing power of nature). This is the keystone of a phi- losophy that has been held for thousands of years by naturally oriented physicians (see Chapter 5). The concept of a homeostatic, self-regu- lating mechanism is central to the understanding of basic concepts of physiology: negative feedback loops control virtually all systems of the body. According to Guyton,65 “the body is actually a social order of about 75 trillion cells organized into different functional structures. … [E]ach cell benefits from homeostasis and in turn each cell contributes its share toward the maintenance of homeostasis.” The body can maintain health and reestablish a healthy state after disease by virtue of its inherent vitality. This is part of the definition of a homeostatic mechanism; it has been selected by nature in the same way that organs vital to our survival have been selected. The surviving species are those most fitted and best able to cope with dysfunction. Those organisms that can tolerate the greatest stresses and still main- tain normal physiology are the hardiest survivors and ensure the spe- cies’ ability to increase the limits of its adaptation. Therefore, given that an organism is self-maintaining when in an environment that it has been selected for, healing happens unaided through simply main- taining an environment that does not obstruct the path of cure. As Norman Cousins66 observed, “without any help, the human body is able to prescribe for itself. It does so because of a healing system that is no less real than the circulatory system, the digestive system, the ner- vous system, or any of the other systems that define human beings and enable them to function.”

## The Role of Emotions

Starting in the 1970s and early 1980s, review articles began to examine the effect of the mind on the immune system, emphasizing mechanisms and pathways that gave rise to a new field called psychneuroimmu- nology.5 Reviews of studies that explored how specific emotions can increase cancer susceptibility,67,68 examined the effect of emotions and recovery from cancer,69 investigated the increased incidence of sudden and rapid death during psychological stress,70 and moni- tored the changes in immune function during emotional stress71,72 all confirmed that emotions play a powerful role in the prognosis of a patient. Cannon32 and Tregear73 documented dramatic case histories of pioneering anthropologists who witnessed the power of taboos and curses to kill strong, healthy men and women in third-world cultures throughout Africa, South America, and the South Pacific. Tregear73 wrote, “I have seen a strong young man die the same day he was tauped [tabooed]; the victims die under it as though their strength ran out as water.”

## The Vis Medicatrix Naturae

The healing process described as vis medicatrix naturae demonstrates the significant power and potential of the self-generated healing capac- ity. For a physician, there is no more powerful stimulator of this healing mechanism, the placebo effect, than a strong doctor–patient interac- tion. Just walking through the door of the physician’s office nudges a patient’s internal homeostatic mechanisms into seeking higher levels of health, healing, and adaptation. The placebo effect is a result or effect of the patient’s seeking the assistance of the doctor’s ability to heal and cure. As Benson60 noted, When we dissected the placebo effect a number of years ago, we found three basic components: One, the belief and expectation of the patient; two, the belief and expectation of the physician; and three, the interaction between the physician and the patient. When these are in concert, the placebo effect is operative. … Perhaps noth- ing is being transmitted from the healer to the patient, but rather it’s the belief the patient has in the healer that’s helpful.

## Conscious Control Over Homeostasis

The body has two internal forces to maintain homeostasis: a lower drive and a higher drive. The lower drive is the inherent internal heal- ing mechanism, the vital force, or the primitive life support and repair mechanism that can operate even in a person who is asleep, uncon- scious, or comatose. The higher drive is the power of the mind and emotions to intervene and affect the course of health and disease by depressing or stimulating internal healing capacities. The effect of this drive can be seen in the clinical observation of patients who move toward spontaneous remission of a life-threatening disease through positive emotional support15,69 and in patients who fail to express emo- tions compatible with the body’s attempts to survive.69 In any disease process, the consciousness of the patient decides the effectiveness of any therapy. It has been suggested that widely ranging nondrug stimuli have the capacity to modulate human functioning.74 It is emerging in the medical literature that any sensory stimuli or mental activity is able to alter disease progression. This extends to the thoughts and intentions of those connected to the patient. Experiments in remote intention–generated healing and prayer showed that the intention of others was a factor in the homeostatic capabilities of the mind and body. The fact that the homeostatic mechanism can sense and respond to these remote intentions is a reflection of the power of the human mind. Some authors believe that there is a physiological basis for the unlimited possibility of human voluntary control.75 The conclusion that awareness or “mind,” anyone’s mind—the patient, the doctor, or someone who is aware of the patient—can alter the patient’s physiology is a testament to the “holos” concept in different schools of alternative and complementary medicine. This idea flies so deeply in the face of our mechanistic model of medicine, it forces a complete paradigm shift in the conventional social ethos of medical care. The ultimate control of psyche over soma demonstrates the priority of the conscious mind over physiological processes such as immunity and pain control.76 This puts an enormous responsibility on the phy- sician. He or she must take full account of a patient’s mental and emo- tional states when treating chronic or life-threatening disease.

## Physiological Mechanisms

Identification of a biochemical mechanism for placebo analgesia has done more to change the image of placebo therapy than any amount of arguing about the importance of beliefs and the mind.77 The mechanisms of the placebo response have been suggested to be a mixture of psychological interactions78 and cognitive states79 mediating physiological responses.19 The psychological components

of the patient’s placebo effect have been shown to include decreased anxiety and increased relaxation,54 conditioning,18 expectation,23 and well-being generated by the establishment of a sound doctor–patient relationship.80,81 Review articles summarized a wide range of receptor-agonist mech- anisms driving the neural pathways in different parts of the brain.82 To date, endorphin, dopamine, cholecystokinin, interleukins, growth hormone, and cortisol have been implicated. The physiological mech- anisms of the placebo effect were suggested to include chemicals, cat- alysts, and enzymes. It is believed that steroids, catecholamines,15 the autonomic nervous system,19,83 neuropeptides, and endorphins84 are also involved. These physiological mechanisms interrelate synergisti- cally and are currently being researched within the rapidly developing field of psychoneuroimmunology,7 through which the links between depression, affective disorders, emotions, and the immune system and central nervous system (CNS) are being explored. Susceptibility to depression and sensitivity to pain have now been found to be mediated through neurotransmitters such as catecholamines, serotonin, and dopamine. The current model for explaining the mechanism by which emo- tions, mood, and psychological stress suppress immune function involves cerebral–hypothalamic and pituitary interaction, which translates stress and anxiety into an autonomic–endocrine response. This response adversely affects the immune function, particularly after chronic stimulation. Stressful stimulation is received in the sensory cortex of the brain and is then referred to the limbic system and the hypothalamus. This interface of higher-brain functions and homeo- static regulating centers provides the communication link between the psyche and soma. According to Rossi,19 “The hypothalamus is thus the major output pathway of the limbic system. It integrates the sensory- perceptual, emotional, and cognitive function of the mind with the biology of the body.” The nerve centers that control both branches of the autonomic nervous system (both parasympathetic and sympathetic), nerve cells that secrete endocrine-releasing factors, and neural pathways that release hormones directly into the posterior pituitary are in the hypothalamus. The corticosteroids and catecholamines from sympa- thetic stimulation are key factors in the alteration of disease suscep- tibility in response to stress. Corticosteroids inhibit the function of both macrophages and lymphocytes, as well as lymphocyte prolifer- ation.85 Corticosteroids also cause the thymic and lymphoid atrophy noted by Hans Selye in his experiments on stress-induced immune dysfunction.86 The autonomic release of catecholamines stimulates receptors on the surface of lymphocytes, thereby increasing their maturation rate. When lymphocytes are in a mature state, their ability to kill bacteria and cancer cells and produce interferon seems to become paralyzed.87 Thus a population of mature lymphocytes develops, ready to defend the body from infection and inflammation, yet remains paralyzed until the “red alert” signal of sympathetic fight or flight is turned off, signal- ing the appropriate time to rest and repair. A number of other peptides, E-type prostaglandins, somatotropin, histamine, insulin, endorphins, antidiuretic hormone, and parathy- roid hormone all have receptor sites on lymphocytes and can stimulate the same cyclic adenosine monophosphate–mediated response result- ing in lymphocyte maturation and inhibition.85 A study of the effect of catecholamines on the human immune system showed that when a physiological dose of epinephrine was injected into a healthy vol- unteer, there was an increase in the number of circulating suppressor T lymphocytes and a decrease in the number of circulating helper T lymphocytes (changes similar to those found in acquired immunodefi- ciency syndrome [AIDS]).85

## Neurophysiology of Placebo Response

Medical research has continued to expand the understanding of the placebo healing response, extending the understanding of the com- plexity of the brain functions that control healing in the body.88 One review article did an excellent job of summarizing the psychobiological mechanisms involved in the wide array of medical conditions observed in the placebo response literature.2 Imaging techniques such as pos- itron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have literally illuminated the areas of the brain involved in generating the placebo effect.89 One fascinating development is the indication that the placebo effect may be especially useful in depression, anxiety, sub- stance abuse, and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. Research has indicated that the conditioning and anticipation of the patient have a potent effect of stimulating spe- cific brain region activity associated with pain modulation and neuro- hormonal regulation.

## Brain Region Activity

Some of the most interesting research on placebos has evolved out of the new MRI technology. This functional MRI (fMRI) can measure blood flow into specific areas of the brain. One study showed that expectation or hope was able to stimulate a certain part of the brain that is activated by pain medications and is associated with pain relief. Placebo analgesia was found to be related to decreased brain activity in pain-sensitive brain regions, including the thalamus, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex. It was also associated with increased activity during anticipation of pain in the prefrontal cortex, providing evidence that placebos alter the experience of pain.90 In another study, researchers found that empathy could activate a portion of the brain. They showed that some of the brain regions involved in feeling physical pain became activated when someone empathized with another’s pain. Using fMRI, study participants were observed when they experienced a painful stimulus, and the results were compared with those elicited when the participants observed their spouses receiving a similar pain stimulus. The bilateral ante- rior insula, rostral anterior cingulate cortex, brainstem, and cere- bellum were activated when participants received pain and also by a signal that a loved one experienced pain.91 A group of researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles, using a new technology called quantitative electroencephalography, showed that “effective” placebo treatment induced changes in brain function that were dif- ferent from those associated with antidepressant medication. Placebo responders (those who showed a response to placebo) showed a signif- icant increase in prefrontal activity starting early in treatment that was not seen in medication responders or in participants who showed no response to medication or placebo. Because a high percentage of anti- depressant medication represents the placebo effect, it is important to be able to predict who will be placebo responders.92

## Placebo and Stress Physiology

The stress “letdown” of a patient in the therapeutic environment is one of the mechanisms that produces the placebo effect. It results from the patient’s perception that a transition from a stressful situation to a nonstressful situation has occurred. Mowrer87 observed that with a decrease in anxiety, there is a concomitant increase in hope, signify- ing that the period of suffering is over. Certain familiar images and signals, such as white coats, syringes, behavioral procedures, and clin- ical protocol, create a conditioned response—relief now that help has arrived. Evans and Hoyle54 similarly observed that “the reduction of fear through the shared expectations that the doctor’s medicine will work—even if unknown to the patient it is placebo—mediates power- ful therapeutic effects.”

The placebo effect in the clinical environment transforms the emo- tional and mental stress of the patient. These effects, also observed and described by Franz Alexander,16 Hans Selye,86 George Solomon,93 and Walter Cannon,94 allow the patient to escape the “fight-or-flight” response that can cause and maintain the state of illness.

## Physiological and Psychological Stress

Selye86 demonstrated that physiological stress can have a dramatic effect on the immune and endocrine systems of the body. Laudenslager95 went on to show that it is not just stress that creates these physiologi- cal changes; the perception that stress is “inescapable” is critical to the response. More recently, studies on the effects of psychological stress demonstrated significant changes in immune capability. Maladjustment to “life-change stress” correlated with reduced activity of natural killer cells,93 decreased T- and B-cell responsivity,71 and diminished lym- phocyte cytotoxicity.96 For example, Riley97 observed increased tumor activity in a controlled stress environment and concluded: Emotional, psychosocial, or anxiety-stimulated stress produces increased plasma concentrations of adrenaline, corticosteroids and other hormones through well-known neuroendocrine pathways. A direct consequence of these increased corticoid concentrations is the injury to elements of the immunologic apparatus, which may leave the subject vulnerable to the action of the latent oncogenic viruses, newly transformed cancer cells, or other incipient pathologic pro- cesses that are normally held in check by an intact immune system. The damage to the immune system by stress, mediated through the hypothalamic–pituitary axis, has been shown to be due to the increase in serum levels of cortisol. In one study, elderly caregivers were shown to have higher cortisol levels and poor antibody response to influenza vaccine.98 The effect of cortisol on immune and other regulatory func- tions, such as the regulation of blood sugar, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), insulin, testosterone, and bone resorption, flag it as having highly destructive potential. Anxiety, depression, heart disease, AIDS, and osteoporosis have all been linked with elevated cortisol levels. DHEA, another adrenal hormone, is also modulated by stress phys- iology, although it seems to have the opposite effect of cortisol. High levels of DHEA seem to protect the body from the damaging effects of elevated cortisol. Ratios of DHEA to cortisol are highly predictive of the individual’s ability to tolerate stress.99 Current reviews of the literature relating psychological stress and immune dysfunction support the hypothesis that homeostatic immune mechanisms, both humoral and cellular, are significantly impaired by both natural and experimental stress.5,61,84,100 Hypertension,101 com- mon colds,102 coronary artery disease,103 and myocardial ischemia104 were linked to adverse stress physiology. Stress even has the ability to increase the permeability of the blood–brain barrier.105 The implica- tions of stress-related alterations in the blood–brain barrier expose important insights into enigmatic diseases like chronic fatigue syn- drome and stress-induced neurological disorders.

## Endorphins, Hormones, and Neuropeptides

… one rapidly activated psychoneuroendocrine mechanism through which a placebo stimulus may reduce both depression and pain is produced by stimulating the endorphin system.18 Research on endorphins is a relatively new area of study in the field of psychoneuroimmunology. Original research by Levine et al.106 sug- gested that the pain relief noted in placebo studies could be explained by the simple mechanism of endorphin-mediated actions. The orig- inal emphasis on endorphins and enkephalins was plausible, con- sidering their known modulation of pain and mood functions. This position was further supported by later observations that depres- sion increased chronic clinical pain107 and that decreased activity in endogenous opioids may be part of the pathophysiology of depres- sion.108 With the information that placebo can stimulate endorphins, Levine et al.106 believed that an explanation for the action of placebos had finally been found. Furthermore, research showed that an endor- phin-mediated, pain-suppressant placebo effect could be abolished with the use of Naloxone, an opioid antagonist.109 The same authors went on to further show that endorphin-mediated placebo effects penetrated other physiological systems besides pain management.110 However, this hypothesis failed to account for the broad spectrum of placebo effects as well as for the fact that the analgesia associated with hypnosis was not affected by an opioid antagonist.111,112 It is import- ant to note that later literature suggested that Levine et al.106 were not entirely wrong in implicating the role of endorphins in the placebo mechanism; rather, these researchers were right for the wrong reason. Endorphins are mainly derived from three precursor proteins (by separate biochemical processes).113 These opioid peptides are released from central and peripheral areas in response to pain, stress, and emo- tions and perform many physiological functions, of which analgesia is but one.114 However, it is becoming evident that the boundaries between the CNS and the immune system are not as clear as once thought. The several known effects of endorphins on immune system function are listed in Table 6.2.115 When the functions of neurotransmitters such as endorphins are found to have such an intimate relationship with immune integrity, the paradigm of a body with functions performed independently by its parts—a Newtonian type of thinking—begins to lose credibility. To further blur the already hazy distinction between the CNS and the immune system, research demonstrated that endorphins and peptide hormones, such as adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, and luteinizing hormone, are produced by lymphocytes.115 It is clear that the demarcation between the CNS and the immune system is impossible to distinguish. The brain and the immune sys- tem are the only tissues in the body that have a memory, and the level of communication between the two argues a taxonomy that iden- tifies them as one. Evidence of the innervation of the thymus gland, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes supports the finding that the immune system is subject to efferent CNS information.115 In addition, studies demonstrating the atrophy of the thymus and lymphatic tissues in the absence of growth hormone,116 adrenocorticotropic hormone, and increased steroid production by adrenal cells after interferon stim- ulation indicate that “in the future it will be difficult to distinguish the receptors and signals that are used within and between the neuroendo- crine and immune system.”115

## 95CHAPTER 6 Placebo and the Power to Heal


Whether a clinician intends to initiate a placebo effect in a clinical set- ting or not, the mind of the patient will initiate some subliminal heal- ing effects according to the patient’s hope, expectation, conditioning, anxiety reduction, and meaning around the disease and treatment. A recent article in Lancet2 on placebos concluded, “Any ethical assess- ment of efforts to promote placebo effects in clinical practice first requires knowledge as to the clinical relevance and importance of pla- cebo effects.” A physician with an interest in psychopharmacological treatment, which can be expensive, elaborate, detailed, time consuming, esoteric, and dangerous, usually has considerable knowledge about such treat- ment. He or she is interested in the symptoms of the patient and the differential response to various drugs and is careful to observe side effects, which may be dangerous. The physician may encourage the patient to call at any time if side effects develop.26 The application of the placebo phenomenon in clinical practice should not be a vague attempt to replace the skill of the medically trained physician with obscure “hand waving,” incantations, and inert lactose pills. In primary care and specialty clinical practice, the physi- cian’s intent should be to optimize patient care by engaging restorative defense mechanisms. To effectively apply current placebo research, the physician must understand several principles (listed in Box 6.4 and dis- cussed here).

## Prima Non Nocerum: Prioritize a Treatment Program and

<!-- chunk -->

## Establish a Hierarchy of Care

Prima non nocerum is the Hippocratic injunction dictating that a phy- sician care for the patient so that self-healing mechanisms can engage. This ancient phrase means “Do not disturb the organism’s ability to heal itself.” The body must be given the full range of possibilities in allowing the power of homeostasis, vis medicatrix naturae, to have its optimum capability. “Doing no harm” means that a patient is supplied with the level of medical intervention that is appropriate to his or her ability to maintain life support. The job of the physician is to deter- mine when homeostasis or the defense mechanism has lost the ability to respond to disease. Acute traumatic swelling and inflammation and shock are exam- ples of the human defense mechanism responding in a way that threat- ens the health of the organism. It is most interesting that the organism would make choices, as in shock and inflammation, that could kill it. To practice the principle of prima non nocerum, a physician must learn when to act and when to let the body heal itself. This is the highest art of medicine; each case and situation is different, and it is up to the physician to interpret the needs of the moment. By implication, the physician who seeks to apply this principle understands the principles of physiology on which human life depends for homeostasis. Prima non nocerum does not necessarily mean that a physician withholds invasive therapy: it is the physician’s responsibility to deter- mine when the body is unable to reestablish homeostasis and therapy is indicated. If an arm must be severed to save the patient’s life, there is no violation of prima non nocerum. However, to enhance the principle of prima non nocerum, a phy- sician sometimes must withhold therapies and must be content to leave the patient to self-heal. Hippocrates understood the wisdom of letting the body heal on its own, which is implicit in the injunction to “do no harm.” The following account of the treatment of Charles II of England is a case in point117: A pint of blood was extracted from his right arm and a half pint from his left shoulder, followed by an emetic, two physics, and an enema comprised of fifteen substances; the royal head was shaved and a blister raised; then sneezing powder, more emetics, and bleeding, soothing potions, a plaster of pitch and pigeon dung on his feet, poisons containing ten different substances, chiefly herbs, finally forty drops of extract of human skull and an application of bezoar stone; after which his majesty died. When this treatment is compared with modern procedures, such as mammary artery ligation for the relief of angina—a procedure that has no more benefit than sham artery ligation—it appears that physicians continued throughout the centuries to rely on the placebo effect for the care and cure of their patients. Recently, the invasive standard-of-care procedure percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of angioplasty and placing coronary stents was shown to be no better than placebo for stable angina. Missing from the medical community discussion on this study was the remarkable fact that some individuals who under- went the sham “placebo” PCI procedure had results that demonstrated that the placebo effect can affect cardiac perfusion.118 Our medical culture has very little interest in exploring the physiological limits of self-healing. Because this effect plays such an important role in health care, simple, noninvasive, and effective treatments should be the goal of all therapeutic approaches. Robert Burton119 wrote in 1628, “an empiric oftentimes, and a silly chirurgeon, doth more strange cures than a rational physician … because the patient puts confidence in him.” The rational physician will also recognize that healing and curing are not necessarily the same. If a patient is helped in any way by the doctor, with or without the use of a placebo, the path of cure has been assisted, although the specific disease may not have responded. Not all patients can be cured, but most patients can be helped.

## Tollem Causum: Remove the Cause of Disease

Tollem causum is the principle that seeks to remove the obstacles to cure. The forces “inhibiting the floodgates of health from opening” must be removed for the full force of the patient’s beliefs to effect the path of cure. This concept is fundamental to the philosophy of natu- ropathic medicine, with its strong emphasis on diet, detoxification, and a pattern of living that is consistent and compatible with the con- text in which humans evolved. Obstacles to cure block the self-heal- ing capacity of the organism. Contamination with heavy metals and xenobiotics (see Chapter 35), focal infections, electromagnetic pollu- tion, scar tissue, genetic metabolic abnormalities, and parenchymal organ damage defeat the best therapeutic intentions and must be addressed. The patient’s habitat is an important aspect of the therapeutic pro- tocol, not only in the diagnosis and care of internal mental and phys- iological dysfunction but also in determining which environmental factors may be contributing to dysfunction and disease. These factors might include diet, lifestyle, and living environment. It is of the utmost importance to remove a patient from surroundings that are associated with illness or to assist the patient in creating an environment more conducive to health.

## 96SECTION 1 Philosophy of Natural Medicine

Factors that provide conditioning that reinforces the disease process can be associated directly or indirectly with one’s environment. For example, if animals are returned to situations where their experimen- tal neuroses were induced, their pathological behavior reactivates.120 When a patient leaves the offending environment to receive treatment from a physician, the prognosis is correspondingly more favorable.17 The physician has the added advantage of a patient’s heightened expec- tation during an office visit; a patient’s positive associations with the “healing” environment increase his or her receptivity to treatment.121 If the home or work environment is a source of “disease” and an obsta- cle to cure, providing an alternative environment may be a most help- ful way to remove the obstacles to cure.

## Support the Therapeutic Relationship

Confidence should surround all aspects of the therapeutic interaction. The patient must have confidence in the doctor’s ability to assist a cure; the doctor must have confidence in the efficacy of his or her ther- apy122; and there must be an understanding or relationship between the doctor and patient that is mutually conducive to respect, trust, and compassion. The quality of the doctor–patient relationship is paramount. The therapeutic approach to a patient that optimizes the confidence of the patient in the skill of the doctor stimulates the inherent self-regulating healing mechanisms by relaxing the anxiety the patient has about the illness. Anxiety is a well-known immunosuppressant and aggravates the body’s defense mechanisms. An optimum therapeutic relationship, when combined with the clinical skill to remove the cause of homeo- static dysfunction, is the height of therapeutic acumen. As Lewith123 so accurately stated, “The general practitioner may therefore wish to employ all his knowledge, enthusiasm, consultation technique and sympathy, to create the best possible atmosphere in which to elicit a placebo response from the patient.” Current research on factors contributing to the genesis of the placebo effect consistently document the importance of the doctor– patient relationship.124–126 The healing power of the therapeutic inter- action has been demonstrated by the commencement of the placebo effect even before the actual administration of the pill.127 The physician facilitates the cultivation of a sound relationship by developing good communication skills. The art of the bedside manner has been recognized throughout history as the primary skill a successful physician needs.128 The history of medicine is as much a history of the relationship between doctor and patient as the evolution of medical tech- nology and techniques. Through centuries in which doctors were doing more harm than good, little more than the esteem of their clientele sus- tained the medical profession. But however little real help the doctor had to offer, it was to him that people turned when illness struck.129 Bedside manner has been found in clinical studies to entirely alter the course of double-blind studies, and the quality of a therapeutic encounter has been found to facilitate or disrupt the efficacy of a treat- ment.130 Listening to the patient,130 the verbal and nonverbal commu- nication of the physician, the amount of time spent with the patient,131 patient education,132 the demeanor of the physician,133, and interview skills131 have been suggested as factors and components of effective physician communication skills. Communication between the doctor and patient is not simply a process of one party talking and the other side listening. Deep communication between both sides is a process of “interbrain” synchronization—literally, the brain waves of two people talking begin to match each other, as described in a research study by researchers at the Basque research center BCBL.134 This syn- chronization or lack of it may be an important aspect of interpersonal communication. The examination of placebo dynamics uncovers the complexity, depth, and importance of the doctor–patient relationship. Many factors may be responsible for the varying therapeutic effects of the physician–patient relationship. An open-minded investigation of this relationship brings us, incredibly, to the possibility of brain-to- brain coupling, an interconnected matrix of the mind of the healer and the healed.135 Learning to “listen” or synchronize with the patient you are communicating with ensures optimum transfer of information, hope, empathy, and a host of essential dynamics between doctor and patient. Touch is an important form of communication and is sometimes forgotten as a key aspect of the doctor–patient relationship. Highly skilled clinicians with many years of experience, such as the now deceased Dr. John Bastyr (whose remarkable healing abilities inspired the founding of Bastyr University by those privileged to have been his students), frequently impressed upon clinicians the importance of always using diagnostic and therapeutic touch during a patient visit. The doctor’s touch can be diagnostic, therapeutic, and, perhaps most important, a means of communicating that he or she is deeply attuned to the problems, needs, and fears of the patient.133 Touch can heal by increasing tissue mobility and fluid exchange, as in massage, or by relieving pain, as demonstrated by research on healers who use their hands.136 Touch has also been documented in well-designed double-blind research to extend an unusual healing power that can be transmitted through the hands to plants and animals.137 Among other methods of enhancing confidence between the doctor and patient, the setting in which a doctor provides therapy to a patient also determines its effectiveness. The doctor’s office setting is very important for optimum and effective treatment: tools and support systems are more accessible, and a heightened patient response results from seeking out the “healing” environment. In a clinical trial with hypertensive patients, placebo alone was not as effective as when it was administered in conjunction with hospitalization. The visit to the phy- sician represents a search for changes that cannot be found through “self-care” or over-the-counter medicines. According to Frank138: In short, it appeared that the placebo situation relieved chiefly anxiety and depression, that the degree of relief was unrelated to personality and autonomic measures, and that the patients who responded strongly to a placebo at one time might not at another. In conjunction, these results suggest that the extent of responsive- ness to a placebo depends on the interaction of the patient’s state at a particular time with certain properties of the situation. The find- ing that administration of tests and questionnaires seemed to have at least as beneficial an effect as had the pill implies that any inter- action between patient and situation that heightens expectations of help may lead to symptom reduction and improvement in mood. The aspects of the situation producing this effect include not only presentation of a symbol of the physician’s healing powers (a pill), but any attention and interest shown by professional personnel. This phenomenon was also observed in industry and termed the Hawthorne effect. As a direct result of the greater attention fac- tory workers received during investigation, the quality of their work improved.139 In conclusion, the importance of a doctor–patient rela- tionship and the confidence that it engenders shows that all human beings need to share their feelings and experience the therapeutic ben- efits of touch: the doctor–patient relationship provides an ideal way to meet these fundamental needs.

## 97CHAPTER 6 Placebo and the Power to Heal

For optimum enhancement of the psychoneuroimmune system, the physician must assist the patient in developing practices that amplify positive emotional states and reduce a negative emotional state. A neg- ative mental state (anxiety, stress, panic, anger, depression, neurotic behavior, self-deprecation, self-destructive feelings and tendencies, and a weak will to live) hinders the ideal functioning of the psychoneu- roimmune endocrine axis, disrupting homeostasis. Engle140 termed this the giving-up/given-up complex: Study of the life settings in which patients fall ill reveals that illness is commonly preceded by a period of psychological disturbance, during which the individual feels unable to cope. This has been des- ignated the giving-up/given-up complex and has the following five characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of grat- ification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of the mental coping mecha- nisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biologic emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism’s capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic pro- cesses, permitting disease to develop. The importance of reducing negative mental states in acute and chronic conditions has been discussed extensively.70 Acute psychological stress is documented to cause various forms of cardiopulmonary dysfunction and even death.61 Chronic mental and emotional strain causes a breakdown of the immune system and can lead to disease. The homeostatic processes become overwhelmed by autoimmune, microbial, or neoplastic invasion. Major writers on the subject of acute and chronic stress emphasize the high priority of managing the physiologically and immunologically destructive effects of the human body’s response to stress. Pelletier141 listed hypertension, arteriosclerosis, migraine head- ache, cancer, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, and arthritis as disease processes that are caused or exacerbated by stress physiology. A study researching the relationship between resistance to streptococ- cal infections in families and stress load in the family found a positive correlation.142 Another study on the psychosomatic susceptibility to infectious mononucleosis found that two psychosocial factors, high motivation and poor academic performance, significantly increased the risk of “disease” infection.143 In still another, anticipation of mood and menstrual discomfort were positively correlated and manipulated, thereby supporting the suspicion that expectations act as a determi- nant of mood.144 The conclusion that there is no acute, chronic, or degenerative disease that is not affected by a patient’s mental and emotional state must be drawn from the pervasive immunoendocrine effects gen- erated by the mind and emotions. Wolf145 and Cousins146 wrote of the power of panic as a factor in myocardial infarction; Marbach et al.107 described depression as a component in myofascial pain dysfunction; and Shekelle et al.147 noted, in a 17-year follow-up study, a twofold increase in the incidence of cancer in depressed patients. The clinical scenarios these observers described imply that the placebo effect can control the onset and advance of a disease by shutting down the destructive thoughts, images, and feelings that mediate stress. Enhancing positive emotions is the corollary of controlling the damaging effects of negative mental and emotional states. Laughter,23 hope,148 acceptance,64 and the reduction of suffering149 have been shown to speed the course of healing and reduce the level of pain and distress reported by patients. Although pain is sometimes the only language nature can use to adequately communicate to the patient that something is in need of healing, “the relief of suffering and the cure of disease must be seen as twin obligations of a medical profession that is truly dedicated to the sick.”149 Acceptance has been observed to be a key factor that assists patients in better understanding their pain.64 Acceptance does not mean com- placency in the face of disease but a rational understanding of the sit- uation and the limitations that can sometimes accompany a disease process. The importance of cultivating hope in a patient also cannot be underestimated.150 The fact that a patient seeks the help of a physician or “caregiver” already implies a substrate of hope and is a signal that the patient can visualize the potential for recovery. The treatment needs to merely stimulate this willingness to envision a future of health. Hope is an embodiment of the patient’s and the doctor’s ability to visualize an image of healing and recovery. This process is a recurrent theme in imagery therapy,151 visualization therapy,152 therapeutic touch,153 and psychic healing.154 Hope is both an active and a passive placebo. The passive hope placebo is that which is brought with the patient as the act of seeking help generates a level of unspoken faith in an image or potential for cure. The active hope placebo is generated by the physi- cian, who consciously instills a vision or image of cure in the patient as an adjunct to therapy. Frank138 performed a double-blind study in which patients were divided into control and induction groups. The induction group was led through a process whereby their hope was strengthened to conform with the expectations of the therapist138: It introduces some perceptual clarity into the process of treatment; and to the extent that all our therapists adhered roughly to the insight model of therapy, it helped to bring the patient’s expecta- tions in line with what actually occurred in treatment, and also helped him behave in accordance with the therapist’s expectations of a good patient. The induction group was actually being consciously strengthened to a level of optimal response but was not being led into false expectations.155 This type of patient education or active placebo is a necessary and useful tool for framing and directing a positive outlook and progno- sis. If a patient can conceive of a state of wellness, then that state of wellness can be achieved. It is the job and domain of the physician to discover those images, emotions, and perceptions that reside in the conscious and subconscious mind of the patient that block the image of a positive state of health. He or she must actively work to con- trol these with the same level of intent as with any presenting gross complaint or physiological dysfunction. Finding these dysfunctional mental substrates and working with the patient to try to change them is fundamental to treating the true cause of disease (see earlier discus- sion of tollem causum). Research demonstrated the importance of positive and negative thinking in heart disease and cancer, the two areas of disease that cause the highest death rate. Doctors’ health care management pro- tocols should reflect this research in the same way that attention to a proper diet is part of a management approach to high serum cholesterol. It is now clearly established, for instance, that even low levels of stress trigger the onset of myocardial ischemia.156 We also know from the work of Steven Greer157 and David Spiegel158 that attitude and emotional exploration are critical to breast cancer sur- vival. Knowing these scientific facts, all doctors must have strategies for helping their patients explore the areas of stress management, group therapy and support groups, and skills in building positive attitudes.

## Implement Therapeutic Conditioning or Learning

Those who remain at least dimly aware that everything they say or do to a patient conveys a major or minor, positive or negative, and helpful or harmful psychological impact are likely to be more effective physicians.159 Conditioning of the mind has been suggested as a mechanism by which the placebo effect becomes a learned response.17,19,138 The future of the therapeutic application of placebo will probably hinge primarily on the use of conditioning. A doctor who can understand this will pay close attention to the stimuli of his or her patients and modify these stim- uli in a scientific way to help treat immune-related and neurologically related diseases. Modern psychology acknowledges two models of conditioning or reinforcement of learning behavior, operant and classical. Operant conditioning is a behavior response that theoretically occurs in the presence of some stimulus that is a positive reinforcement; for exam- ple, a rat will learn to press a conditioning bar if a food pellet is dis- pensed as a result. Classical conditioning is a behavior response created by the simultaneous pairing of unconditioned and conditioned stimuli before an evoked response. This is best illustrated by the experiments of Pavlov and his “salivating dog.” In Pavlov’s experiment with the conditioning of a dog’s salivary response to the ringing of a bell, the bell ring is the conditioned stimuli, and the food is the unconditioned stimuli. The salivation is the unconditioned response to the food that becomes the conditioned response. When the dog finally associates the bell ring with the food, the ringing alone causes salivation, the condi- tioned response. The principle of classical conditioning has far-reaching implica- tions for the diagnosis and treatment of disease because of the per- vasive and permeating implications that conditioning has in all the sensory stimuli of daily existence, in sickness and in health: “Pavlov’s teachings, concepts and basic notions afford the real and ultimately scientific basis for the recognition of the potentialities of medical sci- ence attacking diseases from both the psychic and somatic sides.”160 For the purposes of this discussion, one must recognize that classi- cal conditioning happens randomly in our environment and is closely linked to health and healing phenomena. Subconsciously, we note ran- dom events and associate them with previous events and observations, independent of an intended learning behavior. Operant conditioning happens in the context of reward, and classical conditioning happens in the context of associated stimuli. There is a much greater predom- inance and range of associated stimuli for classical conditioning than for operant conditioning for the genesis of the placebo effect. This is because the operant depends on reward, although operant condition- ing can happen in the medical model: “Pain-killing drugs that I have taken in the past kill pain; therefore this capsule, which is a painkiller, will kill my pain.” Gliedman et al.17 noted that drugs that affect the CNS are readily conditioned, whereas drugs that affect the peripheral nervous system and are secretory stimulators (e.g., atropine and pilocarpine) do not result in the establishment of a conditioned response. The primary importance of psychological states to CNS excitation demonstrates that the pivotal loci of command for conditioning reside within the hypothalamus and the limbic system. Therefore a doctor who can induce a state of central excitation in the patient can encourage and condition the patient to make those changes that are deemed necessary for the recovery of health. The conditioning of a patient to a placebo response is modified by learning stimuli associated with the illness, the stimuli of the doctor and the therapeutic setting, the stimuli of the therapy, previous health, medical therapy, and authority-related experiences.161 The way that all of these factors interact in the psyche of the patient determines the nature of the placebo response that is achieved. Satiation obscures the conditioned response, whereas situations of increased stress seem to potentiate the responsiveness of the placebo effect.64 The placebo effect, conditioning, and learning may therefore be subject to the nature of central excitatory states as well as levels of stress and distress. The physiological breadth of the placebo response in humans can now be understood in terms of the variety of interactions and effects that drugs, therapeutic procedures, and sensory phenomena of the medical environment have on the psychosomatic matrix of a patient’s consciousness. Rossi19 noted that this complicated web of sensory pro- cessing reveals how any facet of therapy “that alters any aspect of the body’s sensory, perceptual or physiologic responsiveness on any level can disrupt the more or less fragile state-dependant encoding of symp- toms and thereby evoke a ‘nonspecific’ but real healing effect that we call the placebo response.” The scientific basis of therapeutic applications of psychoneuro- immunology is based on classical conditioning. Ader and Cohen162 performed research to show that the immune system could be con- ditioned for therapeutic purposes. They conditioned immunosup- pression in rats by injecting them with a conditioned stimulus of cyclophosphamide (a potent immunosuppressing agent) while feeding them a saccharine solution as an unconditioned stimulus.162 The idea of conditioning for immunomodulation in human patients is there- fore a promising therapeutic modality. Applying conditioning tech- niques for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus involving a dosage that normally had minimal results resulted in a delay in the development of the disease.163 To fully account for the extent of previous and future condition- ing in a patient, the physician must take a complete and exhaustive history to explore the influences of family, work, accidents, emotional predispositions, medical history, and neutral stimuli as contributing factors during the onset of an illness. Lifestyle and emotional, behav- ioral, or physiological factors might contribute to maintaining the state-dependent learning pattern of disease and dysfunction or give clues to a successful therapeutic intervention. A good example of this is the demonstration by Batterman and Lower164 of increased analge- sic effectiveness based on similar previous therapy. A physician who knows which therapies succeeded and which failed can take advantage of the patient’s conditioning and encourage biochemical pathways that the body has learned. Drug or therapeutic interventions are not proce- dures that can be predicted in the same way that in vivo experimental results can. The variables involved in human responses to therapy are clearly underestimated in the current rush of research-oriented therapeutic evaluation.165 Therefore a patient who has been treated by a number of physicians or practitioners for a complaint and has received no results or relief has been conditioned to believe that consultation and treatment by a physician will provide no positive changes. When the patient visits the next practitioner, even if this practitioner can offer a diagnosis and treatment that are correct answers to the long-sought cure, there are very real patient conditioning factors that must still be considered. Consider the case of a young woman who underwent treatment for breast cancer and the clinical course of the ensuing metastases. Each time she had a positive response to therapy, she experienced a subse- quent remanifestation of the cancer. The result of this conditioning was that she came to equate each new course of chemotherapy as a her- ald of some new manifestation: she “was torn between a desire to live and the fear that allowing hope to emerge again would merely expose her to misery if the treatment failed.”166

## 99CHAPTER 6 Placebo and the Power to Heal

The parameters of conditioning in a clinical setting extend to all aspects of the patient’s sensory perceptions. Consciously or uncon- sciously, the physician provides an environment for patient learning. Lipkin167 pointed out that every drug, every apparatus, every injec- tion, and every piece of information or advice carries a suggestion of help and hope, regardless of the physiological effects that may accom- pany it. The physician must realize that patients are taking in all the information about the surroundings, interactions, and therapy and are making associations that can potentially affect the course of their responsiveness to therapy. Mowrer86 observed that the “safety signals” of syringes, laboratory coats, and behavioral procedures were all retained in the patient’s psy- che for future association. A physician can skillfully take advantage of these signals by encouraging and cultivating response generaliza- tion or by associating previous therapeutic situations with subsequent treatments by means of unconditioned stimuli, such as office music, odors, and images. Giving patients some sort of unconditioned stim- ulus that can be taken home allows them to associate with the condi- tioned response, eliciting the memory of the therapeutic interaction while patients are away from the doctor’s office. These unconditioned stimuli or placebos can be given in multiples at one time81; changed for more powerful stimuli168; and delivered at the end of an induction, suggestion, or imagery procedure. They should not be limited to pills or other apparent medicaments and should extend to sounds, smells, visualizations, and feelings. It should be remembered that therapeutic conditioning depends on a perceived physiological shift or change in the patient as described in the theory and research of biofeedback.169 This shift can be experienced as a sense of relaxation, increased warmth or circulation, altered auto- nomic tone, or a change in some sensory perception. Patients know immediately when there is no change in their disease or dysfunction after they have been given placebo.170 Therefore some patients need a more active form of therapeutic management that allows for some level of perceived change. Ideally this perception would be a sense of being free from pain or alteration from a state of abnormal physiological function to a state of improved physiological function. Acupuncture, spinal manipulation, drug therapy, physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, and surgery are all therapies that can create an immediate biochemical effect that is perceived by the patient. The optimum model to apply to the concept of conditioning therapy and the selection of an appropriate therapy or modality was proposed by Greene and Laskin171 in their evaluation of myofascial pain dysfunction. During an 11-year follow-up study of patients with myofascial pain dysfunction, these researchers concluded that when comparing the effectiveness of a wide variety of reversible and non- reversible (surgical) therapies, conservative and reversible therapies were the most important and appropriate treatment factors for the patient’s health and well-being. Focusing on patient communication, educating patients about the reversibility of the condition and the nature of muscle dysfunction as it relates to stress–pain–spasm, devel- oping a therapeutic strategy based on increasing patient awareness and self-management skills, and selecting a flexible treatment strategy were all found to be essential for achieving a good initial response that could lead to long-term wellness. Greene and Laskin171 believe that the spe- cifics as to which therapy is most indicated are not as important as the need to focus on the nature of presenting musculoskeletal problems and the factors and complexity of the treatment environment. The routine use of active pharmacological substances reinforces the relationship between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. However, the routine use of unconditioned stimuli in the absence of a conditioned response weakens the therapeutic efficacy of the prac- titioner and has been described as “placebo sag.”18 Therefore the learning of a conditioned response from unconditioned stimuli could diminish if the conditioned stimuli fail to produce an adequate or reli- able conditioned response. Without the intermittent demonstration of active strength, the placebo effect will get weaker and weaker. The implications of placebo sag for practitioners of alternative medicine, who try to work with the body’s own defense mechanisms without overwhelming medical intervention, are that periodic use of perceptually active therapy is needed to support a patient who is not able to respond or responds too slowly to a gentler therapeutic nudge. In this case the physician must recondition the vital force to open a path to homeostasis. In a sense, this may be a paradigm of the therapeutic situation, in which changes toward health are induced in the patient by a doctor who is able to cultivate a basic state of arousal, presumably central in nature. This state of arousal causes the patient to become accessible to the doctor’s expectations of the patient.17 The typical placebo burst, in which a therapy is initially effective after a short period but then wanes, is now understood in terms of the placebo sag from a lack of effective unconditioned stimuli to main- tain the conditioned framework.168 Physicians who lack the ability to extract themselves from a series of unsuccessful therapies risk eventual placebo sag18: [T]herapists who primarily use their active strengths (or uncondi- tioned stimuli) paradoxically will get stronger placebo effects than quacks, will enjoy escalating credibility, and will seem as miracle men—when in fact perhaps only half their miracles can be traced to their active ingredients while the other half is a function of the anticipatory (or conditioned) response elicited by their conditioned features. Because the visit to a physician is often initiated by the physical pain of the patient, it stands to reason that skillful pain management is a high priority in establishing a therapeutic conditioned response. Pain management by hypnosis, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, therapeutic touch, direct or indirect manipulation, imagery, acupunc- ture, meditation,172 and an understanding that aims to elicit the nature of suffering166 can all be valuable therapeutic adjuncts to establishing a therapeutic environment that conditions the patient for the full poten- tiation of his or her healing capabilities. (See Chapter 42 for a full dis- cussion of these techniques.) With the recent development of standardization of, research into, and concentration of the active components of plant medicines, vita- mins, and biochemical precursors, naturopathic medicine and other forms of alternative medicine stand on a stronger therapeutic base because of an ever-growing verification of the pharmaceutical and therapeutic armamentarium. These therapeutic modalities are charac- terized by safe yet physiologically active substances and procedures; therefore they provide some defense against placebo sag.

## Use Altered States of Consciousness

Since ancient times, aboriginal humans have recognized the tremen- dous therapeutic power that lies dormant in the subconscious mind. For thousands of years, shamans and medicine men have used trance states to engage the most subtle aspects of the patient’s subconscious to affect factors in disease pathogenesis and prognosis.173 In modern medicine, it has been documented that shamanistic healing involving altered states can offer dramatic “spontaneous remissions33;” the mech- anisms of this process have been explored in the theory and application of hypnosis.4,76 Most currently accepted techniques employed to trigger the sub- conscious to effect positive changes in somatic or psychic health involve hypnosis. The placebo effect has been linked with hypnosis, or

“low arousal states,” which are therefore believed to be critical factors in the evaluation of the mechanisms and perimeters of placebo.160 A review of the literature documenting the potency of hypnosis and the observed results of placebo clearly demonstrated that these two areas yielded remarkably similar clinical results. The inquiry into hypnosis grew out of the simple intent to validate the effectiveness of the mind in healing processes, whereas most placebo literature grew out of the intent to demonstrate a certain percentage of chance, fluke, sponta- neous remission, or psychosomatic illness as a factor to be ruled out in the delivery of intelligent, scientific health care. Using these antiquated definitions of placebo and hypnosis, one is led to believe that hypnosis describes a process of healing based on the skillful guidance of a quali- fied practitioner and that placebo describes a process based on chance, regardless of the professional circumstances. On closer inspection, the distinction between the two blurs: they appear to be much the same process. Illness, healing, and health states shift constantly in the homeo- static system, a system that is affected by stimuli received through the different levels of awareness and can be accessed, investigated, and modified by a variety of techniques. These include placebo, hypnosis, and induced altered states of consciousness. Rossi19 noted that because memory depends on and is limited to the level of awareness in which the memory was acquired, it is “state-bound information”: State dependent memory, learning, and behavior phenomena are the missing link in all previous theories of mind body relation- ships. … The major thrust of these hypotheses is that mind-body information and state-dependent memory, learning and behavior mediated by the limbic-hypothalamic system, are the two funda- mental processes of mind-body communication and healing. … The new approach to mind-body healing and therapeutic hyp- nosis may be conceptualized as processes of accessing and utiliz- ing state-dependent memory, learning and behavior systems that encode symptoms and problems and then reframing them for more integrated levels of adaptation and development. Some psychosomatic phenomena are coded into the behavior of an individual through state-induced patterning. Until the patient can access the state in which somatic complaints are induced, possibly through hypnosis or other methods that break the sympathetic dom- inance of “encoded” shock,174 the psyche cannot clear them from the soma19: A person in a traumatic car accident experiences an intense rush of the alarm reaction hormones. His detailed memories of the acci- dent are intertwined with the complex psychophysiological state associated with these hormones. When he returns to his usual or “normal” psychophysiological states of awareness a few hours or days later, the memories of the accident become fuzzy or, in really severe cases … the victim may be completely amnesic. The memo- ries of the accident have become “state-bound”—that is, they are bound to the precise psychophysiological state evoked by the alarm reaction, together with its associated sensory-perceptual impres- sions. In accessing these psychosomatic state-dependent areas of homeo- static dysfunction, the physician must use techniques that relax the conscious mind and allow access to subconscious content for refram- ing. The nature of the visit to a physician encourages a patient into more accessible unconscious states, as demonstrated by higher placebo effects when patients present in a hospital setting.121 These labile states of consciousness are quite natural; humans constantly cycle in and out of different consciousness states.121 These cycles, or ultradian rhythms, are described as alternating cycles of hemispherical dominance that change every 1½ hours. When these cycles are interrupted by behavioral stress, psychoso- matic behavioral responses such as ulcers, gastritis, asthma attacks, and rashes develop.175 A change in these rhythms manifests as a period of psychic repose. If an individual is in the midst of performing a task, daydreaming or the perceived need for a rest or coffee break may be the external manifestation of an internally sensed signal of a change in rhythm. This is also a period when one is highly susceptible to hyp- notic suggestion. Because these rhythms are very flexible and labile, they can be invoked through hypnosis, or if the physician senses a natural lull indicating a hemispherical switch, a “natural” trance can be induced. Centuries ago in India, practitioners of hatha yoga observed the effect of mental states on the breathing patterns of an individual. With anger, frustration, and mental instability, the breath reflects a short, arrhythmic pattern that mirrors the disturbed psyche of the person. Conversely, when a person is in a peaceful, relaxed, deep meditative state, the breath is long, rhythmic, and barely perceptible. Their dis- covery formed the basis for the development of breathing exercises called pranayama (literally, regulation or restraint of the vital energy), which aimed to calm the breath so that deep states of meditation and focused concentration could be attained. Current research has affirmed the powerful effect these exercises have on asthma, diabetes, chronic gastrointestinal disorders, and psychosomatic and psychiat- ric dysfunction.176 Traditional literature on the ethnomedical effects of training the mind and energy (prana, qi, ki, lung) in India, China, and Tibet consistently remark on the antiaging effects of these training methods. Research suggests that meditation may have a deep antiaging response on human functioning, potentially measurable in the epigen- etic aging effect.177 Therapeutic exercises that use somatic stimuli to effect changes in the psyche create fertile environments for stimulating the placebo response. A breathing technique used to decrease sympathetic tone or alter nostril predominance for causing shifts in hemispherical activ- ity,178 an exercise to release fascial muscle tension and thereby effect mood-enhancing blood flow in the brain,179,180 and a biofeedback treatment that aids in slowing the heart rate and decreasing negative emotional states169 are all examples of how the psyche can be accessed by the soma. The whole process of eliciting the placebo response involves an attempt to marshal all the reserves and potential for heal- ing through a doctor–patient interaction, engaging both the patient’s mind and body to reestablish homeostatic equilibrium. Therapeutic meditation training has shown benefit in modifying pain.181 Engaging in a formal or traditional method of meditation training may give the patient enhanced insight into the nature of his or her mind and thereby elicit psychological and physical health benefits.182 Trained meditators exhibit unique abilities of mental functioning.183 Medical applications of mind-training methods might be better served by relying on meth- ods with deep cultural experience, at the expense of adopting a liberal, nondenominational, nonsectarian method of “relaxation therapy,” as it appears not all awareness therapies are created equal. Traditional meditation-training methods offer the possibility of sustained and enhanced awareness of mental states, which may contribute to positive medical outcomes.184 Healthcare professionals can use the wisdom of psychosomatic therapies as a central part of their therapeutic protocol. In addition to the specific therapeutic regimen, treatment of the whole patient can be achieved through these harmonious techniques. If physicians could persuade patients to care daily for their emotions, minds, and spirits

the way they care for their hair or teeth, the effectiveness of any pre- scribed treatment would be greatly enhanced. As a primary therapeutic adjunct and important basis for preventive medicine, this line of treat- ment is all too often ignored.

# ETHICS

There are two forms of “conscious” placebo use by the physician. The use of a placebo as a gentle therapeutic agent by a practitioner is very different from the use of a placebo in a controlled trial in which the possibility of a known therapy is withheld in a treatment group. Some researchers believe that the use of placebos in clinical trials breaches the Declaration of Helsinki, which states that every patient should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic method.185 The ethical problems of delivering health care in a research design in which there is a possibility of a favorable outcome, and half of the group is denied access to this possible favorable outcome, make it a troubling issue. The ethical use of placebos has also been questioned in an attempt to determine whether a physician should be deceiving patients during the process of healing.186 Although some writers advocate a restricted use of pure and impure placebos because of their “deceptive” nature,169 it becomes clear in a brief review of the current literature6 that any argument for or against the use of placebo assumes the existence of medical procedures that are free of a potential placebo effect. Brody29 concluded that a placebo can be called the “lie that heals.” However, closer examination shows that it is not the lie that does the healing but, rather, the relationship between the patient and doctor that stimulates a natural self-healing mechanism via psychological, symbolic, and bio- logical intervention29: For some time, medical science has looked almost exclusively at technical means of diagnosis and treatment; the doctor/patient relationship that forms the setting for their application has been naively viewed as a noncontributory background factor, relegated to the amorphous realm of the “art of medicine,” or simply ignored. In this setting, the placebo effect has inevitably been viewed as a nuisance variable, interfering with our ability to elicit “clean data” from clinical trials; and deception in medicine has been seen either as an unimportant side issue or as a tolerated means toward an end. But as the doctor/patient is rediscovered as a worthy focus for medical research and medical education, the placebo effect assumes center stage as one approach to a more sophisticated understanding of this relationship. A physician’s correct understanding of the nature of placebo ther- apy has been observed as able to coexist with its inaccurate use and abuse.41 It has been recommended, however, that (1) a pure pla- cebo should not be prescribed unless the physician has examined the exact indications even more carefully than when prescribing specific therapy, and (2) to avoid missing a disease process that can be easily treated with an empirically proven protocol (e.g., vitamin B 12 –deficient peripheral neuropathy), the physician should not relax a diagnostic protocol because a patient seems to be responding to a placebo.186 The final ethical hurdle of placebo use, or any medical treatment, for that matter, is the abuse of hope in the patient’s path of healing. It is one thing to make a harmless recommendation that provides no therapeutic value, but it is another to subject a patient to the known consequences of a dangerous procedure in the pursuit of a dubious outcome. Hope can be abused, leading the patient to experience unrea- sonable suffering.187


Health practitioners must be equipped with a better understanding of placebo therapeutics.10,188 For many years now, the study of placebos has been recommended to doctors and other healthcare professionals. The ideal environment for the dissemination of the therapeutic impli- cations of the doctor–patient relationship is in medical schools as a required part of the curriculum. After finding a pattern of misuse and misunderstanding about the nature and efficacy of placebo, Goodwin et al.41 recommended that better education might result in more effec- tive placebo use. In 1938 Houston128 wrote of the need to reaffirm the art of medi- cine because he perceived a trend in medicine that invested in a con- cept of the therapeutic doctor–patient interaction as “undisciplined thought.” Houston’s remedy for the intellectual bias that viewed med- icine as a “tight, fast-set science” was to emphasize the importance of psychobiology in medical schools129: One of the most hopeful moves in medical education is teaching to first-year students the elements of psychobiology. A system of belief is implanted best in the young. It would be my suggestion that psychobiology be taught in the premedical years, that the doc- tor/patient relationship be the beginning of medical studies. A deep insight into this fundamental philosophy is a chief concern of the internist.

## 103CHAPTER 7 Positive Mental Attitude

The immune system is so critical to preventing cancer that if emo- tions and attitude were risk factors for cancer, one would expect to see an increased risk of cancer in people who have long-standing depres- sion or a pessimistic attitude. Research supports this association; for example, smokers who are depressed have a much greater risk of lung cancer than smokers who are not depressed.15 Depression and the harboring of other negative emotions contrib- ute to an increased risk of cancer in several ways. Most research has focused on the effect of depression and other negative emotions on natural killer cells. Considerable scientific evidence has documented the link between a higher risk of cancer and negative emotions, stress, and a low level or low activity of natural killer cells.16 Negative emo- tions and stress paralyze many aspects of immune function and lit- erally can cause natural killer cells to burst.16,17 Furthermore, the prototypical cancer personality—an individual who suppresses anger, avoids conflicts, and has a tendency to have feelings of helplessness— has lower natural killer cell activity than other personality types.13,14 These studies also indicate that individuals with a personality type that is prone to cancer have an exaggerated response to stress, which com- pounds the detrimental effects stress has on natural killer cells and the entire immune system. Depression and stress not only affect the immune system but also appear to hinder the cell’s ability to repair damage to DNA. Most carcinogens cause cancer by directly damaging DNA in cells, thereby producing abnormal cells. Some of the most important protective mechanisms against cancer in the cell’s nucleus are the enzymes responsible for the repair or destruction of damaged DNA. Several studies have shown that depression and stress alter these DNA repair mechanisms. For example, in one study, lymphocytes from depressed patients demonstrated impairment in the ability to repair cellular DNA damaged by exposure to x-rays.18,19 Just as research has identified personality, emotional, and atti- tude traits that are associated with impaired immune function, the field of psychoneuroimmunology has likewise identified a collection of “immune power” traits that include a positive mental attitude; an effective strategy for dealing with stress; and a capacity to confide trau- mas, challenges, and feelings to oneself and others.16,20

## Cardiovascular Health

The cardiovascular system is another system intricately tied to emo- tions and attitude. The relationship of an optimistic or pessimistic explanatory style with the incidence of coronary heart disease was examined as part of the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study, an ongoing cohort study of older men.8 These men were assessed by the MMPI PSM scale. During an average 10-year follow up, 162 cases of incident coronary heart disease occurred: 71 cases of incident nonfatal myocardial infarction, 31 cases of fatal coronary heart disease, and cases of angina pectoris. Men reporting high levels of optimism had a 45% lower risk for angina pectoris, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and coronary heart disease death than men reporting high levels of pessimism. Interestingly, a clear dose–response relationship was found between levels of optimism and each outcome. To illustrate how closely the cardiovascular system is linked to atti- tude, one study showed how measures of optimism and pessimism affected ambulatory blood pressure.21 Pessimistic adults had higher blood pressure levels than optimistic adults, suggesting that pessimism has broad physiological consequences. Affective well-being (happiness and pleasure) and eudaimonia (sense of autonomy and purposeful engagement with life) have been associated with smaller waist circum- ference, healthier lipid profiles (e.g., greater high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], lower levels of triglycerides), higher levels of serum antioxidants, and lower levels of inflammatory markers (e.g., C-reactive protein [CRP], fibrinogen).22 Excessive anger, worrying, and other negative emotions have also been shown to be associated with an increased risk for cardiovascu- lar disease; however, these emotions may simply reflect a pessimistic explanatory style.

# SELF-ACTUALIZATION

A physician’s role should include facilitating the health of the patient as well as helping the patient achieve self-actualization, which is a concept developed by Abraham Maslow, the founding father of humanistic psy- chology. His work and theories were the result of more than 30 years of intense research on psychologically healthy people. Essentially, Maslow was the first psychologist to study healthy people. He strongly believed that the study of healthy people would create a firm foundation for the theories and values of a new psychotherapy. Maslow discovered that healthy individuals are motivated toward self-actualization, a process of “ongoing actualization of potentials, capacities, talents, as fulfillment of a mission (or call, fate, destiny, or vocation), as a fuller knowledge of, and acceptance of, the person’s own intrinsic nature, as an increasing trend toward unity, integration, or synergy within the person.”23 Maslow developed a five-step pyramid of human needs in which personality development progresses from one step to the next. The needs of the lower levels must be satisfied before the next level can be achieved. When needs are met, the individual moves toward well-be- ing and health. Fig. 7.1 displays Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. The primary needs that form the base of the pyramid are basic sur- vival or physiological requirements: the satisfaction of hunger, thirst, sexuality, and shelter. The second step consists of safety needs, which are essential for dealing with the world: security, order, and stability. The individual then progresses to the third step, which involves the abil- ity to love and be loved: belonging. The fourth step involves self-esteem and self-respect: approval, recognition, and acceptance. The final step is self-actualization: the use of one’s creative potential for self-fulfillment. In modern life, a person’s occupation often correlates with the ability to achieve these needs. Table 7.1 provides an application of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs in an occupational environment. Maslow studied self-actualized people and noted that they had strikingly similar characteristics. Some of Maslow’s key findings, in an abbreviated form, include the following: • Self-actualized people perceive reality more effectively than others and are more comfortable with it. They have an unusual ability to Being Needs Self-esteem Needs Belonging Needs Safety Needs Physiologic Needs Deficit Needs Self-actualization

detect the spurious, the fake, and the dishonest in personality. They judge experiences, people, and things correctly and efficiently. They possess an ability to be objective about their own strengths, possi- bilities, and limitations. This self-awareness enables them to clearly define values, goals, desires, and feelings. They are not frightened by uncertainty. • Self-actualized people have an acceptance of self, others, and nature. They can accept their own human shortcomings without condem- nation. They do not have an absolute lack of guilt, shame, sadness, anxiety, and defensiveness, but they do not experience these feelings to unnecessary or unrealistic degrees. When they do feel guilty or regretful, they do something about it. Generally, they do not feel bad about discrepancies between what is and what ought to be. • Self-actualized people are relatively spontaneous in their behav- ior and even more spontaneous in their inner lives, thoughts, and impulses. They are unconventional in their impulses, thoughts, and consciousness. They are rarely nonconformists, but they seldom allow convention to keep them from doing anything they consider important or basic. • Self-actualized people have a problem-solving orientation toward life instead of a self-orientation. They commonly have a mission in life, some problem outside themselves that enlists much of their energies. In general, this mission is unselfish and is involved with the philosophical and ethical. • Self-actualized people have a quality of detachment and a need for privacy. Often, it is possible for them to remain above the battle, to be undisturbed by what upsets others. They are self-governing peo- ple who find meaning in being active, responsible, self-disciplined, and decisive rather than being pawns or helplessly ruled by others. • Self-actualized people have a wonderful capacity to appreciate the basic pleasures of life, such as nature, children, music, and sex, again and again. They approach these basic experiences with awe, pleasure, wonder, and even ecstasy. • Self-actualized people commonly have mystical or “peak” experi- ences, times of intense emotions in which they transcend the self. During a peak experience, they have feelings of limitless horizons and unlimited power while simultaneously feeling more helpless than ever before. There is a loss of place and time and feelings of great ecstasy, wonder, and awe. The peak experience ends with the conviction that something extremely important and valuable has happened, and thus the person is transformed and strengthened by the experience to some extent. • Self-actualized people have deep feelings of identification with, sympathy for, and affection for other people despite occasional anger, impatience, or disgust. • Self-actualized people have deeper and more profound interper- sonal relationships than most other adults, but not necessarily deeper than children’s. They are capable of more closeness, greater love, more perfect identification, and more erasing of ego bound- aries than other people would consider possible. One consequence is that self-actualized people have especially deep ties with relatively few individuals, and their circle of friends is small. They tend to be kind or at least patient with almost everyone, yet they speak realis- tically and harshly of those who they feel deserve it, especially hyp- ocritical, pretentious, pompous, or self-inflated individuals. • Self-actualized people are democratic in the deepest possible sense. They are friendly toward everyone, regardless of class, education, political beliefs, race, and color. They believe it is possible to learn something from everyone. They are humble, in the sense of being aware of how little they know in comparison with what could be known and what is known by others. • Self-actualized people are strongly ethical and moral. However, their notions of right and wrong and good and evil are often unconventional. For example, a self-actualized person would never consider segregation, apartheid, or racism to be morally right, although it may be legal. • Self-actualized people have a keen, unhostile sense of humor. They do not laugh at jokes that hurt other people or are aimed at others’ inferiority. They can make fun of others in general or of themselves when they are foolish or try to be big when they are small. They are inclined toward thoughtful humor that elicits a smile, is intrinsic to the situation, and is spontaneous. • Self-actualized people are highly imaginative and creative. The cre- ativeness of a self-actualized individual is not of the special talent type, such as Mozart’s, but rather is like the naive and universal creativeness of unspoiled children.

# CLINICAL APPLICATION OF LEARNED OPTIMISM

The new psychology that Maslow’s work referred to may turn out to be “positive clinical psychology.”24 This field of practice was born in when Martin Seligman chose it as the theme for his term as president of the American Psychological Association.25 Positive clinical psychol- ogy aims to change clinical psychology to have an equally weighted focus on both positive and negative functioning.26 The approach is based on five key bodies of empirical findings: (1) the absence of positive well-being leads to the development of disorder over time9; (2) the absence of positive characteristics predicts disorder above and beyond the presence of negative characteristics9; (3) positive charac- teristics interact with negative life events to predict disorder (so study- ing only negative life events would produce misleading results)27; (4) many aspects of well-being range from extremely negative functioning, through a neutral midpoint, to positive well-being (possibly including happiness to depression and anxiety to relaxation continuums),28 mak- ing it impossible to study exclusively negative or positive well-being; and (5) positive interventions can be as effective as other more com- monly used approaches, such as cognitive therapy.29 Positive clinical psychology ultimately involves helping patients become optimistic, which, according to Martin Seligman, is our natu- ral tendency.30 Optimism not only is a necessary step toward achieving optimal health but is also critical to happiness and a higher quality of life.

## 105CHAPTER 7 Positive Mental Attitude

In many instances, it is not what happens in one’s life that deter- mines one’s direction; to a large degree, it is the response to those challenges that shapes the quality of life and determines one’s level of health. Surprisingly, it is often true that hardship, heartbreak, disap- pointment, and failure serve as the sparks for joy, ecstasy, compassion, and success. The determining factor is whether these challenges are viewed as stepping-stones or stumbling blocks. A person’s attitude is like his or her physical body: it must be condi- tioned to be strong and positive. Conditioning an attitude to be positive and optimistic requires adopting specific healthy habits. Four key areas of focus for helping patients develop a positive mental attitude are as follows: 1. Help them become aware of self-talk. Tell them that all people conduct a constant running dialogue in their heads. In time, the things people say to themselves and others percolate down into their subconscious minds. Those inner thoughts, in turn, affect the way people think and feel. Naturally, a steady stream of negative thoughts will have a nega- tive effect on a person’s mood, immune system, and quality of life. The cure is to become aware of self-talk and then to consciously work to feed positive self-talk messages to the subconscious mind. 2. Help them ask better questions. The quality of a person’s life is equal to the quality of the questions habitually asked. For example, if a person experiences a setback, does he or she think, “Why am I so stupid? Why do bad things always happen to me?” or “Okay, what can be learned from this situation so that it never happens again? What can I do to make the situation better?” Clearly, the latter response is healthier. Regardless of the situation, asking bet- ter questions is bound to improve one’s attitude. Some examples of questions that can improve attitude and self-esteem when asked regularly include the following: “What am I most happy about in my life right now?” “What am I most excited about in my life right now?” “What am I most grateful about in my life right now?” “What am I enjoying most in my life right now?” “What am I committed to in my life right now?” “Whom do I love? Who loves me?” “What must I do today to achieve my long-term goal?” 3. Help them experience gratitude. A large body of recent work has sug- gested that people who are more grateful have higher levels of well-be- ing and are happier, less depressed, less stressed, and more satisfied with their lives and social relationships.31,32 Gratitude appears to have one of the strongest links with mental health of any character trait. Help- ing instill a sense of gratitude has been shown to be a very successful intervention. In one study, participants were randomly assigned to one of six therapeutic interventions designed to improve the participants’ overall quality of life.33 Of these six interventions, it was found that the biggest short-term effects came from a “gratitude visit,” where partici- pants wrote and delivered a letter of gratitude to someone in their lives. This simple gesture showed a rise in happiness scores by 10% and a significant fall in depression scores, the results of which lasted up to month after the visit. The act of writing “gratitude journals,” in which participants wrote down three things they were grateful for every day, had longer-lasting effects on happiness scores. The greatest benefits with this practice were usually found to occur around 6 months after it began. Similar practices have shown comparable benefits. 4. Help them set positive goals. Learning to set achievable goals is a powerful method for building a positive attitude and raising self-es- teem. Achieving goals creates a success cycle: a person feels better about him- or herself, and the better he or she feels, the more likely he or she is to succeed. Some guidelines for helping patients set healthy goals include the following: • Be specific. The more clearly the goal is defined, the more likely it will be achieved. For example, if a person wants to lose weight, he or she should define the desired weight and the body fat per- centage or measurements to be achieved. • State the goal in positive terms and in the present tense; avoid negative words. It’s better to say, “I enjoy eating healthy, low-calorie, nutritious foods” than to say, “I will not eat sugar, candy, ice cream, and other fattening foods.” • Make the goal attainable and realistic. Start out with goals that are easily attainable, like drinking six glasses of water a day or switching from white to whole-grain bread. Initially choosing easily attainable goals creates a success cycle that helps build a positive self-image. Little things add up to make a major differ- ence in the way a person feels about him- or herself. Counseling is necessary for the severely pessimistic individual. Forms of cognitive therapy appear to be the most useful therapy. Cognitions comprise the whole system of thoughts, beliefs, mental images, and feelings. Cognitive therapy can be as effective as the use of antidepressant drugs in the treatment of moderate depression; in addition, there tends to be a lower risk of relapse—the return of depression—with cognitive therapy.34 One reason for this is that cognitive therapy teaches people practical skills they can use to com- bat depression anytime, anywhere, and every day for the rest of their lives. Cognitive therapy avoids the long, drawn-out (and expensive) process of psychoanalysis. It is a practical, solution-oriented psy- chotherapy that teaches skills a person can apply to improve quality of life. Mental health specialists trained in cognitive therapy seek to change the way the depressed person consciously thinks about failure, defeat, loss, and helplessness. To do so, they employ five basic tactics that help patients do the following: • Recognize the automatic negative thoughts that flit through con- sciousness at the times when they feel the worst. • Dispute the negative thoughts by focusing on contrary evidence. • Learn a different explanation to dispute the automatic negative thoughts. • Avoid rumination (the constant churning of a thought in one’s mind) by helping the patient better control his or her thoughts. • Question depression-causing negative thoughts and beliefs and replace them with empowering, positive thoughts and beliefs.

# Primary and Adjunctive

# Diagnostic Procedures

During the 20th century, tremendous progress was made in the development of laboratory procedures for the diagnosis of disease. However, this work focused primarily on pathological processes—typically advanced disease; little was done to help the physician recognize physiological abnormalities before they progress to the pathological stage. The problem is further aggravated for doctors of preventive/integrative/functional/natural medicine, who need to evaluate in an objective manner the nutritional status, lifestyle, physiological competency, toxic load, and vitality of their patients. The few avail- able tests that exist tend to be oriented to measuring absolute values rather than functional indices and generally indicate abnormal values only after serious dysfunction develops. In this section, we have compiled useful assessment methodologies we believe will greatly aid healthcare profession- als who want more objective tests in their evaluation of the pathophysiological status of their patients and the causes of dysfunction. These are not meant to replace the standard, pathologically oriented, diagnostic procedures. Rather, we are encouraging the use of methodologies that aid in the early diagnosis of disease susceptibility, quantification of the processes that usually precede clinical disease, and ways to objectively assess foundational causes like functional nutritional deficien- cies and toxic load. Where possible, preference is given to tests that measure the uniqueness of the patient’s biochemistry rather than abstract absolute values. In keeping with the metabolic and scientific orientation of this textbook, the emphasis has been placed on those procedures that have strong support in the research literature. Most of these laboratory procedures are on the cutting edge of our understanding of the assessment of the physiological function of metabolically unique individuals. Because it is an emerging field, few experts exist, and many are employed by or associated with the commercial laboratories performing the procedures.

## 108SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

This process of apoptosis and its analysis by flow cytometry are shown in Figs. 8.1 and 8.2. Another assessment of apoptosis involves ex vivo cell analysis. Specifically, the expression of active caspase-3 along with the Bcl-2:Bax ratio as markers of apoptosis can be measured. Immunohistochemical staining will reveal the expression of these apoptotic-related proteins, caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3; the latter is indicative of apoptosis.10 Bcl-2 is antiapoptotic gene product that exists in ratio to Bax and Bak, which are proapoptotic gene products. This ratio is indicative of the degree of apoptosis, with a decreased Bcl-2:Bax ratio indicative of apoptosis. Cells from Bax(−/−) and Bak(−/−) knockout animals do not respond to apop- tosis inducers. In these cells, cytochrome C is not released from the mito- chondrial membrane to initiate the caspase cascade.11 Thus Bax and Bak are critical to apoptosis, and their expression in relation to Bcl-2 is highly correlative to apoptosis.

<!-- chunk -->

## Different Stages of Apoptosis

The process of apoptosis is divided into three stages: • Induction • Sensing or triggering • Execution These stages of apoptosis are depicted in Fig. 8.3. Induction rep- resents the initial events that signal a cell so that apoptosis may begin. This induction phase may be induced by various physical agents, such as toxic chemicals, hypoxia, radiation, chemotherapy agents, hormones, and CD95 or Fas ligation. It has been proposed that the induction stage of apoptosis is prevented by many antioxidants (vitamin C, β -caro- tene, and vitamin E) and also by various biological response modifiers, including lentinan, thymic hormones, viral antigens, and cytokines. It is important to note that both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis induction converge in the mitochondria and that the pre- vention or initiation of apoptosis from this point is the result of cellular redox status.12 Persistent low to moderate oxidation is consistent with the prevention of apoptosis. Low to moderate oxidative stress within the mitochondrial membrane activates Bcl-2. Bcl-2 maintains the intracellu- lar redox status at a level that is optimal for the cell. Bcl-2 does this by increasing the mitochondrial burn rate of oxygen, thereby increasing elec- tron leakage and oxygen concentration, relative to hydrogen peroxide, in the mitochondrial membrane. This reduces the permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane and the opening of apoptotic pores. Further, Bcl-2 physically sequesters proapoptotic proteins, Bax and Bak.13 Bax and Bak normally facilitate the release of cytochrome C from the inner mitochondrial membrane and out into the cytosol, where it initiates the caspase cascade. However, when oxidative stress is acute or high, the inhibitory role of Bcl-2 is altered, and apoptosis can occur. Also, higher levels of reactive oxidative stress generate more hydrogen peroxide within the mitochondria, which, in turn, oxidizes other mitochondrial compo- nents, such as cardiolipin, and inner membrane phospholipid. Oxidized cardiolipin moves to the outer mitochondrial membrane and recruits Bax and Bak, thus enabling the release of cytochrome C through Bax- and Bak-controlled pores, finally activating caspases and apoptosis.14 Also in response to higher oxidative stress, p53 translocates from the cell’s nucleus to the mitochondria, where it is de-ubiquitinated and subsequently acti- vates Bax- and Bak-induced apoptosis.15 Chemicals Toxins Ultraviolet Cancer drugs Early apoptotic cell Live cell Detection of % apoptosis by staining of membrane annexin or DNA single-strand break Late apoptotic cell

There is, however, a limit to the proapoptotic response to oxida- tive stress. When oxidative stress is overwhelmingly high and/or pro- longed, oxidative damage occurs to cytochrome C and to downstream caspases preventing apoptosis. There are other apoptotic escape mech- anisms present in cells as well. Mitochondrial paraoxonase enzymes PON2 and PON3 interact with ubiquinone to reduce oxygen release. This mitigates oxidation of cardiolipin, creating a resistance to apop- tosis. In fact, PON2 and PON3 have been established as key factors in the prevention of atherosclerosis because endothelial and macrophage death are the basis of atherogenic plaques.16 The induction of apoptosis is entirely dependent on the redox state of the cell and the mitochondrial response to oxidation. Mitochondria can respond to moderate or acute oxidative stress by initiating apop- tosis; however, excessive and/or prolonged oxidative stress prevents apoptosis. Glutathione plays a major role in controlling mitochon- drial oxidative stress. Reduced glutathione (GSH) donates electrons to reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby preventing the genera- tion of hydrogen peroxide. In the course of donating the electron, glutathione itself becomes oxidized (GSSG). Oxidized glutathione is then regenerated back to its reduced state through the action of glutathione reductase. On the one hand, the presence of GSH facil- itates the destruction of hydrogen peroxide, thereby preventing the release of cytochrome C and delaying apoptosis. This allows the cell to undergo repair, instead of apoptosis, when the oxidative stress is temporary and/or low. On the other hand, by regulating the amount of oxidation, GSH preserves mitochondrial membrane integrity and cytochrome C, ensuring that the capacity for apoptosis in the face of high and/or prolonged oxidative stress is present. If there is a defi- ciency of reduced glutathione or damage to glutathione reductase (for instance by arsenic trioxide or lead) in the context of high oxidative stress, the cell will be unable to initiate apoptosis.17 Instead, the cell will be forced to undergo unprogrammed cell death, or necrosis. This is an inflammatory event and will ultimately further contribute to the regional oxidative stress. Thus the induction of apoptosis is intimately connected with the cellular redox potential of cells, itself regulated primarily by glutathione. The induction stage is followed by a decision on whether or not the cell will undergo apoptosis. The decision to die is under the control of a number of different pathways or cellular sensors that induce the apoptosis signal, which then triggers the central mechanisms. During this stage, enzymes such as interleukin-1 β –converting enzymes, serine protease, cysteine protease, granzymes, and cyclin-dependent kinases become activated. Once activated, these enzymes dismantle the cell and trigger the cell-surface changes that cause direct cell recognition and engulfment of the dying cells by phagocytes. These central events are prevented by various antioxidants and biological response modifiers.

## Apoptosis Is Induced by Chemicals to Control

## Malignancy

Many chemicals have the capacity to bind to DNA, form DNA adducts, or cause DNA single-strand breaks, possibly leading to cancer. However, the body is equipped with many factors, enzymes, suppressor genes, and cellular sensors, all with the capacity to prevent the conse- quences of this DNA damage by activating apoptosis-inducing signals. The role of apoptosis in regulating tissue growth is readily appar- ent in the simple equation in which the rate of growth is equal to the difference between the rates of cell proliferation and cell death. Thus tissues expand if the rate of proliferation exceeds the rate of cell death. This is one of the reasons for suggesting that defects in apoptosis may contribute to the transformed state. An important prediction of the relevance of apoptosis to malig- nancy is that the rate of apoptosis versus mitosis should influence the behavior of a tumor. Recently, the relationship between the apop- totic and mitotic indexes in a tumor was demonstrated as predictive of outcome: a higher ratio of apoptosis to mitosis within the tumor correlated with a positive prognosis. Further, it was found that this was not simply a function of cell death per se. Tumors with a high incidence of necrosis rather than apoptosis were correlated with a poor prognosis. It therefore follows that treatments or conditions that favor apoptosis should have desirable effects and that defects in the pathways leading to apoptosis are likely to play important roles in the process of oncogenesis.6,7 Many reactive chemicals and drugs, such as acetaminophen, diquat, carbon tetrachloride, quinones, cyanide, polyhydroxy poly- ether, methyl mercury, and organotin, have been implicated in apop- tosis (programmed cell death) and necrosis (toxic cell death).18–25 Most research on chemical induction of apoptosis is carried out with primary cultures of cell lines (e.g., neurons, thymocytes, carci- noma cells, leukemia cells, neuroblastoma, breast cancer cells, lym- phoma); little has been published on the in vivo effects of chemicals on apoptotic cells in animal models and none in humans. Therefore it was of interest to examine the effects of exposure to low levels of benzene, as well as through drinking water concentrations of up to 14 ppb, on the apoptotic cell population, as well as to examine possible changes in the cell cycle progression.18 Evidence is sufficient for the carcinogenicity of benzene in humans; therefore there is no safe level of exposure to this chemical or its metabolites. Published case reports, a case series, epidemiological stud- ies, and both cohort and case-control studies have shown statistically significant associations between leukemia and occupational exposure to benzene and benzene-containing solvents.26,27 It has been indicated that possibly 800,000 persons are exposed to benzene from coke-oven emissions at levels of less than 0.1 ppm, and 5 million may be exposed to benzene from petroleum refinery emis- sions at levels of 0.1 to 1 ppm. Since these studies, numerous chemicals have been implicated in apoptosis (or programmed cell death), which arises from damage to DNA. One of the authors, Vojdani, along with collaborators, hypothesized that in individuals with a certain genetic makeup, benzene or its metabolites act as haptens, which may induce programmed cell death. The study involved a group of 60 male and female subjects who were exposed to benzene-contaminated water (at concentrations up to 14 ppm for a period of 3–5 years).18 For com- parison, a control group consisting of 30 healthy males and females with a similar age distribution and without a history of exposure to benzene were recruited. Using flow cytometry, the peripheral blood lymphocytes of both groups were tested for the percentage of apoptotic cell population. When exposed individuals were compared with the control group, statistically significant differences between each mean group were detected (27.5 ± 2.4 and 10 ± 2.6, respectively), indicating an increased rate of apoptosis in 86.6% of exposed individuals (P < 0.0001; Mann–Whitney U-test). Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis in a healthy control and a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome is shown in Fig. 8.4. It has been demonstrated that benzene induction of apoptosis is caused by a discrete block of the cell-cycle progression. There is a ten- dency for normal cells to commit “suicide” when deprived of usual growth factors or physical contact with their neighbors due to chemical exposure, which may represent a built-in defense against metastasis. Prompt activation of apoptosis in tumor cells that leave their native tissue presumably eliminates many metastatic cells before they have a chance to proliferate. In cancer, it is tumor cells that neglect to sacrifice themselves or forget to die. Researchers increasingly describe cancer as

## 110SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

a disease involving both excessive proliferation of cells and abandon- ment of their ability to die. The dysregulation of apoptosis in malig- nant cells underlies both the initiation and progression of cancer. Cancer develops after a cell accumulates mutations in several genes that control cell growth and survival. When a mutation seems irrep- arable, the affected cell usually kills itself rather than risk becoming deranged and potentially dangerous. However, if the cell does not die, it or its progeny may live long enough to accumulate mutations that enable it to divide uncontrollably and metastasize. In many tumors, genetic damage apparently fails to induce apop- tosis because the constituent cells have inactivated the gene that codes for the p53 protein. This protein can lead to activation of the cell’s apoptotic machinery when DNA is injured by environmental agents, such as benzene or its metabolites. Therefore it is important to study cell suicide in health and diseases.

## Apoptosis in Cancer

The failure of apoptosis in malignant cells in the context of irreparable DNA damage leads to tumor progression. Cancer therapies, namely chemotherapy and radiation, control cancer by inflicting cell damage, which, in turn, triggers apoptosis. Unfortunately, >50% of all human cancers involve a mutation of p53, a central gene in apoptosis. p53 stimulates both the extrinsic death receptor pathway of apoptosis as well as the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway involving a decreased Bcl- 2:Bax ratio. Thus it is imperative to find therapies that promote apop- tosis independent of p53. Promising therapies in this regard include curcumin28 derived from Curcuma longa, genistein derived from soy,29 and resveratrol,30 all of which are under investigative study for this application. Another promising cancer treatment involves the use of recombinant human apoptosis ligands to induce tumor necrosis fac- tor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). These ligands induce apoptosis via TRAIL, a selective death receptor pathway in a broad range of cancer cell lines, while sparing most normal cell types.31 The therapeutic potential for TRAIL-inducing ligands is most promising in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy agents. Advances in cancer therapy are likely to come in the area of targeted therapies, the majority of which trigger specific receptor-driven path- ways that culminate in apoptosis. The centrality of apoptosis induction in cancer cannot be overstated.

## Apoptosis in Autoimmune Diseases

In cancer, it is the tumor cells that forget to die; in autoimmunity, immune cells fail to die when they are supposed to. Virtually all tissues harbor apoptotic cells at one time or another. Damaged cells usually commit suicide for the greater good of the body; when this does not occur, disease may develop. Autoimmunity occurs when the antigen receptors on immune cells recognize specific antigens on healthy cells and cause the cells bearing those particular substances to die. Autoimmune disease results from perpetuated immune-mediated tissue destruction and can involve immune cells that are resistant to apoptosis. Under normal conditions, the body allows a certain number of self-reactive lymphocytes to circulate. These cells normally do little harm, but they can become overactive through several processes. For instance, if these reactive lymphocytes recognize some foreign anti- gen such as microbes on food and haptenic chemicals, then exposure to that antigen causes them to become excited. If, due to molecular

mimicry, these antigens are similar to normal tissues, the activated cells may expand their numbers and attack the healthy tissue, thus causing an autoimmune disease.3,32,33 Autoimmune reactions usually are self-limited—they disappear when the antigens that originally set them off are cleared away. In some instances, however, the autoreactive lymphocytes survive longer than they should and continue to induce apoptosis in normal cells. Some evidence in animals and humans has indicated that extended survival of autoreactive cells is implicated in at least two chronic autoimmune syndromes—systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. In other words, the lymphocytes undergo too little apoptosis, with the result that normal cells undergo too much.34,35

## Apoptosis During Viral Infection

Disturbance in the regulation of apoptosis is a component in various diseases. Viral illnesses are among the diseases caused by apoptosis dysregulation. After entering a cell, viruses attempt to shut down the cell’s ability to make any proteins except those needed to produce more virus. This act of stalling host protein synthesis is enough to induce many kinds of cells to undergo apoptosis. If the host cell dies, the virus is also eliminated. Therefore certain viruses have evolved ways to inhibit apoptosis in the cells they infect. Epstein–Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis and has been linked to lymphomas in humans, uses a mechanism that has been seen in other viruses. Epstein–Barr virus produces substances that inhibit apoptosis. Papillomavirus, a major cause of cervical cancer, inactivates p53, a central mediator of apoptosis. Cowpox virus, a relative of which is used as the smallpox vaccine, is another virus that inhibits caspase activation and attendant apoptosis. Investigators interested in antiviral therapy are now exploring ways to block the activity of the antiapop- totic molecules manufactured by viruses.34

## Apoptosis in Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome

Induction of apoptosis by viruses in healthy cells is believed to con- tribute to the immune deficiency found in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In these patients, infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes T-helper cells to die. As T-helper cells gradually disappear, cytotoxic cells, such as natural killer cells, also perish through apoptosis because they cannot survive without the growth signals produced by T-helper cells. When the num- ber of T cells dwindles, so does the body’s ability to fight infections, especially viral and parasitical infections. Researchers have shown that many more helper cells succumb in addition to those that are infected with HIV. It is also highly probable that a large number of the cells die through apoptosis. Apparently, Fas plays a crucial role in this process. Normally, T cells make functional Fas only after they have been active for a few days and are ready to die. However, helper cells from AIDS patients may display high amounts of functional Fas even before the cells have encountered an antigen. This display of Fas would be expected to cause the cells to undergo apoptosis prematurely whenever they encounter Fas ligand on other cells (such as on T cells already acti- vated against HIV or other microbes). In addition, if the primed cells encounter the antigen recognized by their receptors, they may trigger their own death. It is also possible that oxygen free radicals trigger the suicide of virus-free T cells. These highly reactive substances are produced by inflammatory cells drawn to infected lymph nodes in patients with HIV. Free radicals can damage DNA and membranes in cells. They will cause necrosis if they do extensive damage, but they can induce apop- tosis if the damage is more subtle. In support of the free-radical theory, researchers have found that molecules capable of neutralizing free rad- icals prevent apoptosis in T cells obtained from patients with AIDS.34,35 Therapies with antiapoptotic medication, such as Trolox, a water-soluble analog of vitamin E that prevents oxidative stress, and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a potent inhibitor of nuclear factor- κ B, are now the focus of AIDS and autoimmune disease studies.36,37 Additionally, protease inhibitors, which are the mainstay of HIV therapy, inhibit apoptosis in immune cells.38 The mechanism underlying the apoptosis inhibition is as of yet unknown, but interestingly, supratherapeutic doses of protease inhib- itors have an opposite, proapoptotic effect.

## Apoptosis in the Heart and Brain

In contrast to cancer, where cells forget to die and insufficient apoptosis occurs, excessive apoptosis accounts for much of the cell death that fol- lows heart attacks and strokes. In the heart, vessel blockage decimates cells that were fully dependent on the vessel. Those cells die by necro- sis, partly because they are catastrophically starved of the oxygen and glucose they need to maintain themselves and partly because calcium ions, which are normally pumped out of the cell, rise to toxic levels. Over the course of a few days, cells surrounding the dead zone, which initially survive because they continue to receive nourishment from other blood vessels, can die as well. Later, however, many cells die by necrosis after being overwhelmed by the destructive free rad- icals that are released when inflammatory cells swarm into the dead zone to remove necrotic tissue. The less injured cells commit suicide by apoptosis. If the patient is treated by restoring blood flow, still more cells may die by necrosis or apoptosis because reperfusion leads to a transient increase in the production of free radicals. Similarly, in strokes due to inflammation, the release of such neurotransmitters as glutamate leads to necrosis and apoptosis. Understanding of the factors that lead to the tissue death accompanying heart attack, stroke, and reperfusion has led to new ideas for treatment. Notably, cell death might be limited by drugs and other agents that block free-radical production or inhibit proteases. Apoptosis also accounts for much of the pathology seen in such diseases as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease), which are marked by the loss of brain neurons. Elevated apoptosis in these neurological diseases seems to be related to a lack of production of the nerve growth factor and to free-radical damage. It seems likely that a combination of such factors could cause many cells to destroy themselves. Manipulation of this process of cell killing may help in treating these neurological diseases. Studies in animal models imply that long-term delivery of nerve growth factors could protect against programmed cell death in these conditions. Therefore a greater understanding of the mech- anisms involved in cell death should greatly enhance those important steps.32,36,39

# CONCLUSIONS

Apoptosis and cell proliferation play an important role in develop- ment, differentiation, homeostasis, and aging.4–8 The balance estab- lished between these two processes depends on various growth and death signals that are influenced by diet, nutrition, lifestyle, and other environmental factors. When the equilibrium between life and death is disrupted by aberrant signals (e.g., low levels of antioxidants in the blood or tissue cells), either tissue growth or atrophy occurs. Under normal conditions with optimal nutritional factors, tissue homeostasis is sustained by balancing the effects of mitosis and apop- tosis. The importance of this balance can clearly be seen when one of these processes becomes predominant (Fig. 8.5). The apoptotic poten- tial within each cell is critical for the health of the host. Apoptosis is

an elegant response to oxidative stress. This seemingly heroic sacri- fice of self for the greater good underpins healthy living. Imbalance of apoptosis regulators, genetic mutations, and viral infections thwarts the healing effect of apoptosis. Finding ways to restore apoptotic and redox balance is critical to health.

luminal contents all the way from the stomach to the terminal ileum over a period of 113 to 230 minutes, depending on the individual.32 The MMC has been referred to as the “intestinal housekeeper.” Its influence on motility is independent of the peristalsis that occurs in the large intestine. For instance, whereas colonic peristalsis is stimulated by eating a meal, the MMC is only active in the fasting state. The MMC consists of four phases. Phase I, which takes place in the stomach, is devoid of contractions. Phase II is composed of low- amplitude, irregular contractions that progress from the stomach to the small intestine. Phase III, initiating in either the stomach or the small intestine, is the most active phase of the MMC; contractions are of high amplitude and travel the length of the small bowel, serving to cleanse it of food from a recent meal. Phase IV represents a brief tran- sition period back to phase I.31,32 MMC dysfunction has been demon- strated in many individuals with SIBO, especially in Phase III.33 For SIBO to produce clinical consequences, an adequate concen- tration of organisms with particular metabolic properties within spe- cific locations of the small intestine is required. For example, a heavy concentration of strict anaerobes and coliforms in the proximal small intestine is more likely to be associated with malabsorption than a flora consisting of fewer strict anaerobes or coliforms or when strict anaerobes or coliforms are confined to the distal small intestine.24 For this reason, SIBO may be asymptomatic in some individuals yet produce signs and symptoms in others. Box 9.2 outlines clinical signs and symptoms that should alert the practitioner to consider testing for SIBO.

## Signs and Symptoms

The classic SIBO syndrome is characterized by megaloblastic anemia resulting from vitamin B 12 deficiency and weight loss and diarrhea sec- ondary to fat malabsorption.24 However, many patients present with nonspecific symptoms 1 to 2 hours after a meal, including bloating, flatulence, and abdominal pain resulting from bacterial fermentation of intraluminal sugars and associated gas production, and constipation- predominant SIBO is also possible (Box 9.3).15,26 Via secretory and osmotic processes, diarrhea may occur even in the absence of significant steatorrhea. Unabsorbed fats and bile salts are modified by bacteria in the colon to hydroxylated fats and free bile acids, respectively, which stimulate colonic secretion of water and electrolytes.24 Bile salts, essential to fat emulsification and assimilation, must be conjugated with taurine or glycine to function properly. In SIBO, bacteria in the proximal small intestine can deconjugate bile salts to form free bile acids.24 This can have two major clinical repercussions: (1) free bile acids can promote mucosal damage (Fig. 9.1), result- ing in reduced brush-border enzyme activities (especially lactase),34 defects in mucosal uptake of sugars and amino acids, enteric blood loss, and protein-losing enteropathy; or (2) the conjugated bile salt

concentration may fall below the concentration necessary for effective micelle formation, resulting in fat malabsorption, steatorrhea,24,25 and deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins.2 Fat malabsorption in SIBO can also result from mechanical inter- ference, specifically the formation of a pseudomembrane, thought to represent a maladaptive defense mechanism against the bacterial overgrowth.35 Unabsorbed fatty acids can form insoluble soaps with calcium and magnesium, rendering them unavailable.2 Osteomalacia, night blind- ness, hypocalcemic tetany,19 or metabolic bone disease4 may develop as a consequence of lipid malabsorption in patients with SIBO. Although rare, iron-deficiency anemia may result from blood loss2 or possibly from an inflammation-induced upregulation of hepcidin, the body’s main iron-regulating hormone.36 SIBO may also lead to vitamin B 12 deficiency, with megaloblastic anemia and low serum cobalamin lev- els.19,24 Although intrinsic factor is not altered by anaerobic bacteria, microbes are capable of detaching vitamin B 12 from the intrinsic fac- tor, as well as directly using B 12 .30 Either mechanism can make the vitamin unavailable. Paradoxically, serum folate values are usually normal or even elevated in SIBO, a result of the bacterial synthesis of the vitamin.37 Hypoproteinemia may also occur in SIBO, secondary to protein- losing enteropathy and protein malabsorption.2,25 In addition, bacteria may metabolize proteins to ammonia and fatty acids, thereby rendering them unavailable to the host.34 The composition of bacterial populations contaminating the small bowel is complex and variable.19 However, the diagnosis of SIBO tends to be oriented less to the identification of specific microorganisms and more to overall bacterial concentrations.19

# DIAGNOSIS

<!-- chunk -->

## Endoscopy

Culture of a small bowel aspirate (typically jejunal or duodenal) via endoscopy is a direct method for diagnosing SIBO; abnormally high bacterial counts confirm the diagnosis.25 Although this technique has been considered the gold standard for diagnosing SIBO, intubation methods are invasive, time-consuming, uncomfortable, and expensive. It also has several shortcomings: (1) because the aspirate is typically taken from only one location, SIBO in the more distal end of the small bowel or concentrated in a large diverticulum or blind loop may be missed38; (2) false positives can result from bacterial contamination from the mouth or esophagus39; and (3) the traditional threshold of >105 cfu/mL is not well validated and may only be appropriate for patients with blind loop syndrome as a result of past surgeries (e.g., Billroth II procedure). It is now generally agreed that a lower cutoff of 103 cfu/mL is sufficient for a diagnosis of SIBO.40,41

## Breath Testing

Breath tests were devised as less invasive alternatives to intubation and culture, offering greater patient comfort and convenience. They also offer good sensitivity42: a meta-analysis of 12 studies found that lactu- lose and glucose hydrogen breath testing identified SIBO in 54% and 31% of patients with IBS, respectively, compared with only 4% of the patients via jejunal aspirate and culture.43 Breath tests are based on the ability of intestinal microbes to fer- ment carbohydrates, producing H 2 or CH 4 in the process. A fraction of these gases naturally diffuses from the bowel to the circulation and is excreted with expired air. Because there is no other metabolic source of H 2 and CH 4 , pulmonary excretion of these gases is used as a measure of bacterial fermentation during the passage through the bowel.44 Breath tests for SIBO commonly employ either lactulose or glucose, a prescribed dose of which is ingested following 1 to days of dietary fiber restriction and a 12-hour fast.45 In all cases, intestinal bacteria modify the challenge substance, producing an early peak in breath gas values in patients with SIBO. Lactulose is a synthetic, nonabsorbed disaccharide that offers the advantage of traveling the full length of the small intestine. An early H 2 (and/ or CH 4 ) peak is typically followed by a prolonged gas peak repre- senting colonic bacterial activity (approximately 90 minutes into the collection process).42,46 Glucose, an absorbable monosaccha- ride, is not suitable for patients with blood sugar disorders such as diabetes, and its rapid absorption reduces the test’s sensitivity in the distal ileum.42 However, its superior diagnostic accuracy in some studies has led to a growing consensus in favor of glucose over lactulose.47 Differences in methodology between studies may have contributed to the wide range of sensitivities and specificities for lactulose versus glucose (e.g., 31% to 68% and 44% to 100%, respectively, for lactulose; vs. 20% to 93% and 30% to 86%, respec- tively, for glucose).41 During a breath test, breath specimens are collected by exhal- ing into a special mouthpiece connected to a vacuum-sealed col- lection tube. A fasting (prechallenge) breath specimen is collected, a specified amount of lactulose or glucose is ingested, and then nine more breath specimens are typically collected at timed inter- vals every 15 to 20 minutes. Breath levels of H 2 and CH 4 are plot- ted over time, with earlier rises in breath gas values corresponding to more proximal portions of the small intestine. CO 2 is also mea- sured because insufficient amounts of CO 2 will invalidate results for H 2 and CH 4 .

## Hydrogen Versus Methane Versus Hydrogen Sulfide

Many studies using carbohydrate challenges have measured only breath H 2 . However, 30% to 50% of H 2 producers also produce CH 4 ,48 most likely a result of “methanogenic” bacteria, which consume H 2 , producing CH 4 in the process.45 Individuals whose intestines harbor methanogenic bacteria typically produce greater amounts of breath CH 4 during the test, thus being potentially missed on a test measuring only H 2 .49 Because of the lack of consis- tency and standardization across studies, clinics, and practitioners, a North American group of clinician scientists met for discussion in May 2015.40 Consensus was reached that CH 4 should be measured along with H 2 , especially in cases of constipation or slow transit time. Some individuals with SIBO also appear to produce hydrogen sul- fide (H 2 S), a result of intestinal sulfate-reducing bacteria utilizing H 2 equivalents such as acetate and formate. H 2 S is not apparent on the standard breath test measuring H 2 and CH 4 , and in such a case, the breath gases values may form a flat line. Currently available gas chro- matography equipment cannot detect H 2 S. However, a preliminary study examining breath H 2 S offers promise in diagnosing H 2 -negative individuals with SIBO.50 Clinical correlations have been noted between various disorders and the production of H 2 versus CH 4 . In one study, individuals pro- ducing higher amounts of H 2 relative to CH 4 reported significantly increased bloating and cramping after carbohydrate ingestion, whereas individuals producing high CH 4 reported no significant increase in these symptoms.51 Specific IBS symptoms also vary with breath gas values. For example, CH 4 production has been associated more with constipation-predominant IBS, whereas H 2 production tends to be more associated with diarrhea.52 SIBO, in general, appears to be more common in diarrhea-predominant IBS than in constipation-predom- inant IBS.43

## Interpretation of Breath Testing

Lactulose is normally not fermented until it reaches the bacteria-rich colon. As a result, the typical fasting breath sample contains less than 20 ppm of H 2 or CH 4 . An increase in breath gas levels in the later breath specimens (90 and 120 minutes) usually reflects colonic bacterial fer- mentation and is considered normal. Lack of the expected colonic peak can result from antibiotics or an acidic colonic pH.53,54 In patients with SIBO, the lactulose is typically fermented in the small intestine, result- ing in an early peak in breath gas values.42 According to the consensus meeting for SIBO in May 2015, a posi- tive test result (indicating SIBO) is defined by a rise in H 2 of ≥ 20 ppm above baseline (or a rise in CH 4 of ≥ 10 ppm above baseline), occur- ring less than 90 minutes after lactulose or glucose ingestion.40 A dou- ble-peak is not considered necessary for diagnosis. Elevated baseline values occur in up to one-third of patients with SIBO53 and have been proposed to relate to the fermentation of endogenous brush-border glycoproteins,55 although future studies are needed to confirm the clinical significance of this finding.40 Various factors may interfere with the breath test, resulting in false-negative or false-positive results. Detailed instructions for breath collection help minimize this interference.

## False-positive results. The following factors may account for a

false-positive result on a breath test: • Failure to fast for at least 12 hours before the test or to avoid dietary fiber the day before collection can result in excessive “background noise” that contributes to the overall concentration of breath gases.29 • Sleeping, smoking, or eating shortly before or during sample collec- tion can increase concentrations of breath gases.56 • Fermentation by oropharyngeal flora can lead to early, transient elevations in breath gases after carbohydrate ingestion.57 As a result, it is recommended that teeth and tongue brushing be per- formed before specimen collection.

<!-- chunk -->

## False-negative results. False-positive results on a breath test can

be caused by the following factors: • Diarrhea or the recent administration of antimicrobials can tem- porarily reduce the concentration of gut bacteria,58 thus obscur- ing SIBO. Laxatives and enemas pose a similar risk.59 Patients are advised to wait at least 1 week after antibiotic therapy before per- forming the test. • SIBO confined to the distal ileum may go undetected if the breath gas peak produced in the ileum merges with the breath gases pro- duced by the colonic flora.42 • Rapid intestinal transit may cause delayed increases in breath gases, leading to a rise only after the lactulose has already reached the cecum.60 This is particularly relevant for patients with SIBO who have undergone small bowel resection.

# TREATMENT OF SIBO

For a successful clinical outcome, the treatment of SIBO should not only eradicate the bacterial overgrowth but also address symptoms, underlying causes, and complications of SIBO, such as nutrient defi- ciencies. Although relapses are common, identifying and treating the individual root causes of SIBO can greatly minimize this potential.

## Bacterial Eradication

Most patients with clinically significant SIBO host an intestinal flora consisting largely of anaerobes; however, some patients harbor a pre- dominance of gram-negative aerobes, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas.61 As a result, the most effective antimicrobial agents are those that target both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.19

<!-- chunk -->

## Antibiotics

According to a meta-analysis of 10 studies using different antibiot- ics to treat SIBO, antibiotics were superior to placebo in normalizing H 2 breath tests (51% efficacy for antibiotics compared with 9.8% for placebo).62 Historically, the first-line antibiotic for SIBO has been tet- racycline (250 mg four times daily for 7 days).19 However, the high prevalence of bacterial resistance to this drug (up to 60% of patients with SIBO)19 has led to the use of alternative antibiotics. Common alternatives include metronidazole, clindamycin, neomycin, and rifax- imin; amoxicillin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cip- rofloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole have been used less frequently.41 The duration of treatment has varied in studies as much as the choice of antibiotic, ranging from 5 days to 1 month. The minimally absorbed and broad-spectrum antibiotic rifaxi- min is increasingly recognized for its effectiveness and minimum of side effects.63 Rifaximin has been widely studied for its use in func- tional bowel disorders, including SIBO, and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2015 for diarrhea-predom- inant IBS. In one study, a 7-day course of rifaximin at 400 mg three times daily normalized breath H 2 excretion in 70% of patients with SIBO, whereas tetracycline normalized H 2 excretion in only 27% of patients.64 In a larger 7-day study, rifaximin at 400 mg three times daily normalized H 2 excretion in 63.4% of patients with SIBO, compared with 43.7% of patients with SIBO taking metronidazole.65 Longer treatment durations of 10 to 14 days are common.63 In cases of excess CH 4 production, the addition of neomycin (e.g., 500 mg twice daily) to rifaximin, ideally for 14 days, has been found to be more effective than rifaximin alone.66,67 This is because Methanobrevibacter smithii, the bacterium considered most respon- sible for CH 4 production in the gut, is commonly resistant to many antibiotics. A poor response to antibiotics may indicate mucosal disease, anti- biotic resistance, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, or an incorrect diag- nosis.30,68 Recurrence of symptoms after treatment suggests the need for follow-up testing and possible retreatment, as well as a closer examination of underlying causes. Older age, history of surgery such as appendectomy, and chronic use of proton-pump inhibitors increase the likelihood of recurrence.69 Because prolonged antibiotic therapy significantly raises the risk of diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection, and bacterial resistance,19 the administration of probiotics is often advised to minimize such side effects.29 Certain probiotics may also reduce breath H 2 in some patients with SIBO.70 However, this is an area of ongoing research in SIBO because probiotics have also been observed to exacerbate symptoms in patients.71

## Herbal Antibiotics

Because conventional antibiotics have shown variable success in erad- icating SIBO and can come with side effects (most) or a high price tag (rifaximin), interest has been steadily growing in the use of various botanical agents with antimicrobial activity. Small intestinal fungal overgrowth (SIFO) is also present in some patients with SIBO; thus herbal agents may offer the additional advantage of antifungal activ- ity. Anecdotally, some of the more common antimicrobial and/or antifungal herbs used for SIBO include berberine sulfate or berberine- containing herbs, for example, goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), bar- berry (Berberis vulgaris), or goldthread (Coptis chinensis); oregano (Origanum vulgare); allicin (stabilized garlic extract); and neem (Azadirachta indica). In the first formal study examining the efficacy of herbal agents in patients with confirmed SIBO, over a 4-week period, patients received rifaximin and 37 patients received various herbal

combinations (totaling 27 herbs) known to have antibacterial and/or antifungal properties.72 At follow-up, 46% of the patients in the herbal therapy group had negative lactulose breath tests, compared with 34% of the patients in the rifaximin group.

## Antibiotic Alternatives

Peppermint oil, which has been used successfully in patients with IBS, is a volatile oil with antimicrobial properties.73 Although enteric- coated peppermint oil (dose of 0.2 mL three times a day) dramatically reduced gastrointestinal symptoms and reduced breath H 2 in a patient with SIBO,74 further research is needed before drawing conclusions about its effectiveness in SIBO.

## Addressing the Underlying Causes

Bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine may easily recur if the root causes are not addressed.

<!-- chunk -->

## Restoration of Gastric Acidity

Because gastric acidity is a critical deterrent to SIBO, restoration of normal stomach pH in patients with hypochlorhydria or achlorhy- dria is essential. This may include the use of betaine hydrochloride with meals or the discontinuation of antacid medications. A meta-analysis of 19 studies concluded that the use of proton-pump inhibitors moderately increases the risk of SIBO.75

## Normalization of Intestinal Motility

As mentioned, intestinal stasis is a major contributing factor to SIBO. When not a result of anatomical or organic causes, reduced motility may be improved with measures such as increased dietary fiber (espe- cially partially hydrolyzed guar gum, which may be safer in SIBO than other forms of fiber76 and even enhance the effect of rifaximin77), water, probiotics, stress management, and exercise. As stated, impairments in the migrating motor complex (MMC) have been noted in patients with SIBO. The MMC is influenced by both gastrointestinal hormones and the central nervous system. The most active phase of the MMC, Phase III, is induced by serotonin, motilin, and ghrelin. Accordingly, low doses of promotility agents such as sero- tonin agonists (e.g., tegaserod, prucalopride, or cisapride) and motilin receptor agonists (e.g., azithromycin or erythromycin) are increasingly included in a comprehensive approach to SIBO patients, aimed at preventing relapse71; low-dose naltrexone, an opioid antagonist that interacts with the immune system, is also sometimes employed.78 This is an area of continuing research. In one such study of patients suc- cessfully treated for SIBO, tegaserod was shown to dramatically extend symptom-free days posttreatment, and both tegaserod and erythromy- cin were superior to no prevention at all.79 Abdominal/pelvic adhesions (e.g., from prior surgeries) can some- times restrict motility in the gastrointestinal tract. Anecdotally, such adhesions may be amenable to visceral manipulation.

## Dietary Support

An elemental formula supplies daily nutrition in an easy-to-assimilate form and does not contain carbohydrate residues that can feed bacte- ria. In a study of 124 patients with IBS with SIBO, an elemental diet was found to normalize lactulose breath tests in 80% of patients after 14 days, a statistic not observed with antibiotics; another five patients achieved a negative breath test after following the diet for an additional 6 days, raising the overall success rate to 85%.80 The precise mecha- nisms behind the success of an elemental diet are still unclear, although they are postulated to include nutrient deprivation of enteric microbes, stimulation of Phase III of the MMC, and/or stimulation of intestinal immunity.80 Diet is increasingly recognized as a critical factor determining success in the treatment of SIBO. Because bacteria thrive on enteric carbohydrates, restricting dietary fermentable oligosaccharides, disac- charides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) can theoreti- cally help reduce symptoms and reduce bacterial counts. A systematic review found that a low-FODMAP diet ameliorated IBS symptoms in all FODMAP studies examined.81 Adequate spacing of meals (e.g., at least 4–5 hours apart) is another important therapeutic consideration, based on the fact that the MMC is only active in the fasting state. Patients with SIBO may become lactose intolerant as a result of disaccharidase deficiency. This is often ameliorated with bacterial eradication82; however, temporary avoidance of all disaccharides—the premise of the “specific carbohydrate diet”—can also help “starve” the excess bacteria and allow healing of the intestinal lining.83 Substituting more easily absorbed medium-chain triglycerides for most dietary fat may be helpful in patients with diarrhea and steatorrhea.19 Further research is needed into the role of diet in the treatment and especially the maintenance of remission in SIBO. In the meantime, practitioners continue to experiment and refine various approaches.

## 119CHAPTER 10 Cell-Signaling Analysis

produces the necessary proteins that play a major role in cytokinesis. After a highly variable amount of time, the cell enters mitosis (M). DNA content remains constant at 4C until the cell actually divides at the end of telophase. The enlarged parent cell finally reaches the point where it divides in half to produce its two daughters, each of which is endowed with a complete set of chromosomes. The new daughter cells immediately enter G 1 and may go through the full cycle again. Alternatively, they may stop cycling temporarily or permanently.2–4 Telomeres, con- densed chromatin caps on the ends of chromosomes, dictate the ulti- mate number of cell divisions that can occur. With each cell division, the telomeres shorten, ultimately to the point that destabilizes the chromosomes sufficiently enough to disallow further mitosis. Thus telomeres are considered to be the “mitotic clock.” Telomere short- ening is linked to aging, sedentarism, chronic stress, and age-related diseases, including cancer, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. Cell-proliferation capacity, the cellular environment, and epigenetic factors affect telomere length and therefore cells’ mitotic capacity. Telomere length can be assessed, and a clinical test is available. The telomere length is reported as a telomere score, which is a calculation of the telomere length derived from nucleated white blood cells. This result is then compared with the average telomere length of a similarly aged sample population. Although the transferability of this information to other bodily tissues is not well characterized, telomere length mea- sured in this way has been correlated to clinical outcomes such as cancer incidence and mortality from cancer.5 This information can be used to prioritize interventions that increase telomere length, such as dietary interventions, stress reduction, and antioxidant and vitamin therapies.6 Another influence on the cell-cycle clock is circadian rhythms, or the circadian clock. The circadian clock is the result of molecular clocks in each cell, circadian physiology, and, ultimately, the suprachiasmatic nuclei in the hypothalamus. The circadian clock regulates the activ- ity and expression of proteins related to cell-cycle checkpoints, and in turn these checkpoints regulate circadian-clock proteins. Every cell in the body has circadian-clock proteins, so-called peripheral oscillators, which exert rhythmic control of mitochondrial morphology, energy metabolism, and cell division.7 This has significant clinical implica- tions, particularly in the area of cancer treatment. Both the toxicity and efficacy of cytotoxic agents can vary by more than 50% as a function of when they are dosed in experimental models.8 Although the clinical implications of this have not yet been discovered, the administration of cytotoxic agents in accordance with the circadian-induced activity of the target cells is gaining ground as a reasonable therapeutic approach.

# FLOW CYTOMETRY TO ASSESS CELL-CYCLE

# STATUS

Flow cytometry identifies cells as they “flow” through a detector while being illuminated with intense light. Tissues are generally disaggregated into single-cell suspensions and stained with one or more fluorescent dyes. The cells are forced to flow within a sheath of fluid, eventually being intersected and interrogated by an intense light source, such as a laser beam. As the cell enters the laser beam, it scatters light in all directions. The measurement of light scattered in the forward direc- tion yields information on the particle’s size. Scattered light at right angles to the incident light beam provides information on the internal granularity of the cell. If the cell has been stained with one or more fluorescent dyes, a correlated measurement of more than one cellular parameter can be achieved. The cell cycle is challenging to study because almost any method can cause perturbations to the activity under study. Newer methods to study the cell cycle allow the ability to assess the cell cycle in living cells. One such method involves labeling the subpopulations of living cells in each phase of the cell cycle with fluorescent proteins. Then, using imaging, one can track and quantify cells in specific phases of the cell cycle using these live cell sensors. This method avoids perturbations to the cell cycle from the test and also allows for the assessment of exter- nal influences on the cell cycle.9

## Patients With Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

To determine whether peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) isolated from individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and chemically exposed patients represent a discrete block in cell-cycle progression, PBLs isolated from patients with CFS and control individuals were cultured, harvested, fixed, stained with propidium iodide, and ana- lyzed by flow cytometry. The nonapoptotic cell population in PBLs isolated from individuals with CFS consisted of cells arrested in the late S and G 2 /M boundaries compared with healthy controls. The arrest was characterized by increased S and G 2 /M phases of the cell cycle (from 9%–33% and from 4%–21%, respectively) (Table 10.1 and Fig. 10.2) at the expense of G 0 /G 1 . Such an abnormality in cell-cycle progression indicates abnormal mitotic cell division in patients who have been exposed to chemicals and who have CFS. From these results,

it was concluded that the PBLs of patients with chemical exposure and CFS grow inappropriately, not only because the signaling pathways in the cells are perturbed but also because the cell-cycle clock becomes deranged and stimulatory messages become greater than the inhibitory pathways.10,11 However, to limit cell proliferation and avoid cancer, the human body equips cells with certain backup systems that guard against runaway division. One such backup system present in the lym- phocytes of patients with CFS provokes the cell to undergo apopto- sis. This programmed cell death occurs if some of the cell’s essential components are deregulated or damaged. For example, injury to chro- mosomal DNA can trigger apoptosis.1,10,11

## Westergren Method

In the standard Westergren method, the following procedure is used: 1. Dilute venous blood 4:1 with anticoagulant sodium citrate. 2. Put in a 200-mm-long, 2.5-mm-internal-diameter glass tube (Westergren tube). 3. Allow it to stand in a vertical position for 1 hour. 4. At the end of 1 hour, the distance from the meniscus to the top of the column of erythrocytes is recorded as the ESR. The modified Westergren method uses ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid rather than sodium citrate as an anticoagulant and is more conve- nient because the same tube of blood can be used for other hematologic studies. The standard and modified methods give identical results.1–4

<!-- chunk -->

## Wintrobe Method

The second most commonly used method is the Wintrobe method. This method is performed with a 100-mm tube (Wintrobe tube) containing oxalate as the anticoagulant. It is more sensitive than the Westergren method in the “normal” to “mildly elevated” range; how- ever, in the more highly elevated ESR, the short tube leads to relatively insensitive readings resulting from packing of cells.2

<!-- chunk -->

## Results

The results of both the Westergren and Wintrobe methods are listed in Box 11.1.


Several factors may result in false-positive or false-negative ESR values; the more significant of these are listed in Box 11.2. In addition, it is important to recognize that in acute disease, the change in sedimen- tation rate may lag behind the temperature elevation and leukocytosis for 6 to 24 hours, and in unruptured acute appendicitis, the rate may be normal. In convalescence, the increased rate tends to persist longer than the fever or leukocytosis. Box 11.3 lists the most common clinical implications of changes in the ESR. An ESR value exceeding 100 mm/h has a 90% predictive value for serious underlying disease—most often infection, collagen vascular disease, or metastatic tumor.1

## Elevated Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate

<!-- chunk -->

## Asymptomatic Patients

The presence of an elevated ESR as the only manifestation of a disease process is quite rare. However, when present, it can be highly signif- icant. For example, in one study of 17 patients whose increased ESR was the sole initial clue to disease, two had tuberculosis, one had colon cancer, one had systemic lupus erythematosus, three had ankylosing spondylitis (diagnoses that typically become apparent only after several years of observation), and four men had a persistently elevated ESR several years before a myocardial infarction. The remaining patients developed myeloma, prostate cancer, psoriasis, benign monoclonal gammopathy, and pancreatic cancer.2 Although the ESR generally makes a small contribution to disease detection in asymptomatic persons, the presence of an elevated ESR as the only clue to illness in an asymptomatic person indicates the need for a careful diagnostic workup; it may be the first sign of an occult malignancy or a chronic inflammatory disease. The laboratory evaluation for an asymptomatic patient with an elevated ESR should include a complete blood cell count with differentials, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, alkaline phosphatase measurement, serum protein electrophoresis, urinalysis, guaiac tests of stool, and chest radiograph.2 An ESR that exceeds 100 mm/h is definitely associated with infec- tion, malignancy, or connective tissue disease. Rarely does disease remain undiagnosed when the ESR is greatly elevated.1–4 If an elevated ESR cannot be explained after further clinical evaluation, the ESR should be repeated in 1 month.

## As a Predictor of Coronary Artery Disease

An elevated ESR in white men aged 45 to 64 years was found to be an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-I.5 The risk was highest when the ESR was greater than 22 mm/h. Subsequent studies and the growing awareness that atherosclerosis is associated with chronic inflammation has given support to the use of the ESR as a prognostic indicator for the risk of coronary artery disease.6,8 It was hypothesized and later shown that an elevated ESR reflected an elevated blood fibrin- ogen level (see Chapter 148 for further discussion of fibrinogen). The association of an elevated ESR as a harbinger of coronary artery dis- ease precedes an elevated CRP and can be viewed as an easy-to-use and inexpensive method that indirectly indicates fibrinogen level and aids in the early detection of microinflammation and eventual atheroscle- rotic burden, even in apparently healthy people.9,10

<!-- chunk -->

## Symptomatic Patients

The ESR is sometimes used to provide confirmation of a disease pro- cess when the history and physical findings point toward a specific diagnosis. Although the ESR itself does not diagnose a specific disease, when combined with information gathered in a history and physical, and in conjunction with other laboratory tests, it can be a great help in the formation of a specific diagnosis. In patients with vague, unsubstantiated illness, the ESR offers limited benefit because of the lack of specificity and the presence of a normal ESR in a wide variety of illnesses. However, the ESR offers great diagnostic benefit when other signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings are present. This is particularly true in malignancies, tempo- ral arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica, inflammatory arthritis, and suspected infection.

<!-- chunk -->

## Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate in Cancer

Malignancy is quite common in symptomatic patients with an elevated ESR. In one study, 70 (8.8%) of 790 clinic patients with an elevated ESR had cancer.1 However, of the 70 patients with malignancy and an increased ESR, 68 had local signs that led directly to the diagnosis. Thus occult malignancy was present in only 2 of the 790 patients. In addition, the ESR is often normal in patients with cancer, indicating that the ESR should not be relied on as a test to exclude occult malig- nancy in patients with vague symptoms. In a prospective follow-up of 300 patients with prostate cancer, an ESR greater than 37 mm/h was associated with a higher incidence of disease progression and death. These findings paralleled other prog- nostic indicators (e.g., tumor, node, and metastasis staging; grade; performance status; and age) but also indicated that ESR provided additional value in the monitoring of these patients and presumably others with invasive cancer.3

## Temporal Arteritis and Polymyalgia Rheumatica

Temporal arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica are related syndromes that can occur together or alone. Both occur in older individuals and are associated with an increased ESR. Symptoms of temporal arteritis include unilateral throbbing headache, scalp sensitivity, visual symp- toms, jaw claudication, and localized thickening or loss of pulsation of the temporal artery. Polymyalgia rheumatica is a fast-developing con- dition characterized by pain and stiffness of the pelvis and/or shoulder girdle, in association with fever, anemia, malaise, and weight loss. It is typically self-limited to 1 to 2 years. Determination of the ESR is of critical importance in the diagno- sis and management of patients with temporal arteritis, a condition that can result in blindness caused by obstruction of the ophthalmic arteries. When the clinical evidence for temporal arteritis is limited, a normal ESR reduces the probability of the disease to less than 1%. When the clinical evidence is strong, it is extremely rare to have a nor- mal ESR. Achievement of a normal ESR by using anti-inflammatory agents, such as cortisone or the natural medicines (e.g., Curcuma longa, fish oils, Ginkgo biloba), greatly reduces the risk of developing blindness.1,2

<!-- chunk -->

## Inflammatory Arthritis

The ESR is sometimes used to distinguish inflammatory arthritis from other causes of joint symptoms. This is particularly true in the differ- entiation of RA, which has an elevated ESR, and osteoarthritis, which typically has a normal ESR. Because ESR is not a specific indicator of RA, it is not appropriate to place much value on it as an independent diagnostic predictor of RA. An elevated ESR in patients with joint symptoms simply indicates an active inflammatory process.1,2

<!-- chunk -->

## Suspected Infection

Leukocytosis and fever are better indicators of an acute infectious pro- cess than the ESR because the ESR is typically normal during the first stages of infection. However, the ESR is of some value in the differenti- ation of an intact versus ruptured appendix. Researchers demonstrated that only 2 of 25 patients with nonruptured appendicitis had an ESR of greater than 20 mm/h. In contrast, 67% of patients with ruptured appendixes had an elevated ESR.1 CRP, however, has emerged as a more accurate measure. The value of CRP for the surgical indication of appendicitis is 4.95 mg/dL.11 CRP has also been shown to correlate better with joint sepsis than ESR.11

<!-- chunk -->

## Decreased Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate

The causes of a low ESR (0–1 mm/h) are listed in Boxes 13.2 and 13.3. A low ESR is generally of little significance and may actually indicate a healthy state.1–4

<!-- chunk -->

## Monitoring of Disease Activity

The ESR is well recognized as an aid in monitoring the activity of such inflammatory diseases as temporal arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica,

<!-- chunk -->

## 124SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

and RA.1–3 In general, improvements in ESR levels generally reflect clinical improvement, and vice versa.

<!-- chunk -->

## Temporal Arteritis and Polymyalgia Rheumatica

The ESR is the most widely used test for assessing disease activity in patients with temporal arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica because these conditions have few specific clinical indicators of disease activity. However, both the ESR and clinical status need to be monitored in these patients, and appropriate therapy instituted, if the ESR increases or if there is a worsening in the clinical picture.1,2,12

<!-- chunk -->

## Rheumatoid Arthritis

Although 5% to 10% of patients with RA have a normal ESR, the ESR generally parallels disease activity. Monitoring the patient’s ESR there- fore provides invaluable feedback on therapeutic effect. An isolated elevated ESR is not useful for prognosis, but sustained extreme eleva- tion of the ESR is associated with a poor prognosis.1–3 It is important to note that in a meta-analysis of 63 clinical trials or observational studies of RA treatment, the authors concluded that ESR was more sensitive to change than CRP and was the preferred measure of the acute-phase response in RA in clinical practice.13

<!-- chunk -->

## Other Inflammatory Diseases

Other inflammatory diseases, particularly autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, can be monitored by the ESR in a fashion similar to that for RA.1-3


The ESR is a simple, valuable, and useful laboratory procedure. Although it is a nonspecific indicator of inflammation, an elevated ESR (i.e., greater than 80 mm/h) indicates the presence of significant disease in more than 95% of individuals. The ESR should never be used as the sole diagnostic test. Clinical presentation, comprehensive history, lab- oratory investigation, and other diagnostic procedures should always be considered when interpreting ESR results. The ESR may be used as a nonspecific gauge of therapeutic efficacy and as a monitoring tool in several inflammatory conditions, including temporal arteritis, poly- myalgia rheumatica, RA, certain malignancies, and atherosclerosis.

angiotensin elevation was found to adversely affect the myocardium in humans, even when blood pressure remained within normal limits.28 It has been observed that the adverse effects of excess salt can persist for an extended time after excess salt ingestion has been discontinued.29,30 Identifying people who at risk for the harmful effects of excessive salt consumption is an important aspect of preventive medicine. Included in this group are individuals with chronic renal disease, osteoporo- sis, hypertension or a family history of hypertension, and individuals over the age of 50.31 The Fantus test is also useful in monitoring salt intake in clinical conditions where restricted sodium chloride intake can be an aggra- vating factor or a trigger for serious symptoms, such as in Addison dis- ease, postural hypotension, chronic fatigue syndrome,32 and electrolyte imbalance (see Table 12.1).

# PROCEDURE

The Fantus reagent is prepared so that the number of drops of silver nitrate (AgNO 3 ) used in the titration step can be recorded as grams of sodium per liter of urine (g Na/L urine).

<!-- chunk -->

## Method

1. Collect a 24-hour urine sample. 2. Measure and record the 24-hour volume. 3. In a test tube, add one drop of 20% potassium chromate (K 2 CrO 4 ) solution to 10 drops of the sample of the 24-hour urine specimen. 4. Titrate (add one drop at a time) with the 2.9% silver nitrate (AgNO 3 ) solution. 5. Record the number of drops needed for the color to turn from yel- low to brown as g sodium/L.

<!-- chunk -->

## Required Reagents

• AgNO3: 2.9% aqueous solution • K2CrO4: 20% aqueous solution

<!-- chunk -->

## Results

Fantus test results are measured as NaCl but can be converted to Na (NaCl × 0.39 = Na). • Typical Western diet: >3000 mg Na/24 h • Salt-restricted diet: 2300 mg Na/24 h (or less)


The results of a Fantus test generally reflect the salt content of the diet. The typical Western diet contains 3.4 g of sodium in a 24-hour period. On a salt-restricted diet, the goal is typically to reduce 24-hour urine sodium to 2.3 g Na/24 h or less. The minimum 24-hour sodium intake considered safe is 0.5 g Na/24 h for healthy individuals with intact adrenocortical function. Some conditions require higher sodium chlo- ride intake (see Table 12.1). A random urine can be tested for urine sodium with the Fantus test and can give an approximation of 24-hour sodium ingestion. A sodium intake of 3.4 g Na/day with an intake of 2750 mL of water from both solids and fluids corresponds to the average water turnover for a 70-kg adult. After evaporation from the lungs and other losses, the amount of water excreted by the kidneys is approximately 1500 mL/24 h.33 A urinary sodium excretion of 3 g in 24 hours would thus produce a uri- nary sodium concentration of 2 g/L and a urinary sodium chloride con- centration of 5.1 g/L (NaCl). A 24-hour urine sample provides a more accurate estimate of 24-hour sodium intake (i.e., 24-hour urine volume × urinary sodium concentration approximates 24-hour sodium intake).

different positions within their carbon backbone. The double-bond position designates its name. The most common MUFA is oleic acid, which is found in olive oil. It has a double bond at the ninth carbon and is therefore an omega-9 fatty acid ( ω -9). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), found in foods such as salmon and sunflower seeds, contain more than one double bond. In PUFAs, the first double bond may be found between the third and fourth carbon atom from the ω ; these are called omega-3 fatty acids ( ω -3). If the first double bond is between the sixth and sev- enth carbon atoms, then they are called omega-6 fatty acids ( ω -6).15 It is important to note that some laboratories denote omega using the letter n. For example, omega-3 fatty acids may also be reported as n-3. If the hydrogen atoms on either side of the double bond are in the same configuration, it is termed a cis configuration. Most fatty acids are in the cis configuration. When the hydrogen atoms change configuration, they are considered trans. Trans isomers may be induced during industrial processing of unsaturated oil or found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of ruminant animals (cattle, sheep, goats, and deer). Trans fatty acids produced by industrial process- ing, such as partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, have been shown to cause endothelial dysfunction and may affect cardiovascular risk factors. Ruminant trans fats, as found in dairy products, may be beneficial.16,17 In fatty acid profiling, it is important to understand this nomencla- ture because the abbreviations can vary depending on the laboratory used. For example, stearic acid is a saturated fatty acid with 18 carbons and no double bonds (18:0), whereas oleic acid has 18 carbon bonds and one double bond in the n-9 position (18:1n9). Additionally, eicos- apentaenoic acid (EPA) has 20 carbons and multiple double bonds and is represented as 20:5n3. This numerical scheme is the system- atic nomenclature commonly used by clinical laboratories. It is also possible to describe fatty acid double bonds in relation to the carbon chain’s acidic end, symbolized as delta ( Δ ). Hence, EPA can also be represented as 20:5 Δ 5,8,11,14,17.

# MEASUREMENT

Monitoring a patient’s fatty acid status offers a way to target dietary therapeutics and alter disease progression. For this reason, usual or long-term dietary intake markers are important. Fatty acids can be measured as free fatty acids in serum, as erythrocyte membrane com- ponents, or in adipose tissue. Adipose tissue fatty acid measurement estimates fatty acid intake ranging from 6 months to 2 years.18 It is therefore the most ideal reflec- tion of dietary patterns. However, adipose tissue biopsy is not prac- tical. Plasma and erythrocyte assessments are more commonly used because of the ease of specimen collection. Because the life of a red blood cell averages 90 to 120 days, erythrocyte fatty acid assessment is more reflective of long-term status and is therefore preferred to plasma evaluation.18 For example, omega-3 plasma levels have been shown to be influenced by an acutely high fish oil dose or a short-term dietary increase.19 Fatty acid biomarkers are sometimes validated by examining the correlation with measured dietary fat intake. Saturated and mono- unsaturated fatty acid measurements may not always reflect dietary fat intake because these can be endogenously synthesized from carbohydrates.20 Erythrocyte fatty acids are reported as a percentage in the red blood cell (RBC) membrane. When dealing with RBC percentages, one must realize that each fatty acid has an effect on the other per- centages. For example, fish oil supplementation (n-3) may increase the overall n-3 percentage, which by default may lower the n-6 percentage. Plasma measurements are expressed as a percentage or absolute total lipid volume concentration. Again, the percentages are interde- pendent on the whole. After an omega-3 dose, the peak concentration can be observed at 6 hours, whereas the peak percentage can be seen at 24 hours. Plasma-based metrics can be sensitive to fasting status and acute intake. In general, RBC-based metrics are more stable over time.21

## Omega-3 (n-3) Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids

Omega-3 fatty acids are positively correlated with healthy aging throughout life and are essential for brain function and cardiovascular health. The average American diet is deficient in n-3 food sources such as oily fish, nuts, flax, and green leafy vegetables. Deficiencies in n-3 fatty acids can result in neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorders, visual changes, skin abnormalities, and heart disease.22–26 Many studies show that n-3 fatty acids have significantly positive effects on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular disease, depres- sion, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and cognitive decline. These health benefits are mediated through several different mech- anisms, including alterations in cell membrane composition and function, anti-inflammatory effects, gene expression, and eicosanoid production.27

<!-- chunk -->

## • Alpha-linoleic acid (ALA) is an essential n-3 fatty acid that must

be supplied from the diet. From ALA, other important n-3 fatty acids can be endogenously produced by enzymatic elongation and desaturation. ALA is the 18-carbon, 3-double-bond (18:3n3) pre- cursor to make eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), although these are also found in fish oils. ALA dietary sources include green leafy vegetables, walnuts, chia, hemp, and certain plant oils like flaxseed oil and unhydrogenated soybean oil. Several studies on high dietary intake of ALA and higher ALA blood levels show an association with lower fatal coronary artery disease risk.11 However, there are significant variations in genetics, nutrition, and toxin load that greatly affect an individual’s ability to make this multistep conversion.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is an omega-3 fatty acid with a

20-carbon chain and five cis-double bonds (20:5n3). It can be enzymatically converted from ALA; however, the efficiency of enzymatic conversion is much lower compared with the absorption from EPA-containing foods. EPA can be obtained by eating oily fish such as cod, mackerel, salmon, and sardines. It is also available in fish oil supplements. EPA acts as a precursor for prostaglandin-3 (which inhibits plate- let aggregation), thromboxane-3, and leukotriene-5 eicosanoids. EPA has beneficial effects on multiple atherosclerotic and inflammatory processes, including endothelial function, oxidative stress, foam cell formation, inflammatory cytokine production and release, plaque formation/progression, platelet aggregation, thrombus formation, and plaque rupture. EPA also reduces atherogenic dyslipidemia and has other beneficial effects arising from its inclusion in membrane phospholipids.28

<!-- chunk -->

## • Docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) is made by adding carbons to the

backbone of EPA using the enzyme delta-5 elongase. It is an inter- mediary product between EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and can retro-convert back to EPA. It is denoted as 22:5n3. Rela- tively little is known about the potentially distinct DPA health ben- efits. Although small amounts are found in seafood, it is more often synthesized from EPA.29

<!-- chunk -->

## • Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a DPA metabolite with 22 carbons

and six double bonds (22:6n3). DHA’s endogenous synthesis from its precursor is extremely low, so measured levels largely reflect H 3 C 18 H 3 C 18 H 3 C 18 H 3 C 18 H 3 C 18 H 3 C 20 H 3 C 20 H 3 C 22 methyl COOH 1 carboxyl COOH 1 COOH 1 COOH 1 COOH 1 COOH 1 COOH 1 COOH 1 9 9 9 9 581114 1417 1916131074 1185 12 1215 H H H H Stearic 18:0 cis-Oleic 9c-18:1 (18:1n–9) Linoleic (LA) 9c, 12c-18:2 (18:2n–6) Arachidonic (AA) 5c, 8c, 11c, 14c-20:4 (20:4n–6) Eicosapentaenoic (EPA) 5c, 8c, 11c, 14c, 17c-20:5 (20:5n–3) Docosahexaenoic (DHA) 4c, 7c, 10c, 13c, 16c, 19c-22:6 (22:6n–3) α-Linolenic (ALA) 9c, 12c, 15c-18:3 (18:3n–3) trans-Oleic 9t-18:1 Fig. 13.2 Common dietary fatty acids.

seafood consumption or fish oil supplementation. Fish oil supple- mentation is commonly a combination of purified EPA and DHA. Cardiovascular disease researchers have studied seafood consump- tion and fish oil supplementation for both disease prevention and treatment. Fish oil supplementation has been shown to improve serum lipid levels. It prevents cardiac dysrhythmias by increasing cardiac cell membrane fluidity and prevents inflammatory cytokines from binding to their receptors.27 In cardiovascular risk assessment, the Omega-3 Index has emerged as an important biomarker in stratifying patients for targeted thera- peutics. The Omega-3 Index is the sum of EPA + DHA percentages in RBCs. A target of >8% is optimal, whereas less than 4% denotes increased cardiovascular risk. Fish oil supplementation and dietary changes using fish, flax, chia, and walnuts are often used as therapeutic interventions. EPA and DHA are also important in fetal brain development. DHA levels positively correlate with the cognitive and retinal development of the fetus.27 Additionally, there is a role for n-3 in cancer prevention. Diets rich in n-3 (fish oil, flaxseed) and high n-3 erythrocyte concen- trations are inversely related to colorectal and breast cancer develop- ment, likely due to n-3’s anti-inflammatory properties.27

## Omega-6 (n-6) Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids

Omega-6 fatty acids play a vital role in many physiological functions. They are particularly important for maintaining bone health, regulat- ing metabolism, and stimulating hair and skin growth. In spite of this, n-6 fatty acids are controversial. The current standard American diet reflects a higher n-6 intake compared with n-3. Dietary sources include vegetable oils and animal fats. Many human evolutionary diets had a 1:1 dietary ratio of n-3:n-6. The fatty acid intake dietary shift toward n-6 sources associated with the cultivation of food and feeding corn to livestock has been impli- cated in recent increases in disease.30 The issues surrounding n-6 fatty acids include potentially proinflammatory effects, their increased sus- ceptibility to oxidation, and their competition with the n-3 fatty acids for the enzymatic elongation and desaturation pathways. Most of the concern regarding n-6 effects revolves around one of its downstream metabolites: arachidonic acid (AA). AA is the primary precursor in the inflammatory cascade. However, AA is not the only n-6 metabolite, and other n-6 fatty acids can be beneficial. For exam- ple, dihomo-gamma linoleic acid (DGLA) is a downstream n-6 fatty acid with many anti-inflammatory benefits. Additionally, linoleic acid has shown significant benefits for cardiovascular risks.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Linoleic acid (LA) is an essential n-6 and denoted as 18:2n6. It is

the predominant n-6 in the Western diet, obtained mainly from vegetable oils and nuts. Higher LA intake has been shown to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, promote insulin sensitivity, and reduce hypertension risk. There is a significant inverse rela- tionship between dietary LA intake and coronary artery disease when using LA to replace dietary carbohydrates and/or saturated fats.12

<!-- chunk -->

## • Gamma linolenic acid (GLA) is classified as 18:3n6. It can be pro-

duced from the essential LA using the enzyme delta-6 desaturase. This is a very slow enzymatic reaction that is further restricted by systemic inflammation, acute and chronic disease, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies such as zinc and cobalt deficiencies.31 How- ever, GLA can be supplemented using black currant, borage oil, and evening primrose. GLA levels are important because GLA is the direct precursor to produce dihomo-gamma linolenic acid (DGLA), which is a highly beneficial and anti-inflammatory n-6. GLA supplementation is rapidly metabolized to form DGLA and therefore is a common therapeutic intervention.32 However, GLA supplementation can also increase the downstream metabolite AA.8 Supplementing fish oils (EPA/DHA) along with GLA may mitigate this downstream AA conversion because of enzymatic competition for the delta-5-desaturase enzyme. Delta-5- desaturase is responsible for both AA production and EPA metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), 20:3n6, has no significant

dietary source (very small amounts can be found in some animal products) and is only metabolized from GLA. Research has con- firmed that the inability to convert precursor fatty acids to DGLA is associated with many conditions, including diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.33 DGLA exerts anti-inflammatory effects when it is metabolized into eicosanoids and prostaglandins. These two oxidative DGLA metabo- lites have shown clinical efficacy by suppressing chronic inflammation, lowering blood pressure via vasodilation, inhibiting smooth muscle proliferation associated with atherosclerotic plaque development, arresting cancer cell growth, and aiding in tumor cell differentiation.33

<!-- chunk -->

## • Arachidonic acid (AA), 20:4n6, is a downstream LA metabolite.

There are also preformed AA dietary sources, such as animal fats, eggs, poultry, organ meats, and fish. AA is stored in cell mem- branes and released in response to injury. After AA release, it can be metabolized into eicosanoids through four different pathways: cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, cytochrome P450, and oxygen-spe- cies–triggered reactions. These pathways yield prostaglandins, isoprostanes, thromboxane, leukotrienes, lipoxins, and epoxye- icosatrienoic acids. Each can act to promote the inflammatory cascade.34 AA-derived eicosanoids have important roles in immu- nopathology and have been implicated in inflammation, autoim- munity, allergic diseases, and cancer.35

<!-- chunk -->

## Monounsaturated Fatty Acids

MUFAs are different from other fatty acids because they have only one double bond in their carbon chain. The carbon atom number making up the backbone and the position of this double bond distinguishes one from another and changes their nomenclature. For example, if the double bond is in the seventh position on the carbon backbone, it is known as an omega-7 fatty acid. The most common dietary MUFA sources are olive oil and nuts. Diets rich in MUFAs have shown beneficial effects on total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipo- protein (HDL) cholesterol. MUFA diets have been shown to reduce LDL oxidative susceptibility, decrease platelet aggregation, increase fibrinolysis, and increase bleeding time.36 The mechanism involved in MUFAs’ health benefits is still being investigated. However, it has been proposed that changes in the composition of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), VLDL enzymes, and VLDL proteins involved in VLDL catabolism decrease plasma triacylglycerol concentrations. Therefore the rates of VLDL production and triacylglycerol clearance may be altered because of dietary fat type and amount.36

<!-- chunk -->

## • Oleic acid (OA) has an 18-carbon backbone with one double bond

at the ninth carbon. Therefore it is known as an omega-9 fatty acid, 18:1n9. Olive oil is the main source of OA, which is the most repre- sented MUFA in the diet. OA has attracted much attention because of the wide array of literature extolling the “Mediterranean diet,” which is rich in olive oil and nuts. Oleic acid has been shown to reduce saturated fatty acids’ inflammatory effects on endothelial cells due to a dampening of cytokine activation.37,38

<!-- chunk -->

## • Nervonic acid (NA) is an important omega-9 fatty acid, 24:1n9.

NA can be found in small amounts in borage and vegetable oils, but mainly it is an oleic acid elongation product.39 It is abundant in the brain’s white matter and necessary for nerve-cell myelin bio- synthesis. NA is essential for brain growth and the maintenance of

peripheral nervous tissue enriched with sphingomyelin.40 Alter- ations in NA plasma levels have been implicated in mood disorders and demyelinating disorders. Nervonic acid supplementation may also mitigate diabetic neuropathy.41

<!-- chunk -->

## • Palmitoleic acid (PA) is a monounsaturated omega-7 fatty acid,

16:1n7. The main PA dietary sources are dairy products and maca- damia nuts. However, PA can also be synthesized from triglyceride breakdown or de novo from surplus carbohydrates. Dairy products are rich in the trans isomer of PA, whereas macada- mia nuts contain the cis isomer. In some studies, the trans isomer from dairy has been associated with less inflammation and lower diabetes risk than other trans fats. PA is involved in insulin sensitivity by exert- ing distinct effects on insulin signaling and glucose uptake.42 Macadamia nuts are associated with improving lipid profiles. However, whether the lipid-lowering effects are due to PA specifically, or other oils or nutrients found in these nuts, remains uncertain.42

<!-- chunk -->

## • Vaccenic acid (VA) is a monounsaturated omega-7 fatty acid

that is also classified as a trans fatty acid (trans-11-18:1n7). It is a positional and geometric isomer of oleic acid. Unlike trans fatty acids produced industrially, VA is naturally occurring. It is formed when saturated fatty acids are bacterially fermented in the GI tracts of ruminant animals (cattle, sheep, and goats). Dairy products (cheese, milk, butter) and meat from these animals contain VA.43 Although animal and cell studies suggest that VA may be lipid low- ering and antiatherogenic, human studies are limited.

<!-- chunk -->

## Trans Fatty Acids

Trans fatty acids (TFAs) are unsaturated fatty acids with at least one double bond in the trans configuration. There are two primary dietary trans fat sources: naturally occurring TFAs and industrially produced TFAs. Naturally occurring TFAs are consumed in meats and dairy prod- ucts from cows, sheep, goats and other ruminant animals. As noted previously, these ruminant trans fats are produced through bacterial metabolism in the animal’s GI tract.44 But the more common dietary source in the American diet is industrially formed TFAs, as formed in vegetable oil’s hydrogenation or partial hydrogenation. The hydrogenation process converts vegeta- ble oils into semisolid fats for use in margarines, commercial cooking, and manufacturing processes. These hydrogenated oils are increas- ingly used to improve grocery shelf life, increase vegetable oil stability during deep frying, and enhance taste in baked goods. The major TFA sources in the American diet are deep-fried fast foods, bakery prod- ucts, packaged snack foods, and margarines.17 In recent years, TFAs’ dietary implications in public health have received increasing attention. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ruled, effective January 1, 2006, that the nutrition labels for all conventional foods and supplements must indicate trans fatty acid content. This was prompted by the evidence that trans fats promote inflammation and increase coronary heart disease risk. Trans fats also increase triglycerides, increase Lp(a) levels, and reduce LDL particle size.17

<!-- chunk -->

## • Elaidic acid (EA) is an oleic acid trans isomer (trans-9-18:1). It is

the predominant trans fatty acid in the Western diet. EA is found in margarine, partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, and fried foods. EA, like all TFAs, has been extensively studied for its role in increas- ing cardiovascular risk and adversely affecting lipid profiles. Addi- tionally, EA has recently been shown to enhance metastatic cancer progression.45

<!-- chunk -->

## • Vaccenic acid (VA), as noted previously, is a monounsaturated

omega-7 trans fatty acid. It is formed in ruminant animals’ GI tracts and consumed in the diet as butter, cheese, and meats from these animals. Although, as with all TFAs, increased VA intake and elevated levels increase risk, there is evidence that VA shows some health benefit in rodent and animal studies, although human studies are limited.16 VA’s metabolic fate has not been extensively studied. It is well absorbed from the diet, but from there, it is either rapidly oxidized or metabolized to other lipids. Data are evolving as to whether VA is preferentially oxidized for energy.46

<!-- chunk -->

## Saturated Fatty Acids

Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) are made up of a carbon chain with no double bonds. Because fatty acids are cell-membrane structural units, this saturated configuration contributes to decreased cell-membrane fluidity. SFAs are not essential nutrients. They are mainly obtained through dietary intake of animal fats. However, the body is capable of synthesizing SFAs from carbohydrates via de novo lipogenesis. The synthesized SFAs are the same FAs found in dietary animal fats. Therefore reducing disease risk using dietary modification should also include carbohydrate reduction. Most saturated fatty acid studies focus solely on their tendency to alter lipoprotein metabolism and influence cholesterol levels. Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that SFAs may cause adipose tissue inflammation. This inflammatory process involves the signaling of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a sensor that binds lipopolysac- charides. This receptor activation signals nuclear factor-kappa B (NFk- B) production, which triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines like interleukin 1 and 6 (IL-1, IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α ).47 This inflammatory process is implicated in overall dietary SFA disease risk.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Palmitic acid, or PA (16:0), is a saturated fat naturally found in

animal meat and dairy products, as well as in palm and coconut oils. Recent studies reveal evidence that PA excess causes mitochon- drial dysfunction mediated by oxidative stress, an effect known as lipotoxicity. Although investigations are ongoing, PA has been linked to an increase in cardiovascular disease risk, cancer risk, and diabetes.48

<!-- chunk -->

## • Stearic acid (18:0) is found mainly in meat and dairy products.

Stearic acid (SA) increases Lp(a) levels, although the effects are less harmful than those of trans fatty acids.49 SA is the only saturated fatty acid with a net neutral effect on serum cholesterol ratios. Although meat is a primary SFA source, not all meat is created equal. Grass-fed beef contains less total fat and tends to contain more conjugated linoleic acid and antioxidants. Grass-fed beef also tends to have much higher cholesterol-neutral stearic acid (18:0) and less cho- lesterol-elevating SFAs, such as myristic (C14:0) and palmitic (C16:0) FAs.50

<!-- chunk -->

## Lauric acid (12:0) is a medium-/long-chain fatty acid most often

found in coconut oil. Lauric acid’s metabolic and physiological prop- erties account for many of coconut oil’s properties. Lauric acid can be classified as either a medium-chain or long-chain fatty acid. In terms of digestion, however, it behaves more as a long-chain fatty acid because it gets absorbed with chylomicrons. Detailed studies show that most ingested lauric acid is converted directly to energy rather than stored as fat. Most medium-chain fatty acids are absorbed directly into the portal vein and used for energy.51 One of coconut oil’s advantages is its resistance to oxidation and polymerization, which makes it a stable cooking oil. Because of its high SFA content (92%), coconut oil has always been classified, along with butter, palm oil, and animal fats, as a saturated fat source that should be consumed in low levels. Although the common perception remains that saturated fatty acids are bad, an increasing number of researchers contend that medium-chain fatty acids are less hazardous than hydro- genated vegetable oils, such as soybean and corn oils.52 Although lauric

acid is a saturated fatty acid, there is no link between lauric acid and high cholesterol.53 Infrequent to moderate coconut oil use does not seem to raise cholesterol levels.51,54

## Fatty Acid Ratios

Despite the knowledge that fatty acids are implicated in many chronic diseases, there is a fundamental gap in fatty acid research. No accepted established reference ranges define optimal levels. This results in dif- ficulty interpreting results in relation to disease progression and risk. Therefore ratios between specific fatty acids, separately and in groups, are often used.55

<!-- chunk -->

## • Omega-6/Omega-3 Ratio: As touched on previously, Western

diets have changed over the past 100 years. A 1:1 balance (n-6:n-3) existed throughout evolutionary history. The current Western diet averages 15:1 to 16.7:1. The shift to n-6 fatty acids correlates with an increase in many chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular dis- ease, diabetes, cancer, obesity, autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and depression. The proinflammatory effects of preformed AA, and its formation from n-6 precursors, favors increased thromboxane A2, leukotriene B4, IL-1 β , IL-6, TNF- α , and C-reactive protein (CRP). By decreasing n-6 dietary intake and balancing this with increases in flax, walnut, chia, fish, and purified fish oils, these inflammatory effects can be mitigated.55

<!-- chunk -->

## • Arachidonic Acid/Eicosapentaenoic Acid (AA/EPA) Ratio: EPA,

an n-3 fatty acid, metabolically competes with the inflammatory AA to use the same enzyme, delta-5-desaturase, for metabolism. Omega-6 fatty acid dietary intake, specifically animal fats rich in AA, alters essential fatty acid metabolism in favor of inflamma- tion. Adding fish oils, or increasing overall n-3 intake with oily fish, flax, walnut, and chia, shifts delta-5-desaturase activity toward n-3 metabolism and therefore decreases n-6 precursor conversion to AA. Additionally, a decrease in animal fats is helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Linoleic Acid/Dihomo-Gamma-Linoleic Acid (LA:DGLA) Ratio:

The n-6 fatty acid DGLA is anti-inflammatory, and the ability to convert precursor n-6 fatty acids to DGLA is paramount because of its ability to alter disease risk and progression.33 The enzyme responsible for this conversion is delta-6-elongase, which relies heavily on zinc as a cofactor. Delta-6-elongase is quite sensitive to early-stage zinc deficiency. The ratio of LA:DGLA is often used as a zinc status biomarker in humans, in the absence of confounding factors, such as infection or stress. The richest dietary zinc sources include red meats and liver, nuts, seeds, and grains.56

<!-- chunk -->

## Omega-3 Index

The Omega-3 Index was first proposed in 2004 by William S. Harris, PhD, and Clemons von Schacky, MD, as a way of evaluating the risk of death related to coronary artery disease (CAD). It is defined as the RBC percentage sum of EPA + DHA. Estimations show a cardioprotective target to be >8%, and the level associated with increased cardiovascu- lar risk is <4%. The Omega-3 Index allows clinicians to risk-stratify patients and target therapy with purified fish oils or increased dietary intake of n-3–rich foods. Therapeutic interventions are shown to con- tribute to a reduced risk of CAD-related death.57–59


Fatty acid profiling aids clinicians in disease risk stratification and can direct dietary modification. Patients often misreport fatty acid intake, and food consumption tables can be unreliable. Fatty acid profiling uncovers deficiencies and imbalances that have clinical implications. Dietary and therapeutic targeting may be warranted. Several dietary and supplementation recommendations can be found in Table 13.1, although this list is not exhaustive. Due diligence is recommended regarding supplementation and dietary intake.

## 135CHAPTER 14 Food Hypersensitivities

dietary habits, digestive enzymes, and liver function or increased chemical exposures (affecting DNA transcription of enzymes and/or microbiome). This chapter focuses on testing for the immune-mediated reac- tions (including classical food allergies and food sensitivities) and food intolerances. Various testing methods are used as tools to identify a person’s reactive foods. The adverse food reaction test depends on the hypothesized type of food reaction (most often determined by the patient’s symptoms) along with the patient’s medical history and phys- ical examination. This chapter provides a review of the immunology of adverse food reactions and then looks at the different testing methods.

# IMMUNOLOGY OF FOOD ALLERGIES AND FOOD

# SENSITIVITIES

Most individuals do not have food allergies or sensitivities. Instead, they eat a variety of foods, digest them with varying levels of efficiency, and absorb what they need, and their immune systems develop oral tolerance to the food. Oral tolerance describes how the body learns to not react to an antigen (food) when it is delivered through the oral route.4 The factors that influence tolerance include the person’s genet- ics, microflora, digestive function, vitamin A levels, lipids, and gut epi- thelial barrier; the route of exposure (skin versus oral route); and the nature and form of the food when it is consumed.4 The mucosal immune system is quite complex, consisting of many parts and functions. Key to food reactions are the regulatory T-cells (Treg cells) in Peyer’s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes that produce inter- leukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and transforming growth factor- β (TGF- β ). These cytokines promote B-cell class switching to secretory IgA antibodies (sIgA) and act as a general immunosuppressant for both T and B cell responses.9 When functioning properly, these allow tolerance to food while still fighting pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites, toxins). Food allergies or IgE-mediated allergy reactions persist in patients with an inappropriate Th2 immune response. Patients with food allergies have food specific CD4+ T cells that express IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13.9 Research into what causes a breakdown in tolerance and pro- motes food allergies suggests that adjuvants, alternative routes of sensitization,9 and loss of intestinal permeability control are all con- tributing to the increase in food allergies.10 Adjuvants are substances that stimulate the immune system when given with an antigen. For example, in an illustrative study, mice given cholera toxin (CT) were sensitized to peanut and milk proteins.11 Allergen-specific IgE antibodies and Th2 cytokines occurred and induced an anaphylaxis response to peanut and milk proteins. The study showed alterations in dendritic cells presenting antigens and in the mesenteric lymph nodes inducing the allergic response.11 Another hypothesis is that alternative routes of sensitization may be contributing to food allergy reactions. Primary exposure to a food allergen through nonoral routes, such as using creams with peanut oil on the skin, has been implicated in inducing an allergic response.12 Another paper showed that skin exposure desensitized the allergic response and might help induce a tolerance response in intact skin.13 Increased intestinal per- meability contributes to food allergies through various mechanisms. Efficiency of digestion, transportation of food into the mucosa, mast cell degranulation, and induction of sIgA and cytokines (high levels of IL-4 and IL-9 in the intestines) all contribute to inducing more allergic reactions.10 The research has focused on understanding food allergy (IgE-mediated allergy) reactions rather than food sen- sitivity (non-IgE allergy) reactions, although many factors relate to both types of reactions. Genetic background, environmental factors, stress, infection, malnutrition, and microbiota balance all contribute to tolerance and immune-mediated hypersensitivities.10

# FOOD ALLERGY/HYPERSENSITIVITY/INTOLERANCE

# TESTING METHODS

A variety of ways to test for adverse food reactions are available, includ- ing oral food challenge (OFC), skin-prick testing (SPT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgE or IgG antibodies, allergen- specific IgE (sIgE), component-resolved diagnostic tests (CRDs), atopy patch test (APT), breath testing (BT), and controversial energetic test- ing methods. As immunological methods become more sophisticated, more specific and accurate tests are likely in the future. All methods give different information about adverse food reactions and have spe- cific advantages and disadvantages. Evaluation of adverse food reac- tions always starts with taking a patient history aimed at identifying the relationship between specific foods and the occurrence of physical symptoms and family predisposition to evaluate possible genetic risk factors. The type of test used depends on the clinical presentation and the results of past tests. Clinical interpretation is required to under- stand the relevance of the results regardless of the type of testing used.

## Oral Food Challenge

The OFC is the most common test used to identify and verify adverse food reactions. The test is extremely versatile and can be used to iden- tify a variety of adverse food reactions, including food allergies, sen- sitivities, and intolerances. OFCs are indicated to identify the food responsible for acute or chronic symptoms, to expand the diet in patients who have developed tolerance to previously reactive foods, and to identify foods that may have been reactive on other types of testing due to cross-reactivity of antigens.14 For patients at risk of severe IgE reaction, OFC for food allergies is performed in an allergist’s office or hospital because of the risk of a life-threatening anaphylaxis response.14,15 A patient with suspected food allergies will eat a gradually increasing amount of food under medical supervision until an age-appropriate dose is reached or symp- toms develop. Symptoms often develop in minutes for a food allergy but can appear a couple of hours after the test.7 This method is recom- mended for confirming food allergy reactions to reactive foods from SPT and sIgE tests.14,16 Food sensitivities and intolerances often have symptoms that are delayed (hours to days after ingesting a food) and are usually not life threatening; therefore OFC can safely be recommended by a variety of clinicians to confirm these types of food reactions.

<!-- chunk -->

## Method: When testing for food allergies, the OFC can be performed

as an open feeding, in which the patient is aware of what he or she is eating; a single-blind OFC, in which the patient is unaware of the food he or she is being fed but the allergist knows what is being tested; or a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), in which the test food and placebo food are concealed from both the patient and doctor. The DBPCFC is time consuming and difficult to administer and is mostly used in research studies.15 The challenge food should be eaten in its usual form or the form implicated in the allergic reaction because food processing can significantly affect the allergenic properties of the proteins.7 OFC is contraindicated when there has been a severe ana- phylactic reaction to the test food and when SPT or sIgE exceeds cutoff values, indicating a high probability of severe symptoms with an OFC. When testing for food sensitivities or intolerances, it is beneficial to eliminate potentially reactive foods from the diet for 8 weeks and then reintroduce foods, watching for symptoms.2 The precise method will depend on the type of food reaction one is looking for, the clin- ical presentation of the client, the ability of the person to adhere to a restricted diet, and the preference of the clinician. Methods for testing food sensitivities and intolerances are as follows:

<!-- chunk -->

## Eliminate potentially reactive foods for 8 weeks:

1. Single suspect food 2. Commonly reactive foods (dairy, eggs, gluten, citrus, nuts/seeds, shellfish, and others) 3. Foods that appear to correlate to physical symptoms 4. Identified reactive foods on food sensitivity test (e.g., food-specific IgG testing) 5. Potentially intolerant foods (e.g., foods containing salicylates or fructose)

<!-- chunk -->

## Reintroduction in food sensitivities or food intolerances:

1. Encourage the client to keep a journal of symptoms and the timing of reintroduction. 2. Add one food back to the diet by eating 1 serving of the food and waiting 3 days to see if any reactions occur. 3. If no symptoms appear, increase the dose of the food to 2 or 3 serv- ings in a day and observe reactions for the next 3 days. 4. If a reaction occurs, eliminate that food and wait until the symp- toms resolve before reintroducing the next food. 5. Continue with the process until all suspected food sensitivities or intolerances have been tested.

<!-- chunk -->

## Advantages: This method will identify any type of reaction to foods

and can be used to confirm a reaction and motivate food elimination compliance, as well as identifying food sensitivities or intolerances. The method is very adaptable and can accommodate a wide variety of people.

<!-- chunk -->

## Disadvantages: An OFC for a food allergy should only be done

with resuscitation equipment available due to possible severe reactions. People can influence the results based on their ideas rather than real reactions when using an open feeding. It is difficult to disguise food for a blinded test. Scoring of symptoms can be useful when evaluating results.16 When eliminating and reintroducing foods to test for food sensitivities or intolerances, the method can be time consuming and requires the ability to be on a restricted diet for months while keeping good records of symptoms and diet. This method is not appropriate for people with eating disorders or orthorexia.

<!-- chunk -->

## Clinical Evaluation: Clinicians can consider the severity of the

food reaction, the timing and type of symptoms present, and past reac- tions when developing a specific, individualized protocol. Oral food challenges can be used to confirm associations between foods and symptoms, which can help motivate dietary changes.

## Skin-Prick Testing

SPT is the most common test performed by conventional allopathic allergists (MDs) to confirm IgE-mediated allergies, including food allergies and environmental allergies.

<!-- chunk -->

## Method: SPT is performed by placing a drop of commercially pre-

pared allergen on the skin of the forearm or back and “pricking” or lightly lancing the skin to a depth of 1 mm using a sterile, disposable lancet. After 3 seconds, blot the solution from the skin. A positive and negative control (histamine [10 mg/mL] and physiological glycerine) are used to confirm the reactions. The person is allergic to the allergen when he or she has erythema or swelling greater than that of the posi- tive control in 15 minutes. This method identifies reactions to allergens that produce an IgE-mediated allergy.17,18 Immunologically, the IgE antibodies that the body has made from past exposure to the allergen are bound to Mast cells that degranulate when the allergen is encoun- tered during the test. A prick + prick (P+P) test is used with fresh foods that have unstable proteins, such as vegetables. This test is done by pricking the fresh food then pricking the patient’s skin.14

<!-- chunk -->

## Advantages: SPT is an inexpensive, well-standardized, simple, and

low-risk diagnostic test that is more sensitive than ELISA testing for IgE antibodies. There is a high negative predictive value, meaning if there is no reaction on the skin test, there is little possibility of an IgE- mediated allergy assuming the food contains stable proteins in the extracts (such as casein from cow’s milk, egg ovomucoid, albumin, and peanut vicilins). When the proteins are not as stable, there is a low pre- dictive value.14 The test is very accurate for identifying environmental allergies.

<!-- chunk -->

## Disadvantages: SPT requires that a person be exposed to the aller-

gen before being tested so that the body can produce IgE antibodies. The test can be uncomfortable for patients and is contraindicated in patients with extensive skin disease, those taking antihistamines or other drugs that cannot be discontinued, or those with a recent his- tory of anaphylaxis.17 The commercial extracts used for SPT contain a mix of major and minor allergenic proteins and can partially degrade during the extraction process. Because these are biological extracts, they may contain cross-reactive allergens.14 Proteins that degrade with heat have a low predictive value (meaning a negative test does not rule out the possibility of an allergy). With strong clinical indications of food reactions, a P+P test can be used with fresh food.14 An obvi- ous additional disadvantage is that it primarily detects only IgE-type immunological reactions.

## 137CHAPTER 14 Food Hypersensitivities

<!-- chunk -->

## Clinical Evaluation: This test is usually performed by a board-

certified allergist. People who report being “tested for food allergies already” have usually had their IgE-mediated food allergies tested through SPT. Intradermal skin testing is a similar, more sensitive test and involves injecting a small amount of the suspected allergen into the skin. This type of testing is more sensitive than SPT but has a higher risk of death, and its value for food allergies is questionable.17,19

## Radioallergosorbent Testing

Radioallergosorbent testing (RAST) was the first in vitro blood test reported in the literature for identification of IgE antibodies to specific allergens.20 RAST testing has been replaced by ELISA testing, which is another in vitro test that uses fluorescence instead of radioactivity to perform the test. The basic method of the RAST test has followed different forms as the technology has evolved.

<!-- chunk -->

## Method: RAST testing is performed using human serum to identify

the presence and amount of an antigen-specific IgE antibody present in the serum. In brief, the method involves binding a specific allergen to a solid substrate and adding serum from the person being tested. Antibodies in the serum will bind to the allergen. The sample is rinsed, leaving the bound antibodies behind. A radioactive marker is added to bind to the IgE antibodies bound to the substrate. The radioactive signal can be measured and is proportional to the amount of aller- gen-specific IgE antibody in the serum. RAST identifies food allergies (IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions).21

<!-- chunk -->

## Advantages: This type of testing allows for more convenient iden-

tification of allergens in the blood rather than using an SPT. RAST sets the stage for second-generation, allergen-specific antibody tests (ELISA tests) using the same basic method.22 The newer antibody tests can measure different types of antibodies, use higher-quality allergen extracts, and use different matrix substrates that improve the test accu- racy and sensitivity.

<!-- chunk -->

## Disadvantages: Antibody testing is limiting in that a person needs

to be recently exposed to an allergen to have antibodies and a positive result. This type of testing specifically only looks at IgE antibodies and is hampered by cross-reactive proteins and low-quality test agents.21

<!-- chunk -->

## Clinical Evaluation: RAST testing in its original form is not used

currently. It has been replaced by quantitative, automated technology, bringing more accuracy and precision to this type of testing.

<!-- chunk -->

## Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay

ELISA is a second-generation, allergen-specific antibody test also known as a solid-phase immunoassay. The technology has advanced significantly since RAST was developed in 1961, creating a variety of changes in this type of testing. ELISA test results are reported qualita- tively (positive or negative), semiqualitatively (very low, low, moder- ate, or high reactivity), or qualitatively in the case of some specific tests.

<!-- chunk -->

## Method: ELISA testing is similar to the RAST test in that an anti-

gen (allergen) is bound to a solid substrate, and serum or whole blood is added to allow for antibodies to bind to the allergen being tested. The sample is rinsed to remove unbound antibodies, and a fluorescent marker is added to bind to the desired antibody. ELISA tests can be used to identify IgE, IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies depending on the fluorescent marker that is added. sIgE levels are measured routinely to identify food allergies.8 IgG antibodies could be related to food sensi- tivities (non-IgE-mediated allergy), although the clinical significance of IgG antibodies to foods is still being debated in the research litera- ture.23–25 ELISA tests can be performed with whole blood (IgG, IgA), serum (IgE, IgG, IgA, IgM), or saliva (IgA) samples.

<!-- chunk -->

## Advantages: ELISA testing is versatile, relatively inexpensive, easy

to prepare, and readily available, making it a useful screening tool for food reactions.26 sIgE levels are measured routinely to identify food allergies but should not be used alone to diagnose food allergies.2 The use of sIgE tests eliminates the risk of systemic reactions that can occur using SPT and OFC,26 although OFC by a qualified allergist is recom- mended to confirm food allergies.16 sIgG testing is generally accepted in the literature for celiac disease, nonceliac gluten sensitivity, and irritable bowel syndrome24,27 and for patients with unidentified aller- gic symptoms25 but is not verified for other symptoms related to food sensitivities.

<!-- chunk -->

## Disadvantages: A person must have recently eaten the food in

question for it to yield a positive result on an sIgG test. More frequent exposure to specific IgG-mediated food sensitivities will induce higher IgG antibody levels in reactive individuals. The amounts of IgG anti- bodies will decrease as long as the immune system is not reactivated by the food. Cross-reactions between specific food antigens and other agents can cause a positive test reaction even when a person has never eaten the food. sIgE testing has high false-positive rates, possibly due to cross-reac- tivity between different similar food proteins.28 The quality and form of the antigen (food) are difficult to standardize due to natural vari- ability in the extracts and degradation of the testing reagents, which can cause low assay sensitivity.26 Low assay specificity is found because of the complex mixture of proteins, both allergenic and nonallergenic, in the extracts.26 One research study looking at the differences between raw ver- sus processed food allergens showed higher reactivity for processed foods.29 Most commercially available ELISA tests are made from raw foods, which may mean some processed foods are missed in the test- ing. Teadorowicz’s review article shows how the Maillard reaction increases immunogenicity in food proteins by skewing T-cells to a Th2 response, which most likely affects both allergies and sensitivities.30 Eggs appear to be a special case, in which cooked eggs (baked) are less reactive than raw or boiled eggs in allergy tests (SPT and IgE ELISAs confirmed with oral food challenge), which highlights the importance of specifying the food antigen in the test being used.31

## Clinical Evaluation: A positive sIgE test is used with the patient

medical history, physical examination, and closely supervised OFC by an allergist to confirm food allergies.8 Nonconventional medicine practitioners will often use sIgG tests to identify food sensitivities that have not been identified with SPT or sIgE. Confirmation of a food sen- sitivity also relies on patient history, the physical examination, and the results of sIgG and OFC. The clinical significance of sIgG tests is being debated in the literature, with many articles correctly concluding that sIgG testing does not confirm that a patient has food allergies.32,33 The research literature is starting to associate positive sIgG tests with spe- cific clinical conditions associated with non–IgE-mediated reactions, such as celiac disease, irritable bowel disease, food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic gastrointesti- nal disorders, and depressive disorders.24,25,27,34–36 Further research is needed to more fully understand the role of food sensitivities and sIgG testing in clinical pathology.

## Specific IgE to Foods

Automated sIgE tests (e.g., ImmunoCAP, Immulite, and HYTEC-288) are automated systems that mimic the ELISA method of IgE antibody detection using traditional extracts containing multiple proteins that are also known as singleplex extracts.22,37,38 Technological advances have allowed quantification of IgE antibodies and specific IgE antibody levels but are not identical between assays and cannot be compared directly.22,38

<!-- chunk -->

## Method: The method is similar to ELISA testing but uses an auto-

mated machine and different solid substrates to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the test.

<!-- chunk -->

## 138SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

<!-- chunk -->

## Advantages and Disadvantages: This technology improves on

ELISA technology, but it is more expensive and is available only for IgE antibodies. Differences in the composition of the antigens used in the various assays can affect the results of the specificity and comparability of the tests.22

<!-- chunk -->

## Clinical Evaluation: For identifying specific IgE allergens, these

methods are less sensitive than skin testing but more sensitive and spe- cific than ELISA testing. This is the most common type of serum test- ing ordered by a conventional allergist. An OFC is still recommended with automated sIgE tests.15,18,39

<!-- chunk -->

## Component-Resolved Diagnostic Tests or Molecular-

<!-- chunk -->

## Based Diagnosis

CRDs or MBD (ImmunoCAP-ISAC 112) is an IgE antibody technol- ogy that uses specific proteins in a food rather than extracts containing a complex combination of food proteins. This allows for identification of which proteins a patient is sensitized to and whether they are dan- gerous, commonly allergic proteins or relatively harmless proteins.8,14 This type of testing is sometimes referred to as multiplex sIgE testing because it tests for multiple individual allergic proteins.

<!-- chunk -->

## Method: The microarray biochip is made with purified proteins

or recombinant proteins from different common allergens. Common allergens tested include peanut, hazelnut, walnut, soy, rosacea fruits, wheat, and shrimp.40 Proteins are bound to a microarray biochip, and a small amount of serum or plasma is added. Samples are processed and read with an automated machine to allow protein-specific IgE to be detected.41

<!-- chunk -->

## Advantages and Disadvantages: This technology is being used to

identify specific proteins in foods that a person is reacting to. This allows clinicians to correlate clinical reactivity with IgE antibodies to specific proteins in foods or identify if cross-reactivity is occurring with foods carrying homologous proteins.15,40,42 The utility of CRD has been tested for a variety of commonly allergenic foods and has increased specificity and decreased sensitivity compared with tradi- tional SPT and serum sIgE testing.37,43,44 The cost of CRD is considered a significant disadvantage for this method.45

<!-- chunk -->

## Clinical Evaluation: Currently, CRD is recommended as an adjunct

to SPT and sIgE testing to avoid performing oral food challenges when the risk of severe symptoms is suspected.15 A more accurate specific immunotherapy (SIT) prescription can be recommended based on the results of CRD for treatment of food allergies.42,45

## Atopy Patch Test

The APT is most commonly used to identify irritant contact dermatitis and was researched to assess for delayed cell-mediated hypersensitiv- ities to foods (type IV hypersensitivities) but has been shown not to be a useful test for food allergy and is not currently recommended for evaluation of adverse food reactions in the allergy literature.2,14 APT has also not been shown to be useful in food sensitivities (non–IgE- mediated food allergies) or in children with atopic dermatitis or gas- trointestinal reactions to foods, although there may be benefit in more research into these areas.7 APT may be most useful to identify food intolerance to nickel, incorrectly named systemic nickel allergy syn- drome (SNAS). Symptoms include contact dermatitis and gastrointes- tinal symptoms after eating foods that contain high levels of nickel.46,47

<!-- chunk -->

## Method: APT is performed by using adhesive tape to adhere par-

ticular potential allergens to the skin. The patches are left in place for 48 hours, and the skin is examined at 48 and 72 hours for a response. If the skin develops redness or blisters, the person is allergic to the substance.48

<!-- chunk -->

## Advantages: APT is excellent for identifying topical triggers for

contact dermatitis. It could be used to identify patients with systemic reactions to nickel from eating nickel-rich foods such as almonds, chickpeas, cocoa, peanuts, and walnuts.46,47

<!-- chunk -->

## Disadvantages: The research examining APT for food sensitivi-

ties, atopic eczema, and gastrointestinal diseases has been shown to be unreliable.2,7 There are not any standardized food reagents for APT, and there is significant variability in interpretation, making it not a useful test for food allergies or sensitivities.49

<!-- chunk -->

## Clinical Evaluation: APT for nickel reactivity may help identify a

nickel intolerance.46,50,51 A controlled, oral food challenge is still nec- essary to verify SNAS, including a low-nickel diet, which can be chal- lenging to implement.52

## Breath Testing

BT can be used to determine enzyme deficiencies in some food intol- erances and small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Many common gastrointestinal disorders with irritable bowel–like symptoms or car- bohydrate maldigestion can be identified with BT.

<!-- chunk -->

## Method: Patients need to prepare for BT by avoiding antibiotics or

probiotics for 2 weeks before the test, avoiding prokinetics or laxatives 7 days before the test, and eating only low-fiber meals 24 hours before the test. The patient needs to fast from solids or liquids for 12 hours before the test. A baseline breath sample is taken of hydrogen (or some- times methane because 20% of patients are not hydrogen producers). The patient is then asked to drink a carbohydrate solution (lactose, fructose, or sorbitol), and breath samples are collected every 20 minutes for the next 2 to 5 hours. Patient symptoms are also recorded. Positive breath tests have increased hydrogen or methane levels.5,53,54

<!-- chunk -->

## Advantages: This diagnostic test is relatively inexpensive, safe, and

simple to perform.54

<!-- chunk -->

## Disadvantages: The test can be difficult to prepare for and time

consuming to perform. It can take 2 to 5 hours to assess carbohydrate malabsorption. There is variability in how the test is interpreted, and it can be positive for people without clinical symptoms.54 More research is needed to determine doses for pediatric populations, assess the effect of pre-/probiotics on the test, determine the effect of diet on the test, establish the significance of baseline elevations of hydrogen despite appropriate preparation, and determine optimal time intervals for BT of different substances.54

<!-- chunk -->

## Clinical Evaluation: BT may become a useful diagnostic tool for

establishing food intolerances caused by enzyme deficiencies or car- bohydrate malabsorption. Although BT is routinely done to diagnose small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), more research will need to be done to establish its use in food intolerances.

<!-- chunk -->

## Basophil Activation Test

The basophil activation test (BAT) is considered a promising test to identify allergenic foods, but there are challenges in its use outside the research setting. These tests are expensive and require fresh blood and a flow cytometer, which limits their effective use.8,55,56 OFC can be dan- gerous in some patients with clinical food allergies. BAT is an in vitro test that is being researched to identify allergies without the need for an OFC after an equivocal SPT or sIgE.55,57 BAT has the potential to distinguish food allergies from cross-reactivity and to monitor aller- gic patients on therapy.56,58 Although this type of testing is not used routinely at this time for allergies, it holds promise for the future.57,58

## Energetic Methods of Food Sensitivity Testing

Energetic methods of food sensitivity testing, such as Electro- acupuncture According to Voll [EAV], Vega testing, Carroll testing, applied kinesiology, electrodermal screening (EDS), and bio-resonance therapy (BRT), are some of the ways alternative medicine practitioners test for adverse food reactions, describing the reaction as energetic and

<!-- chunk -->

## 139CHAPTER 14 Food Hypersensitivities

often not specifying whether the reaction is an allergy, sensitivity, or intolerance. These tests are not validated and most often do not give consistent results.32,49,59 One study showed that “kinesiology as a diag- nostic tool is not more useful than random guessing” after the test was not able to reliably identify wasp venom allergy.60

<!-- chunk -->

## Methods: The methods of these types of tests vary and are generally

not elucidated. Most appear to be measuring galvanic skin resistance through an electrical circuit.

<!-- chunk -->

## Advantages and Disadvantages: Some practitioners have reported

good success with these types of devices in identifying food sensitivi- ties and intolerances. Clinical trials using Vega testing and EDS have not shown them to be reliable compared with traditional allergy test- ing,59,61 and these tests are not recommended for the identification of food allergies. A review of applied kinesiology literature showed the studies to be unreliable, although many of the studies quoted in the review showed favorable clinical results.62,63

<!-- chunk -->

## Clinical Evaluation: Scientifically, energetic testing methods

are unsupported in the literature and should not be used to identify adverse food reactions.

<!-- chunk -->

## Other Testing Methods

Other testing methods include lymphocyte response testing (ELISA/ ACT), cell-size variability testing (ALCAT), provocation-neutraliza- tion testing, cytotoxic food allergy testing, and Nambudripad’s Allergy Elimination Techniques (NAET), all of which have been used clinically for adverse food reaction testing and treatment. Anecdotal evidence in the form of case studies is positive for NAET64,65 but could not be found for other testing methods. Systematic, scientific studies either have not been done to verify the clinical relevance of these methods or have shown the tests to be unreliable and clinically questionable.49,66–68 Review articles suggest that these methods lack scientific rationale, standardization, and reproducibility.2,14,32,49 Cell-size variability test- ing had random results with the same sample in a study examining the reproducibility and reliability of this testing method.69

# CONCLUSIONS

Testing for reactions to foods is being used in clinical practice to confirm or exclude a suspected diagnosis of food allergies, sensitivities, or intol- erances and is used as a tool to motivate dietary changes. Selection of the type of diagnostic test and interpretation of the results must be directed by the patient’s clinical history, presentation, and the type of suspected adverse food reaction. Clarity around the terms used to describe adverse food reactions will help with the selection and interpretation of testing.

## 141CHAPTER 15 Genomics, Nutrigenomics, and the Promise of Personalized Medicine

nucleotides are different. That means that there are 3 million reasons why the two of you are not the same. These subtle variations of the genetic code are known as polymorphisms (literally, “many shapes,” because if the change in the genetic code results in an amino acid sub- stitution, the resulting proteins will have different shapes and slightly altered functions as well). These polymorphisms are largely responsi- ble for our biochemical individuality. Our polymorphisms help make us unique individuals. There are many types of polymorphisms, but by far the most common is the single-nucleotide polymorphism (abbre- viated SNP and pronounced “snip”), in which a single nucleotide of the DNA is altered. The sum of all of an individual’s polymorphisms significantly affects protein synthesis and physiological function, ren- dering each individual biologically and biochemically unique.

# WHY DO POLYMORPHISMS EXIST?

The theory of natural selection has two central tenets: (1) all organisms compete for limited resources, and (2) organisms with some advantage in acquiring those resources are more likely to survive, to thrive, and to pass on that advantage to their offspring. Polymorphic variations are the ultimate source of these advantages. All polymorphisms that are found to be common in a species must afford some adaptive advantage to survival in some specific environment. Genetic polymorphisms are preserved and become more prevalent in a species when they endow a better chance of survival or of reproduction. The cumulative weight of slight genetic variations over time is the means by which variability within a species arises and by which new species also emerge. However, what may be good for a species and its evolution may not be good for a specific individual because the environmental pressures exerted on a species over millions of years may be very different from the environ- ment encountered in the present. In individuals, altered polymorphic genes (the legacy of evolution) produce altered proteins, and altered proteins exhibit altered func- tions. For any given individual, altered protein function may be bene- ficial, neutral, or harmful, depending on the environment to which he or she is exposed. Prevalent polymorphisms are likely to be beneficial in certain environments but harmful in others. Because we cannot change our genes, the goal of preventive genomics is to alter an indi- vidual’s environment based on his or her specific genetic variations to optimize his or her genetic potential. Genes themselves cannot be modified, but gene expression can be. One of the common miscon- ceptions of polymorphisms is that they reveal only limitations, but in reality they reveal an individual’s potential.

# NUTRIGENETICS AND NUTRIGENOMICS

From a clinical perspective, changes in diet are one major way of alter- ing the gene–environment balance and improving an individual’s health. Two distinct but interrelated fields of inquiry and knowledge are emerging. Nutrigenetics, also referred to as personalized nutrition, is based on the understanding that our genetic polymorphisms change the way we respond physiologically to specific nutrients. By study- ing specific polymorphisms and their physiological response to spe- cific nutrients, we can determine a more optimal nutritional regimen for a specific individual based on his or her specific polymorphisms. Nutrigenomics, by contrast, focuses on the effects of specific nutrients (both macro and micro) on the genome and, subsequently, on the body’s resulting total pool of proteins (the proteome) and on all its subsequent metabolic activity (the metabolome) as well (Fig. 15.1).2,3 Food is, by definition, derived from other living organisms. Inherent in any food is an information code that we read and inter- pret by eating that food. There is a literal exchange of information that passes between the eaten and the eater. Not surprisingly, central to life is our ability to coordinate our metabolic activities with nutrient avail- ability. Signals from the exterior world (food, toxins, weather, stress, etc.) turn on and turn off specific metabolic processes to improve our chances of survival in an ever-changing world.4 The most extreme example of the interaction of food availabil- ity and metabolic change is the situation, common in nature, when no food at all is available (i.e., famine). Clive McCay at Cornell University in the 1930s found that by restricting calorie intake in rats by at least 25% from the free-feeding level, he could substantially NutrigenomicsNutrigenetics Epigenomics Transcriptomics RNA DNA

increase their average and extreme life expectancies, delay the age of tumor onset, delay cessation of reproductive function, and preserve functional homeostasis or stress response capacity.5 Since that time, no major investigation has failed to demonstrate significant benefits to health and longevity from calorie restriction. Calorie restriction lowers the level of insulin exposure, which in turn lowers the over- all growth-factor exposure, improves age-declining maintenance of mitochondrial function, and helps maintain a long-term favorable balance of the antagonism of insulin to growth hormone.6 From an evolutionary perspective, this makes intuitive sense. Only when cal- ories are abundant does an individual have the metabolic resources for growth and reproduction. Survival during times of famine neces- sitates metabolic shifts that conserve resources and promote repair because growth is not an option.7 Reducing calorie intake not only lowers overall insulin exposure but is now known to activate the transcription of a family of genes known as sirtuins (SIRTs). The SIRT enzymes appear to have first arisen in primordial eukaryotes, possibly to help them cope with adverse conditions, like famine, and today are found in all plants, yeast, and animals. In response to calorie restriction, SIRT-1 stimulates the production of new mitochondria in skeletal muscle and liver cells, thereby increasing the capacity for metabolic repair and energy pro- duction. New mitochondria produce fewer free radicals than the old mitochondria, which leads to less free-radical damage and to delayed onset of metabolic aging. SIRT-1 also has a cascading effect on multi- ple genes, leading to increased catalase activity, increased free fatty acid oxidation for energy, and reduced inflammation via suppression of the enzyme nuclear factor- κ B (NF- κ B).8 The obvious problem with calorie restriction, however, is that humans like food. Recent studies on the effects of the polyphenol com- pound resveratrol (initially isolated from grape skins) on obese, sedentary mice suggested that it could mimic the beneficial health effects of calorie restriction even while the mice continued to eat a high-calorie, high-fat diet and did not exercise. Dietary supplementation with resveratrol was found to oppose the effects of the high-calorie diet in 144 of 153 altered biochemical pathways, most of which could be attributed to its activation of the transcription of the enzyme SIRT-1. Resveratrol increased insulin sensitivity, reduced insulin-like growth factor-1 production, increased adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase, increased peroxi- some proliferator-activated receptor-coactivator-1 (PPAR-1) activity, increased the number of mitochondria, and improved overall motor function.9 Such research suggests that at some future time we just may be able to have our cake, eat it too, and suffer few of the metabolic con- sequences of overeating. Nevertheless, the best current nutritional advice for longevity and health remains simply, “eat less.” Not only does eating fewer calories lower the insulin load, but it activates the transcription of numerous enzymes that promote mitochondrial regeneration, health, and longevity. Nutrigenomics helps elucidate the myriad effects of specific nutri- ents on our genome, as well as helps us rethink and understand the mechanisms by which other nutrients act on our physiology. Ginkgo biloba is a commonly prescribed medicinal herb that is known to increase peripheral microcirculation and to contain rather potent anti- oxidants. The vasodilation allows delivery of these antioxidant com- pounds to poorly vascularized areas, like the brain. Not surprisingly, ginkgo is commonly used for impaired memory and mental func- tion as we age. Using gene chip assays, researchers examined cellular extracts to look for altered levels of messenger RNA, an accurate mea- sure of gene activity. In vitro studies with human bladder cancer cells that were incubated with ginkgo resulted in suppression of gene tran- scription by more than 50% in 16 genes and induction of 139 genes by more than 100%. The overall effect of adding ginkgo was to activate genes that code for improved mitochondrial function and antioxidant protection. Subsequent in vitro mouse studies showed activity of more than 12,000 genes and a preferential activation of genes within the brain, with induction of more than 200% of 43 genes in the cortex and 13 genes in the hippocampus, including those genes that promote nerve cell growth, differentiation, regulation, and function, as well as increased mitochondrial activity and antioxidant protection.10 This elegant research points to a new understanding of why and how herbal medicines or other specific nutrients can act to change our physiology, but it also helps explain why specific herbs or nutrients act preferentially on specific tissues or organ systems. It is not just G. biloba that acts to alter gene transcription. Every medicinal herb, every nutrient, every food, and every pharmaceutical medicine is likely to act in a similar fashion. These compounds do not just have a gross chemical effect on our physiology; they also alter gene expression. Nutrigenomics is forcing us to rethink the ways in which our bod- ies respond to environmental stimuli in the form of food, herbs, or medicine. In some areas, nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics can overlap. We propose the use of the term “preventive genomics” to include both nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics because they cannot always be easily separated. To illustrate, PPAR- γ is a nuclear hormone receptor that regulates many cellular functions, such as nutrient metabolism, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation, in response to dietary macronu- trients, specifically to carbohydrate and fat intake. PPAR- γ integrates the cellular control of energy, lipid, and glucose homeostasis. Its acti- vation by increased dietary fat or sugar intake is clearly an example of nutrigenomic interaction. However, there is a common polymorphism in the gene that codes for PPAR- γ in which an alanine is substituted for a proline at the 12th amino acid in the protein (the polymorphism is referred to as PPAR- γ P12A). Individuals with the 12A variant display a greater metabolic tolerance to a high-fat diet, leading to a signifi- cantly reduced risk of developing insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and central obesity when consuming a typical Western diet.11 Individuals with the 12P variant are more sensitive to the ill effects of excessive dietary saturated fat intake, suggesting a clear therapeutic dietary strategy in P-allele carriers to prevent obesity, dia- betes, and heart disease.12 There are many polymorphisms, like the PPAR- γ proline varia- tion, that exist in a large percentage of the population and appear to increase the risk for certain serious diseases. They beg the question, why do these seemingly harmful polymorphisms exist? It is import- ant to remember that the PPAR- γ proline variation is harmful only in individuals who eat a typical Western diet that is high in calories and saturated fat. It behooves us to remember that in most of nature and for most of human history, too much food to eat was rarely a major risk factor. Quite the opposite was true when food scarcity in winter and famine were common occurrences. In these environments, the ability to extract more nutrition from the same caloric intake would be a distinct advantage for survival. It is only in the past 50 to 100 years in our culture of affluence that these variations have begun to pose significant risks to our health. We call these genes “thrifty genes,” a term first coined by D. L. Coleman to explain why the Pima Indians from the desert of the American Southwest were prone to developing obesity and diabetes. Thousands of years of survival in that harsh envi- ronment selected for genes that made this group incredibly efficient at retaining calories from food—a distinct adaptive advantage when the food supply was scarce. However, with the 24-hour grocery only a car ride away, their genes are significantly less well adapted to survive.13 We see similar gene variations that increase inflammation throughout the body. This seems counterproductive until we realize that infectious disease has been a major environmental risk throughout evolution,

and inflammation and immune activation are essentially the same bio- logical process. It is imperative to remember that every polymorphism that exists in humans with significant prevalence confers protection and advantages to survival in some environment. Our task as clinicians is to identify that environment and to recommend it to those patients with that genetic variation.

# NATURE VERSUS NURTURE

The reality is that the prevention and cure of complex diseases and syn- dromes are not to be found exclusively in our genes or our environment but in the interactive symphony between the two. Nature (our genes) provides a plastic template that is largely adaptable to a wide range of environments (“survival of the most adaptable”), and slight variations in those genes can cause altered responses to specific environments (nutrigenetics). In contrast, nurture (our environment) switches genes on and off, largely controlling gene expression (nutrigenomics). To illustrate this idea of gene–environment interaction, consider the research of Caspi et al.14 They studied variations in the promoter sequence for the gene coding for monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) and found that a promoter polymorphism caused some people to have high-activity MAO-A genes and others to have low-activity genes. Those with high activity MAO-A would deactivate catecholamine neu- rotransmitters, like dopamine and noradrenaline, more rapidly. They then examined whether these genes played a role in antisocial and vio- lent behavior in men who had been abused as children. Remarkably, they found that men with the high-activity MAO-A gene were vir- tually immune to the effects of maltreatment as children, seldom if ever becoming violent offenders, whereas men with the low-activity MAO-A gene were much more antisocial and violent, but only if they themselves were abused as children. In other words, for violent behav- ior to manifest in adulthood, both the low-activity gene (nature) and childhood maltreatment (nurture) needed to be present. If either was missing from the equation, the adult was very likely to be well social- ized and nonviolent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a Gene-Environment Interaction Fact Sheet in August 200015 that out- lines the basic principles of a broad understanding of the causal inter- action of genes and environment in human disease. In it, the CDC makes four main points: 1. Virtually all human diseases result from the interaction of genetic susceptibility and modifiable environmental factors. 2. Variations in genetic makeup are associated with almost all disease. 3. Genetic variations do not cause disease but, rather, influence a per- son’s susceptibility to environmental factors. 4. Genetic information can be used to target interventions. In this brief paper, the CDC essentially outlined the chief tenets of nutrigenetics and of preventive genomics. Ironically, these ideas are hardly new. In 1909 Archibald Garrod16 published Inborn Errors of Metabolism, in which, after identifying the first human disease that behaved as a true mendelian recessive trait (alkaptonuria), he went further to construct a sweeping hypothesis that altered heredity was “the seat of chemical individuality.” “Inborn errors of metabolism,” he wrote, “are due to a failure of a step in the metabolic sequence due to loss or malfunction of an enzyme.” By examining the subtle end products of metabolism, he continued, we should be able to identify the differences that altered heredity pro- duces in each individual. This is a remarkable insight, given that the words gene and genetic did not exist in 1909, and it would be roughly years before the structure and true function of DNA were confirmed. Moreover, Garrod’s book was published 3 years before the first vita- min was discovered, so he would have had no notion of vitamins as cofactors in enzymatic reactions. He concluded his prophetic work by envisioning the complex interaction between our unique genetic con- stitution and environmental factors in the exquisitely simple statement “These idiosyncrasies may be summed up in the proverbial saying that one man’s meat is another man’s poison.”

# THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF NUTRIGENOMICS AND

# NUTRIGENETICS

The point of using genetic and genomic information in a clinical set- ting is to personalize the therapeutic regimen and develop an effec- tive strategy toward true disease prevention. It is a common mistake, however, to think that somehow the new preventive genomic infor- mation we can access will make all previous therapies obsolete. This is evident in the mind-set that thinks we can attribute disease risk to polymorphisms without reference to environment (read any genetic newspaper headline). Simply put, genetic information is no more and no less valuable than environmental information. We need them both to make an optimal difference. Furthermore, at this stage in preventive genomic research, there are, at best, only 100 or so polymorphisms about which we have sufficient clinical information to make person- alized nutritional recommendations.17 Although it is useful informa- tion, it is insufficient for comprehensive nutritional and therapeutic recommendations. Carl Sagan once said, “If you want to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first create the universe.”98 Fortunately for making an apple pie, the universe has already been created, and fortunately for making comprehensive nutritional recommendations, natural selection has been active since the beginning of life on this planet. As humans, we and our ancestors have been adapting to environments for the past 3 billion years, if you want to think of all life, or for a mere 600 million years, if you want to think of eukaryotic cells with aerobic respiration. Either way, it is a lot of experimental trial and error that brought us to the present. The proper starting point of nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics is not necessarily genetics but good epidemiology. Good epidemiology can provide the information necessary to deter- mine the best nutrition and lifestyle for the average person. Specific genetic polymorphisms can help health professionals modify these recommendations to meet the specific genetic needs of an individual patient. Discovering the optimal nutrition and lifestyle for a specific indi- vidual will depend on developing a functional matrix that is minimally composed of the following: 1. Good epidemiological dietary and lifestyle data 2. Specific genomic polymorphisms that alter specific macronutrient and micronutrient requirements 3. Functional laboratory assessment of individual function, physiol- ogy, and micronutrient status In terms of Western diets, the Mediterranean diet is one of the best studied, and from an epidemiological perspective, it is arguably the best for disease prevention and optimal health. It has been demon- strated to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides; to prevent athero- sclerosis and high blood pressure; and to reduce the risk of senility, stroke, heart disease, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and numerous cancers, including those of the breast, prostate, and colon.18 Among elderly Europeans, a Mediterranean diet combined with moderate daily activity and no smoking reduces all-cause mortality by 67%, and switching to this healthier diet and lifestyle at age 70 reduced mortality rates by 50%.19 Clearly, these results are impressive, but the central tenet of preventive genomics is that these risks can be reduced further with the judicious appli- cation of nutrigenetic information gathered from the analysis of individual

polymorphisms. Not all polymorphisms are clinically relevant. Most of our interindividual genetic variation occurs in sections of the DNA that do not actually code for proteins. About 97% of our DNA is either of viral ori- gin, repeats, or simply junk DNA that codes for nothing. To make genomic information clinically useful, polymorphisms must meet four essential cri- teria; they must be relevant, prevalent, modifiable, and measurable. 1. First, the only polymorphisms of clinical interest in the genome are those that exert an effect on some specific aspect of our biochemis- try and physiology (relevant). 2. Second, given our current knowledge of the human genome, only polymorphisms that exist in a substantial portion of a population are likely to be able to be demonstrated in epidemiological and case-controlled studies to be clinically relevant—in essence, we compare polymorphisms that occur in substantial numbers in both groups (prevalent). 3. Third, only polymorphisms whose genetic expression is modifi- able via reasonable clinical intervention are clinically useful. Such an intervention may be any modification of environment, includ- ing diet, lifestyle, and targeted nutraceuticals or pharmaceuticals. Although genes themselves are not modifiable, the phenotype they generate is modifiable via environmental changes because environ- ment turns genes on and off. 4. Finally, because our genes do not themselves change, we must be able to measure changes in our functional physiology to determine that the environmental changes implemented have been effective in modify- ing the phenotypic or physiological expression of our unique genes. For this purpose, functional testing must be available and used in con- junction with genomic testing for polymorphisms (measurable). To illustrate this model of clinical utility, let us consider the exam- ple of the detoxification and antioxidant protection afforded by the enzyme glutathione-S-transferase (GST). High levels of toxins and oxidative stress are associated with numerous degenerative diseases and with the aging process itself. Thus an enzyme like GST that pro- tects against such oxidative damage is highly relevant to our health. The GST polymorphisms have been associated with numerous can- cers in epidemiological and case-control studies.20,21 Although there are several isoforms of GST in the body, the μ isoform, GSTM1, is the most common in the liver. More than 75% of Caucasians and about 25% of Africans exhibit mutations resulting in complete GSTM1 dele- tion.22 Because other isoforms of GST and other antioxidant pathways exist, it is possible to improve antioxidant protection by maintaining a high reduction potential through exogenous avenues, including dietary antioxidants. Furthermore, men and women who lack the GSTM1 gene altogether can increase their serum glutathione levels by 16% and 38%, respectively, and their other GST activity by 6% and 8%, respectively, simply by eating four or more servings of brassica vegetables weekly. Interestingly, individuals possessing a GSTM1 gene showed significantly less benefit.23 Similar benefits were seen from reg- ular brassica vegetable consumption in reducing colorectal cancer by 53%24 and lung cancer in smokers by 70%,25 but again only in indi- viduals lacking the GSTM1 gene. Thus the increased oxidative stress is attenuated by regular brassica vegetable consumption. Finally, we can validate the clinical efficacy of our intervention strategy by measuring functional levels of oxidative stress through any number of simple lab- oratory tests, such as urine lipid peroxides, 8-hydroxy-deoxyguano- sine, serum glutathione, urine, or plasma cysteine/cysteine ratio, for example. The biological effects of our interventions are measurable.

## Personalized Nutrition and Nutrigenetics

Most of the clinically relevant nutrigenomic information available relates to the relationship between polymorphisms with increased chronic disease risk and the dietary therapies and supplements that have been demonstrated to treat the physiological imbalance effec- tively. This is particularly true of SNPs. In as many as one third of genetic polymorphisms, the corresponding enzyme has a decreased binding affinity for a vitamin or mineral coenzyme, resulting in a lower rate of reaction and altered enzyme function (Fig. 15.2). In a series of review articles, Ames26 and Ames et al.27 provided evidence of more than 50 human diseases involving defective enzymes that could be remedied or ameliorated by the administration of higher doses of vitamins or minerals, which at least partially restore enzyme activity. Thus the clinical validity of high-dose nutrient therapy is established but only in genetically susceptible individuals.

## 145CHAPTER 15 Genomics, Nutrigenomics, and the Promise of Personalized Medicine

from more than 84,000 women who were monitored for 14 years, epi- demiology researchers at Harvard University estimated that about 83% of cardiovascular disease could be decreased if everyone ate a reason- ably healthy diet, exercised daily, did not smoke, maintained a nor- mal weight, and drank 1 to 2 alcoholic beverages per day.28 Although these five diet and lifestyle changes seem fairly simple, only 3.1% of the women in the study actually adopted them. Not only is compliance an issue, but epidemiological studies raise deeper philosophical questions because such studies assume that all participants are essentially similar to one another. Are the same therapies equally effective for all indi- viduals? Do all individuals need the same quantities of these diet and lifestyle modifications? Can preventive genomic testing help us indi- vidualize our therapeutic protocols? Let us begin by asking what proportions of carbohydrate, pro- tein, and fat in the diet are the most effective in maintaining normal serum cholesterol levels. Is it a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet as touted by Nathan Pritikin and Dean Ornish? Or perhaps a 40-30-30 (40% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 30% fat), low-calorie “Zone” diet as pro- posed by Barry Sears? Or a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet such as that made popular by Robert Atkins? Logically they cannot all be the best diet for everyone, yet some people swear by each of them as the answer for an optimal diet. There is mounting evidence that optimal macronutrient pro- portions in the diet may be a function of specific polymorphisms. Apolipoprotein-E (Apo-E) is a molecule that mediates the interaction of chylomicron remnants and intermediate-density lipoprotein parti- cles with lipoprotein receptors, including the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and the chylomicron remnant or Apo-E receptor. It has been suggested that Apo-E allelic variation may account for ≤ 7% of the variation in total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations in the gen- eral population.29 There are three variations of the Apo-E gene, known as Apo-E2, Apo-E3, and Apo-E4, and these polymorphic variants are important genetic modifiers of serum lipid responses, which conse- quently may significantly affect an individual’s risk for development of coronary artery disease. (Technically, each of these polymorphisms is a haplotype: two individual SNPs at different points in the Apo-E gene that are linked.) Population studies have shown that plasma LDL-cholesterol levels are highest in subjects carrying the Apo-E4 allele, intermediate in those with the Apo-E3 allele, and lowest in those with the Apo-E2 allele.30 The E3/E3 genotype is the most common in all populations and serves as the benchmark genotype for compari- son with any other possible genotype. The Apo-E4 allele is associated with a moderately increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR] = 1.53 for men and 1.99 for women in one study).31 The increase in the risk of all cardiovascular disease in men carrying the Apo-E4 allele is 63% and is 56% for women.32 Conversely, LDL-cholesterol levels declined with each Apo-E2 allele by 8.8 mg/dL in Hispanics, by 25.6 mg/dL in non-Hispanic white persons, and by 18.1 mg/dL in African Americans.33 The association of the Apo-E4 allele with elevated serum choles- terol levels is greatest in populations that consume diets rich in sat- urated fat and cholesterol compared with other populations. Thus the higher LDL-cholesterol levels observed in people carrying the Apo-E4 allele are manifested primarily in the presence of an athero- genic diet characteristic of Western societies and that the response to dietary saturated fat and cholesterol may differ among individuals with different Apo-E genotypes. Many studies have been conducted to prove this hypothesis.34 Given that each person inherits two alleles, there are six possible genotypes: E2/E2, E2/E3, E3/E3, E2/E4, E3/E4, and E4/E4. In patients with elevated serum total and LDL-cholesterol, the cholesterol- lowering response to a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet increased as the sum of the allele numbers increased (in other words, response improved in the order of the previously listed six geno- types).35,36 Conversely, individuals carrying an E4 allele who ate a high- fat diet were much more likely to have elevated serum cholesterol.37 In contrast, serum triglyceride levels were found to be significantly higher in men, and to a lesser extent in women, who carried an E2 allele. Moreover, the triglyceride levels of individuals with an E2 allele showed a dose-dependent relationship to table sugar consumption, an association not shared with the other genetic variations.38 Dietary sucrose consumption also increased very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and triglycerides in Apo-E2 carriers. In contrast, E3/E3 individuals were found to have the lowest triglyceride levels, and E4 carriers were found to have intermediate levels.39 In another multiethnic study, plasma triglyceride levels were inversely correlated with the number of Apo-E4 alleles (175, 159, and 143 mg/dL with 0, 1, and 2 alleles, respectively).40 Another study found E4 carriers to have elevations in triglycerides, but only those who consumed alcohol regu- larly.41 A study of Turkish men who did not consume alcohol found no elevated triglyceride values in E4 carriers.42 The most effective dietary therapy to lower triglycerides is restricting carbohydrate, especially sugar, consumption. Because Apo-E2 men are prone to significant triglyceride elevations and their levels are less sensitive to dietary fat intake, a lower-carbohydrate, higher-protein, higher-fat diet may be therapeutically desirable for them. Individuals with the E3/E3 genotype are moderately affected by dietary fat intake but tend to have lower triglyceride levels than the other genotypes. In one study, individuals with high cholesterol and triglyceride values were treated with a short-term (7-day) very low- calorie juice fast (208 calories/day), and their responses were stratified by Apo-E genotype.43 Only E3/E3 individuals experienced signifi- cant improvement in all parameters, experiencing reductions in LDL cholesterol by 10% and in triglyceride values by 18%. In these indi- viduals, it is tempting to speculate that the low-calorie, moderate 40-30-30 carbohydrate-protein-fat ratio “Zone” diet might be more effective in treating both hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceri- demia, although no clinical trials to validate this hypothesis have yet been published. Also, in this trial, E2 carriers experienced a 31% drop in LDL levels but a 15% increase in triglyceride levels, lending some additional support for the carbohydrate-sensitive triglyceride hypoth- esis. E4 carriers had an opposite response to E2 carriers: a dramatic reduction of triglyceride levels by 49% but a rise in LDL levels by 13% while eating only 200 calories/day. Other dietary interventions that affected cholesterol levels were fiber and alcohol. High intake of soluble fiber (5.7 g/day) reduced LDL cholesterol by 6.6% and 5.6%, respectively, in E3 and E4 allele carri- ers but had little effect on E2 carriers.44 Similarly, a study of Korean patients with coronary artery disease found that replacing white rice with whole grains produced the greatest benefit in E3/E3 individuals (12% reduction in triglyceride, 8% reduction in LDL cholesterol, and 8% increase in high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol levels), as well as moderate benefit in E4 carriers (including a 15% increase in HDL cholesterol values), but there was absolutely no effect on cho- lesterol levels in E2 carriers.45 Thus a high-fiber diet may be clinically most useful for E3/E3 individuals, modestly useful for E4 carriers, but not useful for E2 carriers. The modest consumption (1–2 drinks) of alcohol daily has been shown epidemiologically to be extremely protective against coronary artery disease in the general population. However, Apo-E genotyping reveals that the benefits are not the same for everyone. In a comparison of nondrinkers with drinkers of alcohol, women who were drinkers had lower cholesterol (total and LDL) than women who did not drink, regardless of Apo-E genotype. In men, however, Apo-E2 carriers who were drinkers had lower cholesterol, but Apo-E4 carriers had higher

cholesterol, and alcohol consumption had no significant effect for Apo-E3/E3 individuals.46 It is worth observing that moderate exercise, although not dietary therapy, was found to be effective in improving serum lipids in E2 and E3 genotypes but not in E4 carriers.47 In another study, high- intensity physical exercise was most effective in E4 carriers.48 Thus E2 and E3 carriers may benefit from modest daily exercise, but for an individual with an E4 allele to benefit from exercise, that exercise must be high intensity. Similarly, knowledge of Apo-E genotype may allow for a more discriminating and more effective use of targeted pharmaceuticals for patients with lipid abnormalities. Statin drugs exhibited a greater cholesterol-lowering effect in Apo-E2 carriers, followed by Apo-E3/E3, with less effectiveness for Apo-E4 carriers. Apo-E2 carriers also showed a better response to gemfibrozil and cholestyramine than the other genotypes. The greatest cholesterol-lowering effects for Apo-E4 car- riers came from probucol, a potent antioxidant.31 However, although statins had a weaker cholesterol-lowering effect in Apo-E4 carriers, statins were most protective in preventing a second heart attack in men with an E4 allele. Statin use reduced the risk of a second heart attack in E4 carriers by 64% compared with only 33% for other genotypes, even though statins reduced LDL cholesterol levels least in Apo-E4 genotypes.49 More prospective clinical trials are needed to fully elucidate the optimal therapeutic dietary interventions to protect against coronary artery disease in individuals based on their Apo-E genotype status. However, distinct patterns are beginning to emerge in terms of dietary and lifestyle management for the treatment of coronary artery disease; these are summarized in Table 15.1. Other variants within the Apo-E gene locus have also been investi- gated in relation to the association with lipid phenotypes and response to dietary intervention. Evidence suggests that variability in the Apo-E promoter region is associated, independently of the traditional E2, E3, and E4 alleles, with plasma lipid levels,50 dietary response,51–53 and car- diovascular disease risk.54 Apo-E polymorphisms are the best studied in terms of their asso- ciation with atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease, but other polymorphisms exert similar effects. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is responsible for the transfer of insoluble cholesteryl esters from HDL to other lipoproteins.55 The Taq1B polymorphisms of the CETP gene result in increased CETP levels, with impaired ability to remove cholesterol from the cells and the bloodstream. The Taq1B polymorphism occurs with lower HDL cholesterol levels and an increased risk of development of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.56,57 In one study, individuals who were homozygous for the Taq1B polymorphism had larger reductions in LDL and VLDL levels through eating a low-fat diet with a high ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated dietary fat.58 Furthermore, daily moderate alcohol consump- tion raised HDL levels substantially but only in individuals with the CETP polymorphism.59,60 E-selectin (SELE) is a glycoprotein molecule that adheres circulat- ing neutrophils to the endothelial lining of blood vessels. E-selectin is expressed on the surface of endothelial cells after stimulation by inflammatory mediators (mediated by NF- κ B). Several polymor- phisms in the SELE gene increase adhesion activity of E-selectin, dra- matically increasing the risk of atherosclerosis and premature coronary artery disease.61,62 The primary therapeutic aim for carriers of a SELE polymorphism is to decrease NF- κ B stimulation, in turn reducing SELE expression. Maintaining high antioxidant potential has been shown to decrease NF- κ B activation.63,64 Thus higher levels of dietary antioxidants and possibly supplemental antioxidants may be beneficial. The proin- flammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor- α and interleukin-1 also increase NF- κ B activation. Antioxidants, fish oil,65 and milk this- tle (silymarin) supplementation have each been shown to suppress interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor- α production directly and would therefore lower NF- κ B activation. The MLXIPL gene codes for carbohydrate-responsive ele- ment-binding protein (ChREBP). This protein is a transcription fac- tor that binds and activates carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) motifs in the promoter regions of genes responsible for triglyceride synthesis and glycolysis in the liver. Thus ChREBP appears to play a major role in determining fasting triglyceride levels in the blood. Additionally, the MLXIPL gene is one of about 26 genes that is deleted in Williams–Beuren syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder with several cardiovascular defects. A SNP in the MLXIPL gene (specifically, the C allele of the G771C polymorphism) shows a strong association with elevated triglyceride levels (OR = 1.29 per copy of the C allele for triglyceride levels >1.7 mmol/L). Median triglyceride levels are 2.07, 1.96 and 1.75 mmol/L for the C/C genotype, C/G genotype, and G/G genotype, respectively.66 Conversely, the G allele of the G771C polymorphism is protective against several cardiovascular risk factors.67 The G allele is associated with lower triglyceride levels (−9.86 mg/dL per G allele; OR for hyper- lipidemia = 0.73). Furthermore, stronger adherence to a Mediterranean diet enhances the triglyceride-lowering effect of the G allele (OR = 0.63), and this protection is attenuated when the adherence is low (OR = 0.88). The Mediterranean diet also significantly lowered the risk of cardiovascular pathology in carriers of the G allele more so than in C/C homozygotes on the same diet (hazard ratio = 0.34) and compared with carriers of the G allele who were not on the Mediterranean diet (whose hazard ratio = 0.90).68

The SERPINE1 gene (formerly known as PAI-1) codes for plas- minogen activator inhibitor-1. This protein is a member of the serpin family and inhibits both the tissue-type and urokinase-type plasmin- ogen activators. Plasminogen activators are responsible for the con- version of plasminogen to plasmin, which, in turn, degrades fibrin. Thus plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 appears to play a major role in determining the proliferative response to vascular injury by inhibiting the degradation of fibrin and several extracellular matrix proteins by plasmin. A SNP in the SERPINE1 gene called the rs6950982 polymorphism is associated with higher levels of several lipids in the blood. People who carry the G allele have higher total cholesterol (A/A: 208, A/G: 210, G/G: 218 mg/dL), higher LDL cholesterol (A/A: 127, A/G: 131, G/G: 136 mg/dL), and higher triglycerides (A/A: 131, A/G: 128, G/G: 154 mg/dL) in the blood. Additionally, men who carry the G allele have higher systolic blood pressure (A/A + A/G: 141.4 mm Hg vs. G/G: 149.8 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (A/A: 81.5, A/G: 82.1, G/G: 85.7 mm Hg). Both men and women with the G/G genotype respond well to the Mediterranean diet for controlling triglyceride levels ( ∼ 175 mg/dL in the lower-adherence group vs. ∼ 125 mg/dL in the higher- adherence group).69

## Electrolytes and Hypertension

Hypertension is an independent risk factor for coronary artery dis- ease and for stroke. The therapeutic response to sodium restriction in hypertensive individuals is highly variable. A SNP in the angiotensino- gen gene (AGT) allows an amino acid substitution in which threonine (T) replaces methionine (M) at amino acid 235. The T allele is asso- ciated with increased production of angiotensin, with a tendency for higher blood pressure. There is a stepwise increase of serum AGT from MM to MT to TT genotypes among persons with hypertension70 and those with normal blood pressure.71 Although there have been some discrepancies between studies, a meta-analysis of all studies published between 1992 and 1996 showed the 235T allele had a consistent, mild association with hypertension (OR = 1.20), a positive family history of hypertension (OR = 1.42), and more severe hypertension (OR = 1.34).72 A more recent study (2016) puts the risk of hypertension in carriers of two copies of the 235T allele at an OR of 1.8.73 The 235T allele of the AGT gene is associated with greater blood pressure decreases than the 235M allele after an intervention to reduce sodium intake (>5 mg/day).74 Persons with the TT and MT genotypes showed significant systolic blood pressure reductions when consuming mineral salt compared with control subjects (P < 0.02 and P < 0.001, respectively), but persons with the MM genotype did not (P < 0.10). The net adjusted systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction was –8.6 mm Hg systolic/–3.9 mm Hg diastolic for persons with the TT genotype, –9.0/–5.2 mm Hg for those with the MT genotype, and –5.3/–1.0 mm Hg for the MM genotype. Aerobic exercise was effective in reducing blood pressure but only in the MM (–3.7 mm Hg) and MT (–3.4 mm Hg) genotypes, and not in the TT (–0.4 mm Hg) individuals, among 477 previously sedentary white Americans.75 Finally, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors produced more dramatic reductions in blood pressure in 235T allele carriers (TT and MT) than in the MM genotype,76,77 illus- trating the notion that diverse modifications in “environment” (diet, exercise, targeted pharmaceuticals) may produce similar alterations in phenotype (in this case, blood pressure) among genetically susceptible individuals.

## Homocysteine and Micronutrients

As mentioned previously, one common physiological effect of SNPs is a decreased binding affinity of a vitamin or mineral coenzyme for the structurally altered enzyme. There is mounting evidence that in most cases, the diminished rate of reaction of that polymorphic enzyme can increase with high-dose cofactor micronutrient supplementa- tion.78 Perhaps the best-studied example of this model is the enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), which is respon- sible for remethylating homocysteine into methionine, allowing meth- ylation reactions to occur efficiently in the body. When methylation reactions are impaired, plasma homocysteine levels rise (Fig. 15.3). Elevated homocysteine values have been associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis,79 risk of early coronary artery disease,80,81 increased risk of hemostasis and venous thrombosis,82,83 decreased bone density,84 neural tube defects, spina bifida,85,86 Alzheimer’s dis- ease, macular degeneration, hearing loss,87 and acute leukemia in adults.88 The risk of heart disease increases for heterozygotes as well as for 677T/T homozygotes.89 Folic acid and vitamins B 2 (as fla- vin adenine dinucleotide [FAD]), B 6 , and B 12 are all cofactors in the methylation cycle, and a dietary deficiency of any of these vitamins can result in elevated homocysteine levels. However, elevated homo- cysteine levels can also result from two common polymorphisms in MTHFR: a 677C-T nucleotide substitution and a 1298A-C nucleotide substitution. Someone with a 677T/T genotype has a 50% reduction in MTHFR enzyme activity, whereas a 1298C/C genotype has a 32% reduction. In one study, approximately 28% of patients with elevated homocysteine did not respond to supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B 12 , and vitamin B 6 because they had the 677T/T genotype dietary folateDHF DHFR THF MTHFD1 MTHFR MTRR methionine MAT SAM SAH SAH hydrolase homocysteine methylation of downstream targets, e.g. DNA 5.10-methylene THF 5.10-methyl THF purine synthesis

and severely impaired MTHFR activity.90 It is worth noting that the 677C-T polymorphism occurs in the FAD site of MTHFR, suggesting that vitamin B 2 supplementation may be a critical component.91 Three rational therapeutic strategies may help resolve elevated homocysteine levels. First is high-dose supplementation of the vita- min cofactors of MTHFR, which relies on the simple logic of the law of mass action in a chemical reaction: higher concentrations of sub- strates drive the chemical reaction forward. Second, the metabolic products of the MTHFR enzyme, namely, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, may be supplemented. Third, alternate remethylation pathways may be stimulated by supplementing trimethylglycine or betaine as alter- nate methyl-group donors. Considering the low cost and high degree of safety associated with each of these options, all three strategies may be employed simultaneously. Regardless, serial plasma homocysteine measurements allow the practitioner to determine whether the therapy employed has been successful. Although the science of nutrigenomics is still in its infancy, sev- eral principles have become clear, with an enormous potential impact for clinical medicine. Nutrients act as dietary signals that alter gene expression (nutrigenomics). In individuals with specific polymor- phisms, their specific genetic variation may render that individual more or less sensitive to specific nutrients or environmental stimuli and, therefore, may help determine optimal diet and lifestyle (nutri- genetics). Knowing the effects of these environmental stimuli on gene expression allows us to use this information proactively to alter gene expression and to mitigate risk for developing various forms of chronic disease, like cardiovascular disease. These principles of nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics hold true for macronutrient balance in the diet and for micronutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes. Although our primary focus here has been on nutrient– gene interactions, the same principles hold true for lifestyle changes and targeted pharmaceuticals. Nutritional intervention is merely a more specific application of environmental modification to alter gene expression. What should be clear is that as our knowledge of gene–gene and gene–environment interactions increases, so too will our capacity for delivery of increasingly personalized and primary prevention.

# GENOMIC TESTING

<!-- chunk -->

## From Early Detection to Prevention

We use the term susceptibility gene to refer to a polymorphism that may render an individual more susceptible to the development of a chronic disease when exposed to an adverse environment. Most susceptibility genes have a low positive predictive value (the probability that a disease will develop in a person with a positive test result) and a low attribut- able risk (the proportion of cases of a disease that can be attributed to a susceptibility gene).92 Therefore some researchers have questioned the clinical utility of susceptibility genetic testing,93 but such arguments, by applying a single-gene/single-disease model to susceptibility genes, miss the clinical relevance. Susceptibility genes, much like taking a family history, must be seen as important but incomplete contributors in what is invariably a multifactorial risk assessment. In terms of health outcomes, preventive genomic polymorphisms raise risk modestly and are additive in their effects (gene–gene interactions), and their actual phenotype expression is strongly affected by diet, lifestyle, and envi- ronment (gene–environment interactions). Rather than negate their clinical utility because of a low positive predictive value and a low attributable risk, these polymorphisms begin to offer a molecular basis for understanding the pathophysiology of complex multifactorial dis- eases, and an understanding of the environmental factors that affect gene expression begins to evoke effective therapeutic strategies. Because environment is broadly understood to refer to anything outside the genome itself, therapeutic regimens may be constructed to include any portion of the environment that has been shown to affect gene expression and phenotype. This is truly a holistic approach because effective therapeutic strategies may involve diet, nutritional, and targeted pharmaceutical supplementation; lifestyle and behavioral modification; and the avoidance or elimination of toxins, xenobiot- ics, and microbes. Intervention at any level of our “environment” may prove clinically beneficial. Functional medicine is the clinical discipline designed to promote health, to anticipate and prevent disease, or to correct an existing dis- ease by improving physiological function. The underlying assumption is that health and disease lie on the same continuum, and the con- necting thread of the continuum is physiological function. Before the manifestation of any frank disease, a progressive loss of homeostasis and increasing dysfunction occur. Clinical intervention in this strategy may begin at the earliest signs of imbalance.94 The promise of preven- tive genomics is that the point of effective intervention may begin even earlier, before the beginnings of physiological dysfunction.

## Clinical Challenges

Preventive and nutritional genomic testing in clinical practice has its critics, who predominantly argue that there are insufficient numbers of clinical trials to demonstrate the diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy of genomic profiles.95 However, rather than demonstrating that all prege- nomic testing is “premature and scientifically unsound,” as suggested by Dr. Muin Khoury of the CDC,96 such objections merely underscore the perspective shared here. Namely, it is precisely because chronic dis- ease is multifactorial with complex gene–gene and gene–environment interactions that the diagnostic and therapeutic utility of preventive genomic testing must meet the four criteria of being relevant, prev- alent, modifiable, and measurable. The last criterion, measurable, is critical at this early stage of preventive genomic testing. We must be able to measure beneficial phenotypic, physiological changes in indi- viduals that result from the therapeutic strategy employed. There will always remain a possibility that other genetic polymorphisms or other environmental influences that we have not yet identified may also affect an individual’s disease risk. A similar cautionary argument should be made in cases in which current genomic knowledge offers conflicting therapeutic advice. A man with an Apo-E4 allele presumably should not drink alcohol, but what if he also has a CETP Taq1B polymorphism for which alcohol has been shown to boost HDL cholesterol levels dramatically? At present, the answer is unknown. Fortunately, because fractionated lipid levels are easily measurable, the effects of moderate, daily alcohol intake on such a specific individual’s lipid profile may be easily ascertained. Thus medicine must ultimately be empirical, relying on trial and error until the desired result (e.g., lower serum cholesterol) is achieved.

## Bioethical Considerations: Opportunities and Potential

<!-- chunk -->

## for Discrimination

Genetic information, because it represents an unchangeable state, has the potential, at least in theory, to be used in a manner by insur- ers, employers, and society at large. However, it should be noted that the paradigm for such discrimination views genetic information as representing an individual’s immutable limitations, as typified by single-gene diseases (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease, Huntington’s disease, sickle cell anemia). A fundamental cornerstone of preventive genomics is the idea that the phenotypic outcome of any unique genotype is modifiable through environmental change. Preventive genomic testing, rather than reveal- ing an individual’s genetic limitations, more accurately reflects an

individual’s genetic potential, given the right environment. Genetic polymorphisms have the potential to guide an individual to adopt the appropriate dietary, lifestyle, and environmental changes that can opti- mize health and longevity. Now that we know there are irrefutable connections between genes and environment, and we are learning their myriad effects on health and disease, ignorance is no longer ethically neutral. Choosing not to use genomic information in treating patients, now that its health implications are being effectively documented, is ethically untenable. For the first time in the history of medicine, preventive genomic test- ing allows us to assess individual risk for the development of chronic diseases, to develop comprehensive risk-reduction strategies before imbalances in homeostasis occur, and to institute optimal therapy interventions for patients who are already sick. This new personalized medicine, made possible by the advent of preventive genomics and nutrigenomics, offers practitioners and patients new opportunities for the prevention and treatment of disease and for the promotion of opti- mal health.


Preventive genomic testing exploring both nutrigenomics and nutri- genetics is both new and exciting. It affords practitioners both novel and effective avenues to develop personalized therapeutic regimens and to promote optimal disease-prevention strategies. Although what we know is dwarfed by what we do not know, this imbalance does not negate the current therapeutic power that the past 20 years of genomic research has revealed. We agree with the following assertions made by Loktionov97: • There are many examples of effective research on gene–environ- ment interactions. • There is sufficient evidence to make clinical recommendations on the basis of individualized genomic predisposition. • There is a need for research on traits that protect from, as well as predispose to, disease. • Environment modification, especially dietary changes, may be the easiest and most efficient way to influence the risks of many dis- eases common today. It is little wonder that Paul Berg, the pioneering researcher in recombinant DNA and genetic engineering and the winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1980, once quipped, “At the time, our goal was to focus on the molecular and genetic basis of disease as the starting point for new forms of medicine.”99 However, it is equally true to say that all disease is environmental even when it is also genetic. The symphony between nature and nurture is the very essence of life and health for all creatures who call this Earth their home.

## 151CHAPTER 16 Hair Mineral Analysis

useless.28 Moreover, even when an altered HA pattern has been associ- ated with a disease, generally there are few investigations as to whether mineral supplementation would affect the clinical condition or even revert the hair mineral pattern to normal. Several studies have looked at the relationship between diet and hair mineral status.49,92–96,51 with varying conclusions. Some showed some dietary influences on hair mineral status,93–95,96,97 one showed no correlation,95 and another showed variable correlation.97 Not all hair minerals showed a relation- ship to intake, and many of the studies had limitations because of a limited time of reporting nutrient intake. Hair grows approximately 1.5 cm per month, so the hair sample usually contains mineral content outside of the nutrient reporting time. Growth rate also varies with ethnicity.98 One study tested hair grown in a 2-year period and found a correlation between low hair Ca, Mg, Sr, and BA and an increased presence of hypertension.51 Gender has been found to result in signifi- cant differences in hair minerals,99,100 which can complicate the inter- pretation of test results. “Levels of elements in the hair are not strictly comparable between different areas of the world.”101 Wide overlap of values in disease and control groups is frequently the case with HA, resulting in excessive false-positive and false-negative results. For example, mentally retarded patients have been found to have hair lead, sodium, and potassium hair values approximately twice those of controls,19 but the standard deviations are extremely large for some minerals (for sodium, 1644.71 ± 1814.93 versus 744.43 ± 198728; and for potassium, 870.15 ± 1009.19 versus 408.35 ± 689.99), and the large overlap greatly reduces the clinical use of HA. In addition, many of the altered HA patterns associated with the diseases previously listed are as yet unconfirmed.

# MINERALS

## Calcium and Magnesium

Hair calcium and magnesium values were found to be elevated in patients with fibromyalgia,102 and another study found decreased levels along with iron and manganese.59 Higher levels of calcium and magnesium were seen in amblyopic children.61 Chronic stress in children had an association with elevated Ca/Mg ratios.103 High hair calcium content has been associated with a reduced risk of cor- onary heart disease,104 although higher levels were found in hyper- tensive, obese patients with insulin resistance.49 Higher hair calcium was associated with an enhanced augmentation index, a measure of arterial stiffness.105 Low hair calcium content has been found in the last trimester of pregnancy,106 and hair calcium content increased in response to supplementation during pregnancy.107 Low hair mag- nesium levels have been reported in autistic children, children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, patients with various skin disorders, and patients with several types of leukemia, whereas high levels have been reported in conjunction with dyslexia and Prader– Willi syndrome.18,23,28,108–110 An increase in the Ca/Mg ratio seemed to correlate to increased insulin resistance.55 In contrast, another study saw a decrease in hair calcium and magnesium in metabolic syndrome.56 A decrease in the Ca/Mg ratio was seen in Parkinson’s disease.73 The meaning of these associations remains unknown for the most part, and contrasting findings make interpretation and use- fulness questionable. A 2001 study concluded that analysis of hair calcium and phos- phorus content was of value as a complementary detection tool in abnormalities of bone metabolism.111 Elevations in both calcium and magnesium were correlated with a low dietary calcium/mag- nesium ratio in one study, suggesting that this finding may be indicative of an induced hyperparathyroidism,112 but that hypoth- esis remains unproven. Hair calcium and magnesium also vary in response to the hardness and pH of the water in which the hair is usually washed.104 Water consumption from different sources was reported to change hair calcium and magnesium levels; higher hair levels correlated to an increased risk of kidney stone formation.113 Supplementation of dietary magnesium has been reported to increase hair magnesium levels in deficient children.114 Nonetheless, in one study of congenital hypomagnesemia, researchers concluded that hair magnesium level was not a useful tool in monitoring min- eral status because the values were higher in affected subjects than in subjects who were not deficient.115 A 2013 study showed that a high hair calcium level was associated with low calcium intake and low bone mineral density.44 There is limited evidence to support the use of hair calcium and magnesium measurements in clinical diagnosis at this time.

## Chromium

Hair chromium content is low in insulin-dependent diabetics,30 although there is much overlap with normal persons. Increased insulin resistance was associated with lower hair chromium,55,58 Chromium levels decrease with age,32 but the meaning of this change remains unknown. Hair and tissue chromium levels vary greatly during pregnancy, being very high during the first few months of normal pregnancy and subsequently decreasing.116,117 Late in pregnancy, hair chromium content typically becomes low,118 sug- gesting deficiency.76 However, high hair chromium value in preg- nancy is associated with low-birth-weight infants.119 In patients with gestational diabetes, hair chromium content is high early in pregnancy but decreases in late pregnancy.117 Increasing dietary intake of chromium has been linked to increasing hair chromium values,120 but supplemental chromium does not seem to alter hair levels.116,121 Chromium was found to be higher in patients with a fixed orthodontic appliance. The range of amounts was 8.94 ± 13.1 μ g, although the mean was stated to be above the 90th percentile.122 Although normal and deficiency ranges should be more clearly defined, hair chromium content appears to have potential future use in clinical settings. However, current knowledge remains inadequate to help clinicians treat patients on the basis of abnormal hair chromium levels alone.

## Copper

Oral contraceptive use is associated with decreased hair copper and increased serum copper.123 High hair copper levels are associated with being female, lactation, idiopathic scoliosis, and pregnancy in some but not all studies.124–127 Surprisingly, conditions that affect systemic copper status have been shown not to affect hair levels. Copper defi- ciency,128 Wilson disease,129,130 and cirrhosis131 do not significantly alter hair copper content. Hair copper levels also vary with geograph- ical location.132 However, fur and liver copper values have been found to correlate in rats,131 and one study reported that supplemental cop- per raises hair copper levels.133 Hair color also has been found to influ- ence the levels of copper in the hair.127,134 At this time, hair copper measurement appears unreliable for clin- ical application.124

## Manganese

Levels of hair manganese in mothers of infants with congenital malformations and their offspring were significantly lower in one study,14 which suggest that maternal hair manganese levels may be used as an indicator of the risk for malformations. Hair manganese was inversely associated with working memory in children135 but found not to correlate with developmental scores.136 Both nonsig- nificantly altered137 and normal levels of manganese138 have been

reported in patients with epilepsy.137 Hair manganese values have been reported to be elevated in people with violent behavior, with varying levels of significance.138,139 Manganese was lower in fibromy- algia,59 in children with amblyopia,61 and in rheumatoid arthritis.140 Evidence that manganese supplementation affects behavior does not appear to exist at present. Hair manganese may serve as a useful research tool in the study of altered behavior, but the most promising value of hair manganese may lie in the prediction of congenital malformations.

## Selenium

Levels of selenium in well water and hair show good correlation.141 High hair selenium levels are seen in toxicity142,143 and hyperlipid- emia,144 and low levels are seen in deficiency.145 Low hair selenium values have been reported in babies with neural tube defects and their mothers.15 Selenium appears to be transferred transplacentally as mea- sured by hair analysis.146 Lower selenium was seen in patients with phe- nylketonuria,147 cancer,63,67,68 bipolar disease,71 and steatohepatitis.148 Tissue selenium values reflect short-term variations in intake,82 and hair levels of the element rise significantly after supplementation.149,150 As with chromium, insufficient data are currently available to establish reliable norms for measurement of hair selenium values, and the incidence of false-positive and false-negative results remains unknown. Hair selenium measurement shows promise for clinical use when these problems are resolved, although they haven’t been as of this writing.

## Sodium and Potassium

It is generally accepted, even by proponents of HA, that hair sodium and potassium do not reflect dietary status. High elevations of hair sodium may be diagnostic in cystic fibrosis31 but require confirma- tion. A relatively low Na/K ratio has been reported in celiac disease.151 Although many HA advocates cite low hair sodium and potassium as indicative of “adrenal exhaustion,” the only (preliminary) study exploring this subject reported that hair sodium and potassium do not correlate with adrenal function.152 There have not been any sub- sequent studies. Except for cystic fibrosis, hair sodium and potassium appear to hold little promise for clinical use.

## Zinc

Hair zinc levels have received more research attention than any other mineral. Low hair zinc has been associated with zinc deficiency, anorexia nervosa, hyperactivity, gender, age, atherosclerosis, beta-thal- assemia, vegetarianism, lung cancer, leukemia, celiac disease, epilepsy in males, epilepsy in general, short stature in childhood, poverty, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, neural tube defects, Alzheimer’s disease,46 hypertension,48 atopic dermatitis,153 breast cancer,153 schizo- phrenia,72 hypertension,154 prostate cancer,67 liver cancer,150 poor growth in children,155 and during pregnancy.17,29,32,108,156–174 It also has been reported in neonates if the time between pregnancies is short.175 High hair zinc was associated with low serum zinc in Kashin–Beck disease.175 Because a few of these conditions have been associated with poten- tial zinc deficiencies and supplemental zinc has been shown to increase hair zinc levels,154 practitioners who use HA often rely on hair zinc as an indicator of zinc status. However, one trial reported that hair zinc levels declined after supplementation.107,156,157,168,176,177 Other factors that affect hair zinc levels also interfere with the clinical use of this tool. Shampooing and dyeing affect hair zinc lev- els,178 as do the sex of the subject,178–182 age,127 and hair growth rate. Malnourished children have shown both low171,183,184 and high185 hair zinc. Poor correlations between hair zinc and height,187 weight, and zinc consumption also have been reported,133,179 although one study reported a correlation among hair zinc, weight, and zinc consump- tion.186 Another study found that obese people of both sexes had higher hair zinc than those of normal weight and that there was a correlation between the degree of obesity and higher hair zinc levels.187 Although low hair zinc levels have been reported in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,176 there is generally considerable overlap between cases and controls. To further complicate the picture, in a study of female descendants of noninsulin-dependent (NIDDM) parents, hair zinc was found to be significantly higher compared with women with no family history of NIDDM.188 At this time there is no definitive understanding of the meaning of abnormal hair zinc levels. The hypothesis that high hair zinc levels reflect acute deficiency, whereas low levels indicate chronic deficiency, remains unproven.

## Other Minerals

Hair iron was found to correlate positively with serum ferritin189 and other laboratory markers of iron status,190 although the clin- ical relevance of this finding is unclear.191 Hair lithium has been reported to show a linear response to extradietary sources.13 Low hair levels of lithium also have been reported in conjunction with heart disease, learning disability, and violent behavior.13 However, research findings are far from the point at which hair lithium could be used to help clinicians diagnose or treat these conditions.13 It is suggested that whole-body iodine status can be assessed with HA.192

# DRUG ABUSE

HA has been used to detect drugs of abuse and their metabolites when urine tests were negative.76,78 Hair analysis has been used as evidence in a court of law concerning past drug abuse.77 Although there are concerns about the role of HA in testing for drug abuse,193 HA does seem to be a valuable tool in drug screening.79–82,194 As mentioned, drug metabolites and not mineral levels are measured in these trials, and drug metabolites typically are not reported on most commercially available hair analyses.

# RATIOS

The experimental documentation for most of the “ideal” ratios that have been published by several HA companies has not been substantiated in the research literature. The Zn/Cu ratio has been reported to be altered in violent patients.139 This ratio was also elevated in survivors of myocardial infarcts.195 Ca/Mg ratios were elevated in insulin resistance55 and stress102 coronary artery cal- cification.196 Strong correlations between several mineral ratios and atherosclerosis also have been reported197; however, the clin- ical significance of these ratios is not known. The Mg/Zn ratios helped separate healthy (<1/1) from epileptic (>1/1) subjects in one study.165

# DISCUSSION

Hair mineral analysis is conceptually enticing and potentially a valu- able clinical tool. However, problems abound with standardization of sampling, handling, and analysis of hair samples.86,87 Additionally, reference values can differ widely,198,199,10,200 and many variables affect the results.201

## 153CHAPTER 16 Hair Mineral Analysis

This is further aggravated by the reporting of different results on the same sample from different laboratories.87,202,90,7 The distribution of elements within the lipid and nonlipid portions of hair and the treat- ment of the sample before testing may explain these variances.5,203,8 As noted, dietary intakes do not consistently correlate with hair levels, and hair color, sex, age, and other variables appear to significantly affect levels of some minerals. Separate norms for age, gender, and hair color are now being established.127,204,205,99 However, reviews of the litera- ture attempting to establish reference values continue to show a large variance in mean values, standard deviations, and ranges.132,206,57,91 Although many laboratories make nutritional recommendations, there is no basis for the nutritional advice suggested by some labora- tories. See Box 16-1. Several studies have concluded a diagnostic value of HA53,64,105,69,192,70 in specific circumstances. However, to date, there haven’t been additional studies validating the results of these studies, which reduces the power of their conclusions. As a result of the gulf between available information on the one hand and the clinical interest of some practitioners on the other, several articles have appeared decrying the misuses of HA.86,87,207–209 Hambidge208 has said, “There is a wide gulf between the limited and mainly tentative justification for their use on an individual basis and the current exploitation of multielement chemical analysis of human hair.” Klevay and associates210 acknowledge the experimental usefulness of HA but go on to say that “its use in clinical medicine for diagno- sis, prognosis, and therapy will remain limited until validation by the standard methods of clinical investigation is achieved.” Steindel and Howanitz209 conclude the following: Physicians and other health care professionals who are consider- ing ordering hair analysis to assess nutritional status or who are basing nutritional counseling or therapy on hair analysis should reconsider this approach unless and until the reliability of hair analysis value is established and evidence becomes available that clinical recommendations based on hair analysis improve patient outcomes. Even though these comments are over a decade old, the conclu- sions are still pertinent. The accumulated results of several hundreds of studies do not warrant the use of HA as an independent diagnostic tool. The widespread use of speculative diagnostic procedures invites condemnation, especially when the burden of these speculations falls on the pocketbook and psyche of the patient. HA is a valid and useful screening tool for toxic metal exposure (lead, mercury, cadmium, arse- nic, and selenium) and drugs of abuse. It has the potential of becoming a clinical tool of considerable use in other areas. The current non- standardization of laboratory procedures is more likely to hinder this development than to help it.

## 155CHAPTER 17 Heidelberg pH Capsule Gastric Analysis

<!-- chunk -->

## Methods

The test can be conducted in two ways: the tethered capsule repeat challenge and the flow-through method. Each gives different infor- mation and has its advantages and disadvantages. For both proce- dures, the test begins after the patient has fasted (food and liquid) for 8 hours.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Tethered Capsule Repeat Challenge

In the tethered capsule repeat challenge, the capsule is tethered so that it remains in the stomach while the stomach is challenged by the inges- tion of a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (i.e., baking soda).8 The challenge solution triggers a rise in stomach pH and a subse- quent attempt by the parietal cells to reestablish appropriate acidity. The majority of people have a normal initial pH of between 1 and 2.3. Abnormalities of stomach secretions are usually found only after the stomach is challenged. (A more involved protocol can be found in Wright.8) The procedure is as follows: 1. The waistband antenna is fastened around the patient’s waist, and the receiver/recorder is turned on and calibrated. 2. The patient swallows the capsule, which is attached to a 1-m-long, thin cotton thread (a small amount of distilled water is allowed). The pH reading typically starts at 7 and falls toward 1. After about 5 minutes, the capsule reaches the bottom of the stomach (which normally displays a pH of between 1 and 2), and the remaining thread is taped to the cheek to prevent movement of the capsule out of the stomach and into the intestine. 3. If the fasting pH is normal, the patient swallows the first challenge of 5 mL of the alkaline solution. Within 30 seconds, the pH nor- mally rises to 7, and the patient is asked to lie down on his or her left side (to keep the stomach contents in as long as possible). 4. If stomach function is normal and acid is secreted sufficiently in response to the alkali challenge, the pH returns to normal (between 1 and 2) within 20 minutes. 5. The challenge is repeated up to four times, as long as the response time is within 20 minutes.

<!-- chunk -->

## Flow-Through Capsule

In the procedure for the flow-through capsule, the capsule is not teth- ered to a thread and is allowed to move freely from the stomach into the duodenum and the rest of the small intestine. The proponents of this method claim that this allows measurement of the gastric empty- ing time and intestinal pH, both of which are important parameters.


Results may be classified as normal, hypochlorhydria, achlorhydria, and hyperchlorhydria. Normal. The patient successfully reacidifies after four challenges (Fig. 17.1). Curve number 1 shows the capsule entering the diges- tive tract, number 2 shows the capsule reaching the bottom of the stomach and alkaline challenge occurring, and number 3 shows a pH rise after swallow and subsequent reacidification within minutes. Hypochlorhydria. The patient requires more than 20 minutes to reacidify (Fig. 17.2). Curve number 1 shows a pH of 1 being reached after 30 minutes. Note that on the third challenge, the pH comes back only to about 4. Achlorhydria. The patient’s stomach shows little acid secretion and is not able to secrete enough acid to bring the pH below 4, even on the first challenge (Fig. 17.3). The pH remains at about 4.2 for almost hours. Hyperchlorhydria. The gastrogram shows extremely rapid reacidifi- cation (within 5 minutes) after each challenge. Depending on specific curve components, some investigators believe that mucous quantity, fresh or chronic ulcers, and acute gastri- tis conditions can sometimes be identified.


Gastritis, indigestion, heartburn, and symptoms of gastroesopha- geal reflux can be associated with either HCl deficiency or excess. Proper distinction is important for several obvious reasons. Patients with hypo- or achlorhydria incorrectly treated for hyper- acidity via acid-blocking drugs may experience symptom relief but also further deterioration of the intestinal structure, function, and intestinal microbiome. Direct measurement of gastric acid secre- tion through endoscopy, intubation, and aspiration is uncom- fortable and unacceptable to many patients.

capsule system offers a convenient and accurate outpatient testing system to clinicians interested in evaluating functional gastric acid output. HCl, pepsin, and intrinsic factor are directly involved in diges- tion and contribute to the chemical changes in the intestines that assist in the absorption of many nutritional factors. For example, vitamin B 12 absorption requires intrinsic factor, whereas zinc, cal- cium, and iron are less efficiently assimilated when gastric acidity is low.9–11

# INDICATIONS

Many symptoms and signs suggest impaired acid secretory ability, and a number of specific diseases have been found to be associated with achlorhydria and hypochlorhydria (particularly gastric carcinoma and human leukocyte antigen-B 8 –related autoimmune diseases). These are listed in Boxes 17.1, 17.2, and 17.3.12–23 The presence of Helicobacter pylori is a major factor in both achlorhydria and hypochlorhydria.24,25 H. pylori induce strong inflammatory responses and a transitory hypo- chlorhydria, which can progress in ∼ 2% of patients to atrophic gastri- tis, dysplasia, or gastric adenocarcinoma.

<!-- chunk -->

## Aging

Numerous studies have shown that acid secretory ability decreases with age. Low stomach acidity has been found in more than half of those older than age 60.26,27 One study of the elderly found that their tissue nutrient levels could be saturated only through the use of intramuscu- lar supplementation; oral supplementation was ineffective. The authors speculated that this was caused by atrophy of various digestive organs.28


The Heidelberg pH capsule system is an effective and convenient method to determine gastric acid secretory ability under conditions simulating ingestion of food. The results are extremely valuable in identifying the large number of people who have impaired secretion function. The ramifications of impaired acid secretion are widespread. This technology has become an accepted method of assessing gastric pH in several research settings.

an immunodeficiency. Patients with myelomas and lymphoprolifer- ative disorders may have high antibody levels. For example, patients with alcoholic liver disease often have a polyclonal expansion of immu- noglobulin-A (IgA), whereas patients with systemic lupus erythema- tosus (SLE) and Sjögren’s syndrome have polyclonal IgG expansion.1 The type of isotype made by B cells can provide clues as to the immunological status of the patient (Table 18.2). The route and duration of exposure, type of antigen, and genetic background may all affect the isotype of antibody that is produced, as well as the subclass of antibody produced. Upon immediate exposure to a novel infectious organism, the body produces immunoglobulin-M (IgM). After the B cell makes IgM, it class switches to another isotype, as determined by a combination of activation proteins and cytokines. If the patient has been exposed to an infectious agent, the antibody usually will class switch to IgG.

## Immunoglobulin-G

IgG is the major antibody found in blood, and it consists of four sub- classes, originally described in the 1980s according to their abundance

in serum. IgG1 and IgG2 are present in much higher concentrations than IgG3 and IgG4. All subclasses of IgG are low in pediatric pop- ulations. Deficiency in some IgG subclasses results in increased sus- ceptibility to bacterial infections.2 IgG subtypes vary in their ability to activate complement and Fc-receptor binding. IgG3 has a strong affin- ity for Fc receptors and has the greatest ability to activate complement. The type of antigen can influence the subclass of antibody response. For example, IgG2 antibodies appear to influence polysaccharide anti- gens, whereas protein antigens and whole bacteria preferentially elicit IgG1.3–5 IgG4 antibodies, found at the lowest concentration in the serum, are generated to repeatedly presented antigens. IgG4-deficient individ- uals may be more susceptible to pyogenic infections of the respiratory tract. Antibodies against dietary antigens are frequently IgG4. In a community survey of 40 individuals, antifood antibodies to milk, egg, and fish of the IgG4 subclass were found in a significant proportion of a healthy population, indicating that IgG4 antibodies against food antigens cannot serve as markers of atopic disease. Because IgG4 can- not activate complement, it has been hypothesized that it may serve for protective clearance mechanisms and may be a desirable response to dietary antigens.6 IgG1 and IgG2 have also been found for dietary anti- gens, but the immunological outcome of these subclasses may be food intolerance that is not caused by immunoglobulin-E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity.7 A larger discussion of the immune response to food can be found in Chapter 14. Antibodies of each of the IgG subclasses can be detected by a vari- ety of techniques, including radioactive iodine labeling; antigen-coated red cells; immunofluorescence with antigen-coated Sepharose; radio- immunoassay (RIA); and, most commonly, enzyme-linked immuno- sorbent assay (ELISA) with monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 18.2).8

## Immunoglobulin-A

IgA can also be made to infectious agents and occurs in two forms, IgA1 and IgA2. IgA in serum predominantly exists in the monomeric form, IgA1. The ratio of IgA1:IgA2 in serum is about 9:1. IgA found in secretions, termed secretory IgA, occurs as dimers. The ratio of IgA1:IgA2 in secretions varies, but it is approximately 6:4 in saliva.9 Because IgA is found at mucosal surfaces and lines the mucosal sur- face of the gut, it is not uncommon to find IgA antibody specific for food antigens. Because IgA is at high levels in secretions, it can be found in saliva in addition to serum, and salivary IgA tests are readily available.10,11

<!-- chunk -->

## Immunoglobulin-E

An immune response to parasites, specifically worms, triggers an IgE response.12 IgE elicits an immune response by binding to Fc receptors on mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils, causing degranulation and cytokine release. In atopic individuals, IgE is also made to allergens. IgE is at low levels in the blood. Measurement of total serum IgE is useful in patients in whom parasitical infection is suspected, but it is not valuable for measuring allergies. Thus the most common method for allergy testing is the skin-prick test.13 In this test, a small amount of the suspected allergen is placed on the skin. Then the skin is pricked so that the allergen goes under the skin’s surface. If the patient is aller- gic to the allergen, swelling and redness will appear within 15 to minutes.

<!-- chunk -->

## Total Antibodies

Measuring total antibody in blood involves protein electrophoresis or ELISA and is valuable. However, quantifying the total amount of anti- body specific for an antigen is even more desirable. Antibody titers for common antigens, such as those found in vaccines, can be ordered. Each laboratory has its own reference levels for titers because the sen- sitivity of the test is related to the specificity and affinity of the reagents used.

<!-- chunk -->

## Autoantibodies

Specific antibodies, rather than total levels, are also measured for cir- culating autoantibodies. These antibodies can be detected with immu- nofluorescence, RIA, and ELISA.14 Indirect immunofluorescence is a method often used to investigate autoantibody presence, specifically Antinuclear antibody (ANA). This method involves growing liver cells in a petri dish, exposing the cells to patient serum, then washing any excess antibody away. If the serum contains ANA, these antibodies will stay attached to the nuclear region of the liver cells. The plate is then incubated with an antibody that has a fluorescent tag and is specific to human IgG. When examined under a microscope, a nuclear stain- ing pattern can be observed if the patient has ANA (Fig. 18.3). If the patient does not have ANA, a more diffuse staining pattern occurs. This method is the least sensitive of all the antibody tests, yet it is the gold standard in diagnosing several autoimmune conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).15 Another method of immunofluorescence antibody visualization uses the patient’s tissue as opposed to human cells in a petri dish. This method takes patient tissue that is frozen, and sections are cut on a

cryostat. This tissue is incubated with patient serum, such that auto- antibodies in the serum can bind. A fluorescently tagged secondary antibody specific for human immunoglobulin is then used to detect the autoantibodies. Immunofluorescence examination of biopsy specimens of damaged or normal tissue may reveal deposits of immunoglobulins caused by antibodies reacting with an organ or tissue-specific antigens. This approach is especially important in the diagnosis of antiglomerular basement antibody disease and bullous skin disorders but may show false positives when used for SLE. Current recommendations do not support testing for autoantibodies due to their low specificity, partic- ularly ANA testing, unless clinical suspicion for immune involvement is suspected16 (see Table 18.3 for a listing of common autoantibodies).

RIA is a far more sensitive test used for measuring antibodies that are in low concentrations. In RIA, an antibody specific for human anti- body is tagged with a radioactive isotope. Because radioactivity is more sensitive than fluorescence, when this antibody is incubated with an autoantibody, the contact detects even low levels of autoantibody.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organism-Specific Antibodies

Antibody testing can also be used when determining a diagnosis of conditions like infectious mononucleosis due to Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). EBV does not always induce mononucleosis. In fact, only 30% to 40% of those who are infected with EBV will develop mononucle- osis.17 With clinical evidence, serological testing can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Typically, a monospot is performed. A mono- spot is a form of heterophilic testing, which means that serum is tested against phylogenetically unrelated species’ red blood cells (RBCs), typ- ically horse, ox, or goat. The test is considered positive if the RBCs stick together (agglutination). The antibodies produced early in the infectious process of EBV will cross-react and bind to proteins on the surface of the nonhuman RBCs. If the monospot is positive, a diagno- sis can be made. If it is negative, it does not rule out mononucleosis, and further testing can be done at this time. Testing for IgM and IgG antibodies against the EBV capsid anti- gen is a more specific test for mononucleosis. The presence of IgM indicates an acute infection. IgG antibodies against EBV nuclear antigen appear 6 to 12 weeks after infection and persist for life. Their presence early in the course of illness effectively rules out EBV infec- tion as a diagnosis. In contrast, IgG antibodies against “EBV early antigen” can signify a recent infection. Early antigen antibodies can be further broken down to anti-D and anti-R antibodies. Anti-D antibodies are consistent with early infection and disappear after resolution.18 Measuring antibody titers is a way of assessing vaccination status in individuals who are unsure of their vaccination history or to con- firm vaccine protection. Some people are “nonresponders” to vac- cines, particularly the hepatitis B vaccine. These individuals do not generate a robust response to a vaccine. Their antibody titers may be below 10 mIU/mL, whereas >10 mIU/mL signifies that an indi- vidual is immune. Nonresponders may require further follow-up to determine the etiological mechanism as to why they are nonrespon- sive to the vaccine.19 Additionally, vaccine titer testing may be used in patients who wish to demonstrate that they have active immunity to an infectious agent and do not desire to have additional vaccinations. In cases of pregnancy, vaccine titers may be measured on parents and siblings of the newborn to ensure they are immune to the most com- mon childhood diseases. This strategy capitalizes on the concept of “herd immunity” to ensure newborns’ protection against preventable diseases.

## Urine

When an antibody is made, the antibody light chains, κ and λ , are made in excess. These are present as free forms in serum and urine. Although small amounts of light chains are found in everyone, people with renal damage excrete higher levels of light chains in their urine. Free light chains are associated with malignant plasma dyscrasia and other lym- phocyte-related immunoproliferative disorders. Intact immunoglobu- lin can also be found in urine.20

## Cerebrospinal Fluid

IgG can be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is important in the diagnosis of several CNS disease processes, such as multiple sclerosis, neurosyphilis, and subacute sclerosing panen- cephalitis.21 A sample of CSF and serum is obtained, and the amount of IgG and albumin is recorded in a ratio of IgG:albumin for both samples. Albumin is not synthesized in the brain, so comparing this IgG:albumin ratio of the CSF to the serum sample provides an indi- rect indication of how much IgG has been synthesized within the brain.1

# MEASUREMENT OF COMPLEMENT AND HIGH-

# SENSITIVITY C-REACTIVE PROTEIN

<!-- chunk -->

## Complement

Complement is a series of proteins that result in the destruction of microbes. Assays for complement can either be those that recognize individual complement components (e.g., ELISA for C3 or C4) or functional activity of complement, such as lysis. Measurement of C3 and C4 levels is sufficient, except for rare patients with genetic defi- ciencies, such as hereditary angioedema. Low levels of complement are more significant than high levels. For example, complement levels may be low in patients with glomerulonephritis or SLE.22,23 However, the complement levels return to normal when patients are in remission.

<!-- chunk -->

## High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein

C-reactive protein (CRP) is involved in the complement pathway (Fig. 18.4). CRP functions by opsonizing bacteria, marking them for destruction by the complement cascade. Because it is readily detectable in the blood, CRP has become an important marker of inflammation. CRP is released early in infection (the first 4–24 hours) during the same window that many other components of inflammation are being activated, such as inflammatory cytokines. CRP levels are an indirect measure of the cytokine interleukin (IL)-6. IL-6 induces production of CRP as part of the initial immune response against an invading patho- gen that triggers the rest of the immune response.24 However, because it is far easier to measure than cytokines or other proteins, high levels of CRP are a more consistent marker of a recent infection or heavy immunological involvement, as is the case in several autoimmune dis- eases.25 Laboratories consistently offer a high-sensitivity test for CRP, called hs-CRP. This test is more sensitive than the original test for CRP, allowing the detection of lower levels of CRP. Consistently high levels of hs-CRP may be diagnostic of chronic inflammation and are values commonly used to determine immune involvement or even cardiovas- cular disease risk.26

## T Cells

CD4 T cells make cytokines that direct various arms of the immune system. CD8 T cells kill infected cells. The proteins on the surface of T cells that allow them to be identified are listed in Table 18.4. To qual- itatively identify T cells and separate them from other cell types, two proteins are used: CD3 and CD4 or CD8. CD3 is a signaling molecule associated with the T cell receptor and is on all T cells. CD4 and CD8 function to increase the interaction between the T cell and the antigen presenting cell. A sample of how T cells appear on a flow cytometry dot plot is in Box 18.3. In healthy individuals, the CD4/CD8 ratio should be approximately 2:1. This ratio may differ in some ethnic groups.27 CD4/CD8 ratios can be used to evaluate disease progression in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. When a clinician approaches a patient with suspected immu- nodeficiency, he or she may decide to recommend a functional test. Immunodeficiency could be caused by a cell’s inability to proliferate. In this case a lymphocyte proliferation assay or a carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) assay would be completed.

the initial trigger. CD4 T helper subsets cannot be identified by sur- face markers. However, because CD4 T helper subsets secrete different patterns of cytokines, intracellular cytokine staining can discriminate between subsets. The Th0 pattern is secreted by a naïve T cell, that is, one that has not yet seen antigen. It is the cytokine pattern that is designed to simply keep T cells alive. Th0 cells secrete IL-2. The Th1 pattern is secreted by T cells exposed to bacterial or viral antigens. Overactivity of Th1 T cells has been linked to many autoim- mune diseases. Th1 T cells secrete interferon- γ , as well as some other cytokines. The Th2 pattern is secreted by T cells exposed to worms and para- sites but is also involved in allergy and asthma. Th2 T cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. The Th3 pattern is secreted in response to food. Because the immune response to food should be relatively inert, Th3 cells are con- sidered a type of regulatory T cell (Treg) and are involved in immuno- logical tolerance. Th3 T cells secrete tumor growth factor- β . The Th9 pattern in T cells is closely linked to Th2, and until recently, they were considered to be the same. Th9 T cells produce higher quan- tities of IL-9 and do not produce IL-4, in direct contradiction to the cytokines produced by Th2 T cells. Th9 T cells have been implicated in the pathophysiology of asthma and other pulmonic conditions. On the other hand, they may play an important role in cancer surveillance and anticancer activities.28 The Th17 pattern is secreted in response to molds and extracellular bacteria. This population of T cells has recently been linked to many autoimmune diseases. Th17 T cells secrete IL-17.

## Regulatory T Cells

Tregs play a key role in maintaining tolerance. The loss of Tregs is asso- ciated with disease, especially autoimmune disease. Studies of Tregs have been limited largely because of their considerable diversity and lack of unique surface markers; the current state of the science is given in Table 18.4.29,30 Much of the knowledge about Tregs is from mouse models. Human Tregs have been phenotypically identified as CD4+ CD25+, CD4+ CD25high, or CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ cells, based on how they stain and present in flow cytometry. CD39 is another protein on the surface of Tregs that may allow reliable identification.31 Although most CD4 T cells express CD127, Tregs display lower surface expres- sion of this marker.32 Tregs behave similarly to other regulatory cells, such as Th3 cells found in the gut and Tr1 cells found in the periph- ery, but Tregs originate in the thymus and produce different cytokines upon stimulation than these other types of regulatory cells. Activation of Th1, Th2, and Tregs can be measured with the expression of CD69.33

## B Cells

B cells are identified by the surface markers CD19 and CD20 (Table 18.5). In addition to being markers for B cells, CD20 is a marker of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is a current drug target.34 Monoclonal antibodies directed at CD19 are therapeutic targets in rheumatoid arthritis.35 The products of B cells are antibodies and can be measured as described previously.

## Monocytes and Neutrophils

Neutrophils and monocytes act early in disease. Tethered to the blood vessel walls, neutrophils are some of the first cells to reach infectious agents. Monocytes can quickly extravasate into tissues, differentiating into macrophages and joining tissue macrophages already present at the site of infection. If monocytes and neutrophils are not functioning properly, severe infections can result. It is rare to find patients with low-functioning monocytes because the consequences can be extreme. When patients have severe staphylococcal or fungal infections, neu- trophil numbers should be evaluated, and function should be tested. Neutropenia is more common in neutrophil dysfunction. CD18 is a consistent and reliable marker for neutrophils and can be used as a marker for flow cytometry.36 In healthy individuals, the neutro- phil count normally exceeds 1.5 × 109/L. Mild neutropenia is usually asymptomatic, whereas moderate to severe reductions in numbers are associated with a progressive increase in the risk and severity of infec- tions. Episodes of infection are likely to be life threatening when the neutrophil count falls below 0.5 × 109/L. Neutropenia is a frequent side effect of chemotherapy.37 Neutrophil function consists of adhesion, migration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and a respiratory burst. Defects in the respiratory burst can cause chronic granulomatosis disease. One simple method to evaluate neutrophil function involves a nitro blue tetrazolium test. In this test, neutrophils ingest and reduce a soluble yellow dye to an intracellular blue crystal. Neutrophils are separated and then stimu- lated with endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), and the cells are viewed microscopically. Neutrophils and monocytes can kill microbes with a respiratory burst. Another test of neutrophil function takes advantage of this activ- ity. Neutrophils or monocytes are incubated with live microbes, such as Staphylococcus aureus. After the cells have phagocytosed the organ- isms, they are washed to remove extracellular organisms. The cells are then lysed, and the lysate is cultured on nutrient agar. Live bacteria will grow on the agar. The number of viable organisms inversely reflects the degree of intracellular killing.

## Natural Killer Cells

When cells are infected with a virus or become cancerous, they often express less major histocompatibility complex on their surface. This makes them a target for natural killer (NK) cells. NKs express surface receptors that allow them to recognize the absence of major histo- compatibility complex on a target cell and kill it. In addition to this mechanism, NK cells can be identified with CD56.38 Like CD8 activ- ity, NK function can be measured with a 51-chromium release assay (Box 18.3).

## 164SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

# CYTOKINES

Cytokines are immunomodulatory molecules that play an essential role in cell–cell communication and immune reactions. They are produced by most immune cell types, and many physical symptoms of immune dysfunction are triggered by cytokines. Cytokine expres- sion has been studied extensively in autoimmune disorders, chronic inflammation, and other diseases. Cytokine expression is most accurate when measured locally at the tissue site; however, systemic cytokine levels can be detected in serum and saliva. Cytokines may contribute to disease progression and are thus potential targets for therapeutic intervention.39,40 Cytokine levels can be tested with ELISA or cytometric bead array. Because clinical testing for cytokines is relatively new, clinical cyto- kine testing is not as validated as other forms of testing. Furthermore, cytokine levels are affected by exercise, diet, sleep, age, and gender. Cytokines tend to be secreted in patterns (Table 18.6). Because many natural therapies can modify cytokine expression, skilled clinicians can switch people from one pattern of cytokines to another.

# GENETICS

The genetic control of immunity has long been recognized. Many autoimmune diseases map to specific genetic loci. Polymorphisms in the human leukocyte antigen have been linked to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine and cytokine receptor genes are associated with the variability of immune response between individuals to infectious disease.41 Some clinical laboratories now offer testing for SNPs. SNPs are detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).42 Gene primer pairs for the candidate gene are used to amplify the DNA sequence of the patient’s gene. The patient’s gene is then sequenced and compared with a standard sequence. Genetic microarray provides a second test for genetic variability and may allow clinicians to pinpoint genes that are key players in dif- ferent diseases (Fig. 18.5). In addition to determining patterns of gene expression that contribute to complex disorders, microarray could elucidate gene interactions that lead to clinical symptoms or tell a phy- sician whether a patient is responding to therapy. Microarray involves isolating RNA from tissue, labeling it with fluorescent probe, and then comparing it with a standardized or control tissue by combining the RNA samples and hybridizing them to a chip. The color patterns are read by a computer. The expression of some genes (housekeeping genes) tends to be more stable and can act as a control. There are still several obstacles to overcome with genetic microarray technology, but clinical utility is likely.43

# CLINICAL SYMPTOMS

It would be an oversight to exclude clinical symptoms as one of the primary ways that the immune system is evaluated. Clinical symptoms usually occur after an immune response is under way, but they are often the first sign to the patient and physician that something may be amiss. Physicians recognized an immune response long before the first immune cells and proteins were discovered. The classic symptoms of inflammation—calor (heat), dolor (pain), rubor (redness), and tumor (swelling)—were originally described and recorded by Aulus (Aurelius) Cornelius, a Roman physician and medical writer who lived from about 30 BC to 45 AD. These hallmarks of inflammation are caused by many complex interactions between cells and cytokines of the immune and nervous system and allow a clinician to make some assumption about immune processes without even drawing blood. For example, calor (heat) refers to fever. If a patient has a fever, a physi- cian may assume that IL-1 β is elevated. Table 18.7 illustrates which immune processes underlie the hallmarks of inflammation.

## Sickness Behavior

Proinflammatory cytokines act in the brain to induce nonspecific symptoms of infection. In addition to triggering fever, cytokines elicit profound psychological and behavioral changes. Sick individuals experience several symptoms, including malaise, fatigue, weakness, an inability to concentrate, and listlessness. They become sleepy (hyper- somnia) and experience depressed activity and a desire to be isolated. These infection-induced changes are referred to as ‘‘sickness behav- ior.”44 Sickness behaviors have a variety of advantages to both the sick individual and the population at large. Malaise, fatigue, and listlessness cause a person to rest and thus conserve energy. Rest further aids the body by decreasing heat loss, whereas shivering increases heat produc- tion. Social isolation may help prevent the spread of the infection to others.45 Most sickness behaviors are caused by cytokines, and they may help an observant clinician make a diagnosis. For example, fatigue and malaise are most commonly triggered by IL-1 β . Interestingly, in some people, tumor necrosis factor- α and IL-6 may cause anger or hostility, and this emotional response leads to the social isolation.46


Choosing appropriate immunological tests requires physiological, economic, and ethical considerations. To choose the right test for the patient, the reliability of the tests, as well as their specificity and sensitivity, must be considered. Assessing the immune system is further complicated by its sensitivity to the environment. Thus running tests in duplicate or triplicate may be necessary to validate results.

## 167CHAPTER 19 Intestinal Permeability

trigger toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4)–mediated inflammatory activa- tion, eliciting chronic low-grade proinflammatory and prooxidative stress. Endotoxemia has been implicated in a number of inflammatory diseases, including sepsis, septic shock, diabetes, and, more recently, obesity-related metabolic disorders. Gut microbiota constitutes the major source of LPSs, and the main portal of entry into the systemic circulation is via direct diffusion through increased intestinal permea- bility, or from the absorption and incorporation of LPSs into chylomi- crons after a lipid-rich meal.12,16 Research shows that impaired intestinal barrier function is often associated with alterations in the gut microbiome. When this occurs, instead of maintaining the homeostasis of the immune system, the microbiota can initiate and perpetuate inflammatory responses, thereby triggering or exacerbating intestinal and systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and metabolic syndrome.11,13,17,18

<!-- chunk -->

## The Physical Barrier

The physical barrier comprises the mucus layer, intestinal epithelial cells, and intercellular junctional complexes.6 The chief role of this component of the IEB is to prevent bacterial adhesion (mucus layer) and regulate transcellular and paracellular diffusion of molecules into the systemic circulation (epithelial cells and tight junctions).19

<!-- chunk -->

## The Mucosal Layer

Immediately below the microbiota and overlying the epithelium is the mucus layer, which functions as both a physical barrier and a biochem- ical barrier.5 As the first physical barrier, the mucus layer limits the direct interactions of the intestinal epithelium with microbes, antigens, and toxins while simultaneously allowing nutrient absorption.17,18,20 The mucosal layer also acts as a lubricant for intestinal motility.21 Specialized enterocytes called goblet cells secrete mucus, which is composed of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and water.22 A core component of mucus is large glycoproteins, which belong in the family of secretory-gel–forming mucins. In both the small and large intestine, MUC2 is the primary secretory mucin produced and secreted by goblet cells and forms the main structural unit of the mucus layer.5,22 As well as acting as the first line of defense against physical and chemical injury from luminal microbial and antigenic contents, secreted mucins serve as a food source for microbes and also provide binding sites for bacte- ria.12,19,22,23 At the same time, microbiota and their microbial products are able to modulate mucin synthesis and release through a “crosstalk” feedback mechanism. Thus a symbiotic relationship exists whereby microbiota and mucins work collectively to prevent the invasion of enteric pathogens.22

<!-- chunk -->

## Intestinal Epithelial Cells

Below the mucus layer is the intestinal epithelium, which is organized into a monolayer of invaginations called crypts and villi (finger-like projections) in the small intestine. The bottom of the crypt is com- posed of stem cells, which differentiate into mature cell lineages as they migrate up toward the villus.22,24,25 To date, at least seven different cell lineages have been identified: enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, microfold cells (M cells), endo- crine cells, cup cells, and tuft cells.6,21 The exact roles of cup and tuft cells have not been fully elucidated.6 The key physiological roles of the main intestinal epithelial cells are outlined as follows:

<!-- chunk -->

## Enterocytes comprise approximately 90% of IECs and play an import-

ant role in the absorption of nutrients while also serving as a barrier to prevent the translocation of luminal contents into host tissues.6,19

<!-- chunk -->

## Goblet cells secrete mucin and other mucus constituents that form a

net-like structure to protect microorganisms from reaching the epi- thelial surface.26 They have also been shown to secrete antimicro- bial peptides (AMPs) known as trefoil factors, which are involved in intestinal defense and mucosal repair.1 Fig. 19.1 Components of the intestinal barrier. (From Ji J, Qu H, Shu D. Crosstalk between bioactive peptide and intestinal barrier in gut homeostasis. Curr. Protein Peptide Sci. 2015;16[7]:604–612.)

## 168SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

<!-- chunk -->

## Paneth cells are composed of large numbers of secretory granules

filled with AMPs, and as such, they support and mediate the bio- chemical barrier function.5 Antimicrobial substances secreted by Paneth cells include defensins, lysozyme, and regenerating islet-derived protein 3-gamma (RegIII γ ) proteins, all of which help protect against infection from bacteria, fungi, yeasts, and viruses.1,26,27

<!-- chunk -->

## Microfold (M) cells represent the antigenic component of the

intestinal epithelial barrier. Located above the Peyer’s patches and intestinal lymphoid follicles, M cells are involved in the process of sampling antigenic material, including food anti- gens, pathogenic bacteria, and their bacterial components, from the lumen and transcytosing to the underlying immune system.28–31 Commensal bacteria can also be internalized and exported to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) via this pathway.31,32

<!-- chunk -->

## Enteroendocrine cells are sensory intestinal epithelial cells that detect

and respond to luminal nutrient content by secreting peptide hor- mones to regulate digestive enzyme secretion, intestinal pH, gastric emptying, satiety, electrolytes, and motility.33–36 Hormonal medi- ators secreted by enteroendocrine cells include serotonin, motilin, glucagon-like peptide NPY, and substance P.34 Enteroendocrine cells comprise less than 1% of the overall intestinal epithelial pop- ulation, of which serotonin-secreting enterochromaffin cells are the most abundant subtype.33 Despite their small representation, because they are dispersed throughout the gastrointestinal tract, these cells collectively constitute the largest endocrine system in humans.35

<!-- chunk -->

## Intercellular Junctional Complexes

Intestinal epithelial cells are tightly bound to one another by at least four intercellular junctional complexes, which are vital for the integ- rity of the epithelial barrier.37,38 From apical to basal, the intercellular junctions are composed of tight junctions (zonula occludins), adher- ens junctions (zonula adherens), desmosomes, and gap junctions (Fig. 19.2).9,19,39,40

<!-- chunk -->

## Tight Junctions (Zonula Occludins)

Tight junctions represent the most apical (the side toward the lumen) structure of the intercellular junctional complex and are composed of at least 50 different transmembrane proteins.9,18,21,37,38 Numerous in vitro and animal studies have identified tight junction disruption as the leading cause of altered intestinal barrier function.38,39 The pri- mary function of tight junctions is to provide a physical barrier that selectively allows for the passage of water, ions, and small solutes in the space between neighboring cells while limiting access to pathogens, toxins, and xenobiotics.18,24,41–43 The four integral transmembrane proteins that make up the tight-junction complex are occludin, the claudin family, tricellulin, and the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM).39,40 Occludin, tricellulin, and JAM play a regulatory role in tight-junction structure and perme- ability,3,20,27,34,44,45 whereas the claudin family is primarily responsible for intestinal barrier function.26,27,46 Claudins can be differentiated into two main types: barrier enhancing (those that decrease paracellu- lar permeability) and pore forming (claudins that increase paracellular permeability).20,26,31,46 The specific claudins identified with the sealing function that decreases paracellular permeability include claudin-1, -3, -4, -5, -8, -9, -11, -14, and -19.18,31,47 Claudins linked to pore formation and enhanced permeability include claudin 2, -7, -10, -12, -15, and -23.18,48 Zonula occludins proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3) are intracel- lular scaffold proteins that anchor the transmembrane proteins to the cytoskeleton of the cell.18,27,42,46 Zonulin is recognized as the only physiological regulator of intracellular tight junctions and also plays an important role in the balance between tolerance and immunity.49,50 Gluten and bacteria (commensals and pathogenic) in the intestinal mucosa have been identified as stimuli that can trigger the release of zonulin.49,51 Together, transmembrane and zonulin proteins form a connective network around intestinal epithelial cells via their interaction with the perijunctional actomyosin ring (a dense ring of filamentous actin and myosin that encircles the cell at the region of the adherens junctions and tight junctions).9,17,18,21,24 Tight-junction functionality is also AB C Fig. 19.2 Transmembrane and Intracellular Mechanisms of Paracellular Permeability.

regulated in part by myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation with the enzyme MLC kinase, which causes actin to contract and open the junctional gap. This results in increased permeability to electrolytes and other small organic molecules.11,18,20,43 Historically, the tight-junction complex was thought to be a sim- ple, static paracellular seal. New evidence shows that tight junctions are dynamically and selectively permeable and are able to regulate paracellular flux in both a size- and charge-selective manner.43,47,51,52 Physiological and pathological factors known to influence tight-junc- tion permeability include dietary peptides, probiotics, enteric patho- gens, mucosal immune activation, cytokines, proteases, cellular stress, growth factors, and enteric nervous system signaling.25,50,52

## Adherens Junctions (Zonula Adherens), Desmosomes, and

<!-- chunk -->

## Gap Junctions

Located immediately below the tight junctions are the adherens junc- tions, followed by desmosomes and then gap junctions.24 Adherens junctions and desmosomes form strong adhesive bonds between IECs to hold cells together and protect against mechanical disruption of the epithelial sheet. They are also involved in cell-to-cell communication and are home to proteins that direct epithelial polarization.12,18,20,24,39,45 Gap junctions are also involved in intracellular communication and help facilitate the exchange of small molecules between intestinal epi- thelial cells.9,48,53 Unlike tight junctions, however, these proteins do not regulate paracellular permeability.12,18,20,24,39,45

## The Biochemical Barrier

Embedded in the mucus layer and far into the gastrointestinal lumen resides the biochemical barrier. The main role of the biochemical barrier is to reduce the load of colonized bacteria and help pre- vent luminal antigens from having direct contact with host cells.6 Components that make up the chemical barrier include digestive secretions, AMPs, cytokines, and other inflammatory mediators such as proteases.26

<!-- chunk -->

## Digestive Secretions

The first line of biochemical defense resides within the lumen, where gastric acid, pancreatic juice, and bile participate in the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier by altering the pH, thereby creating a bactericidal environment for pathogenic organisms.19,21 In addition to their antimicrobial role, digestive enzymes degrade dietary proteins, thereby preventing larger immunogenic peptides from reaching the small intestine.30

<!-- chunk -->

## Antimicrobial Peptides

AMPs are secreted by virtually all epithelial cells in the intestine as well as immune cells.9,18 The chief role of AMPs is to protect the intestinal epithelial barrier against invading pathogens and control the coloniza- tion of commensal organisms.6,12,32,54 AMPs are active against a vari- ety of organisms, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, parasites, protozoa, fungi, and enveloped viruses.18,54 AMPs destroy bacteria either by enzymatic attack or via nonenzymatic mechanisms that interfere with bacterial membranes via electrostatic interactions.32 To date, several types of AMPs have been identified, including α -de- fensins and β -defensins, C-type lectins, cathelicidin, lysozyme, and intestinal alkaline phosphatase.6 In addition to their role as antimicro- bial agents, AMPs also represent a link between the innate and adaptive immune systems.5,9

<!-- chunk -->

## Cytokines

Intestinal epithelial barrier function is also regulated by cytokines, which can have barrier-disrupting or barrier-enhancing effects, depending on the particular cytokine involved (Table 19.1).3,45 The secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in response to dysbiotic micro- biota and other noxious stimuli has been shown to impair gut barrier function and induce the reorganization of a number of tight-junction– associated proteins.7,34,42

<!-- chunk -->

## Proteases

Proteases can be present on both the apical and basolateral sides of the intestinal wall. In the gut lumen, they are either produced endog- enously (e.g., pancreatic proteases) or from bacteria and food parti- cles. In the lamina propria, proteases are released into the mucosa by macrophages, neutrophils, and mast cells to regulate inflammation.2 Proteases play a dual role, acting as both degrading enzymes and sig- naling molecules. In the gastrointestinal mucosa, they are involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix, mucosal proteins, and bacteria. As signaling molecules, their proteolytic action is capable of altering the structure and function of tight junctions, thereby increas- ing intestinal permeability.2,26

## The Immunological Barrier

Residing immediately below the epithelial layer is the lamina propria, which is home to the intestinal immune system.13 The innate and adaptive immune systems contribute to the immunological barrier, and together, they form the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which contains up to 70% of the entire body’s immune cells.19,21 Within the GALT are organized lymphoid follicles, including Peyer’s patches, which are primarily located in the distal ileum, and isolated lymph follicles that are mainly found in the colon.28 The immune cells that make up the innate and adaptive immunity of the gastro- intestinal tract include dendritic cells, monocyte/macrophages, neu- trophils, mast cells, B cells, and T cells.28 Collectively, these cells are responsible for antigen sampling and immunological responses to pathogenic microorganisms as well as immune tolerance to com- mensal flora.19,21,50 Secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) is the first line of adaptive immune defense and constitutes the major immunoglobulin class in the gastrointestinal tract.1,18 Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is secreted by

plasma cells (effector B cells) in the lamina propria and is then transcy- tosed through the intestinal epithelium (with the aid of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor) and secreted into the lumen as sIgA anti- bodies.1,6,13,28 Once in the lumen, sIgA binds to bacteria and viruses, thereby preventing them from attaching to and colonizing epithelial surfaces.18,26 Another way in which sIgA exerts antimicrobial effects is by entrapment of bacteria in the mucus layer, reducing bacterial viru- lence factors and phagocytosis of intracellular pathogens as it migrates through the epithelium.13,55

# LUMINAL TRANSPORT ACROSS THE INTESTINAL

# EPITHELIUM

Epithelial cells allow for selective permeability by three distinct path- ways: the transcellular route, the paracellular route, and the more recently identified unrestricted pathway.20,39,45

<!-- chunk -->

## The transcellular transport pathway facilitates the passage of

larger molecules (molecular weight [MW]: >600 Da) through the intestinal epithelial cells.25 Nutrients such as sugars, amino acids, pep- tides, fatty acids, and vitamins and minerals utilize this pathway.40,45 Food antigens, bacteria, and bacterial products, including LPSs, pri- marily use the transcellular route via M cells and other enterocytes such as goblet cells.12,25,40 These antigens are normally degraded by lysozymes within the intestinal epithelium and enter the lamina propria as small, nonimmunogenic peptides.17 To date, a number of different transcellular pathways have been described for different luminal compounds based on their size, hydrophobicity, and other chemical traits12,25,45,56:

<!-- chunk -->

## Transcellular uptake—this route is through the plasma membrane of

epithelial cells. Small hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds and ions utilize this pathway.

<!-- chunk -->

## Active transport—nutrients such as sugars, amino acids, and vitamins

and minerals migrate through the epithelial barrier using trans- porters, which requires energy (hence the name “active” transport).

<!-- chunk -->

## Endocytosis—larger molecules, including proteins, larger peptides,

bacteria, and bacterial products, are endocytosed into vesicles and move through the intestinal epithelium via transcytosis and poste- rior exocytosis. The paracellular pathway allows for the transport of ions (mostly cations), water, and other inert solutes of low molecular weight (<600 Da) through the spaces between the epithelial cells.30,34 Unlike the transcellular pathway, the movement of molecules through the para- cellular route occurs by diffusion.57 Currently, three different routes of paracellular flux have been identified, termed the pore, leak, and unrestricted pathways.39,43 The pore pathway regulates the passage of small-size solutes (approximately 5–10 Å).20 It is a high-capac- ity, size-selective, and charge-selective route.24,52,58 Pore pathway permeability is mainly regulated by subsets of the claudin family of tight-junction proteins.24,39 Cytokines that enhance the expression of claudin-2 proteins, such as interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, upregulate the pore pathway, leading to increased passage of water, sodium, and small cations.2,20,43,52 The leak pathway allows for the passage of large molecules (up to 125 Å) and is a low-capacity, size-nonselective, and charge-nonselective paracellular route.20,52,58 Leak pathway perme- ability appears to be regulated by zonulin, occludin, tricellulin, and MLC kinase.39,43,58 The unrestricted pathway this is thought to be a tight-junction– independent pathway that becomes active after direct epithelial dam- age (i.e., erosions and ulcers). This is a high-capacity, size-nonselective, and charge-nonselective route that allows for the passage of vast quan- tities of both large (including microbes) and small molecules across the epithelial barrier.20,39 Under homeostatic conditions (when the epithelium is intact), lumi- nal flux occurs across both the leak and the pore pathways (Fig. 19.3).39,52 Pathological insults such as infection, immune-mediated stimuli, and ischemia can compromise the epithelial barrier, leading to an increased flux across the pore pathway, the leak pathway, and the unrestricted pathway.20 When there is extensive epithelial damage (e.g., necrotizing enterocolitis), the unrestricted pathway becomes the dominant route of transmucosal flux.20,39

# ASSESSING INTESTINAL BARRIER FUNCTION

The assessment of intestinal barrier function is currently based on two different methods: active and passive measurement. Active tests eval- uate trans- and/or paracellular urinary recovery of orally administered probes, whereas passive assessment analyzes the consequences of a dis- rupted intestinal barrier (i.e., the translocation of luminal compounds and tight-junction proteins into the systemic circulation).27 Because there is no universal marker to assess all facets of intestinal barrier dysfunction and because each test has varied clinical utility and lim- itations, the use of more than one test may be necessary for a more comprehensive evaluation of leaky gut.25,30,59

<!-- chunk -->

## Active Assessment of Barrier Function

Active assessment of barrier function loss is predicated on the under- standing that orally administered probes of different molecular weights have variable ability to cross the paracellular pathway unless the intestinal barrier has been compromised in some way.26,27,29 When barrier function loss occurs, the ingested probes are able to cross the intestinal barrier and enter the circulation, and they can be recovered in the urine after renal excretion.26,27 Currently, there are a number of different marker probes that can be employed to assess active barrier function. These include the sugar probes lactulose, mannitol, rhamnose, and cellobiose as well as polyethylene glycols (PEG 400, PEG 1500, PEG 4000) and chromi- um-labeled ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (Cr-EDTA).26,57 For the purposes of this chapter, only the dual-sugar and multisugar tests will be discussed in detail because they are the most commonly used pro- files in clinical practice.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dual-Sugar Test

The lactulose/mannitol dual-sugar test (DST) has been used for more than 50 years and has long been considered the gold standard for the assessment of intestinal permeability.25,29,30,38,60 The monosaccharide mannitol is a small molecule (MW 182 Da) thought to cross the pore pathway freely, independent of barrier function loss, and thus can be considered a measure of intestinal surface area.26,27,52,61 The disaccha- ride lactulose is a larger molecule (MW 342 Da) thought to cross the leak pathway or the unrestricted pathway (after epithelial damage) and is considered a marker of barrier integrity.4,26,52,61 DSTs usually evaluate lactulose and mannitol recoveries separately, as well as the lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio, for a more complete eval- uation of intestinal barrier function.38 The ratio of the urinary concentration of lactulose and mannitol represents a measure of the sum of leak pathway permeability and epi- thelial damage normalized to the surface area.27,52

<!-- chunk -->

## Multisugar Test

A more comprehensive assessment of intestinal permeability can be achieved by the addition of other test probes.26 This is known as the multisugar test (MST), which involves the simultaneous ingestion of sucrose, lactulose, mannitol, and sucralose to evaluate gastroduodenal, small intestinal, and large intestinal permeability, respectively.26,27,47

<!-- chunk -->

## 171CHAPTER 19 Intestinal Permeability

The disaccharide sucrose is used for gastroduodenal permeability because this sugar is rapidly hydrolyzed by sucrase, an enzyme secreted in large quantities by enterocytes in the duodenum.38,47,62 As with the DST, lactulose and either mannitol or rhamnose monosaccharides are used for small intestinal permeability because they are degraded in the cecum by colonic bacteria.25,27,52 Sucralose is an artificial sweet- ener with a comparable mass to lactulose (MW 397.64 Da). Because this probe is not metabolized and fermented by colonic bacteria, it can serve as a marker for colonic permeability. Sucralose is thought to be absorbed via the leak paracellular pathway.25,28,27,61–63

## Factors That Affect the Excretion of Sugar Probes

The excretion of orally ingested sugar probes depends on many factors, which can be categorized as follows25–25,47,62,64:

<!-- chunk -->

## • Premucosal factors: proper digestion, gastric dilution and empty-

ing, intestinal dilution, transit time, bacterial degradation, alcohol consumption, smoking, and certain medications (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]).

and blood flow.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Postmucosal factors: endogenous sugar production, metabolism,

tissue distribution, renal excretion, and proper urine test collection.

<!-- chunk -->

## Limitations of the Dual-Sugar and Multisugar Tests

Recently, the efficacy of the DST and MST have been called into question by scientists who claim these profiles are not indicative of the transport of macromolecules, such as bacterial toxins and food antigens, that use the transcellular pathway to enter the lamina pro- pria.29,30 Research shows that only molecules of 5000 Da or greater are capable of challenging the intestinal immune system and initiating a T-cell–mediated response with downstream cytokine and antibody production.29 Probes with higher molecular mass, such as proteins and bacteria, have been put forward as alternative markers to determine whether increased intestinal permeability is sufficient to allow bacterial toxins (e.g., LPSs), food antigens and other macromolecules to permeate the gut wall.30,38,59

<!-- chunk -->

## Passive Assessment of Barrier Function

The passive assessment of barrier function loss is based on the under- standing that luminal substances such as bacterial endotoxins, bacte- rial by-products, and tight-junction barrier proteins only migrate into the systemic circulation after barrier function loss. Quantification of plasma or serum levels of these compounds is therefore considered a reflection of the integrity of the intestinal barrier.26,27 AB Fig. 19.3 Intestinal permeability pathways and mechanisms of analysis.

## 172SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

Examples of passive tests to measure intestinal permeability include zonulin, endotoxin (LPS), intestinal fatty acid–binding protein (FABP), and endotoxin core antibodies (EndoCAbs). Although they hold the advantage of being snapshot tests that don’t require a chal- lenge substance or the time-consuming collection of urine, the sub- stances assayed can be difficult to measure due to technical challenges (e.g., endotoxin assays) or endogenous factors such as hepatic metab- olism.26,27 For example, LPS can be readily measured in the portal vein of animals but is challenging to measure in the peripheral blood of humans and requires careful standardization.4,26 Additionally, cer- tain luminal compounds (e.g., FABP and EndoCAb) are only able to detect acute intestinal damage and thus are more suited to the hospital environment.25,26 Currently, one of the most common tests offered by functional diagnostic laboratories to assess passive barrier integrity is zonulin.

<!-- chunk -->

## Zonulin

Zonulin (MW 47,000 Da) is a biomarker of the intestinal barrier integrity of the small intestine.37,49,65,66 At this time, it is recognized as the only physiological protein known to reversibly regulate intestinal permeability by disassembling intercellular tight junctions.37,67,68 The secretion of zonulin is mainly derived from the liver but also other tissue, including enterocytes; adipose tissue; the brain, heart, lungs, kidney, and skin; and immune cells.37,51,69 In addition to being a marker of intestinal permeability, zonulin may also play a protective role. Zonulin upregulation may be a second- ary response to altered metabolism and inflammation, and through its immune-modulating and anti-inflammatory effects, it may help pro- tect tissue from injury.37 Zonulin expression has been shown to be upregulated in a number of metabolic,37,49,67,68,70–74 inflammatory,75–77 autoimmune,38,67,78,79 neurodegenerative,17,29,50,66 and tumoral diseases.37,49,65,67 Elevated lev- els of zonulin have also been identified in children with autism spec- trum disorders.80,81

<!-- chunk -->

## Test limitations of zonulin

Because zonulin is secreted by many extraintestinal tissues, serum zonulin levels represent a culmination of zonulin from intestinal secre- tion and other organs, such as adipose tissue, the liver, the brain, the heart, immune cells, the lungs, the kidneys, and the skin.37,51,69 This may explain why no correlation has been found between serum and fecal zonulin.82 To date, clinical data on the use of zonulin in patients with IBD is limited.51 As such, serum zonulin might best be described as a biomarker of metabolic disorders, such as low-grade inflamma- tion, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, and autoimmune conditions, whereas fecal zonulin may be a more representative analyte to evaluate increased intestinal permeability.37 Zonulin has demonstrated high intraday variability, which could be due to how it is metabolized within the body and its circulating half-life.65,77 Because zonulin is a high-molecular-weight protein, it is capable of eliciting an innate immune-mediated response. As such, when zonulin enters the submucosa and, thereafter, the systemic circulation, it can either be engulfed by macrophages or processed by Kupffer cells in the liver. Thus, depending on the host’s innate immune response, zonulin levels in the bloodstream may vary.65 To date, the half-life of zonulin is not known; rather, it is hypothesized to be very short (minutes to hours) based on the half-lives of other proteins of similar size, such as LPSs.65,76,83 Due to the high day-to- day variability, some researchers have instead proposed testing for IgA and IgG antibodies against zonulin, occludin, and other tight-junction proteins, which are considered more stable markers of tight-junction permeability.65

# FACTORS AFFECTING INTESTINAL PERMEABILITY

A number of factors have been shown to interfere with the integrity of intestinal barrier function, including enteric infections, a high-fat diet, gluten, food allergens, and drugs such as NSAIDs and proton-pump inhibitors (Fig. 19.4).4

<!-- chunk -->

## Enteric Infections

Virtually all enteric pathogens disrupt the tight-junction barrier (Table 19.2), although the mechanisms by which they do so can vary from organism to organism.45 Other mechanisms by which enteric pathogens increase paracellular and transcellular permeability include the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and immune cell infiltration.7,40 Protozoal infections are also associated with damage to the intesti- nal wall, specifically those caused by Giardia intestinalis,46,84 Entamoeba histolytica,22,46,85 and Blastocystis hominis.86 Protozoa conventionally classified as nonpathogenic (e.g., Entamoeba coli) do not appear to alter intestinal permeability.86

<!-- chunk -->

## High-Fat Diet

The Western diet is characterized by a high intake of dietary fats (par- ticularly saturated fatty acids) and sugar (especially fructose) and a low intake of fiber. The long-term effects of an energy-rich, nutrient-poor diet are associated with a number of metabolic disorders that have their origins in altered microbiota and/or increased intestinal perme- ability with enhanced endotoxin in the portal vein.26 Consumption of a high-fat diet leads to upregulation of the transcellular pathway (via chylomicron–LPS cotransport), which occurs independent of altered paracellular permeability.87,88

<!-- chunk -->

## Gluten/Gliadin

As previously mentioned, gluten and the gluten component gliadin, along with bacteria, have been identified as the major stimuli that can trigger the release of zonulin.51,89 It has been postulated that zonu- lin-driven opening of the tight junctions may be a host defense mech- anism to flush out microorganisms and upregulate the innate immune system to protect against colonization of the small intestine.37,49

<!-- chunk -->

## Food Allergies and Intolerance

For food allergies to manifest, intraluminal antigens must first pen- etrate the intestinal epithelial barrier before gaining access to mast cells in the subepithelial compartment and triggering hypersensitivity reactions.90 Under normal conditions, most dietary proteins ( ∼ 90%) are digested by gastric and pancreatic proteases and brush-border enzymes and transformed into peptides and amino acids before being absorbed by enterocytes via the transcellular pathway.30,90 Once inside the enterocytes, any remaining intact proteins are ordinarily broken down inside lysosomal compartments, thereby preventing undigested proteins from entering the lamina propria.17,91,92 A small amount ( ∼ 10%) of intact proteins or partially digested peptides will cross the intestinal wall via the paracellular route. This pathway is regulated by intercellular tight junctions and, once translocated, results in anti- gen-specific immune responses that support immune tolerance to nonself antigens.17,89 Prolonged upregulation of paracellular permeability allows large amounts of nonself antigens to enter the lamina propria, which ini- tiates an allergic reaction characterized by mast-cell recruitment and IgE-mediated antibody production. Inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and proteases also involved in the immune response set up a self-perpetuating situation leading to further gut barrier damage and increased entry of allergens into the circulation.4,57,93

## Inhibitors

Altered gut barrier function is estimated to occur in 60% to 80% of patients taking NSAID medication.4 Even short-term NSAID therapy has been shown to cause changes in intestinal permeability similar to those seen in patients with active IBD.63,94 Ingestion of NSAIDs ini- tially damages the enterocytes and increases gut permeability. The damaged mucosa is then exposed to endogenous substances such as bile acids, bacterial degradation products, and hydrolytic and pro- teolytic enzymes, with subsequent immune activation and inflamma- tion.4,95 Both cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 inhibitors have been implicated in small bowel damage.95 Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are another commonly prescribed drug, often coadministered with NSAIDs. Their deleterious effects on intestinal barrier function primarily target the stomach and colon.4 In addition to decreasing gastric production of HCl, these medications inhibit contractile activity, which interferes with the tight-junction complex via the intracellular actin–myosin cytoskele- ton. Research suggests they may also affect paracellular permeability through phosphate-mediated dephosphorylation of tight-junction proteins.4

## Exposure to Xenobiotic Pollutants

More than 25 tons of food will be processed over the course of an indi- vidual’s life span, representing the largest load of antigens and xenobi- otics confronting the human body. Infection, inflammatory cytokines, nutrient transporter activation, and noxious environmental toxins all alter intestinal permeability. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) bioaccumulate in human and animal tissue and biomagnify in food chains, thus increasing their concentration and toxicity in the envi- ronment. Pollutants that are highly fat soluble are readily reabsorbed via passive diffusion in both the intestines and proximal tubules. These lipophilic compounds can also be actively transported with bile salts back into the bloodstream. POPs damage DNA and mitochon- dria, stimulate the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- α , and increase inflammatory cytokines, all of which contribute to increased

intestinal permeability. Alcohol ingestion also increases intestinal per- meability to endotoxins and macromolecules, allowing increased toxic and antigenic effects.96 Cholinergic signaling is also involved in the regulation of the bar- rier function. Fluoridated drinking water can cause gastrointestinal distress as fluoride is converted to hydrogen fluoride in the stomach. Chronic gastritis with associated histological changes, including scanty microvilli, surface abrasions, and desquamated epithelium, as well as IBD, have been observed in individuals after consuming fluoride for long periods of time.97 These have been shown to result from the effect of fluoride on the cholinergic pathway. Olmesartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, has been associ- ated with the development of a sprue-like enteropathy characterized by severe diarrhea and histopathological changes in the intestine.98,99 A study from the Mayo Clinic first reported the association between olmesartan and enteropathy.100 Twenty-two patients presented with severe diarrhea and weight loss and biopsies consistent with celiac sprue. However, serological testing for celiac disease was negative, and no patient responded to a gluten-free diet. After cessation of the medication, clinical symptoms resolved quickly, and the histological changes disappeared. Many studies have shown that disruption of tight junctions leads to a rise in epithelial permeability. For example, methotrexate induces ZO-1 dephosphorylation, which in turn is associated with a change in the pro- tein’s localization in epithelial cells in the small intestine; this change may contribute to leakage of the intestinal barrier.101 Chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate insecticide, has been linked to microbial dysbiosis and modification of the function of the enteric nervous system and its asso- ciated cholinergic signaling, which alters the epithelial barrier function and changes tight-junction protein expression.102

# GASTROINTESTINAL AND SYSTEMIC DISEASES

# ASSOCIATED WITH ALTERED INTESTINAL BARRIER

# FUNCTION

Alterations in gut barrier function have been implicated in the patho- genesis of a number of chronic inflammatory diseases, including intestinal diseases, cardiometabolic disorders, autoimmune diseases, lung conditions, neurological disorders, and systemic infectious dis- eases (Table 19.3).4,17,39,62 There is much debate among the medical and scientific communities as to whether disrupted intestinal barrier function is an initiating factor or epiphenomenon of inflammatory diseases.17,45,47,48 To date, the gastrointestinal and systemic diseases with the strongest evidence of altered intestinal barrier function as an initiating and/or developing factor include celiac disease, IBD, irritable bowel syndrome, and type 1 diabetes.45 Numerous in vitro, animal, and ex vivo studies indicate that altered intestinal permeability can lead to the development of chronic inflam- matory diseases by influencing the mucosal immune system, but only in genetically susceptible hosts with initial exposure to an environ- mental trigger (i.e., microbial or viral infection, dietary proteins, and toxic chemicals).6,17,29 Fasano and colleagues have identified a com- mon chain of events triggering the development of autoimmune dis- eases such as celiac disease and type 1 diabetes. The initiating step is the genetic susceptibility of the host’s immune system to identify and misinterpret an environmental antigen from the small intestinal tract. The second step involves the host being exposed to the antigen, and the final step involves the antigen being presented to the mucosal immune system following paracellular passage and entry into the submucosa. Delivery of the antigen to the submucosa triggers a multiorgan process that leads to the development of an autoimmune response.49

# THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS

Nutrition has been shown to have a pronounced effect on the micro- biota, intestinal barrier function, and the passage of endotoxins into the circulation.87 Therefore encouraging patients to make positive dietary changes should be part of a holistic treatment plan to restore intestinal barrier function.26 Consuming a more traditional diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and foods with prebiotic properties while minimizing processed and refined foods, total fat, and total calories can help reduce circulating endotoxins.26,87 Such recom- mendations are supported by research that demonstrated a 71% rise in plasma endotoxins with a Western-style diet and a 31% reduction in circulating endotoxins following the consumption of a more tradi- tional diet.96

## Nutraceutical Therapies

Given that increased intestinal permeability may well be a consequence of the disease, versus the initiating event, researchers recommend treating the underlying disease(s).39 For example, IBD is associated with significant increases in proinflammatory cytokines, which are known to increase both paracellular and transcellular permeability.45 Treating IBD with anti-TNF antibodies or other recognized therapies that address the underlying immune activation has been shown to sig- nificantly reduce intestinal permeability.39 Natural agents with the greatest evidence for their use in protecting the intestinal epithelium include probiotics and the amino acid gluta- mine. Other nutraceutical agents with clinical and in vitro evidence to support intestinal barrier function are also described in the following sections.

## Probiotics

Probiotics are thought to protect the intestinal mucosa and epithelial barrier through several different mechanisms6,11,97: 1. By enhancing the expression and secretion of mucin and β -defen- sins, thereby preventing the proliferation and migration of com- mensal and pathogenic organisms across the mucus layer 2. By increasing the production and secretion of sIgA to protect bac- teria and their antigens from epithelial colonization 3. By altering gene expression and/or microbiota composition and increasing numbers of commensal bacteria 4. By producing antimicrobial factors (e.g., bacteriocins) that kill or inhibit pathogenic bacteria 5. By enhancing the production of tight-junction transmembrane proteins Positive peer-reviewed clinical trials evaluating probiotic interven- tion with intestinal permeability as a primary endpoint are summa- rized in Table 19.4.

<!-- chunk -->

## Glutamine

Glutamine is considered a conditionally essential amino acid that serves as a preferential fuel for rapidly dividing mucosal cells such as enterocytes, colonocytes, and immune cells.45,103,104 It plays a vital role in the maintenance of mucosal growth and in its structure and function, particularly in times of metabolic stress where demand out- weighs supply. For example, catabolic states such as burns, sepsis, and recovery from major surgery are associated with low glutamine status and accompanying epithelial atrophy and increased intestinal permea- bility.47,103,105 Glutamine also protects against chemotherapy-induced alterations in gut permeability.106,107 Supplementation with glutamine has been shown to restore intestinal membrane permeability and pro- tect against TNF- α –induced bacterial translocation after intestinal injury.47,104 In vitro studies suggest glutamine helps restore paracel- lular permeability by regulating the expression of the tight-junction proteins zonulin and occludin.56,108 Given its role in intestinal metabolism and immunity, glutamine was thought to be a promising therapeutic agent for patients with IBD. However, research in this cohort is sparse and conflicting, with studies suggesting it may actually exacerbate symptoms.103,109,110 Supplementation with glutamine may enhance T-cell function, which can lead to the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and aggra- vate Crohn’s disease.110 Glutamine may also indirectly increase nitric oxide synthesis via its metabolism from citrulline to arginine, with resultant inflammation and tissue injury in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.111 Some researchers have postulated that discrepant findings may be a result of the timing and duration of glu- tamine supplementation. It is thought that glutamine intervention should be administered before or at the onset of injury and, failing that, for a longer duration than most studies have allowed.56 Dosing may also be a critical factor because studies that have yielded positive outcomes for patients with IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D)112 and hospi- talized,113 postoperative,114,115 chemotherapy,106,107 and radiotherapy patients116 have supplemented with 20 to 30 grams per day (intrave- nously or orally) for 5 to 30 days.

## Miscellaneous Nutraceuticals

Other nutrients with preliminary clinical evidence for supporting intestinal barrier function include bovine colostrum, lactoferrin, and zinc. Bovine colostrum may have potential as a natural agent to protect against NSAID-induced alterations in mucosal integrity by downregu- lating proinflammatory cytokines.117–120 Recombinant lactoferrin has also been shown to reduce NSAID-mediated small intestinal perme- ability following a short-term indomethacin challenge.121 High-dose zinc (110 mg three times a day for 8 weeks) was reported to reduce intestinal permeability in patients with Crohn’s disease in remission.122 Natural agents with experimental evidence for supporting intesti- nal barrier regulation include polyphenols, vitamins A and D, polyun- saturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and butyrate. To date, a number of polyphenols have been investigated, including quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, genistein, catechin, and curcumin. The main mechanisms by which polyphenols help restore intestinal permeability are through enhancing tight-junction assembly and neu- tralizing proinflammatory cytokines (in particular, TNF- α , IL-1 β , and IFN- γ ).26,45,46,56 Vitamin A and D receptors are expressed in a number of organs, including the intestinal epithelium, where they play a role in gene transcription and regulation.45 Both of these fat-soluble vitamins have been shown to support gut barrier integrity and improve immune function.56,123 Vitamin A helps regulate the growth and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. In animal models and in vitro studies, a deficiency of vitamin A is associated with altered commensal bacte- ria, reduced villous height, and dysregulated tight-junction protein assembly.26,124 Vitamin D is thought to protect the intestinal barrier by inducing the expression of tight-junction proteins (specifically ZO-1 and claudin).6 Low levels of vitamin D are associated with reduced mucosal barrier integrity and increased susceptibility to mucosal dam- age, which may in turn increase the risk of IBD.125 In other experi- mental studies, vitamin D deficiency demonstrated alterations in the microbiome and intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction.123 Animal studies suggest polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids can improve villous height and intestinal barrier function and reduce LPS-induced intestinal damage.46 In vitro research shows that PUFAs support paracellular permeability by modulating occludin and zonulin tight-junction proteins.126 Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) produced by the anaer- obic microbial fermentation of oligosaccharides that serves as an important metabolic fuel for colonic bacteria.28 In vitro studies have demonstrated that butyric acid supports intestinal barrier function by regulating the assembly of the tight-junction proteins zonulin and occludin.127 Based on animal research, butyrate improves tight-junc- tion integrity by improving transepithelial resistance. It has also been shown to prevent the release of TNF-induced IL-8 secretion, suggest- ing a therapeutic role for butyrate in inflammatory diseases of the colon.46,128

The most promising pharmaceutical drug candidate for the treatment of altered intestinal barrier function is larazotide acetate. Also known as AT-1001, larazotide is a zonulin antagonist that protects against gliadin-induced alterations in paracellular permeability in patients with celiac disease.39 Phase I and Phase II clinical trials have demon- strated an excellent safety and tolerability profile.126 Although all tri- als demonstrated a reduction in tissue transglutaminase and intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms after a gluten challenge, improvements in the lactulose/mannitol ratio were reported only in the inpatient set- ting.129–132 Phase III clinical trials are currently underway, and its use for other chronic inflammatory diseases associated with zonulin dys- regulation is also being explored.17,49

## 177CHAPTER 19 Intestinal Permeability

promising results in reducing diarrhea-predominate IBS symptoms135 and functional dyspepsia,136 although the exact mechanisms by which it improves barrier function have yet to be determined. A number of pharmaceutical drugs used for the treatment of gas- trointestinal diseases are also capable of modifying intestinal permea- bility. These include steroids, aminosalicylates, anti-TNF agents, and mucosal protectors.21

## Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids have long been used to induce remission in Crohn’s disease. Prednisolone therapy has been shown to reduce intestinal permeability by approximately 50% in patients with Crohn’s disease (evidenced by improvements in the lactulose/mannitol ratio).137 Other clinical research has demonstrated a decrease in permeability in chil- dren and adolescents with active Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (assessed with the lactulose/rhamnose ratio).138 The ability of cortico- steroids to inhibit the expression of TNF- α and nuclear factor (NF)- κ B represent the underlying mechanisms by which these drugs protect against damage to the intestinal barrier.139

## Aminosalicylates

5-aminosalicylic acid derivatives are often employed for the treatment of uncomplicated, mild to moderate IBD. In vitro studies show that these medications (particularly mesalamine) support the reestablish- ment of the mucosal barrier by enhancing epithelial restitution and proliferation.140,141

<!-- chunk -->

## Anti-TNF agents

Anti-TNF agents such as infliximab are a more recent class of drugs used to treat IBD. As their name suggests, they work by inhibiting the TNF pathway, thereby reducing inflammation and restoring mucosal integrity.39,142

<!-- chunk -->

## Mucosal Protectors

Mucosal protectors have a long-standing history of use in the treat- ment of peptic disease. Drugs such as sucralfate and bismuth help protect epithelial cells from gastric acid and pepsin.143 Gelatin tannate works by forming a protective mucoadhesive layer and reducing the intestinal inflammation and bacterial fermentation associated with infectious diarrhea.21

be determined. Discovery of ascorbate-dependent enzymes involved in cell signaling pathways and epigenetic modulation offer the possibility for more functional analysis in the future, although unfortunately no definitive analysis is currently available.11 Lastly, polymorphisms in vitamin C transport genes may also be relevant when assessing status; for example, variants in vitamin C transport genes have been associ- ated with serum vitamin C concentrations and modify the strength of the correlation between dietary vitamin C and serum ascorbic acid.12 Some of these polymorphisms have also been linked to a variety of disease risks, including coronary heart disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and cancer.13,14

## Biotin

Biotin is a vitamin B complex especially affected by oral antibiotics. Food is a poor source of this vitamin, making humans more depen- dent on gut flora sources. Elevation of 3-hydroxyisovalerate (3-HIA) resulting from deficiency of the biotin-dependent enzyme appears a useful measure. Additionally, two studies in which healthy volunteers were intentionally made biotin deficient suggested that elevated uri- nary levels of 3-HIA-carnitine might be a sensitive indicator, even for a marginal deficiency. This offers greater accuracy and is less prone to laboratory error than the traditional urinary 3-HIA.15,16 Plasma levels of 3-HIA-carnitine may also prove to be a sensitive marker and reduce the dependency on renal function for an accurate determination, an important consideration during pregnancy.17

## Folate

Serum folate is too greatly affected by recent consumption to be clin- ically useful; however, elevated serum folate levels (>45.3 nmol/L) in the presence of a vitamin B 12 deficiency may reflect a functional folate deficiency known as a “methyl trap” (i.e., a build-up of 5-MTHF that cannot be converted to tetrahydrofolate, because methionine syn- thesis is impaired).18 Homocysteine levels may be elevated because of deficiency of vitamins B 6 and/or B 12 and folate. Erythrocyte folate is more accurate and considered a more reliable indicator of tissue status; it is not influenced by recent dietary intake and represents a 4-month average. Evaluation of other B vitamin status, particularly B 12 , may be necessary to rule out a folate deficiency. Although the presence of neutrophil hypersegmentation has been used to identify folate deficiency, this also occurs with B 12 and iron deficiency, making it a very nonspecific marker.19 Recent advances in mass spectrome- try allow for measurement of folate species, including 5-MTHF, THF, 70%

5,10-methyleneTHF, methenylTHF/10-formylTHF, and formylTHF, though this test is not widely available.20

## Niacin

Although measurement of nicotinic acid in the blood is not very reliable, measurement of its metabolites provides a clinically use- ful function assessment. Several metabolite tests are now avail- able, including urinary levels of 2-pyridone 5-carboxymide and n-methylnicotinamide.21,22

## Pantothenic Acid

Serum pantothenic acid does not correspond well with dietary intake, although erythrocyte levels are more closely correlated.23 Measurement of urinary excretion of pantothenic acid appears reliable.

## Pyridoxine

Several procedures are available for assessing vitamin B 6 status. Unfortunately, substantial agreement on the best methodology has not been established, because variations in phenotypes significantly alter the results of functional and loading tests. The active form of pyridox- ine (pyridoxal 5-phosphate [P5P]) is involved in some 60 enzymes, so deficient activity of these enzymes can be measured as a functional assessment of pyridoxine. Plasma levels of P5P appear to be a better functional indicator than erythrocyte levels, at least in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).24 Plasma P5P levels show an inverse rela- tionship with C-reactive protein, with low levels observed in a number of inflammatory conditions, including RA, IBD, stroke, and diabetes and, at least in RA and IBD, P5P levels are inversely related to disease severity. It has been suggested that this is caused by a tissue-specific mobilization of P5P to the site of inflammation.25 Plasma levels below 30 nmol/L (considered borderline deficient) have independently been associated with an increased risk for coronary artery disease, with a particularly high risk when combined with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.26,27 High plasma P5P levels have also been associated with a 34% reduced risk for all cancers, according to a recent meta-analysis of nearly 2 million participants.28 Although suitable for most circum- stances, plasma P5P does not appear to be reliable during pregnancy or the acute phase of myocardial infarction, and alternatives should be used. Additionally, it can also be affected by albumin concentration, alkaline phosphatase activity, and alcohol consumption, and decreases after glucose or carbohydrate intake. Urinary 4-pyridoxic acid (PA) is a useful marker of recent intake only, whereas erythrocyte amino- transferase and erythrocyte alanine aminotransferase activation by pyridoxal phosphate may be a better indicator of long-term status.29 Elevated homocysteine may also be a sign of deficiency, at least in some populations.30 Plasma 4-PA has also been suggested as a marker, as it is less influenced by inflammation, though it is significantly influenced by renal function. Ratios of various metabolites, such as the PAr index (PA/[P5P+ plasma pyridoxal]) and the ratio of 3-hydroxykynurenine to xanthurenic acid appear to mitigate the effect of some of the many confounders for vitamin B6 status.31

## Riboflavin

The most common measure of riboflavin is red blood cell glutathione reductase activity. The enzyme is stimulated in vitro by the addition of flavin adenine dinucleotide, and expressed as erythrocyte gluta- thione reductase activation coefficient (EGRAC). An EGRAC greater than 1.30 is typically used as a cut-off (with higher values indicative of suboptimal status), although one recent study suggested this threshold for deficiency might need to be raised. This same study also demon- strated that riboflavin supplementation caused an increase in hemo- globin status among women with the lowest riboflavin intakes, despite no change in iron intake or absorption.32 EGRAC is not reliable in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. In this population, pyridoxamine phosphate oxidase may be more appro- priate.33 Blood riboflavin levels are not reliable because of technical difficulties in measurement. Lastly, homocysteine levels may be rele- vant for those with genetic variation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene. Individuals with the TT genotype of the C677 T poly- morphism may have increased riboflavin needs.34

## Thiamine

The most common measure of thiamine is erythrocyte transketolase activity. The enzyme is stimulated in vitro by the addition of thia- mine pyrophosphate. Elevation in activity greater than 15% indicates a functional deficiency. The test is not reliable in patients with diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia, or a significant negative nitrogen balance. For example, growing evidence has indicated that a tissue deficiency of thiamine exists in patients with diabetes, and may increase the risk for vascular and neurological complications. Despite markedly reduced plasma levels of thiamine among individuals with type 1 and type diabetes, erythrocyte transketolase activity remained normal, largely because of an upregulation of red blood cell thiamine transporter lev- els.35,36 Advances in high-performance liquid chromatography tech- nology now allow for direct measurement of either whole blood or erythrocyte thiamine, which may be a valuable alternative.37,38 Both serum and plasma thiamine levels have poor sensitivity and specificity for a thiamine deficiency. Urinary thiamine excretion less than 40 mcg or less than 27 mcg/g creatinine also suggests a deficiency.39 Additionally, measurement of amino acids and their ketoacid ana- logs that are excreted in thiamine deficiency is being used. (See Brally and Lord4 for a more complete discussion.)

## Vitamin B

<!-- chunk -->

## 12

Serum levels of vitamin B 12 are of some value, although they do not track cerebrospinal fluid levels very well, and only a small portion (20%–30%) of total cobalamin levels are bound to transcobalamin and taken up via receptor-mediated cellular uptake. Additionally, at typi- cal cut-off levels, serum B 12 may miss as many as 45% of B 12 deficient patients if used in isolation.40 Erythrocyte cell size is also not reliable, because neurological signs and symptoms can precede macrocytosis by 6 to 12 months. Serum levels of holotranscobalamin may be the optimal first-line diagnostic procedure, at least among elderly patients. It has been sug- gested to be one of the earliest markers of negative B 12 balance, and its diagnostic accuracy is not affected by renal insufficiency, a prob- lem with total cobalamin levels and methylmalonic acid.41,42 Using a cut-off of 30 and 60 pmol/L holotranscobalamin, a sensitivity of 65% and 90% and a specificity of 90% and 55%, respectively, were shown against a methylmalonic acid standard.43 Measurement of either urinary or serum methylmalonic acid is considered fairly sensitive and specific in those with healthy renal func- tion, especially when expressed as a ratio with the urinary creatinine measurement.44,45 Elevated homocysteine concentrations may indicate deficiency, but it is not specific to B 12 .

## Vitamin A

Although liver biopsy is the most accurate method of vitamin A assess- ment, other less invasive and less expensive methodologies are more appropriate. As with most other nutrients, serum levels of vitamin A fall significantly only after tissue reserves have been depleted, and are subject to numerous laboratory challenges as well as other factors (e.g.,

infection, protein status). Serum retinol binding protein is sometimes used as an alternative to serum retinol because it avoids many of these complications, although it is also susceptible to artificial decreases caused by inflammation or protein malnutrition.46 Optimal cut-offs have not been clearly established for retinol binding protein, although levels greater than 0.825 μ mol/L have been suggested for children and greater than 1.05 μ mol/L for adults.47,48 The dark adaptation test detects early deficiency of this nutrient, and provides a useful alternative (see Chapter 27). The retinol isotope dilution test, using deuterium- or (13) C-labeled retinol, has been cited as the most sensitive indirect marker of vitamin A status, useful for assessment of both deficiency and excess, but is not widely available.49,50 Lastly, given the variation in the ability to convert β -carotene to retinol, the use of plasma carotene levels is probably not a useful marker of vitamin A status.51

## Vitamin D

The widespread deficiency of vitamin D has gained a much greater degree of recognition, with most recommendations based on 25(OH) vitamin D levels. Most functional indicators, such as levels of para- thyroid hormone, point to a level of 25(OH) vitamin D greater than or equal to 80 nmol/L as being sufficient, although some evidence has suggested higher levels might be optimal, particularly for cancer prevention.52-54 Prostate cancer may be the outlier among cancers, as a recent meta-analysis of 21 studies found an increase in risk with increasing 25(OH) vitamin D levels.55 However, a 2018 meta-analysis found that higher 25(OH) levels were associated with reduced mortal- ity among prostate cancer patients, similarly to most other cancers.56,57 Lastly, the measurement of free 25(OH) vitamin D may have its own clinical utility, such as vitamin D assessment during pregnancy, as it measures the functional activity and is less dependent on changes in vitamin D-binding protein levels. Only recently have reference ranges been suggested.58,59

## Vitamin E

Despite dietary intake of γ -tocopherol being tenfold greater than α -tocopherol, the preference of the α -tocopherol transfer protein for α -tocopherol results in much higher serum levels, which is why the latter is often used as a biomarker. Emerging evidence suggests that despite the ease in measurement, and the widespread supplementation with α -tocopherol, mixed tocopherols (such as the γ form) are likely of greater physiological importance.60,61 Unfortunately, optimal lev- els of other biomarkers have not yet been established, although one review reported a γ -tocopherol levels range between 2 and μ mol/L.62 Somewhat concerning, data from nearly 6000 adults in the NHANES study found signs of more advanced cellular aging (measured by telo- mere length) in individuals with higher γ -tocopherol levels ( α -tocoph- erol was not associated).63 It is also important to adjust vitamin E levels to lipid levels, such as triglycerides or cholesterol, with the latter more commonly used. Adipose and platelet levels have been suggested to be better bio- markers, as have cells with low-density lipoprotein receptors, such as mononuclear leukocytes and buccal mucosal cells.64

## Vitamin K

In recent years the importance of vitamin K for physiological functions other than blood coagulation has been recognized, including functions related to both bone and vascular disease. For this reason, the traditional methods of assessment, such as prothrombin and clotting assays, may not be sufficient markers of vitamin K status, at least in regard to these other functions.65 Better functional markers may be serum uncarbox- ylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels, or perhaps a serum carboxylated OC to serum total OC ratio. One review suggested that a percent of ucOC greater than 20 is probably optimal, although genetic variations may modify this to some degree.66-68 Another functional marker is the level of inactive matrix Gla-protein (MGP), referred to as dephospho-un- carboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), or sometimes as a ratio indicating the proportion of MGP that is carboxylated. This marker has been associated with arterial stiffness among diabetics and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.69,70 However, it is not clear that any of the carboxylated proteins reflect more than short-term vitamin K status. Additionally, although they may accurately assess the activity of menaquinones, it is not clear that they assess the different activity of phylloquinone.71,72


As described here, many procedures are now available for the assessment of absolute and functional vitamin status. Although research continues in this important area, the reader is advised to carefully study the discus- sion of urinary organic acids profiling (see Chapter 29). Using metabolic products excreted in the urine now allows the clinician far greater spec- ificity in recognizing dysfunctional enzyme systems, whether they are a result of genetic deviations or nutritional deficiencies.

## 183CHAPTER 21 Lactose Intolerance Testing

digestive capacity does lactose persist in the lumen, ultimately reaching the colon, where it may lead to osmotic retention of fluid and bacte- rial fermentation, thus causing the symptoms characteristic of lactose intolerance (see Fig. 21.1).17 Therefore symptoms of lactose intoler- ance often require several contributing factors in addition to LPH defi- ciency, including (1) relatively high lactose load, (2) gastric emptying rate,18,19 (3) rapid small bowel transit, (4) heightened visceral sensitiv- ity,20 (5) colonic water absorption capacity,19 and/or (6) altered bowel flora.21

# ADULT-TYPE (PRIMARY) LACTOSE DEFICIENCY

The majority of the world’s population has a normal decrease in LPH synthesis after weaning. Two genes appear responsible for the control of LPH synthesis. These include the LCT gene that encodes the lac- tase enzyme itself and the MCM6 gene that encodes two regulatory regions that activate the promoter that transcribes the LCT gene.22 The most common genotype of the MCM6 gene confers the phenotype of primary lactase deficiency (lactase nonpersistence) by downregulat- ing LCT promotion upon weaning.22,23 Genetically, nucleotides in the MCM6 gene appear to be primarily responsible for this developmen- tally programmed loss of transcription of the LCT gene.22,23 However, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MCM6 gene can con- fer the phenotype of lactase persistence by extending the transcription of the LCT gene into adulthood.22,24,25 It is theorized that maintaining the ability to digest lactose into adulthood (lactase persistence) is the result of a relatively new evolu- tionary genetic mutation that occurred after the domestication of farm animals.2,26 Preservation of lactase synthesis has been associated with several distinct SNPs on the MCM6 gene that include the following: –13910C>T, –13915T>G, –14010G>C, –13937G>A, –13907G>C, and –13913T>C. Respective to these SNPs, the variant alleles associated with lactase persistence are T, T, C, G, G, and T.3,22,25,27–30 Although the presence of any these SNPs suggests lactase persistence, their absence does not equate to lactase nonpersistence because there appear to be other SNPs that have not yet been determined.31

# ACQUIRED (SECONDARY) LACTASE DEFICIENCY

Because LPH is located in the brush border (microvilli) of gut mucosal cells, LPH deficiency may be secondary to diseases that damage these cells. Lactose intolerance has been observed as a secondary feature in celiac disease,32 tropical sprue, acute gastroenteritis, chemotherapy-in- duced mucositis,33 cystic fibrosis, alcoholism,34 pelvic radiation ther- apy,35 and Crohn’s disease.36 In secondary lactase deficiency, treating the underlying condition and resultant restoration of mucosal integ- rity often restores lactase activity.37

# CONGENITAL LACTASE DEFICIENCY

Congenital lactase deficiency is a rare inborn error of metabolism char- acterized by very low or absent lactase activity in the intestinal micro- villi at birth. Unlike lactase nonpersistence mutations, which affect upstream enhancer regions of LCT, mutations in the LCT gene itself appear to be responsible for congenital lactase deficiency.38 Clinical symptoms include severe diarrhea, dehydration, and malnutrition and

often appear during the first week with the consumption of lactose. Separately, preterm infants may exhibit symptoms of lactase deficiency if born before 34 weeks’ gestation, a condition called developmental lactase deficiency.39 As expected, preterm infants can gain function of the lactase enzyme with time.

# LACTOSE INTOLERANCE VERSUS DAIRY ALLERGY

Lactose intolerance and dairy allergy are separate pathologies. Lactose intolerance results from the maldigestion of dairy carbohydrate (lac- tose), whereas dairy allergy is an immune response to dairy proteins (e.g., casein, lactalbumin, whey). Dairy allergy may involve reactions (e.g., systemic anaphylaxis) that affect the gastrointestinal tract, skin, respiratory tract, or multiple systems. These immediate reactions are often mediated by immunoglobulin-E (IgE) and can cause severe mor- bidity and even death; however, in such cases, dietary elimination of dairy products is associated with good prognosis.40 The prevalence of IgE-mediated allergic reaction to dairy protein in the general popu- lation is estimated at 1% to 3%, being highest in infants and lowest in adults. However, the prevalence of IgG-mediated allergic reactions may be higher.

# DIAGNOSIS OF LACTOSE INTOLERANCE

Clinical suspicion of lactose intolerance should be raised when foods containing milk or milk products produce symptoms of gas, bloating, cramping, or diarrhea (Box 21.1). A short course of dietary manipula- tion, with careful removal of milk-containing products, can strengthen the case for lactose intolerance as a diagnosis. Stool acidity testing, oral lactose tolerance testing, breath tests for hydrogen and methane, and/ or genomic evaluation for LCT haplotypes should be used to confirm the diagnosis. Because the presence of lactase deficiency does not always result in lactose intolerance, genomic testing should never be used as a sole determinant in diagnosis. Breath testing provides the most reli- able, noninvasive means of determining lactose malabsorption but must be used in the context of symptomology to make the diagnosis of lactose intolerance. In contrast, a positive breath test coupled with the absence of LCT haplotyping indicating primary lactase deficiency sug- gests a secondary causation, the diagnosis of which should be pursued. There have been conflicting results regarding the presence of lac- tose intolerance in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). By definition, the diagnosis of IBS is a functional diagnosis that is made when all organic causes of symptoms have been ruled out. However, studies have shown that patients with IBS have a high rate of lactose intolerance, with the resolution of IBS symptoms upon lactose lim- itation or removal.41–43 Rana et al.44 found that patients with diar- rhea-predominant IBS had a higher incidence of lactose intolerance (82%) than patients who had either spastic-type IBS or features of both IBS types. For this reason, lactose intolerance should always be investigated in cases of IBS, a condition that affects up to 20% of Americans.45 A number of studies have suggested that transient lactose intoler- ance is also associated with infantile colic.46,47 For susceptible children with lactose maldigestion, only 12 g of lactose ( ∼ 1 cup of milk) daily has been shown to be associated with increased abdominal pain.48

## Nutritional History

A detailed history of the patient’s average consumption of lactose-con- taining food should be obtained. Often, patients do not consider yogurt, ice cream, chocolate milk, and milk ingested with cereal as important sources of lactose. They also may not be aware that lactose is added to many nondairy products to provide texture, flavor, and browning and to absorb flavors, aromas, and food colors (Box 21.2). In addition, because of its excellent binding ability, lactose is contained in many drugs and over-the-counter products (Box 21.3). Identifying all sources of lactose is necessary to (1) identify the potential relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and lactose consumption and (2) develop an effective lactose-free diet, if necessary.

## Empirical Testing (Trial Elimination of Milk Products

<!-- chunk -->

## From the Diet)

If the patient experiences symptoms after consuming food products con- taining lactose, the temporary exclusion of all lactose-containing prod- ucts from the diet as a preliminary diagnostic procedure may be helpful. However, the diagnosis of lactose intolerance should not be based solely on the elimination of milk products. This subjective test may be mis- leading if hidden sources of lactose (see Box 21.3) are not removed or if unrelated symptoms coincidently abate during this period.49

## Stool Testing

The fermentation of undigested disaccharides of any kind within the colon results in the overproduction of fatty acids by colonic bacteria, which lowers the pH of the stool. Normal stool pH is between 6.0 and 7.0 in young children and adults. Although infants may normally have a lower pH due to a high-lactose diet, a pH of less than 5.3 suggests maldigestion. Although pH testing can be used to raise the clinical suspicion of malabsorption, further workup is warranted to make a diagnosis of lactose intolerance.

## Breath Testing

Breath testing is the method of choice for diagnosing lactose maldi- gestion.50 It is sensitive and specific,51 simple to perform, noninvasive, and inexpensive.49 Breath testing is based on the ability of intestinal microbes to ferment carbohydrates, in this case lactose, producing hydrogen or methane in the process. A fraction of these gases natu- rally diffuses from the bowel to the circulation and is eliminated via the lungs. Because there is no other metabolic production of hydro- gen and methane, pulmonary excretion of these gases may be used as an indirect measure of lactose maldigestion, indicating lactase deficiency.52 The benefits of breath testing are as follows: • Its results correlate strongly with the symptoms of lactose intoler- ance.53 • It can be done at home by the patient or in the physician’s office.54 • The lower challenge dose of lactose causes significantly fewer side effects than the large doses used in blood and urine galactose tests.55 • The breath hydrogen/methane test is the standard in pediatric cases in which other tests would be difficult to perform.56–58 Historically, breath testing measured hydrogen only. However, Tormo et al.59 showed that methane is produced instead of hydrogen in some patients with lactose malabsorption. They concluded that measuring both gases was necessary for accurate diagnosis of lactose maldigestion. Other researchers suggested that although methane was produced pre- dominantly in some cases, hydrogen production correlated more strongly with symptoms; therefore hydrogen testing alone might be sufficient for the diagnosis of lactose intolerance.60,61 Breath testing using a radiolabeled carbon molecule (13C) in the lactose structure showed poor correlation with lactose intolerance, as evidenced by poor 13CO 2 output by the lungs.53


After an overnight fast, a baseline breath sample is collected 30 minutes after rising. The patient then ingests a challenge dose of lactose (up to a maximum of 25 grams), and breath samples are collected 1, 2, and hours after ingestion of the challenge dose.62,63

<!-- chunk -->

## Interpretation

If lactose maldigestion is present, breath levels of hydrogen or methane will rise within 1 to 2 hours after ingesting the lactose challenge. As little as 2 g of carbohydrate reaching the colon produces a detectable increase in breath hydrogen.64

<!-- chunk -->

## Hydrogen and Methane Responses

The normal breath hydrogen level in a healthy, fasting patient is less than 10 ppm. Patients with lactose malabsorption show an increase in breath hydrogen concentration of 20 ppm or more during the test.65,66 The normal breath methane level in a fasting patient is 0 to 7 ppm. An increase of at least 12 ppm of methane alone during the test is con- sidered positive for lactose malabsorption, regardless of the hydrogen response.67–69 If both breath hydrogen and methane rise after a lactose challenge, the two responses are added to estimate the degree of malabsorption. The increases in breath hydrogen and methane levels together must be 20 ppm or more to suggest lactose malabsorption.69 The extent of elevation relates to the degree of malabsorption.

<!-- chunk -->

## False-Positive Results

False-positive results occur rarely and are usually a consequence of the following interfering factors: • Fiber intake. Fiber should be avoided 24 hours before the test. Ingesting fiber in food or in supplements increases fermentation and hydrogen production.70–72 • Exposure to tobacco smoke. Tobacco smoke increases hydrogen lev- els and should be avoided immediately before and during testing.73 • Sleeping. Sleeping between breath sample collections may increase both hydrogen and methane levels.74

<!-- chunk -->

## False-Negative Results

Breath hydrogen/methane testing has a false-negative rate of approxi- mately 5%; the false-negative rate is 10% if only hydrogen is measured. False-negative results can occur because of the following factors: • Use of lactase supplements.55 • Use of antibiotics before the test. Antibiotics decrease the bacteria that ferment lactose.75 • Use of laxatives or enemas before the test. These decrease hydrogen and methane responses in patients with lactose malabsorption and reduce fermentation in the colon.76 • Severe diarrhea or hyperacidic colon contents. Hyperacidity inhib- its the production of hydrogen and promotes the production of methane by colonic bacteria.77,78

<!-- chunk -->

## High Baseline Levels

An elevated baseline level of breath hydrogen indicates that one or more interfering factors are present. Testing must be repeated to obtain reliable results. A baseline breath hydrogen level of greater than 10 ppm can be due to the following: • Improper fasting • Consumption of high-fiber foods the day before testing • Performance of test immediately after awakening67

<!-- chunk -->

## 186SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

A baseline breath hydrogen level of more than 20 ppm can be due to the following: • Possible small intestine bacterial overgrowth.79 Elevated fasting levels of hydrogen occur in up to one third of patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth80 and may be caused by the fermen- tation of endogenous brush-border glycoproteins.81 • Small intestine bacterial overgrowth may elevate baseline methane readings as well.67,79,81,82

<!-- chunk -->

## Genomic Testing

Genomic testing requires a single blood sample and avoids the diet restric- tions, lengthy collection regimen, and potential for abdominal symptoms that are associated with using an oral lactose challenge. The LCT gene on chromosome 2 encodes for the enzyme LPH, and the wild type is associ- ated with lactase nonpersistence. Lactase persistence is associated with two polymorphisms on the enhancer region upstream from LCT, C/T 13910 and G/A 22018 . Heterozygotes are considered to have lactase persistence but with intermediate lactase activity. Homozygotes T/T 13910 and G/G 22018 have the lactase persistence genotype, whereas C/C and G/G homozygotes carry the wild-type nonpersistence genotype. Genomic testing, although useful, only establishes a lactase enzyme deficiency, the presence of which does not always lead to lactose intolerance symptoms. Heterozygotes, although considered carriers of lactase persistence genotyping, can have bouts of impaired lactase activity due to stress or infection, rendering intermittent bouts of lactose intolerance.83 Therefore testing for lactose malabsorption through an objective measure of lactose malabsorption, such as hydrogen breath testing, is still warranted.84

## Tissue Sampling

An endoscopic biopsy of the jejunum can assess the presence of lactase as well as other disaccharidases, although this test is rarely used due to the expense and discomfort involved. Morphologically, enterocytes would not show abnormality in cases of primary lactase deficiency but may show blunting of microvilli or inflammatory changes associated with secondary causes of lactose intolerance.

<!-- chunk -->

## Blood Testing

Lactose tolerance testing (LTT) was formerly used but has been replaced by more sensitive breath testing, as previously described. LTT required a large dose of glucose challenge, up to 50 g, which often led to abdominal symptoms that are avoided with the lower doses used in breath testing. If the rise in serum glucose after challenge was less than 26 mg/dL during the ensuing 2 hours, then lactose maldiges- tion was presumed. Another similar test uses radiolabeled lactose,18 C-lactose. Although it has been shown to have the ability to differenti- ate between those who can digest lactose and those with maldigestion, this method has not been evaluated for its ability to identify symp- toms directly related to lactose intolerance,79 and it is not available clinically.

# OTHER TYPES OF SUGAR INTOLERANCE

The inability to properly digest other types of saccharides can pro- duce symptoms similar to those caused by lactose intolerance. For this reason, it may be necessary to investigate other types of sugar intolerance, especially in patients whose clinical test results do not support a diagnosis of lactose intolerance. Commonly ingested sug- ars, such as fructose, sucrose, and maltose, should be considered if sugar intolerance is suspected in the presence of normal breath and genetic testing. (See Chapter 9, Bacterial Overgrowth of the Small Intestine Breath Test, for a more in-depth discussion of carbohydrate intolerance testing.)


The majority of the world’s population is lactase deficient. However, lactose intolerance may not develop in all of these individuals. A com- prehensive evaluation that incorporates diagnostic testing, the patient’s nutritional history, and the relationship between diet and gastrointesti- nal symptoms is necessary for an accurate diagnosis. Proper diagnosis of lactose intolerance allows for dietary modifications that may allow a limited amount of dairy products in some lactose-intolerant individuals. Exclusion of lactose-containing foods altogether should be done only for those requiring strict avoidance, with careful attention to the replacement of lost nutrients, such as calcium. Breath testing of hydrogen/methane production after a lactose challenge is the diagnostic method of choice.

exposure history, and symptoms. However, the symptoms associated with toxic metal retention appear to be diverse and rather nondescript, and they may not be fully expressed until later in life. Clear examples of such latency of symptom expression have been provided for lead and hypertension12 and cardiovascular mortality.13 Therefore to address the needs of clinicians who focus on preventive medicine as opposed to crisis management, the following review of laboratory tests empha- sizes testing that has greater sensitivity with respect to the detection of the bioaccumulation of toxic elements. Emphasis has been placed on the distinction between testing that is most appropriate for assessment of exposure versus net retention.

# ASSESSMENT OF TOXIC METAL EXPOSURE

<!-- chunk -->

## Hair Elemental Analysis

When performed properly, hair elemental analysis can serve as a quali- tative screening test for exposure to toxic metals, but it is not a reliable method for the diagnosis of metal toxicity or net retention. Hair is an excretory tissue that can provide a cumulative record of bioavailable trace elements in the body, and the hair content of mercury, arsenic, lead, and thallium has been used as evidence for the cause of death.14 Once metals are incorporated into growing hair, there is no back exchange into the body; the concentration of metals in hair is usually far greater than that in blood or urine. The length of the hair specimen analyzed dictates the duration of time during which exposure occurred, and segmental analysis of hair can be used forensically to estimate the temporal course of exposure. A study of the lead and mercury con- tent of hair from a long-deceased president of the United States was performed at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington, DC, exemplifying the potential utility of hair analysis for exposure to toxic metals.15 Detection of toxic metals in hair actually predates that in blood and urine.16 A growing number of peer-reviewed publications support the value of elemental analysis of hair specimens for the detec- tion of exposure to toxins, and some national laboratories have been performing hair elemental analysis for mercury, lead, and arsenic for years. Arsenic in both hair and urine confirmed arsenic exposure from an arsenical pesticide in an individual with peripheral neuropathy and macrocytosis.17 Hair levels of lead, manganese, cadmium, and other toxic metals have been correlated with psychological conditions and deviant or violent behaviors.18 Lead, cadmium, and mercury levels in children’s hair have been inversely correlated with childhood intelli- gence. Hair analysis has been used to identify historical as opposed to current exposure to lead.20 School children with relatively high lev- els of lead in their hair had slower reaction times and less flexibility in changing their focus of attention than children with relatively low concentrations of lead in their hair.21 More recently, hair levels of lead and barium were found to be higher in rural populations in relation to their proximity to oil fields (contaminated water) in the Thar Jath oil fields in South Sudan.19 The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDRss), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Academy of Sciences recognize the scientific validity of hair mercury levels as an indicator of maternal and fetal exposure to methylmercury. In a cognitive performance study of children in the Faroe Islands, there were detectable effects on brain function in the children whose mothers had elevated levels of hair mercury.22 A his- tory of fish consumption and mercury in hair samples are considered the best indicators of human exposure to methylmercury.23 Fish con- sumption among Scandinavian25 and Tyrrhenian men,26 Amazonian children,27 and people from the Minamata Bay area15 and the San Francisco Bay area24 was positively correlated with hair and blood mer- cury levels. Note that hair elemental analysis definitely provides useful information about exposure to methylmercury (fish consumption); however, it is not nearly as useful for disclosing information about exposure to inorganic mercury as derived from dental amalgams.15 The concentration of methylmercury in hair is about 300 times higher than that in blood.28 In sharp contrast, about 75% of total hair arsenic is present in the inorganic form.29 Although an increasing number of peer-reviewed published studies support the clinical utility of elemental analysis of hair for the assess- ment of exposure to specific toxic metal forms, some considerations prevent its acceptance by governmental agencies in the United States. In June 2001, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) convened a panel of scientists with some expertise in hair analysis or risk assessment to explore “the state of the science of hair analysis.”30 Overall, the discussion was objective and focused on the existing scientific data. In a summary statement from the meeting, it was concluded that “in general, hair analysis results can provide lim- ited qualitative insights into environmental exposures and rarely can answer questions about potential health effects.”27 The primary concerns raised by the group pertained to uncer- tainties about the quantitative relationship among the actual “inter- nal dose,” the rate of incorporation into hair, and the current lack of well-established data to enable one to predict potential health effects for a given concentration of a specific metal in hair. Such criticisms are irrelevant to those who understand the limitations of hair elemental analysis. Overinterpretation of the results of elemental analysis of hair is a serious concern shared by science-based laboratories and astute clini- cians as well as the ATSDR. It should be kept in mind that the ATSDR has been interested in the use of hair analysis as an initial screening tool for inexpensive and noninvasive monitoring of populations in the vicinity of known sites of contamination. The goal of the ATSDR to be able to use hair elemental analysis as confirmation of toxicity is quite different from the use of the test in preventive or environmental med- icine to provide an initial indication of exposure. The consensus report by the ATSDR is consistent with the afore- mentioned statement that hair analysis can provide some qualitative information about exposure to toxic metals but does not provide a basis for the diagnosis of metal toxicity. As such, hair analysis may be helpful to clinicians as a step toward identifying potential health problems that may be associated with toxic metal exposures before overt symptoms are expressed. Further testing should be performed before treatment options are considered. The clinician should be wary of laboratories that perform hair analysis as a vehicle to sell nutri- tional supplements and should be aware of interlaboratory variation.31 Clinicians are encouraged to use only laboratories that can validate their certification or accreditation and incorporate state-of-the-art methodologies for washing, digesting, and analyzing hair specimens.32 Appropriate quality control characteristics and the validation of the establishment of reference ranges, accuracy, precision, and reliability of state-of-the-art hair analysis have been described.33-35

## Blood Analysis: Toxic Metal Exposure

For the most commonly encountered toxic metals, the current stan- dard for diagnosis of metal toxicity is abnormally high concentrations in whole blood or urine (e.g., thallium, arsenic). However, blood anal- ysis for toxic metals is a better indicator of exposure than toxicity in most cases. Distribution of metals, such as lead, in the body has been long recognized as initially dependent on the rate of delivery via the blood to various tissues and organs.36 Subsequent redistribution then depends on the relative affinities of tissues for the metals and toxi- cokinetics that can vary markedly among individuals. Tissue affinities for metals are determined in large part by the high relative intracel- lular concentrations of reduced glutathione and metallothionein.37

## 189CHAPTER 22 Metal Toxicity: Assessment of Exposure and Retention

Furthermore, blood levels can fluctuate considerably with intermit- tent exposure and assimilation. Thus as stated by the ATSDR and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the concentration of lead in the blood reflects mainly the exposure history of the previous few months and does not necessarily reflect the larger burden and much slower elimination kinetics of lead in bone.10 Examining kinetic models of metal metabolism shows that the blood compartment has the shortest half-life. Metals leave blood by excretion (urine, bile, and sweat) and transfer to tissues. The retention by tissues, such as bone, kidneys, and brain, accounts for the much longer biological half-lives of most toxic metals in the body. This sim- ple concept has been clearly demonstrated in numerous studies and in the Physician’s Desk Reference.29 Adult and pediatric patients who were diagnosed with lead toxicity on the basis of elevated blood lead values exhibited marked reductions in blood lead levels after chelation therapy with Chemet (DMSA). However, 2 weeks after cessation of chelation, blood lead lev- els rebounded to between 60% and 85% of pretreatment levels (the rebound effect has been associated with all pharmacological chelators). The relationship between blood lead levels and the quantity of lead excreted in urine after calcium disodium edetate (Ca-EDT) DMSA chelation is nonlinear, in that arithmetic increases in blood lead are associated with exponential increases in urine lead excretion.1,39 Under extreme conditions of grossly excessive retention of met- als (long-term occupational exposure), the equilibrium between tissue stores and blood can result in blood metal levels that are at or above the established threshold values for the diagnosis of metal toxicity but still do not indicate the extent of total body metal reten- tion. The currently established standard of blood lead levels for the assessment of lead toxicity in children is disturbing because no minimum response levels have been established for lead because a threshold has yet to be defined for the most sensitive effect of lead neurotoxicity.45 Interestingly, separation of blood into the plasma versus red blood cell components can provide valuable information to the clinician about the primary sources of exposure to mercury. Approximately 95% of methylmercury, most commonly derived from contaminated fish, partitions into red blood cells,46,47 whereas about 90% of inor- ganic mercury (amalgams, occupational exposure) is found in the plasma compartment bound to albumin, cysteine, and nonspecific proteins.32 Because the first step in successful detoxification is to remove the source of exposure, documentation of the primary source of exposure to mercury can be instrumental for efficient detoxification. Blood arse- nic levels, albeit with a very short half-life (approximately 6 hours), reflect exposure to inorganic arsenic but not dietary organic arsenic (shellfish), which is rapidly excreted in the urine.48,92 The blood lev- els of metals derived from orthopedic metal implants have come to the forefront, especially with respect to metal-on-metal (M/M) total hip arthroplasty. All patients with such M/M prostheses will have ele- vated levels of cobalt and chromium.40,41 The wear-related release of the metal debris has been causally associated with not only local tissue damage42 but also remote adverse effects on a wide array of physiolog- ical/biochemical processes and functions.43,44

## Urinalysis of Toxic Elements Exposure: Unprovoked

In general, urinalysis for toxic metals does not provide a scientifically valid basis for the diagnosis of metal toxicity. However, in some cases it provides an indication of very recent or ongoing exposure. Such is not necessarily the case for lead because urinary lead is generally not a useful biomarker to estimate low-level exposure. However, elevated urinary lead-chelate complexes resulting from the EDTA Ca-EDTA or DMSA mobilization test provide a good means to estimate net reten- tion of lead. A different scenario exists for organic arsenic and inorganic and methylmercury. The most commonly accepted biomarker for expo- sure to inorganic mercury is the urinary level of inorganic mercury.49 However, the World Health Organization (WHO) standard for occu- pational exposure is very high (50 mcg/g creatinine).50 This high stan- dard has been challenged because neurological impairment has been reported for occupationally exposed subjects51,52 whose urinary mer- cury levels were well below the WHO standard. Evidence that urinary mercury levels are indicative of exposure to implanted mercury amal- gams has also been published.53 In a study of more than 1000 Vietnam- era veterans reported by the National Institute of Dental Research, a highly statistically significant correlation was detected between the level of amalgam exposure and urinary mercury levels. Several other studies have reported an association between amalgam exposure and urinary mercury levels.54,56-58 Elevated levels of urinary arsenic have been detected in workers during periods of occupational exposure, including copper smelting, spraying of insecticides or herbicides, and application of wood treatments.61 Arsenic can be markedly and transiently elevated in individuals within 48 hours after consumption of shellfish that contain high levels of relatively nontoxic species of organic arsenic (e.g., arsenobetaine, arsenocholine).62 Urinary mercury is frequently elevated in consum- ers who regularly consume fish.15,63 Therefore analysis of an unpro- voked urine specimen is highly recommended to avoid alarmism and misinterpretation of the results of a urinary metals provocation test. Patients should be instructed to abstain from the consumption of fish and shellfish for about a week before a chelation challenge is performed. Elevated urinary values of arsenic and mercury associated with the specific dietary and occupational conditions reflect recent or ongoing high-level exposure but are not necessarily reflective of the body burden of the specific elements. Although blood metal lev- els reflect transient transport in the body, urinary levels qualitatively reflect excretion of an unknown fraction of the total body pools of assimilated metals.

## Urinalysis: Biomarkers of Renal Cadmium Toxicity

Toxic metals such as cadmium, mercury, and lead are known to be nephrotoxic at high levels of assimilation. Cadmium is of particular concern because of its exceedingly long residence time in the kid- neys.64 Therefore in addition to urine levels of cadmium, urinary biomarkers of renal damage should be assessed for documentation of cadmium toxicity. Early markers of cadmium-induced renal damage include proteinuria, glucosuria, aminoaciduria, hyper- calciuria, and polyuria.65 Sensitive urinary biomarkers for more advanced cadmium-induced renal tubular damage include elevated levels of the low-molecular-weight protein β2 -microglobulin, retinal- binding protein, N-acetyl- β -d-glucosaminidase (NAG), and Cystatin C (especially in patients where serum creatinine may be misleading (e.g., very obese, elderly, or malnourished patients).66 Abnormal urinary levels of NAG have also been reported in association with markedly high urinary mercury levels (35 mcg/g creatinine) in chlor- alkali workers with long-term exposure to inorganic mercury.67 It is noteworthy that the urinary NAG levels were correlated with urinary mercury and integrated dose of exposure but not with concurrently measured blood mercury levels.53 Thus it appears that assessment of urinary biomarkers of renal damage may be useful in the diagnosis of toxicity in cases of very high exposure to cadmium and perhaps mercury. However, negative findings for the renal biomarkers do not exclude the possibility of related nephrotoxicity retention that is most commonly encountered in general clinical practice.

## 190SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

# ASSESSMENT OF RETENTION: URINALYSIS,

# PROVOCATION TESTS

The best currently available method to estimate the level of reten- tion of toxic metals in the body is urinalysis for toxic metals after the administration of chelating agents.55 In the 1970s, the value of a stan- dardized calcium-disodium EDTA (Ca-Na 2 -EDTA) provocative test was recognized as sensitive to determine the mobile and potentially toxic body lead stores and to assess response to chelation therapy in pediatric patients with high blood lead levels.68–70 Subsequently, Markowitz and Rosen61 described the results of a comparable, yet more convenient test that would permit use in a greater number of qualifying patients. The concept and value of using metal complexing agents to esti- mate the net retention of readily accessible toxic elements has gained some acceptance, but it is not accepted by the American College of Medical Toxicology.59 That position is in direct conflict with a renowned nephrologist who has stated that “the best measure for assessing the total accumulation of lead in the body is the calcium disodium EDTA lead mobilization test.”60 Several other pharmaceutical agents are widely used for this purpose. The most commonly used pharmaceutical agents are Ca-Na 2 -EDTA, Dimaval-(RS)-2,3-dimercapto-propropane-1 sulfonate (DMPS), and mes-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). Nonpharmaceutical com- pounds that have also been used as possible provocation agents include N-acetyl-cysteine (N-AC) and potassium-citrate (K-citrate).72 The lat- ter compounds are not chelators by definition and have not been stud- ied extensively or compared with the efficacy of the well-established Ca-EDTA lead mobilization test.

# EDTA

Ca-Na 2 -EDTA is the only form of EDTA approved for lead decor- poration by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It has been used for decades as the provocation agent and therapeutic agent of choice for patients with high blood lead levels. The true chelator is also well known to be effective for increasing the uri- nary excretion of antimony, gadolinium, iron, cobalt, trivalent chromium, copper, nickel, cadmium, and manganese.73 Ca-EDTA also has a high affinity for zinc and, if not used properly, can cause zinc depletion. Clinicians are strongly encouraged to assess glomer- ular function before use (Ca-EDTA mobilized metals are excreted in the urine). Before attempting to embark on the safe and effective use of Ca-EDTA, clinicians should attend specific training courses. Although the “slow-push” Ca-Na 2 -EDTA protocol introduced in the United States appears to be effective for increasing the urinary excre- tion of lead,74 it has not been formally evaluated for safety. Ca-EDTA is not an effective chelator of mercury as are the dithiol metal com- plexing agents discussed next.

# DMPS

DMPS appears to be the most productive agent for the mobili- zation of mercury, as determined in vitro75 and in a comparative study during the Iraqi mercury crisis, in which people were acutely poisoned after consumption of grains contaminated with a meth- ylmercury-containing fungicide.76 More relevant to the typically encountered clinical situation, a DMPS provocation study was con- ducted with volunteer college students.77 Subjects with and without amalgam fillings were given 300 mg DMPS (orally), and all urine was collected over the subsequent 9 hours. DMPS raised mean uri- nary mercury for the nonamalgam group from 0.27 to 5.1 mcg and that of the amalgam group from 0.7 to 17.2 mcg over the 9-hour period. A highly significant positive correlation was detected between the amount of mercury excreted after the DMPS challenge and amalgam surface area. An additional study supports the value of provocation testing for people occupationally exposed to mercury vapors. A comparison of urinary mercury levels was made before and after oral administration of a 300-mg dose of DMPS to dental technicians, dentists, and non- occupationally exposed controls.46 Unprovoked urine mercury levels were comparable for dental technicians and dentists and were about five times higher than those in controls. Compared with preprovoca- tion values, DMPS-induced urinary mercury (micrograms per 6 hours) increased by a factor of 87, 49, and 34 for the technicians, dentists, and controls, respectively. Post-DMPS urinary mercury levels were and 6 times higher than in controls for the technicians and dentists, respectively. The group’s mean urinary mercury for the technicians after DMPS was 424 ± 85 mcg/6 h. The baseline urinary copropor- phyrin level, which is an established biomarker of mercury-induced disruption of heme biosynthesis, was significantly correlated with uri- nary mercury levels after DMPS but was not correlated with baseline urinary mercury levels. The researchers concluded that post-DMPS urinary mercury levels were better indicators of exposure and reten- tion than unprovoked urinary mercury levels. The pharmacokinetics of DMPS have been well defined,78,79 and the efficacy of DMPS for detoxification of mercury,80 arsenic,81 and lead (pediatric)82 has been documented. Although DMPS is not approved by the FDA, it is registered in Germany with the German Drug Regulatory Authorities and is available in the oral form without a prescription.68 DMPS is no longer available to clinicians in the US. DMPS is associated with a very low incidence of serious side effects,68 and its safety in general was evident from the observations made during the course of extensive IV administration (250 mg every 4 hours for consecutive days) in a young woman who had severe arsenic toxic- ity.71 The most commonly reported side effects associated with DMPS are nausea, weakness, vertigo, chills, fever, cutaneous reactions/itch- ing, erythema multiforme, and elevations of transaminases.69,71,72 An extensive review of the German literature about the pharmacokinetics, affinities for various metals, and side effects of DMPS is available.72 The recommended IV dose of DMPS is 3 to 5 mg/kg (not to exceed 250 mg to avoid hypotension). A detailed description of an extensively used oral DMPS provoca- tion protocol has been presented,68 as well as an IV DMPS provoca- tion protocol.6 To establish the basal urinary rate of metal excretion, the patient is instructed to fast overnight and collect a first-morning urine specimen. In the morning, with an empty stomach and after the bladder is emptied, the patient is given about 300 mg DMPS (5 to 10 mg/kg) orally or 3 to 5 mg/kg intravenously. All urine is col- lected for the subsequent 6 hours.68 A light meal (no seafood or fish) may be consumed about 2 hours after oral ingestion, and fluid con- sumption is encouraged. The specific laboratory instructions should be followed for shipping the specimen. Metals mobilized by DMPS are excreted primarily by the kidney and to a much lesser extent by the liver (biliary/fecal).68 Equilibrium and stability constants (in vitro) for various DMPS– metal complexes have been presented.83 In the clinical setting, DMPS is effective for the mobilization and excretion of bismuth, mercury (organic and inorganic), copper, lead, arsenic, antimony, nickel, tin, tungsten, and gold but does not affect thallium, aluminum, or uranium excretion. In the majority of adult patients, mercury is the predominant metal excreted after DMPS, and elevation of copper is normal (about five times higher than the preprovoked urine level). As mercury levels decline during detoxification therapy, it is common to see increased uri- nary levels of other metals, such as lead and tin, with subsequent chal- lenges. The shifting pattern of the metal species excreted is based on a

## 191CHAPTER 22 Metal Toxicity: Assessment of Exposure and Retention

combination of affinities of DMPS for the different metals as well as on mass competition for metal-binding sites. There are no well-established guidelines for the interpretation of the results of the DMPS challenge test. Therefore conclusions about toxicity cannot be made from the DMPS test results alone. Consideration has to be given to the overall medical examination, medical and exposure history, and presenting symptoms. If a decision is made to proceed with some form of detoxification ther- apy, the initial challenge result can serve as a reference point against which subsequent challenge results can be compared with to evaluate the efficacy of treatment. The levels of other toxic metals excreted should always be considered, and one should note that DMPS does not provide direct information as to the level of mercury present in the central ner- vous system. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to discuss protocols for metal detoxification, but it is emphasized that if a pharmaceutical metal complexing agent is to be used, the glomerular filtration rate must be assessed before initiation and periodically during the therapy. Some clinicians use transdermal DMPS for both diagnosis and treatment. However, one study found no measurable presence in blood or urinary DMPS after a standard dose.84

# DMSA

Another dithiol metal-complexing agent, DMSA, is also widely used for provocation testing, as well as detoxification therapy for lead, mer- cury species, and other sulfhydryl reactive metals (e.g., arsenic, anti- mony). Several studies demonstrated the effectiveness of DMSA to increase the urinary excretion of lead85–87 and mercury and decrease the blood levels of these metals.30,88–90 DMSA was approved by the FDA for lead detoxification in children with lead poisoning and is an agent of choice for lead detoxification in children and adults. DMSA appears to be considered by some to be the “new chelator” for lead. Only about 20% of orally administered DMSA is systemically available after a single dose.29 DMSA, when used in conjunction with Ca-Na 2 -EDTA, increases cumulative urinary lead excretion and ameliorates the Ca-EDTA–mediated redistribution of lead to soft tissues.81,91 DMSA is restricted to the extracellular com- partment and does not have direct access to the elements retained in the cells or interstitial fluid, and it does not appear to cross a healthy blood–brain barrier. In rodent models, however, DMSA has been demonstrated to be effective in decreasing the levels of lead and mer- cury in the brain.77,82,83,85 Animal studies also indicated greater efficacy of DMSA for lead detoxification when concomitantly administered with antioxidants.78,79 This is true for all bona fide metal-complexing and metal-chelating agents. N-acetyl cysteine alone appears to enhance lead excretion to a much lesser degree than DMSA, but in contrast, the potential effects of α -lipoic acid alone are equivocal. To date, no reliable studies have been published to indicate that lipoic acid is an effective metal-binding agent that has a net effect on metal excretion in humans, and the potential for lipoic acid–induced mercury redistribu- tion, particularly to the brain, is a significant consideration.86 DMSA is generally well tolerated with common but mild side effects, including GI bloating and/or gas, occasional loose stools, and skin rash. Assessment of liver enzyme levels is recommended before and periodically during extended administration. Compared with DMPS and Ca-EDTA, DMSA has minimal effects on essential elements such as copper and zinc. DMSA is excreted almost exclusively as a mixed disulfide with two mole- cules of cysteine.87 Thorough reviews of the pharmacokinetics and clinical use of DMSA have been presented.6,68,69,88 It should be noted that there is a tremendous difference between the DMSA protocol described for acute lead poisoning76 and that commonly used for chronic lead retention. Various protocols for DMSA provocation testing have been sug- gested.6,89 However, a convenient and productive provocation proto- col has been described that entails giving a single dose of DMSA orally (30 mg/kg, not more than 2 g) on an empty stomach and bladder fol- lowed by collection of all urine for the subsequent 6 hours.62 The peak rate of excretion of metals occurs after about 3 hours. The protocol is well tolerated, enhances compliance, and significantly reduces expo- sure to the compound. Patients should be advised in advance that their urine will transiently have a foul, sulfurous odor and that transient GI inconvenience may occur.

## Nonpharmaceutical Agents

Nonpharmaceutical compounds, such as N-acetyl-l-cysteine (N-AC) and potassium citrate (K-citrate), have been tested for efficacy as prov- ocation agents for mercury in one published study.62 Urinary mercury levels, expressed as micrograms per liter, were compared before and after a single oral dose of N-AC (30 mg/kg), K-citrate (5 g in 200 mL water), DMSA (30 mg/kg), or DMPS (Unithiol, 250 mg in 5 mL water). Basal urinary mercury levels (about 5 ug/L) were comparable for all of the treatment groups, each of which contained 16 to 65 multisymptom- atic subjects. All subjects either had dental amalgams or had recently undergone removal of amalgams. Urine was collected for 3 hours after the challenge compounds were given, except that urine was collected for only 2 hours after the DMPS. The different collection time for the DMPS prohibits valid comparisons of the effects of the other agents. The high bolus doses of N-AC and K-citrate significantly increased urinary mercury, by 131% and 83%, respectively, compared with basal values. Under these conditions of different collection times, DMSA and DMPS increased mercury excretion by 163% and 135%, respectively. No men- tion was made of the urine volumes associated with the different test groups, and, clearly, the data would have been easier to interpret had the results been standardized per gram urine creatinine. Grossly misleading values for urinary metals can be associated with the expression of excreted metals per unit volume because urinary output can vary considerably. No other data are currently available to permit further evaluation of the value of the nonpharmaceutical compounds as provocation agents. These two compounds also should be tested in animal models to determine whether they are associated with significant redistribution of metals among various tissues because neither is a true chelator, and their stability constants are relatively low. Currently, no definitive studies are available to assess the utility of parentally administered reduced glutathione as a direct metal-com- plexing agent. A final note about other routes of administration of var- ious authentic and potential metal detoxification agents, particularly with respect to provocation testing, is that the author has not been able to find any published research addressing the systemic bioavailability or efficacy of any agent that is given via a transdermal delivery system.

# FECAL METALS ANALYSIS

Several toxic metals, including mercury, lead, thallium, and cadmium, are naturally excreted primarily or partially in bile. Therefore under certain conditions, analysis of fecal metals, without provocation, may provide at least qualitative information about the rate of biliary excretion of assim- ilated metals. However, contaminated foods present a significant source of exposure to metals, and metals that have not been assimilated by the gastrointestinal tract can contribute overwhelmingly to the total amount of metals measured in a fecal specimen. In addition to dietary contamina- tion, fecal mercury is very much influenced by the amount of mercury that is present in the mouth in the form of mercury amalgams.90 Fecal mercury concentrations, expressed per gram of dry weight, are roughly an order of magnitude higher in people who have an average of six to eight medi- um-sized amalgams than in individuals who are amalgam-free.90 Day-to- day variability in fecal mercury levels in amalgam bearers is remarkably small. Fecal mercury levels are highly correlated with the number of

## 192SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

amalgams (Fig. 22.1). Further, it has been demonstrated that fecal mer- cury levels decline significantly after extraction of amalgams.91 Therefore levels of fecal metals generally are more a representation of exposure to metals than an indication of total body retention. Current research efforts are focusing on the identification of metal-complexing agents or phytonu- trients that increase the biliary/fecal excretion of metals. Fecal metals have been analyzed in autistic children (n = 54), and, on average, metal levels were significantly higher compared with those in age-matched, neurotypi- cal controls (n = 83).83 The reason for the higher levels in association with autism is not known, and pica is a possible issue that may contribute to higher levels of exposure in patients with autism.


Long-term, low-level exposure to environmental toxins is a growing global problem, and evidence is accumulating to link the bioaccumulation of toxic metals in humans to subtle and overt long-term toxic effects, poor health, and substantially increased disease risk. Increasing numbers of patients dis- satisfied with the care provided by clinicians who rely only on methods for the assessment of acute metal poisoning are seeking out clinicians who are aware of the value of tools that are yet to be accepted for the assessment of subacute metal toxicity. Analyses of metals in hair, blood, and urine all have advantages and disadvantages, and no single currently available labo- ratory test can unequivocally permit a valid diagnosis of “subclinical” metal toxicity. The results of the various tests discussed in this chapter, along with a complete medical examination, exposure history, and other findings, can be used to design a comprehensive therapeutic detoxification program. Table 22.1 provides an overview of the value of the various tests for assess- ing a patient’s potential problem with toxic elements. To close, it is empha- sized that there is a need for better chelating agents that have much greater volumes of distribution and the ability to safely cross a normal blood–brain barrier and directly remove neurotoxic elements from the central nervous system. Perhaps research toward finding a cure for Parkinson’s disease or premature dementia will provide such agents.

because the elements within blood cells represent 60 to 120 days of nutrient element exposure. Both compartments may be assessed with a whole-blood specimen, which may be preferred if an excess of a nutri- ent element, such as manganese, iron, or copper, is suspected.13

<!-- chunk -->

## Urine

Urine may be the preferred specimen for nutrients such as iodine.11 Urinary assessments require normal renal function for accuracy. Animal studies indicate that excess mineral consumption is excreted in the urine to maintain homeostasis, and excretion may rapidly decrease to reflect an insufficient intake of all minerals.20

## Hair

Hair may accurately reflect a nutrient element deficiency, and some hair mineral ratios have been associated with medical disorders.21 However, the research has been inconsistent. Newer studies are con- firming relationships between hair and blood for some nutrient elements and disproving others.22 Other studies are exploring the relationship between hair element concentrations and specific disease states.23 The interpretation of hair results may be confounded by the ease with which hair can be contaminated by external sources of expo- sure. With that proviso, hair analysis can accurately reflect exposure to, and absorption of, a limited number of elements (e.g., chromium) or deficiencies of others (e.g., copper). Research is ongoing to define the physiologic mechanisms that incorporate nutrient elements into hair tissues. Currently, for many mineral elements, a quantitative measure- ment from a hair sample may not represent a quantitative measure- ment of an ingested dose of mineral from the diet and supplements.24 In addition, external contamination may mask a deficiency or artifi- cially increase the amount of mineral element found in a hair sam- ple because external contaminants bind to the cysteine residues of the hair.25 The most appropriate use of hair analysis appears to be in the assessment of toxic metal exposure. The utility of hair analysis remains highly controversial; it remains an “unproven practice” according to the American Medical Association, yet it is approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the assessment of methylmercury and other toxic metals.26

# COLLECTION EQUIPMENT

Clinicians may employ whole-blood or urine analysis in the evalua- tion of mineral status because these fluids are the simplest and most economical to collect and transport.12,14 Tests of whole blood require no centrifugation and, like urine, require no special treatment other than collection, refrigeration, and shipping in approved containers. If samples of cellular blood components are collected, they must be centrifuged immediately per the laboratory’s instructions. If not cen- trifuged in a timely manner, cells may disintegrate, falsely increasing the amount of nutrient elements in the serum or plasma of the sam- ple and falsely decreasing the amount of nutrient element available in the surviving cells. Appropriate, mineral-free containers provided by the laboratory must be used with most element collections to prevent possible leaching of elements from collection devices or shipping con- tainers. Hair analysis has the benefit of convenience and low cost. Hair samples are noninvasive, are stable at room temperature, and require no onsite processing to improve sample quality.

# PREANALYTICAL VARIABLES

Preanalytical variables in the specimen-collection process occur before the receipt of a specimen by the laboratory.12,27,28 Careful attention to collection, preparation, and shipping may decrease preanalytical errors that may affect laboratory results. The timing of specimen collections may be important because some results may be affected by a recent intake of meals or medicines. Variables such as age, gender, ethnicity, time of day (diurnal rhythms), season, tobacco use, or the presence of comorbid conditions may alter analyte levels and must be borne in mind by the interpreting physician. Alterations in renal function may be particularly problematic for the collection of urine specimens. Liver disease or inflammation may alter the levels of acute-phase and metal- lothionein proteins that bind to nutrient elements and metals.29 Renal wasting disorders may increase urine levels and decrease blood levels of creatinine, minerals, and other analytes. Renal clearance disorders may decrease urine levels of creatinine, minerals, and other analytes.30 Medications, such as diuretics, may alter renal function and mineral levels; all medications may be reviewed with the patient’s pharmacist before interpreting results.

# METHODOLOGY

The analytical method used by a laboratory to assess nutrient elements and other metals must be sensitive, specific, accurate, precise, and timely.12 The detection limit of the methodology is important for the analysis of trace or “ultratrace” microminerals. Spectrometry meth- odologies, such as inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry or inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry, are con- sidered state of the art. Reputable laboratories are Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified, use highly trained per- sonnel, and choose to participate in third-party proficiency testing.31 Proficiency testing ensures the reproducibility and reliability of the laboratory’s internal quality control programs (IQCPs) and ensures reliable, reproducible results.32 Some of the quality controls that may be used in each batch of samples processed include the use of reagent blanks, the replication of analyses to ensure precision, and the use of certified reference samples with known amounts of the metals of inter- est to ensure accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. Reference values for some minerals have been standardized in the literature; for other ele- ments, laboratories must establish their own reference values.

# MINERALS AND DISEASE

Several minerals are required to maintain the necessary functions of life.12,11,33 Minerals may be considered essential if a deficiency (lack) of the mineral results in significant disease or death. Nonessential miner- als may affect physiologic function and have health benefits, but they have not yet been proven essential. Macrominerals are required in daily amounts of milligrams to grams; microminerals are required in daily amounts of micrograms to milligrams. Some minerals, such as elec- trolytes, dissociate into charged ions in the body fluids (electrolytes) and may be important in the maintenance of membrane potentials needed for muscle contractions and nerve conduction. Both macro- and microminerals are necessary cofactors in metabolic functions, and either an excess or a deficiency may be detrimental to health. Homeostatic regulation maintains the balance of nutrient elements in the body. Regulation mechanisms may include intestinal assimila- tion, protein chaperones for blood transportation, storage in body tis- sues, and excretion mechanisms (Fig. 23.1). Homeostatic mechanisms may be disrupted by genetics, poor diet, substances that block assimilation, toxins that displace minerals or compete for receptor sites on enzymes and cells, diseases of malab- sorption, liver disease, or renal disorders. Either over- or undernu- trition may be problematic for mineral homeostasis.34 High levels of meat consumption in Western diets may excessively raise iron levels, and consumption of processed foods may result in a dietary deficiency

of multiple minerals.35,36 Inherited mutations that disrupt mineral homeostasis are rare, but important, disruptors of patient health. The most common disorders include the iron-storage disorder hemochro- matosis, the copper disorders Wilson disease and Menkes syndrome, the zinc-deficiency disorder acrodermatitis enteropathica, and sul- fite oxidase deficiency (lack of molybdenum cofactor). The effects of inherited variation in the general population on mineral status is an important new area of research.37 Levels of various nutrient elements have been associated with dis- ease states and may be considered clinical biomarkers.8 Cirrhosis may lower levels of serum selenium,38 calcium,39 magnesium,40 and zinc.41 Emphysema or certain cancers may increase serum copper levels, and both copper and manganese levels may increase during congestive heart failure, infection, or psychoses.42 Heart tissue levels of selenium, iron, copper, zinc, and phosphorus have been associated with ejection fraction and cardiac index.43 In men infected with human immuno- deficiency virus (HIV), helper T-type 4 cells appear closely correlated with serum magnesium concentration.44 Although other associations have been observed between trace minerals and breast cancer,45 gastro- intestinal malignancy,46 and malignant ascites,47 there have been null studies for these conditions as well. It is important to remember that observed associations between certain disorders may be variable and based on patient status, ethnicity, or the stage of the disease when stud- ied; both may confound the results of such studies. The ratios between some trace elements have been associated with specific disorders. Levels of magnesium and copper, and their ratios, may be predictive for lower limb ischemia, atherosclerosis obliterans, and risk of aortic aneurysm.48 The relative concentrations of copper, zinc, and selenium in whole blood and thyroid tissue may present in specific patterns for various thyroid disorders and thyroid cancer. Serum copper and copper/zinc ratios were shown to be increased in breast cancer but not in benign breast diseases.49 In another study, serum copper-to-zinc ratios were shown to be of diagnostic and prog- nostic value in head, face, and neck cancer, with alterations in copper, zinc, and the copper-to-zinc ratio related to the stage of the disease.50 Clinicians specializing in the treatment of certain disorders may wish to review the literature for associations between mineral status and the disorder of interest.

# ESSENTIAL MACROMINERALS

<!-- chunk -->

## Calcium

Calcium is the most common cation in the body and the primary com- ponent of tooth and bone.51 Normal calcium levels are necessary for muscle contraction, enzyme function, protein stabilization, neuron firing, hormone release,52 and blood coagulation.53 Calcium may also act as a second messenger for some cell-signaling pathways. Calcium reserves in the body are maintained through multiple mechanisms, which include parathyroid hormone, dietary calcium intake, assimi- lation of calcium from the digestive tract, and renal calcium excretion. Disruption of these calcium homeostasis mechanisms may result in either hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia.54,55 The parathyroid gland monitors the blood calcium level and responds to low calcium concentrations by releasing parathyroid hor- mone (PTH). PTH increases the level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) and stimulates bone resorption to increase blood calcium levels. Serum calcium is so closely regulated by the parathyroid gland that its use as an indicator of calcium balance is not reliable when con- sidered in isolation. Calcium is also regulated as it is transported across cell membranes; calcium status affects the function of the endoplas- mic reticulum, the mitochondria,56 and the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells. Measurement of physiologically active ionized calcium may be more useful in the independent evaluation of calcium status. Hypercalcemia is defined as a total serum calcium concentration of greater than 10.4 mg/dL or an ionized serum calcium of greater than 5.2 mg/dL.55,57 Hypercalcemia may occur because of excessive bone resorption (immobilization), hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D toxicity, and the presence of cancer or granulomatous disorders. Hypercalcemia occurs when the kidney’s capacity to excrete calcium is exceeded. Mild hypercalcemia may be asymptomatic. More severe hypercalcemia may result in anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, fatigue, polyuria, arrhythmia, and hypertension.58 Severe hypercal- cemia may progress to symptoms of confusion, delirium, and coma. Hypercalcemia may induce renal insufficiency, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, kidney stones, or vascular and soft tissue calcifications. Hypocalcemia is defined as a total serum calcium concentration of less than 8.8 mg/dL or an ionized calcium level of less than 4.7 mg/dL with normal plasma proteins.55,59 Hypocalcemia may occur because of hypo- parathyroidism or pseudohypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency or dependency, magnesium deficiency, acute pancreatitis, hyperphospha- temia, or renal tubular disease. Renal tubular disease may increase cal- cium excretion into the urine or decrease the conversion of precursors into active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. During pregnancy, serum calcium and albumin levels may decrease. Medications, such as anticonvulsants, rifampin, furosemide, or bisphosphonates, may contribute to hypocal- cemia. Steroid medications may decrease the gastrointestinal absorption of calcium. Hypocalcemia is typically asymptomatic but may present with dry and scaly skin, brittle nails, coarse hair, muscle cramps (legs or back), swelling of the optic nerve (papilledema), and cardiac arrhythmia or neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, cognitive decline, or psychosis due to diffuse encephalopathy.58,59 More severe hypocal- cemia may progress to neuromuscular irritability (spasms, tetany) and sensory parasthesias. Hypocalcemia may be associated with liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, congestive heart failure, or malnutrition. Calcium may be evaluated in serum, whole blood, urine, or hair samples.54,55 Serum calcium is reported as total calcium (approxi- mately 40% protein-bound and 60% ionized calcium ions). High serum protein (albumin) levels may falsely elevate and low serum pro- tein levels may decrease serum calcium levels. A whole-blood analysis of calcium will assess calcium present in serum, the cell membranes, and intracellularly. Urinary calcium levels will reflect gastrointestinal assimilation, bone turnover, and renal filtration. Up to 300 mg/24 hours may be excreted by subjects on unrestricted diets. Hair calcium may reflect nutritional status, and the hair calcium-to-magnesium ratio has been associated with levels of coronary artery calcification in older subjects.60,61 Hair mineral deposition may also be altered by the presence of comorbid disorders.62 However, hair contamination may occur because of calcium-rich “hard” water or hair products (perms, dyes, bleaches).63

## 196SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

Calcium (Ca) may be considered in relation to phosphorus (P), and a Ca:P ratio of 1.3:1 has been suggested for the maintenance of bone density.64 Reduced calcium and increased phosphorus intake is com- mon in Western diets and results in a low Ca:P ratio. Food sources of calcium include dairy products, canned fish with bones (e.g., salmon, sardines), green leafy vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Assessment of dietary intake of calcium is confounded by multiple factors that affect absorp- tion, such as the quantity of fiber and other natural chelators in the diet,65 gastric acidity, the ratio of dietary calcium to phosphorus and magnesium, gut transit time, and other factors.

## Chloride

Because chloride is a halogen, most do not consider it a mineral, but technically it is classified as such. Chloride is the most common anion in the body and is primarily found in the extracellular blood compart- ment (serum or plasma).66,67 Chloride, with sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate, regulates water distribution, osmotic pressure, pH, and ion balance in the extracellular compartment of the blood. Chloride is necessary for the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach and is also essential in cellular pump functions. Chloride levels are regu- lated by renal excretion into urine, and chloride may also be excreted in sweat. Chloride is typically evaluated as part of an electrolyte (serum elements) panel; levels of chloride (Cl) and sodium (Na) indicate the amount of salt (NaCl) in the blood. Symptoms of an electrolyte imbalance may include chronic vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, or respi- ratory distress. Chloride and other electrolytes may become imbal- anced during episodes of metabolic or respiratory acidosis or alkalosis. Renal disorders may also disrupt electrolyte balances.68 Dehydration, diuretic medications, and high doses of either antacids or baking soda may lower chloride levels. Glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid med- ications may alter electrolyte balance and increase urine output.69 Chloride ions are obtained through the diet and normally pass easily through the intestinal barrier. Chloride may be evaluated in serum and urine, and urinary chlo- ride is a necessary component of a full electrolyte assessment or meta- bolic panel.66,67 Chloride sweat testing may be used in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.70 Urine chloride analysis, and often the analysis of urine sodium as well, may be important when considering alkalosis or acidosis or when assessing high or low serum chloride levels. Depending on the patient’s condition, serum and urine chloride levels may differ. Urinary chloride may help determine whether chloride loss is related to salt loss or due to an excess of adrenal hormones (cortisol or aldosterone), which may alter electrolyte excretion. Increased serum chloride (hyperchlor- emia) may occur because of dehydration, Cushing disease, or kidney disease (renal clearance disorders). Acid–base dysregulation resulting in metabolic acidosis or respiratory alkalosis may also increase serum chloride.71 Low serum chloride (hypochloremia) may occur because of congestive heart failure, chronic vomiting, or Addison disease. Lung diseases, such as emphysema, may result in chronic respiratory acido- sis and metabolic alkalosis, lowering serum chloride. Decreased urinary chloride may occur because of Cushing disease, primary aldosteronism, congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal malabsorption, or diarrhea. Increased urinary chloride may occur because of dehydration, Addison disease, high salt intake, or insufficient calorie intake. If both urinary chloride and sodium are elevated in a patient on a salt-restricted diet, the patient may not be diet-compliant. See Chapter 12, Fantus Test, for the use of urinary chloride as a measure of salt consumption.

## Magnesium

Magnesium is a cation found primarily in the intracellular (35%–45%) compartment of the blood.55,72,73 Up to 55% of magnesium is found in bone, and this reservoir may be mobilized for the maintenance of serum levels. Serum magnesium levels may affect nerve conduction, muscle contraction, and cardiovascular functions. Transportation of magnesium across the cell membrane is regulated by dedicated trans- porters. Magnesium is a cofactor for over 300 intracellular enzymes that participate in energy production, oxidative phosphorylation, gly- colysis, cell replication, nucleotide (DNA) metabolism, and protein synthesis. Approximately 80% of a cell’s magnesium is bound to ATP, which helps make the ATP bioactive.74 Hypermagnesemia (serum concentration >2.6 mg/dL) is uncom- mon without magnesium supplementation (or ingested as laxatives or antacids).75 Other causes may include renal failure, hyperparathy- roidism, dehydration, early diabetic acidosis, Addison disease, rhab- domyolysis (muscle breakdown), or a history of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. Increased serum magnesium and copper levels may be seen with seizure disorders. High magnesium concentrations may decrease serum calcium levels. Medications that may increase mag- nesium levels include aspirin, thyroid medication, potassium-sparing diuretics, lithium carbonate, and antibiotics (review medications with a pharmacist).74 Magnesium intoxication may occur if magnesium is supplemented and renal failure is present. Deep tendon reflexes are lost as magnesium levels increase above 5 mg/dL. As levels rise higher, magnesium depresses the nervous system; symptoms of magnesium intoxication may include hyporeflexia, hypotension, lethargy, disori- entation, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrhythmia leading to cardiac arrest (>15 mg/dL). Hypomagnesemia occurs because of inadequate magnesium intake, malabsorption, or increased excretion from the kidney or gastrointes- tinal tract.76 Low magnesium concentrations may be associated with poor diet, alcoholism, inflammatory bowel disorders, poorly con- trolled diabetes, chronic diarrhea, recent hospitalization or surgery, or toxemia of pregnancy.77 Magnesium blood levels are also lower in the second and third trimesters of a normal pregnancy. Medications such as proton-pump inhibitors, antacids, diuretics, digoxin, insulin, laxa- tives, phenytoin, glucocorticoids, steroid hormones, hormone antag- onists, some antibiotics, antihistamines, and antivirals may decrease magnesium levels (review medications with a pharmacist).74 High doses of calcium, vitamin D, or caffeine may further exacerbate magne- sium losses. Low magnesium concentrations may result in symptoms of neuromuscular excitability (muscle cramps, spasms) or cardiac arrhythmia. Good dietary sources include green leafy vegetables, nuts, soybeans, and cocoa mass. Hard water may contain magnesium salts and contribute to magnesium intake. Serum magnesium may be the most commonly used but least accurate assessment of magnesium status.55 The serum magnesium concentration may be influenced by recent dietary intake and other factors; it constitutes only about 1% to 3% of total body magnesium and does not reflect magnesium levels in cells.77 The binding of mag- nesium to serum proteins is subject to many uncontrollable variables. Serum magnesium levels as low as 1.2 mEq/L have been measured in patients with normal total body magnesium.78 Measurement of mag- nesium status presents some difficulties; currently, the magnesium retention (load or tolerance) test may be the most accurate, although cumbersome, method of assessment in adults.79 The retention test requires a parenteral infusion of magnesium with subsequent urine collection to evaluate urinary magnesium.80 Other methods of assessing magnesium include ionized magne- sium concentrations (in blood, plasma, or serum), urinary magne- sium, and erythrocyte concentrations.55 Erythrocyte concentrations of magnesium are not subject to the same transient fluctuations as serum and may be more reliable indicators of status than serum levels.81 The analysis of white blood cell (WBC) magnesium content has also been

## 197CHAPTER 23 Mineral Status Evaluation

explored. The concentration of magnesium in leukocytes has been inversely associated with the risk of tachyarrhythmias. WBC assess- ments of magnesium may not be accurate in all patients; inherited variation in the MAGT1 magnesium transporter gene82 may reduce the amount of magnesium in WBCs and result in a form of immunodefi- ciency. The best test to evaluate total body magnesium sufficiency may well be whole-blood analysis because this will assess total magnesium in serum, intracellularly, and in the cell membranes of both red blood cells (RBCs) and WBCs. Ionized magnesium and total magnesium appear to provide similar information.83 Increased urinary excretion in individuals with type 1 diabetes has been shown to decrease erythro- cyte levels, without significant hypomagnesemia.84 A 24-hour urinary magnesium may be useful to reflect dietary changes in magnesium intake.85 Healthy kidneys restrict the excretion of magnesium when concentrations or intakes are low and permit excretion when serum levels are restored. The current scientific literature remains divided in regard to hair Mg levels reflecting intracellular levels. External Mg con- tamination of hair may result from recent hair treatment, hair color, or hard water exposure, confounding hair element evaluations.

## Phosphorus

The element phosphorus is a necessary component in cell membranes, DNA, and RNA.55,86 Phosphorus is primarily used in bone mineraliza- tion (85%), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) metabolism, pH homeo- stasis, and cell signaling. Phosphorus is bound to oxygen in all living systems and is found in the body as phosphate (PO 4 3–). Phosphorus, in the form of phosphoryl groups (PO 3 ), is attached to and removed from molecules during cell signaling. Phosphorus homeostasis is regulated by the parathyroid gland and vitamin D. Hyperphosphatemia may occur because of renal insufficiency (GFR < 30 mL/min), hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism (hor- mone resistance), or granulomatous disease (immunodeficiency).86,87 Less commonly, hyperphosphatemia may occur because of diabetic ketoacidosis, rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis syndrome (cancer therapy), and excessive exercise or occasionally because of the excessive use of oral or rectal (enema) phosphate salts. The condition is asymptom- atic but may present with symptoms if hypocalcemia is also present (dry and scaly skin, brittle nails, coarse hair, muscle cramps [legs or back], swelling of the optic nerve [papilledema], cardiac arrhythmia, or neuropsychiatric symptoms). Elevated serum phosphate has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, heart fail- ure, and kidney disease. Chronic hyperphosphatemia may induce the precipitation of calcium into vascular and soft tissues; the calcifications may appear on imaging studies. The kidney normally compensates for low phosphorus intake. Hypophosphatemia occurs when serum phosphate is less than 2.5 mg/ dL.86,88 Symptoms of hypophosphatemia may include anorexia, ane- mia, muscle weakness, bone pain, increased susceptibility to infections, peripheral parasthesias, loss of coordination, or respiratory distress. In children, chronic hypophosphatemia may present as rickets; in adults, it may present as osteomalacia. Causes of hypophosphatemia include alcoholism, respiratory alkalosis, the recovery phase of diabetic keto- acidosis, hyperparathyroidism, Cushing syndrome, hypothyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, malabsorption syndromes, renal wasting, severe anorexia nervosa, or the presence of other electrolyte imbalances (hypomagnesemia or hypokalemia). The excessive use of theophylline (respiratory inhalers) or antacids and the chronic use of diuretic med- ications may also deplete phosphate levels. Phosphate is measured in serum, plasma, or urine.55 Serum or plasma phosphate results may be compromised if specimens are hemolyzed, have a high fat content, or have high bilirubin concentra- tions. With normal renal function, urinary phosphorus reflects dietary status. Hair phosphorus has not been documented to reflect dietary status or biochemical phosphorus status.

## Potassium

Potassium is the primary intracellular cation.89–91 Intracellular potassium concentrations may be 30 times higher than serum or plasma levels. The high intracellular levels are maintained by adenosine triphosphate (ATP)- dependent cell membrane transporters, which exchange sodium for potassium. The sodium–potassium “pumps” are essential for the main- tenance of the ionic gradients (membrane potentials) needed for muscle contractions and nerve conduction. Potassium diffuses out of cells with the concentration gradient if the pump’s activity is inhibited. The kidney is slow to adapt to changes in potassium concentrations in the blood. Hyperkalemia is defined as a serum potassium concentration of greater than 5.5 mEq/L.89,90,92 Symptoms of hyperkalemia may include peripheral tingling or paresthesias; muscle weakness, which rarely progresses to flaccid paralysis; and cardiac arrhythmia, which may progress to ventricular fibrillation or asystole. Hyperkalemia may be asymptomatic until arrhythmias occur. The causes may include increased potassium intake (supplements), kidney injury or chronic renal disease that decrease excretion, hypoaldosteronism, Addison disease (with sodium depletion), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (salt wasting), metabolic acidosis, and dehydration. The ingestion of large amounts of fruit or fruit juices may increase potassium levels. Medications that may contribute to hyperkalemia include potassi- um-sparing diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhib- itors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), heparin, digitalis, α - and β -blocker antihypertensives, and angiotensin recep- tor blockers. “Pseudohyperkalemia” may occur if comorbid platelet, erythrocyte, or mixed-type blood disorders are present and may result in preanalytical platelet activation or hemolysis.93 It can also occur from excessive, long-term consumption of glycyrrhizin from licorice root. Plasma potassium may be more accurate in such patients. Hypokalemia is defined as a serum potassium concentration of less than 3.5 mEq/L.89,90,94 Hypokalemia may be most apparent in eryth- rocytes; potassium is primarily an intracellular electrolyte.95 Symptoms of potassium loss may begin with fatigue or muscle weakness and cramping and progress to tetany, rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown), respiratory distress, muscle and intestinal paralysis (bloating, consti- pation, pain), and cardiac arrhythmias. Chronic hypokalemia may impair the kidney’s ability to concentrate urine and result in polyuria (excessive urination) and polydipsia (excessive thirst). Hypokalemia is usually caused by decreased potassium intake or increased potassium losses from the gastrointestinal tract or the kidney. Gastrointestinal losses may be precipitated by severe or chronic vomiting or diar- rhea, laxative abuse, bowel diversion surgery, villous adenoma of the colon (rare), or the ingestion of bentonite clay (binds potassium). Renal losses may occur because of Cushing syndrome, hyperaldoste- ronism, congenital renal hyperplasia, acquired renal tubular dysfunc- tion, or inherited renal-wasting disorders (Bartter, Gitelman, Liddle, or Fanconi syndrome). Hypomagnesemia may induce increased renal excretion of potassium, as may excessive intake of glycyrrhizin, a com- ponent of black licorice candies and licorice root herbal supplements. A potassium shift from the intracellular to the extracellular compart- ment may occur because of hyperthyroidism or the rare, inherited condition familial periodic paralysis. Medications that may contribute to hypokalemia include β -adrenergic agonists, decongestants, bron- chodilators, diuretics, mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, antibiotics, caffeine, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, and labor-suppressing medi- cations. Fruits, vegetables, seeds, and nuts are good dietary sources of potassium. Potassium supplements may be required by some individu- als, but their use must be carefully monitored.

## 198SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

Potassium concentrations may be evaluated in serum, plasma, erythrocytes, whole blood, or urine.89 Hair potassium has not currently been associated with either dietary intake or nutrient status. Reference values are different for plasma and serum samples. Platelets rupture during coagulation, and the increased potassium is found in the serum, so the serum reference values are higher. The patient’s platelet count may have an effect on the potassium level in serum samples as well; high platelet counts (thrombocythemia, thrombocytosis) may result in pseudohyperkalemia. Blood samples must be processed quickly and correctly to prevent preanalytical errors that may occur. Cooling of a sample before separation may falsely increase serum or plasma potas- sium levels. Leaving unseparated samples at room temperature for long periods before processing may falsely lower serum or plasma potas- sium levels. Delayed transport, rough handling, or failure to release the arm tourniquet before blood collection may cause tissue damage and falsely elevate potassium samples as erythrocytes break open. In addition, serum or plasma concentrations may not reflect intracellular losses during early potassium deficiency. The renal tubular response is slow to adapt to potassium depletion and may take a week or more to adjust ion exchanges and conserve potassium. Erythrocyte (RBC) potassium concentrations may be a more accu- rate indicator of the potassium content in other types of cells than serum or plasma.95 Although RBCs do not have nuclei, the sodium– potassium membrane pump that maintains the proper influx and efflux of these ions is intact and may respond quickly to restore intra- cellular levels when potassium becomes available. The rapid restoration of intracellular levels is essential for the continued firing of neurons and for cardiac contractility. Reduced intracellular levels have been associated with changes in the cardiac recovery phase (electrocardio- grams).96 Evidence indicates that obesity may decrease the efficiency of the sodium–potassium pumps.97 The whole-blood potassium concen- tration may be almost as accurate as the RBC potassium level because 98% of potassium is intracellular.98 Urinary potassium may be used to confirm and diagnose abnormal blood potassium levels.89 Urinary renal excretion of potassium is also used to estimate daily potassium intakes. A 24-hour collection is the preferred reference method, although collections of shorter duration (7 p.m.–7 a.m.) may also be acceptable.99 Within the reference values, the highest tertile (third) of potassium excretion has been associated with a decreased risk of hypertension,100 cardiovascular events, and mortality.101 Urinary potassium concentrations may decrease because of low aldosterone levels or the use of medications such as NSAIDs, beta blockers, or pharmaceutical lithium. Urinary potassium lev- els may increase because of renal disease or rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown).

Sodium is the primary cation in the extracellular fluid.89,102 The sodium–potassium ATPase pumps maintain the intracellular potas- sium and extracellular sodium concentration gradients and establish the membrane potentials necessary for neuron firing, cardiac function, and muscle contraction. Sodium is evaluated as part of an electro- lyte (serum elements) panel; levels of sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) indicate the amount of salt (NaCl) in the blood.103 Symptoms of an electrolyte imbalance may include chronic vomiting, diarrhea, weak- ness, or respiratory distress. Electrolytes are commonly monitored in patients with hypertension, heart failure, and liver or kidney disease. Sodium is absorbed by the gastrointestinal system, and the kidneys excrete all but 1 to 2 meEq/L of the approximately 200 meEq/L of sodium chloride ingested daily. Sodium, with chloride, potassium, and bicarbon- ate, regulates water distribution, osmotic pressure, pH, and ion balance in the extracellular compartment of the blood. Disruption of the body’s fluid volume or fluid-compartment equilibrium may occur if there is a loss, gain, or inappropriate retention of either sodium or water. The regulation of extracellular water and sodium status occurs in the renal tubules of the kidneys. The extracellular fluid volume includes the blood volume, and signaling systems that regulate blood pressure, including the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, antidiuretic hormone, and renal dopamine, may alter sodium and water regulation in the kidney. Hypernatremia is a hyperosmolar condition, defined as serum sodium of greater than 145 mEq/L, and occurs when water loss is greater than water intake.102,104 Hypernatremia is uncommon with normal kidney function but may occur because of dehydration, Cushing syn- drome, diabetes insipidus, adrenal tumors (secrete deoxycorticoste- rone), congenital adrenal hyperplasia, osmotic diarrhea, hypothalamic disorders, or an impaired thirst mechanism.105 Hypernatremia may be more common in the aged, those with impaired mental status, and infants because these individuals may have difficulty rehydrating unas- sisted. Hypernatremia commonly presents with thirst and proceeds to neurologic symptoms (confusion, agitation, dry mucous membranes, decreased urination, muscle spasms, parasthesias, tremors, ataxia, sei- zures, coma) as water shifts from cells into the extracellular compart- ment. Medications such as anabolic steroids, diuretics, glucocorticoids, laxatives, cough medications, and oral contraceptives may increase sodium levels (review medications with a pharmacist). Hypernatremia resulting from salt ingestion rarely occurs with normal renal function. The treatment of hypernatremia depends on the water (fluid) status of the patient. Hypernatremia may be hypovolemic (extracellular water loss greater than sodium loss), euvolemic (increased sodium but nor- mal extracellular water levels), or hypervolemic (sodium levels increase and extracellular water increases). Urine sodium and osmolality may be used with serum assessments to determine whether the kidney is the cause. Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium level of less than mEq/L and indicates an excess of extracellular water volume compared with sodium concentration.89,102,106 Low serum sodium levels may be caused by a water–sodium imbalance or by the presence of excess glu- cose or lipids in the blood (“pseudohyponatremia”). Causes of sodium loss may include diarrhea or vomiting, renal disease or injury, min- eralocorticoid deficiency, Addison disease, hypothyroidism, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), cirrhosis, heart failure, pancreatitis, rhabdomyolysis, physical or emotional dis- tress (increased vasopressin), small bowel obstruction, or increased fluid intake. Endurance or extreme sports athletes may ingest large quantities of water during events and experience acute hyponatre- mia if they do not replace salt as well. Symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea, weakness, confusion, and lethargy and may prog- ress to ocular palsy, confusion, and coma if the sodium loss becomes severe. Medications that may contribute to hyponatremia include thi- azide diuretics, barbiturates, carbamazepine, chlorpropamide, clofi- brate, opioids, tolbutamide, ACE inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, NSAIDs, and vincristine. Dietary sources primarily include table salt, sea vegetables (e.g., kelp, seaweed), dairy products, and spinach. Hyponatremia may occur during isosmotic, hyperosmotic, or hypoosmotic conditions.89,106,107 Isosmotic hyponatremia is actually pseudohyponatreima; plasma sodium is decreased, but osmolality, glucose, and urea levels are normal. The phenomenon is exclusive to samples assessed using flame emission spectrophotometry or ion- selective electrodes and only occurs in samples from patients with hyperproteinemia or severe hyperlipidemia. Hyperosmotic hypona- tremia occurs most commonly because of severe hyperglycemia as the water and sodium shift compartments to compensate for the excess glucose. Sodium levels will decrease about 1.6 mEq/L for every 100 mg/ dL increase in glucose.

## 199CHAPTER 23 Mineral Status Evaluation

Hypoosmotic hyponatremia occurs because of a greater loss of sodium (depletional) compared with water or because of an increase in the extracellular water volume (dilutional). Depletional hyponatremia presents clinically with orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased skin turgor (“tenting”). Low urine sodium during depletional hyponatremia indicates an appro- priate renal response; the loss is likely from the gastrointestinal tract or the skin (excessive sweating). High urine sodium indicates renal wasting of sodium, metabolic alkalosis, or the use of thiazide diuret- ics. Dilutional hyponatremia occurs because of water retention and presents clinically as weight gain or edema. This may occur because of renal disease or nephrotic syndrome, congestive heart failure, or hepatic cirrhosis. If hypoosmotic hyponatremia presents with normal extracellular water volume, likely causes include SIADH and deliberate excess water intake. Sodium is most commonly measured in blood or urine, although it may also be measured in sweat, feces, and gastrointestinal fluids.89 Whole blood, serum, or heparinized plasma may all be used to assess sodium concentrations, although no information on the status of the extracellular compartment will be available from whole-blood anal- ysis. Urinary sodium is always evaluated as a component of sodium blood level evaluations. Urinary sodium may be increased because of an increased blood sodium level, Addison’s disease, diuretic use, or renal wasting of sodium. Higher urinary sodium levels have been asso- ciated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality.108 Urinary sodium levels may be low because blood levels are low; because urinary excretion of sodium is compromised (nephrotic syndrome); or because of dehydration, congestive heart failure, or liver disease.

## Copper

Copper is an essential component of copper-incorporating oxi- dase enzymes and other metalloproteins.12,109,110 Copper-dependent enzymes are necessary for energy production (cytochrome c oxidase), collagen cross-linking, hemoglobin synthesis, norepinephrine synthe- sis, histamine catabolism (diamine oxidase), melanin synthesis, and antioxidant status (superoxide dismutase). Two thirds (about 60 mg) of total body copper is sequestered in bone or muscle tissues. Free cop- per ions may interact with cellular components to generate free radi- cals. Special “chaperone” proteins keep intracellular copper bound to prevent this cellular damage by free copper ions; however, inherited variations in chaperone proteins may compromise their ability to bind copper.111 Copper absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is bound to albumin and transported to the liver. Ninety percent of the copper exported from the liver is bound to ceruloplasmin; urinary excretion is limited to ionic, not bound, copper. Both copper excesses and deficien- cies may be inherited or acquired. Inherited conditions are the result of genetic mutations and are usually X-linked (maternal inheritance). Acquired conditions may be the result of environmental exposures or supplementation choices. Excess copper in the body may have toxic effects.12,109,110,112 High levels of intracellular copper may inhibit protein synthesis or gene expression. Copper excess may be acquired or the result of inheritance. True acquired toxicity (poisoning) is rare but may occur because of contamination (storage of acidic foods or beverages in copper con- tainers, contaminated water, or cooking in corroded copper or with brass utensils). Symptoms after ingestion may include nausea, vom- iting, and diarrhea. Excess copper is primarily excreted in the bile, and liver disorders that decrease bile excretion may increase copper levels. Subclinical acquired copper excess may require a liver biopsy with visualization of Mallory hyaline bodies for confirmation. Rarely, large amounts of copper may be accidentally absorbed through the skin or ingested (gram quantities). Symptoms may then progress to hepatotoxicity, hemolytic anemia, and anuria (renal failure) and may result in death if not promptly treated. High copper levels may be seen with rheumatoid arthritis and some types of cancers. Serum copper and magnesium may be increased with seizure disorders.113 The use of carbamazepine or phenobarbital may increase copper blood levels (review medications with a pharmacist). Individuals with Wilson dis- ease, a genetic disorder of impaired copper transportation, may be at risk for toxic effects at copper intake levels considered normal for the average population and may present with low ceruloplasmin; Kayser– Fleischer rings in the cornea; and hepatic, neurologic, psychiatric, or reproductive disorders.114 Clinical hypocupremia is rarely noted because of dietary defi- ciency.12,109,110,112 Acquired copper deficiencies may occur because of childhood protein deficiency (kwashiorkor), persistent infant diarrhea (cow’s milk–based diet), malabsorption syndromes, gastric surgery, or excessive zinc supplementation (>50 mg daily). Copper deficiency may delay normal development or result in symptoms of neutropenia, osteopenia, myelopathy, neuropathy, optic neuritis, and iron-resis- tant hypochromic anemia. Levels of serum copper and ceruloplasmin may, or may not, be low. Copper deficiency may be found in associa- tion with premature birth, cystic fibrosis, or aceruloplasminemia (iron deposition). Menkes syndrome is an X-linked mutation in males that results in low ceruloplasmin and low copper levels in serum, the liver, and copper-dependent proteins. Severe symptoms (intellectual disabil- ity, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypopigmentation, skeletal changes, hair texture changes, arterial ruptures) occur in affected individuals, and the diagnosis is usually made in early childhood. Individuals with less severe disease may have partial enzyme activity and a milder form of the disease (occipital horn syndrome). Subcutaneous injections may restore periph- eral copper levels, but passage through the blood–brain barrier remains limited. Dietary copper sources include beans, eggs, fish, fresh fruits, liver, milk, mushrooms, nuts, oysters, peas, poultry, and whole grains. Copper may be evaluated in serum, plasma, whole blood, erythro- cytes, urine, stool, and hair.11,12 Hair may provide an estimate of nutri- tional copper status, and hair copper levels may increase or decrease in certain disease states.115–117 However, hair cannot discern the presence or absence of inherited copper metabolic disorders, and hair may be easily contaminated by copper-based products used in pools, hot tubs, or plumbing. Fecal copper levels reflect excess dietary copper from bile excretion and unassimilated dietary copper in the stool. Urinary copper reflects the excretion of ionic copper and may be used in conjunction with blood levels to assess the presence of inherited copper metabolic disorders. Accurate urinary copper assessments require normal renal function. Urinary copper may be very high if patients with Wilson disease are treated with chelators during urine collection. Wilson dis- ease is diagnosed when serum ceruloplasmin is low but urinary cop- per excretion is high.114 Menkes disease is likely if blood, urine, and hepatic copper levels are low. The most frequently used assessments of copper status are serum or plasma copper and ceruloplasmin.11 If excess copper intake or exposure is suspected, then whole blood (total copper) and ceruloplasmin may be the best choice because the sam- ple includes both intracellular and extracellular copper. Erythrocyte copper may have some utility in certain patient populations, such as patients with Alzheimer’s disease, where elevated RBC copper has been found in Alzheimer’s subjects but not in controls.118

## Iodine

The element iodine, ingested as the compound iodide, is essential for the synthesis of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodo- thyronine (T3).19,119 Metabolic activity (ATP production, protein

## 200SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

synthesis, enzyme activity, development of skeleton and nervous sys- tem, etc.) is regulated by thyroid activity. Thyroid function is regu- lated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary gland, which increases the uptake of iodine by the gland. Approximately μ g of iodine is used to synthesize thyroid hormones daily. A healthy thy- roid gland concentrates about 75% of total body iodine (15–20 mg). Iodide intake varies based on location and the amount of iodide avail- able in the soil. Landlocked populations and those at higher altitudes, far from the ocean, may be more at risk of iodine deficiency. The accu- mulation of radioactive iodine (131I) in the body may occur after acci- dental emissions from nuclear power plants and increase the risk of developing thyroid cancer; the uptake of 131I is less likely with adequate iodine status. Iodine excess may occur if doses of greater than 1.1 mg daily are chronically ingested by iodine-sufficient adults.120,121 Exceeding this dose may increase the risk of iodine-induced dysfunction in suscepti- ble populations, such as individuals with iodine deficiency, preexisting thyroid disease, the elderly, neonates, or during pregnancy (prena- tal exposure). Although there are biological mechanisms in place to control thyroid hormone synthesis during iodine excess,122 the iodine exposure may also increase TSH and the risk of goiter and hypothy- roidism in some susceptible individuals and in neonates.123 Excess iodine may also increase the risk of thyroiditis and thyroid papillary cancer. The accidental ingestion of more than 50 mg of iodine daily for 2 months by 43 older adults occurred during a study, and the effects were reviewed in a separate study.124 Of the 43 subjects taking the high iodide dose, 10 subjects developed hypothyroidism (elevated TSH) while taking the iodide; all but two had returned to normal TSH lev- els 1 month after discontinuing the iodide supplement. Three subjects developed hyperthyroidism (low TSH) while taking the iodide dose, which persisted 1 month after discontinuation. High levels of iodine exposure may occur if iodinated radiographic contrasts or medications such as amiodarone are used (review medications with pharmacist). Iodine excess may result in symptoms of increased salivation, gastro- intestinal irritation, acne-like skin lesions, and a brassy taste in the mouth. Acute iodine poisoning may include symptoms of a burning feeling in the mouth, throat, and stomach; fever; nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; weak pulse; and cyanosis. Symptoms may progress to coma. High doses of iodine may be contraindicated with antithyroid medi- cations, ACE inhibitors, and potassium-sparing diuretics and during pregnancy. Large doses of potassium iodide may decrease the efficacy of the anticoagulant coumarin. Iodine deficiency may result in various disorders.119–121 If iodine intake is less than μ g per day, TSH levels will rise. During defi- ciency, the thyroid gland is stimulated by increasing levels of TSH and increases in size because of overstimulation by TSH (colloid goiter). Most individuals remain euthyroid, but if iodine deficiency is severe, hypothyroidism may result. Iodine deficiency in adults may impair cognitive function and is the most common cause of goitrous hypo- thyroidism. Perinatal iodine restriction may have permanent develop- mental effects on cognition and may result in lower IQ levels. During pregnancy, iodine requirements roughly double. Maternal deficiency may increase the risk of attention deficit and hyperactivity. Severe maternal deficiency (development of goiter) causes cretinism (cogni- tive impairment, deafness, motor impairments, poor growth, devel- opmental delay), miscarriage, or stillbirth. Food sources of iodine include sea vegetables, seafood, dairy, eggs, and grains; all food sources are highly variable in iodine content due to local conditions and production practices. Dietary iodide is easily assimilated by the gas- trointestinal tract, but consumption of goitrogenic (soy, cassava, cruci- ferous vegetables, some beans, millet, and sweet potato varieties) foods may prevent uptake. Iodized table salt may be an acceptable source of iodide; however, restaurants and processed food manufacturers rarely use iodized salt in food production. Adequate selenium, iron, and vitamin A are required to support iodine use by the thyroid gland. Tobacco use may impair iodine uptake by the thyroid gland. The pres- ence of intestinal parasites, such as Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, or Entamoeba histolytica, may prevent iodide absorption by the gastroin- testinal tract.125 Many environmental toxins, especially metals, impair iodine absorption and utilization (see Chapter 183, Hypothyroidism). Urinary iodine is the international standard for the evaluation of iodine status because more than 90% of dietary iodine is excreted in the urine within 24 to 48 hours of ingestion.11 Although often used as a surrogate,126 the assessment of serum thyroid biomarkers has limited utility in the evaluation of iodine status.127,128 Whereas some studies show no association between TSH, T4, and urine iodine levels, other studies indicate that serum T4 may be a conditionally useful biomarker in children and adults. Interventional studies indicate that serum TSH levels may be reflective of iodine status in newborns but are not a sensi- tive indicator of iodine status in developing children or adults, although serum thyroglobulin may be used in school-aged children. Similar stud- ies indicate that serum TSH may be a useful indicator of iodine status in pregnant or nursing women. Serum T4 is not considered accurate for pregnant or nursing women. For serum T4 to be an accurate surrogate for iodine, there must be a moderate baseline T4 status. Iodine intake over the past few days is best reflected in urinary iodine assessments. The World Health Organization defines iodine deficiency as median urinary iodine concentrations of less than μ g/L (< μ g/L during pregnancy).126 Urinary iodine excretion of greater than μ g (> μ g during pregnancy) is considered exces- sive. Urinary iodine of less than μ g/L is considered severe deficiency. Multiple 24-hour urine collections are recommended to estimate iodine intake in individual subjects. It has been suggested, in a non– peer-reviewed trade magazine, that whole-body sufficiency of iodine may be assessed in urine using an “iodine loading test.” The interpreta- tion of the results of this test presupposes specific receptor/storage sites that take up and store iodine/iodide.129 When body storage of iodine/ iodide is optimal, the percentage excretion of an oral loading dose of iodine/iodide excreted in urine is maximal; some authors purport that body stores are optimal when excretion is 90% or more.

## Iron

Iron is distributed into virtually all compartments in the body.130 Iron is used by peroxidase, cytochrome, and other enzymes, such as cysta- thionine- β -synthase (CBS) and enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Iron is found in nonenyzme proteins such as hemoglobin, myoglo- bin, and mitochondrial iron–sulfur clusters131; storage proteins such as ferritin or hemosiderin; and in the transport protein apo-transfer- rin. Strict conservation of iron stores in the body, even when iron is in excess, results in the loss of approximately only 1% of total body iron daily. Regulation of iron intake occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, where iron assimilation may be modulated by hepcidin so that about milligram of iron is absorbed daily.132 Both iron excess (overload) and iron deficiency may impair homeostasis133; the abnormal distribution of iron during various disease processes may contribute to their symp- tomology and presentation. Iron overload may be acquired or hereditary.132,134 Acquired iron overload (hemosiderosis) may occur because of excessive iron therapy, hemodialysis, multiple blood transfusions (for sideroblastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, pyruvate kinase deficiency, and thalassemia major), acute overdose, chronic liver disease, or alcoholism. Individuals with β -thalassemia intermedia may develop iron overload because of increased intestinal absorption. An acute iron overdose damages organs and intestines, resulting in vomiting and diarrhea.

## 201CHAPTER 23 Mineral Status Evaluation

Hereditary hemochromatosis occurs primarily in Caucasians of Northern European descent and is the result of mutations in the HFE gene. The disease is characterized by iron accumulation in the liver and other organs (C282Y homozygous or C282Y heterozygous together with a heterozygous H63D or S55C).135 Early symptoms include fatigue and lethargy; characteristic late symptoms include bronzing of the skin (palms), cirrhosis, diabetes, and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and neurodegenerative diseases.132,133,136 Juvenile hereditary hemochromatosis, from mutations in the HEF2 or HAMP genes, results in symptoms that present before 30 years of age and that include hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, cardiomyopathy, arthropathy, and liver fibrosis or cirrhosis.137 Other mutations result in African iron overload (also known as Bantu siderosis) and ferropro- tein deficiency, iron-storage diseases that deposit iron primarily into macrophages. Inherited disorders such as aceruloplasminemia, hypo- transferrinemia, Friedreich ataxia, and porphyria cutanea tarda may also result in iron overload. Iron deficiency is one of the most common mineral deficiencies worldwide,130,132,134 although isolated iron deficiency is uncommon in the United States.133 Iron deficiency is most common in children, reproductive-aged women, and the elderly. Deficiency may be sec- ondary to poor diet, obesity, chronic kidney disease, gastrointestinal malabsorption, gastrointestinal tumors,138 gastrointestinal parasites, gastric bypass surgery, or blood loss. Blood losses may result from comorbid disease, blood donations, or extreme endurance training. Iron depletion occurs in gradual stages, and different biomarkers are useful at different stages. Iron-deficiency anemia may result in symp- toms such as fatigue, pallor, headaches, dizziness, impaired cognitive function, behavior or motor difficulties (developing children), poor immune responses, decline in exercise performance, tachycardia, dyspnea, and difficulty regulating temperature (iodine deficiency or comorbid hypothyroidism). Symptoms may progress to nail spoon- ing, brittle nails, loss of taste, angular cheilosis (skin lesions at the cor- ners of the mouth), atrophic glossitis (“bald,” sore, tongue),139 or pica. Co-occurring deficiencies in vitamin A, copper, or zinc may further impair iron metabolism. Dietary sources include beans, dark green leafy vegetables, dates and figs, dried fruits, egg yolk, fish, molasses, nuts, organ meats, red meat, shellfish, and whole and enriched grains. Iron deficiency may increase manganese absorption by the gastroin- testinal tract. A variety of tests and methods may be used to assess iron sta- tus,130,132,134 and a variety of physiologic conditions must be considered when interpreting iron results (see Table 23.1).130,140 Serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), serum transferrin, serum ferritin, hemato- crit, hemoglobin, soluble transferrin receptor, and zinc protoporphyrin may all play a role in diagnosing iron disorders. The use of various com- mercial methodologies to measure some of these analytes requires each laboratory to establish its own reference values for those tests. Although the majority of iron is sequestered inside the erythrocytes as heme iron, and iron supplementation improves RBC hemoglobin content (during pregnancy), erythrocyte iron is not commonly measured in conventional laboratories.142 Iron test results may be affected by diurnal variation (test in morning), stage of menstrual cycle, use of iron supplements or intake of a high-iron diet, oral contraceptives (raise iron values), hepatitis, and the presence of acute or chronic inflammation. Methotrexate may increase iron test results. Testosterone, high-dose aspirin, metformin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone may decrease iron test results. Serum iron evaluates the level of iron in circulation.140 A low serum iron with a high transferrin or TIBC may be an indication of iron deficiency.130,143 During chronic diseases, serum iron, transferrin, and TIBC are all decreased. Serum iron increases, and unsaturated iron-binding capacity decreases during iron overload. High levels of stress or sleep deprivation may transiently decrease serum iron levels. TIBC is assessed by saturating a blood sample with iron and com- paring the saturated sample (transferrin saturation) with the serum iron results to obtain the TIBC and the transferrin percent saturation: Transferrin%saturation= serum×100 TIBC Normally, about 30% of transferrin is bound to iron. Transferrin levels will decrease because of liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, low protein intake, or iron overload, and the transferrin saturation will increase. TIBC levels will increase during iron deficiency, and the transferrin saturation will decrease. Plasma iron levels decline in stage 2 iron deficiency, and TIBC rises. Serum transferrin represents the unsaturated iron-binding capac- ity (UIBC) and may be used instead of the more expensive transferrin saturation test: TIBC = UIBC + serum iron Transferrin levels may decrease because of nephrotic syndrome or other renal-wasting disorders.144 Hemoglobin levels usually remain in range during stage 2 iron deficiency, whereas serum transferrin recep- tor concentrations increase. Ferritin is the primary intracellular iron-storage protein, and serum ferritin estimates the amount of iron stored in the body.130 Serum fer- ritin decreases during the first stage of iron deficiency as iron stores are depleted and bone marrow iron decreases. Low levels of ferritin indicate iron deficiency; however, high levels may occur not only with iron-storage disorders but with a variety of acute and chronic diseases or with the presence of malignancy. Hemoglobin is found within erythrocytes, and the hematocrit value roughly estimates the number of RBCs.144 Hemoglobin and

## 202SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

hematocrit values are assessed during a complete blood count. In the third stage, iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), hemoglobin and hematocrit levels decrease, and microcytic hypochromic anemia occurs. An ele- vated hematocrit may indicate polycythemia, dehydration, pulmonary disease, congenital heart disease, renal tumor, tobacco use, or high- altitude living. Hematocrit results may also be altered by recent blood transfusion or donation. The soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is used when ferritin results may be compromised by a preexisting or concurrent inflammatory dis- order (ferritin is an acute-phase reactant during inflammation).145,146 The sTfR assessment is not affected by the level of inflammation and may be used to discern whether anemia is caused by iron deficiency or chronic disease. sTfR rises with the onset of iron-deficient erythro- poiesis and continues to rise as iron deficiency progresses to anemia. sTfR will also elevate because of hemolytic anemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, and the use of erythropoietic stimulation medications. Importantly, sTfR does not rise during anemia of chronic disease. Zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) is a heme-precursor protein.147 When there is insufficient iron to synthesize heme, or if an exposure to the toxic element lead occurs, ZPP levels rise. ZPP is measured in the free erythrocyte protoporphyrin test, and a ZPP:heme ratio may be included in the results. A change in the ZPP:heme ratio may be the first indication of insufficient iron reserves in pediatric populations, and the ratio will shift before symptoms of iron deficiency appear. ZPP may also be elevated due to comorbid infection, inflammatory disorders, anemia of chronic disease, or inherited porphyria. The results must be interpreted with the patient’s symptoms and history in mind. Iron levels may occasionally be evaluated in urine or hair. Urinary iron excretion is variable and is not considered to reflect tissue iron stores; however, increased urinary iron excretion may be an indicator of exposure to the toxic element lead.148 Increased iron excretion may be a causative factor in intractable IDA and may be evaluated in such cases.149 The iron levels in hair have not been correlated with more conventional blood estimates of iron status; however, research contin- ues in this area. Recent studies have correlated low hair iron (and other elements) with growth retardation62 and demonstrated a positive asso- ciation between hair iron levels and levels of behavioral traits (novelty seeking, extraversion) and physical activity.150

## Manganese

Manganese is an essential cofactor for enzymes in multiple biochemi- cal pathways, including antioxidant protection (mitochondrial super- oxide dismutase), glucose synthesis (pyruvate carboxylase), the urea cycle (arginase), and connective tissue and cartilage synthesis (glycos- yltransferases).12,151 Although essential, manganese at high levels may have toxic effects in the nervous system. Manganese and iron may compete for uptake in the gastrointestinal system. Manganese uptake increases during iron deficiency and decreases during a high-iron meal. Manganese is transported in the body bound to albumin or transferrin and excreted from the body primarily through the bile. Manganese levels of greater than 5.4 μ g/L serum or greater than 20 μ g/L whole blood indicate manganese exposure or retention.12,152 High levels of manganese exposure may occur because of occupational inhalation of manganese dust; inhalation of methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) gasoline additive; or ingestion of man- ganese in supplements, food, or water.151 Exposed infants and children may not excrete manganese efficiently until their hepatic systems are fully developed, and adults with liver disease may have cholestasis and increased manganese retention. Symptoms of hypermanganesemia may contribute to hepatic encephalitis and resemble the neurologic symptoms of Wilson disease or Parkinson’s disease; however, manga- nism is unresponsive to L-dopa therapy.152–154 In rare individuals, a mutation in the SLC30A10 zinc/manganese cellular transporter may result in a syndrome of hepatic cirrhosis, dystonia, polycythemia, and hypermanganesemia,155 which may run in families. Human manganese deficiency has been demonstrated in small exper- iments or during chronic parenteral nutrition.12,151,152 Symptoms in chil- dren may include growth delays and skeletal abnormalities. Symptoms in adults may include low cholesterol; skin rash or lesions; abnormal glucose tolerance; and increased blood calcium, phosphorus, and alka- line phosphatase. Human studies indicate that low manganese levels may increase the risk of seizures156 and may be associated with Alzheimer’s disease and risk of cognitive impairment.157 Dietary sources include dark green leafy vegetables, dried fruits, dried legumes, nuts, and whole grains. Manganese levels may be assessed in serum, whole blood, erythro- cytes, urine, and hair.12,13,158,159 For serum collections, a plastic can- nula should be used to prevent contamination from steel needles, and specimens should be discarded and redrawn if hemolysis occurs during sample collection or processing. Serum manganese levels represent approximately 30% of total body manganese and may vary based on recent dietary intake. Serum manganese may also require an evaluation of lymphocyte manganese superoxide dismutase activity to accurately assess nutritional deficiency. Whole-blood levels may be used to mon- itor manganese excess and may provide a more accurate assessment of recent dietary intake over the life span of the RBC (60–120 days).160 Erythrocyte manganese represents about 60% of total manganese and may provide further diagnostic insight for specific conditions such as prolidase deficiency (imidodipeptiduria),161 which presents with increased erythrocyte manganese and normal serum levels. Urinary manganese is considered to have a short half-life postexposure and may better reflect recent dietary and environmental exposures rather than body nutritional status. Hair manganese has been evaluated in multiple studies,162–164 but the possibility of external contamination must be eliminated before the interpretation of results.165

## Molybdenum

Molybdenum is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in sulfur metabolism (e.g., sulfite oxidase), uric acid synthesis (xanthine oxi- dase), and detoxification (aldehyde oxidase, mitochondrial amidox- ime reducing component).12,166,167 The element must be complexed into a pterin protein to act as a cofactor in biochemical reactions,168 and inherited deficiency of the cofactor results in microcephaly, developmental delay, and neurologic symptoms within a week of birth. Affected individuals have increased levels of urinary sulfite, S-sulfocysteine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine and decreased uric acid in their blood.169 Molybdenum is assimilated in the gastrointestinal tract as molybdate (MoO2- 4 ); once assimilated, more than 80% of the molybdate binds to erythrocyte proteins. Excess dietary molybdenum is excreted by the kidneys, and experimental ingestion of up to 1.5 mg daily for 24 days produced no adverse effects in young men.170 Dietary molybdenum excess in humans is not well documented. Ingestion of 10 to 15 mg of molybdenum in the daily diet occurs in some isolated Armenian populations and has been correlated with increased blood levels of uric acid. Increased uric acid, arthralgias, and ceruloplasmin levels have been reported with occupational molybde- num exposures.12 Reported dietary deficiency is rare but has been documented when molybdenum-deficient parental nutrition has been administered to patients. Chronic molybdenum deficiency causes sulfite toxicity.171 Deficiency symptoms included tachycardia, tachypnea, headache, nausea, vomiting, and progression to coma. Animal studies indicate that tungsten exposures may increase the excretion of molybdenum, even when molybdenum is deficient in the diet.172 Dietary sources of molybdenum include beans, peas, red meats, and whole grains.

## 203CHAPTER 23 Mineral Status Evaluation

Molybdenum was once considered difficult to measure, but induc- tively coupled plasma mass spectrometry has sufficient sensitivity to measure molybdenum in biological samples, such as whole blood, erythrocytes, serum, plasma, or urine.12 The average value for whole blood is μ g/L; for plasma or serum, the average is 0.5 μ g/L. Urinary molybdenum ranges, on average, from 40 to μ g/L daily and varies with dietary intakes. Urinary molybdenum has been compared with femoral neck and lumbar bone mineral densities, and an inverse rela- tionship has been found: the higher the urinary molybdenum, the lower the bone mineral density.173

## Selenium

Selenium is an essential component of selenoproteins vital for var- ious metabolic and antioxidant functions.12,174,175 Selenoproteins all contain selenocysteine, which is now considered the 21st amino acid. Glutathione peroxidase (antioxidant), iodothyronine deio- dinase (thyroid hormone), thioredoxin reductase (intracellular redox status), and selenophosphate synthase (selenoprotein synthesis) all require selenocysteine in their structures, as do the antioxidants sele- noprotein P and selenoprotein W. The human synthesis pathway has only recently been defined and may be affected by inherited variations in the pathway enzymes,176 with clinically significant results. Animal studies indicate that selenium may have synergistic antioxidant effects with vitamin E.177 Dietary selenium is primarily selenomethionine. Both organic and inorganic selenium may be absorbed by the gastrointestinal system, although the absorption of some inorganic selenium may require the presence of glutathione.178 Intakes in the United States and Canada are generally considered sufficient. Selenium sufficiency may reflect dependence on local food production; in some areas of the world, sele- nium-deficient soils and dependence on locally grown foods may pre- dispose human populations to selenium deficiency; in other areas, high selenium levels may be found. Excess selenium is normally excreted by the kidneys. Toxic levels of selenium exposure may occur because of supple- mentation, industrial exposure, or high levels in local soil or water, which may bioaccumulate into food plants and animals.12,174,175 Chronic exposure to high amounts of selenium in food, water, or soil may increase the risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.179 Inorganic selenates may be more toxic than organic selenium compounds and may cause symptoms at lower levels of exposure.180 Early signs and symptoms of selenosis (chronic exposure) include a “garlic” odor on the breath, brittle nails, and hair loss and progress to fatigue, irrita- bility, gastrointestinal symptoms, mottled teeth, skin rashes, and neu- rologic disorders. Toxic effects have been associated with selenium intakes of μ g daily. The tolerable upper intake level for adults is 400 μ g daily from all sources, but newer evidence indicates that daily intake in excess of 250 to μ g daily may increase the risk for type diabetes, dermatitis, and hair loss. Selenium deficiency may occur because of low levels in local soil and water, because of malabsorption syndromes, or because of inher- ited variations in selenocysteine insertion protein (SECISBP2 tRNA), which impairs thyroid hormone synthesis and antioxidant status and decreases plasma selenium levels.176 Systemic selenoprotein deficiency results in photosensitivity and hearing loss; the effects of partially active pathways are unknown at present. Symptoms of severe deficiency may include muscle weakness, mus- cle wasting, and cardiomyopathy. Severe deficiency may also decrease male fertility.12,174,175 Severe dietary selenium deficiency during child development may result in multifactorial Keshan (cardiomyopathy) or Kashin–Beck (joint deformities, dwarfism) disease; these conditions are seen primarily in areas of China with selenium-deficient soil. The risk of deficiency may be increased because of bariatric surgery, malab- sorption syndromes, renal dialysis, and specialized medical diets (phe- nylketonuria, homocystinuria, maple syrup urine disease). Selenium levels may be lower in HIV+ individuals in developing countries or due to local selenium-deficient soils. Marginal selenium deficiency may impair cognitive function,181 thyroid function, and immune or inflammatory responses. Deficiency may increase the risk of cardio- vascular disease, reproductive disorders, or mood disorders. Poor immune responses in selenium-deficient individuals may increase viral virulence and the severity of viral diseases. The use of cisplatin or other medications may decrease selenium levels (review all medications with a pharmacist). Dietary sources of selenium include Brazil nuts,182 fish, seafood, meat, brown rice, and sunflower seeds. Selenium status may be evaluated by whole blood, serum, plasma, urine, and hair.12 The types of selenium ingested may sequester in dif- ferent compartments in the blood; organic selenium increases plasma and urine levels, whereas inorganic selenite does not.183 Whole-blood analysis measures selenium in both the intracellular and extracellular compartments and may be the best assessment if selenium excess is suspected. Serum and plasma are the most commonly assessed, despite the fact that serum levels may decrease during acute-phase activation or chronic inflammation.184 Lower levels of serum selenium have been associated with an increased risk of anemia in adults over 65 years old.185 Erythrocyte levels remain stable, even as serum or plasma levels decrease, and may provide a better assessment of recent dietary intakes over the life span of the RBC (60–120 days).186 Urinary selenium lev- els reflect recent dietary and environmental exposures.187 After the injection of 2,3 dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS), less urinary selenium is excreted by subjects with amalgams, which indicates that selenium may bind to mercury.188 Hair selenium has been correlated with plasma levels in Polish subjects.189 Altered hair selenium levels have been demonstrated in subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver dis- ease190 and hyperlipidemia,191 compared with controls. Hair is easily contaminated from external sources, and selenium from antidandruff shampoos may greatly increase hair selenium levels.192

## Zinc

Zinc is an essential cofactor and catalyst in approximately enzymes.12,193,194 Zinc, cysteine, and histidine combine to form folded “zinc finger” compounds used in cellular metabolism as a structural stabilizer in proteins and membranes or as a regulator of gene expres- sion. Adequate zinc is required for normal growth and development. Zinc is also used during the conversion of vitamin A precursors, cell signaling, hormone synthesis, and nerve transmission. Blood plasma contains less than 1% of total body zinc, and 80% of plasma zinc is bound to albumin. Zinc in erythrocytes is present as the enzyme car- bonic anhydrase; RBC levels are about 10 times greater than plasma levels. Zinc assimilation in the gastrointestinal tract is variable based on the availability of zinc in the diet; zinc absorption may range from 20% to 50% of the zinc in a sufficient diet and may increase to 100% absorption of the zinc in a deficient diet. Zinc uptake may be inhibited if large amounts of supplemental iron are taken simultaneously or due to inherited variations in the ZIP4 (SLC39A4) gene.195 Excess zinc is excreted into the gut and incorporated into stool or excreted by the kidneys. Zinc, in excess, has toxic effects.12,194,196 Excessive supplementa- tion, accidental exposure from galvanized food or beverage contain- ers, or industrial exposure to zinc-oxide fumes may all result in toxic levels of zinc. Symptoms of toxic levels of zinc ingestion may include headaches, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. Symptoms of inhalation (metal fume fever) may include fever, sweat- ing, shortness of breath, nausea, fatigue, and myalgias 4 to 12 hours

## 204SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

postexposure; symptoms then resolve after 12 to 24 hours in a zinc-free environment. Chronically high levels of zinc exposure may decrease copper levels and result in nerve damage. Chronic high doses of zinc (100–150 mg daily) block gastrointestinal copper assimilation and result in low blood copper levels. Signs and symptoms include eryth- rocyte microcytosis (small RBCs), neutropenia (low WBCs), poor immune responses, and an increased risk of urinary lithiasis (kidney stones).197 Higher zinc doses of 140 to 450 mg daily may alter iron metabolism and reduce levels of high-density lipoproteins. Local applications of zinc in the nasal passages may damage olfactory nerves; intranasal zinc sprays and gels are no longer recommended because the loss of smell may be permanent. Marginal zinc deficiency may be prevalent in developing coun- tries or areas dependent on cereal grain-based diets high in phytate and fiber.193 In the United States and Canada, zinc deficiency may occur because of inadequate intake, increased excretion, or increased requirement.12,194 Zinc deficiency may occur because of poor diet, gastrointestinal malabsorption, chronic diarrhea, cystic fibrosis, liver disorders, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, sickle cell disease, HIV+ status, physical trauma, pregnancy, and lactation. Severe zinc deficiency may cause symptoms of intrauterine growth restriction, impaired development, short stature,198 loss of appetite, immune dysfunction, weight loss, delayed wound healing, taste abnor- malities, poor concentration, and fatigue. Symptoms may progress to night blindness, hair loss, diarrhea, delayed sexual development, male hypogonadism, impotence, and eye lesions or skin lesions. The very young and very old may have an increased risk of zinc deficiency.12,194,199,200 Inherited variations in the metal-binding pro- tein metallothionein 2A (MT2A-5 A/G) may result in GG phenotypes having lower zinc and, perhaps, higher copper and lead levels than the wild-type AA phenotype.201 Inherited variations in the ZIP4 zinc trans- porter (SLC39A4) may result in severe zinc deficiency (acrodermati- tis enteropathica) with classic indications of low (<30 μ g/dL) serum zinc, periacral and periorificial dermatitis, alopecia, and diarrhea.199 Inherited variations may be suspected if zinc is persistently low (< μ g/dL), with symptoms of poor growth, anorexia, and mild nonspe- cific dermatitis that improve with zinc supplementation. Severe zinc deficiency in infants may occasionally occur because of inherited vari- ations in zinc transporter 2 (SLC30A2) specific to the mammary gland, which results in low levels of zinc in breast milk but normal maternal zinc levels. The zinc content of breast milk decreases after the first months; dietary zinc is required to meet infant needs at approximately 6 months postpartum. Approximately 40% of individuals over 60 years old may be zinc deficient if no supplemental zinc is used; even with supplementation over 20% may still be zinc deficient due to comorbid conditions or gastrointestinal dysfunctions.12,200 Strict vegetarians or vegans on pri- marily grain-based diets may require 50% more dietary zinc because of the decreased availability of zinc in the diet.193 High intakes of sup- plemental iron or calcium may impair zinc uptake; patients may be monitored for zinc status during supplementation. Zinc excretion may increase because of muscle breakdown and excretion of ketone bodies during extended fasting or the use of extremely low-calorie or ketogenic diets. Medication use may alter zinc uptake. Tetracycline, quinolone antibiotics, or bisphosphonates lose efficacy and reduce zinc assimilation if taken together (consult with a pharmacist for dosing regimens). Anticonvulsants (sodium valproate, etc.), thiazide diuret- ics, and ethambutol may all increase zinc excretion. Medications such as penicillamine, used to treat Wilson disease, or diethylenetriamine penta-acetate (DTPA), used for iron overload, may severely deplete zinc. Review all medications with a pharmacist if zinc–medication interactions are suspected. Dietary sources of zinc include oysters, crab, meats, beans, chickpeas, and cashews. Soaking beans, grains, and seeds before cooking and the use of leavened grain products increase bioavailable zinc from plant-based foods.193 Although zinc may be measured in whole blood, serum, plasma, erythrocytes, urine, and hair, nutritional zinc status is difficult to dis- cern because homeostatic mechanisms maintain plasma zinc until the deficiency is severe.12,202 Plasma zinc is the most commonly used assessment; however, plasma zinc is considered insensitive to dietary intakes, has a diurnal shift (higher in the morning), and must be inter- preted in conjunction with serum albumin levels, urinary zinc, and an assessment of acute-phase reactants (zinc levels decrease; copper levels increase).203 Plasma is preferred over serum because zinc lev- els may be 5% to 15% higher in serum samples. A repeated fasting plasma zinc of less than μ g/dL is suspicious for marginal deficiency, and a level of less than μ g/dL indicates deficiency. Whole blood and erythrocytes may also be used and may have different associations with health and disease.204–206 Because the majority of zinc is intracellular and bound to enzymes, whole-blood levels may provide the best over- all blood assessment of zinc status. Urinary zinc may be used in con- junction with serum zinc levels to determine whether kidney function is a contributing cause for abnormal serum/plasma results. Increased urinary zinc excretion may deplete serum zinc levels. Renal failure may decrease urinary zinc and increase serum/plasma levels. Urinary zinc levels may also reflect dietary intake, but they are not sensitive enough to be used as a screening test for mild or moderate deficiency.202 Hair samples may indicate zinc deficiency but may be easily contaminated by external sources such as hair products, which may artificially elevate hair zinc levels.

## Bromine

Bromine is an unstable element found in nature as bromide. Although in high amounts bromine or bromide exposures may have toxic effects, increasing evidence indicates that lower levels of bromide in the human body may be beneficial, and perhaps essential, for human health.10,207–209 Brominated proteins may play a role in neurologic sig- naling, immunity, collagen synthesis, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.210 High levels of bromine or bromide exposure may be associated with negative effects. Bromide is found in food, water, and seawater. Industrial exposure to bromine gas may occur; bromine may be used in pool or hot tub cleaners, pesticides, and fire retardants.211 Brominated vegetable oils may be used in food preparation or added to soft drinks.212 Bromide may be found in veterinary medications and occasionally in human pharmaceuticals (Germany, Japan).213 Pyridostigmine bromide was distributed and may have been taken by some U.S. troops during the first Persian Gulf war as a nerve agent antidote.214 Bromide levels may be higher in areas of radioactive fallout.215 Signs of acute inhala- tion exposure may include dyspnea, cough, headache, dizziness, and irritation of mucous membranes. Acute ingestion of a large amount of bromine may result in gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, etc.). Chronic, excessive ingestion of brominated vegetable oils may result in dermatologic or neurologic symptoms. Higher plasma bro- mine levels have been associated with increased levels of TSH.216 Low levels of bromide intake may alter acetylcholinesterase signal- ing,207 sleep quality,209 collagen cross-linking,208 and the function of G protein-coupled receptor 7 (GPR7) in the nervous system.217 The antimicrobial function of eosinophil peroxidase in WBCs is inhibited by low bromine levels.10 Bromine levels in serum and erythrocytes are decreased by peritoneal dialysis.218 Dietary sources of bromide include fish, grains, and nuts.

## 205CHAPTER 23 Mineral Status Evaluation

Bromine has been measured in blood,219 serum,220 and urine.221 In whole blood, typical bromide levels may range from 0.3 to 1.2 mg/ dL. Whole blood levels of greater than 1.2 mg/dL have been associated with altered electroencephalogram readings. Serum levels of greater than μ g/mL are considered toxic. Urinary bromide may be used to monitor industrial exposures to 1-bromopropane or other bro- mine/bromide compounds.

## Chromium

Chromium (as a component of “glucose tolerance factor” or chromod- ulin) was proposed as an essential element more than 50 years ago after patients on long-term parenteral nutrition developed glucose intoler- ance, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and weight loss, which improved with the addition of trivalent chromium.12,222–224 Chromium may be biologically active, yet multiple studies have failed to confirm the pres- ence of biological chromium-binding compounds in humans. Studies have also failed to confirm the claims that chromium improves body composition or muscle mass.225,226 Although recent studies in Asian populations have correlated lower plasma chromium levels with meta- bolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes,227 the majority of randomized con- trolled trials do not demonstrate evidence of prevention or treatment of glucose intolerance or type 2 diabetes at the usual supplement dose of μ g daily. For most glucose-intolerant subjects, higher doses may be required to achieve benefit, but safety studies to support the use of higher doses are lacking. There is some evidence that increasing chro- mium intake for mildly glucose-intolerant subjects on low-chromium diets may be beneficial,228 and one study using a biotin-chromium supplement with obese subjects with type 2 diabetes reported improve- ments in glucose response and biomarkers for cardiovascular disease and atherogenesis.229 Less than 3% of dietary chromium is absorbed in the gut, although vitamin C, niacin, NSAIDs, aspirin, beta blockers, corticosteroids, or insulin may increase absorption (animal studies). The supplement chromium picolinate may have greater bioavailability, passing directly through the jejunum and being incorporated into cells. Dietary trivalent chromium is bound to transferrin or albumin in the plasma, and excess is excreted in the urine. The toxic effects of chromium vary based on whether the expo- sure is trivalent or hexavalent chromium. Trivalent chromium (CrIII) is considered nontoxic at normal dietary intake and supplementation levels; however, hexavalent chromium (CrVI) is considered toxic in any amount. Chromium may be ingested, inhaled (industrial exposures), or absorbed through the skin.230,231 Ingestion of hexavalent chromium may result in inflammatory changes in small intestine, pancreas, and liver tissues (animals) and may increase the risk of gastrointestinal and lung cancers. Respiratory exposure may result in bronchial asthma, respiratory tract polyps, nasal and septal ulcerations, or nasopharyn- geal irritation and inflammation and may increase the risk of lung can- cer. Topical exposure to very high levels of hexavalent chromium may result in allergic dermatitis. Hexavalent chromium is a component of joint-replacement prosthetics and may be found in drinking water sup- plies as a contaminant.232 Trivalent chromium is found in supplements and dietary chromium. Although few symptoms are associated with trivalent chromium exposure, human studies indicate that long-term chromium picolinate supplementation ranging from 600 to μ g/ day may result in kidney or liver damage in some individuals. Patients with comorbid renal or liver disorders may be at particular risk. True dietary deficiency has not been documented for chromium. The most likely cause of low chromium levels is increased urinary excretion from poor diet, renal disorders, or intense athletic train- ing.233 Diets high in simple carbohydrates may increase chromium excretion. Trivalent chromium may be obtained from whole grains, brans, green beans, broccoli, nuts, and egg yolks. Chromium may be measured in serum, plasma,227 erythrocytes, whole blood, and urine by laboratories using element-free collection devices and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technology.12 Serum values are considered normal at 0.1 to 0.2 μ g/L. Recent evidence indicates that RBC chromium levels primarily reflect exposure to toxic hexavalent chromium (Cr VI) because trivalent chro- mium does not enter erythrocytes.234 Whole blood provides an assess- ment of both compartments and, therefore, total chromium exposure. Urinary chromium levels may not reflect dietary intake because renal excretion may be altered by exercise and high-carbohydrate diets.233

## Fluorine

Fluorine, as the metal compound fluoride, is found naturally in water sources at varying levels.235 Fluoride is not considered essential because deficiency does not result in overt death or disease; however, lack of fluoride increases the risk of dental caries and gum disease, which may contribute to cardiovascular or chronic inflammatory disease. Fluoride is absorbed by the gastrointestinal system and moves quickly from the circulation into the bones and teeth, where 95% of the body’s fluoride is found. Approximately 90% of excess fluoride is excreted in the urine. Fluoride is deliberately added to water supplies in the United States and some areas of Canada.12,236 Internationally, fluoride-poor areas may supplement salt or milk with fluoride instead. In the body, fluoride is incorporated into hydroxyapatite, which, as fluoroapatite, strengthens bones and tooth enamel.10 Although fluoride may increase the density of osteoporotic bone, it has not been shown to alter the underlying structural defects in the bone trabecular pattern that increase the risk of fracture.237 Excess fluoride exposure may occur industrially, from high levels of fluoride found naturally in springs or groundwater (>4 mg/L), or from the overuse of fluoride-containing products such as powdered infant formula, tea (Camellia sinensis), fluoride supplements, or flu- oridated dental products.237 Young children may be at risk if they swallow fluoridated toothpaste.12 Medications, such as anesthetics, antibiotics, antiinflammatories, and cancer treatments, may contain fluoride. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose is used as an imaging agent for posi- tron emission tomography (PET) scans.10 Low-salt diets may decrease the element’s excretion in the urine and increase fluoride retention. Symptoms of acute fluoride poisoning may include gastrointestinal symptoms and progress to excessive salivation, excessive lacrima- tion, sweating, and muscle weakness. Chronic ingestion of higher levels of fluoride may contribute to the risk of hypothyroidism.238 A recent meta-analysis indicates that in utero exposures may contrib- ute to lower IQ levels at fluoride exposure levels considered safe for adults.239 The most obvious sign of chronic excess fluoride ingestion is fluorosis, the development of chalky, white patches on erupting teeth, which may stain yellow or brown. Continued exposure (plasma fluo- ride > 4 micromoles/L) may weaken or pit tooth enamel and progress in adults to osteosclerosis (excessive bone hardening), spinal exosto- sis (new abnormal bone growth), and genu valgum (knock-knee).240 Symptoms of skeletal fluorosis may include joint pain and stiffness and may progress to calcification of ligaments, immobility, muscle wasting, and spinal cord compression. The use of the antifungal voriconazole may result in symptoms of fluorosis.241 Low levels of fluoride are associated with an increased risk of den- tal caries.12,237 Dietary sources include bone-in marine fish (sardines, etc.), tea, grape juice, and crab. Fluoride may be measured in plasma or urine.12 Individuals drink- ing U.S. fluoridated water may have plasma fluoride levels of 0.1 to 0.4 mmol/L and urinary fluoride levels of 0.2 to 3.2 mg/L.242 Drinking water samples may also be assessed for fluoride concentration with lab- oratory analysis. For urine and water samples, a special fluoride-specific

electrode is usually used to directly determine concentration. Tissue (blood) samples require special processing to remove the fluoride from the organic material before measurement.

## Lithium

The element lithium is found sporadically in natural drinking water sources and is not considered an essential element, although it may have biological effects at low doses.10 Lithium is absorbed by the gas- trointestinal tract and excreted from the kidneys much like sodium.243 Lithium has been shown to upregulate the expression of glutathione S-transferase244 and the antiapoptosis genes BCL2 and IRS2 in vitro. Lithium also down-regulates the proapoptosis genes Bcl2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD) and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (BAK1).10 Lithium has also been shown in vitro to inhibit the expres- sion of glycogen synthase kinase-3 β , an enzyme involved in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. Lithium exposure may alter thyroid function; urinary lithium levels have been inversely associated with plasma con- centrations of T4 and positively associated with TSH in women,245 and plasma levels of lithium carbonate have been associated with TSH lev- els in children.246 High levels of lithium carbonate are used as a pharmaceutical in the treatment of mania and bipolar disorder; responses to lithium therapy may depend in part on the patient’s ethnicity and inheritance of glutamate decarboxylase-like protein 1 (GADL1).10 GADL1 vari- ants rs17026688, rs17026651, and IVS8 + 48delG may predict lithium response in patients of Han Chinese descent.247 Because of its chemical similarities to sodium, renal lithium conservation may be increased in dehydrated patients.243 Toxicity information is based on studies of lithium carbonate. High levels of lithium carbonate may result in leth- argy, dizziness, weakness, poor coordination, slurring speech, gastro- intestinal symptoms, confusion, or restlessness.248 Chronic exposure to high levels of lithium carbonate may impair renal and thyroid func- tion. Blood levels greater than 2.5 mmol/L may result in tremors, mus- cle rigidity, hyperreflexia, seizures, and renal failure. Prenatal exposure to lithium carbonate during the first trimester may result in the devel- opment of cardiac malformations.249 The use of medications such as acetazolamide, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, antacids, caffeine, calcium channel blockers, NSAIDs, theophylline, or psychiatric medications such as haloperidol, methyldopa, and selec- tive serotonin reuptake inhibitors may alter the metabolism of lithium carbonate.250 Symptoms of deficiency may affect the central nervous system, and behavioral disorders have been associated with low lithium levels.10 Population studies have associated lower levels of lithium exposure (2.0–5.0 μ g/L) in drinking water with a higher risk of dementia, vascu- lar dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease compared with populations with more than μ g/L in drinking water.251 No association has been found in population studies for the incidence of bipolar disorder and lithium levels in drinking water.252 Low hair lithium levels have been associated with heart disease, learning disabilities, and violent behavior.253 Lithium levels may be evaluated in serum,243 erythrocytes,254 urine,255 or hair.253 Serum is most commonly used to assess levels of lithium carbonate and may correlate with RBC levels.256 Urinary lith- ium values were found to range from 11.0 to 50.5 μ g/L in a Japanese population. Hair lithium levels averaged 0.063 μ g/g in a study of U.S. adults, and hair levels may correlate with lithium supplementation.

## Vanadium

Vanadium is not currently considered an essential nutrient cofac- tor for any human enzyme, although it is essential for some rodents (rats) and other mammals.257 Because of this, animal studies using this element may not translate directly into human populations. Vanadium may compete with phosphate-binding sites in human enz- ymes.258 Increasing evidence suggests vanadium may have effects on cell metabolism and immune responses, particularly humoral B cell responses,259 and sodium–potassium ATPase.260 The oxidation state of vanadium may determine whether it is found in the cell or the plasma. VanadiumIV binds to transferrin in the blood and is primarily found in the plasma. Intracellular vanadium is found primarily in the kid- neys, spleen, bones, and liver, and is typically found as vanadiumIV or vanadiumV. Small human studies indicate that vanadium may result in minor improvements in glucose metabolism, glycogen synthesis, and HbA1c levels in subjects with type 2 diabetes; however, vanadium may also increase triglyceride levels, and large, well-controlled studies are needed to confirm findings and establish dosing.261,262 Assimilation of vanadium by the gastrointestinal tract is poor (3%–20%). Vanadium is primarily excreted through the kidneys. High levels of vanadium exposure, either ingested or inhaled, have toxic effects.263–265 Toxic vanadium compounds may be encountered in industrial settings and released into the environment as industrial waste (coal emissions, fly ash, fuel oils, jet exhaust).266 Several organic vanadium compounds have been tested as treatment agents for diabetes and can- cer. Inhalation of vanadium compounds may result in cough, sputum, exertional dyspnea, wheezing, headache, nausea, palpitations, nosebleed, abnormal breath sounds (wheezes, rales, rhonchi), eye irritation, and throat inflammation. Ingestion of vanadium compounds may result in headache, nausea, and diarrhea. Chronic high levels of exposure may progress to distal tremors (hands), diarrhea, blood cell abnormalities, hair and nail changes, green-hued tongue, hypertension, and enlarged liver. Industrial exposures to vanadium compounds have been associated with altered response times, cognition, and mood in Chinese factory workers.267 Although vanadium deficiency has not been studied in humans, low levels of vanadium have been associated with several chronic dis- eases. A study of Chinese industrial workers associated low levels of vanadium with an increased risk of atherosclerosis (higher cholesterol, lower high-density lipoprotein C [HDL-C], poor apoB:apoA1 ratios); the association was strongest in male subjects. Another study found an inverse correlation between new-onset type 2 diabetes in Chinese individuals and plasma vanadium levels.268 The subjects with the low- est levels of vanadium had the highest risk of diabetes. Food sources of vanadium include mushrooms, shellfish, peppers, parsley, dill weed, grain, and grain products. Vanadium levels may be evaluated in whole blood, serum, urine, or hair.265 Serum or whole blood is preferred because very little vanadium is found in RBCs. The average serum concentration due to dietary vanadium exposures is less than or equal to μ g/L. The average uri- nary vanadium level from normal background exposures (based on study controls) was found to be 2.7 μ g/L. Women in the highest third of urinary vanadium concentration were shown to have a lower risk of breast cancer (64%–40%) compared with those in the lowest third.269 Hair levels of vanadium have not been correlated with ingestion in studies of children exposed to elevated vanadium in drinking water.


Newer technologies and methodologies continue to improve the detection of mineral elements. Testing for mineral excess or deficiency may be an important step in the diagnosis of patients and may be necessary to confirm the effectiveness of supplementation or dietary changes.270,271 It is important to remember that a laboratory result is only as good as the laboratory performing the assay. Reputable labo- ratories will have quality assurance and quality control procedures in place32,272 and will participate in third-party proficiency testing when available.

## 207CHAPTER 23 Mineral Status Evaluation

Proper collection and analytic procedures must be followed to ensure accurate results. For mineral element analysis, such procedures may include the preanalytical preparation of hair samples.273 For blood samples, element-free collection equipment is essential to prevent contamination and false high results. Careful preparation of separated blood components is also required to ensure the accuracy of results. Urinary samples may occasionally be contaminated by personal hygiene products, and hair may be easily contaminated by minerals in bathing water or by elements in hair products.274 The interpretation of results must always include the consideration of the patient’s his- tory and physical condition because, in the end, it is the patient who is treated, not the laboratory results.273

8. The governmental regulations of mycotoxins in food vary greatly by country. Global standards are needed that account for the synergy of mycotoxins. This will also have a significant financial impact as even more batches of crops and products are deemed inedible.

## Symptoms to Consider in Mycotoxin Illness from

<!-- chunk -->

## Contaminated Food or Inhalation

At the time most government policies and medical organization state- ments were published, there was no testing available to correlate myco- toxins present in humans and the environment with human disease, and thus such policies are outdated. Most of the research on mycotoxins is done on animals or other organisms. Because controlling mold in ani- mal feed is a challenging, ongoing worldwide issue, there is extensive animal research. Standard medical education teaches clinicians to con- sider mold only as an allergy or asthma issue or in the differential diag- nosis for an infectious disease in immunocompromised patients, not as a toxicity issue. Certainly, mold infection is a recognized cause of morbid- ity and mortality in transplant patients on immunosuppression, patients on chemotherapy, and those with autoimmunity or immunodeficiency.2 Few health care providers are aware of the toxic effects of mold on their patients. As more health care providers gain experience in recognizing mold-related illness, emerging research is showing promise for identify- ing mold toxin exposure as an underlying contributor to many illnesses. Research estimates that up to 50% of residential and work environments in North America have had water damage3 and that mold exposure should be considered in all patients with any chronic respiratory condition. Of par- ticular significance is the finding that in adult-onset asthma, two thirds of cases are caused by exposure to water-damaged buildings. The relationship of indoor mold exposure from water-damaged buildings to other health conditions has less research available. Mold exposure has been linked to neurotoxicity, autoimmunity, immunotoxicity, and cytotoxicity. The car- cinogenic effects of food-borne mold contamination are well established. Research supports that environmental toxins drive disease in the general population, not just those who are genetically or nutritionally the most susceptible. Mycotoxins and mVOCs are joining the catego- ries of pesticides, metals, solvents, and persistent organic pollutants in affecting health and longevity.

• Mycotoxins, or fungal toxins, are low-relative-molecular-mass biomolecules produced by fungi, some of which are toxic to ani- mals and human beings. Mycotoxins are known to interfere with RNA synthesis and may cause DNA damage. Some fungal species may produce various mycotoxins, depending on the substrate. In the case of Penicillium, one such compound is penicillin, a strong antibiotic. Several mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxin from Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus) are potent carcinogens. Many mycotoxins are immunotoxic, but the trichothecene mycotox- ins are immunostimulating at low doses.4 Numerous mycotoxins have been classified by their distinct chemical structures and reac- tive functional groups, including primary and secondary amines, hydroxyl or phenolic groups, lactams, carboxylic acids, and amides. The mycotoxins that have perhaps received the most attention are the trichothecenes, produced by Stachybotrys chartarum. Bloom5 showed that several mycotoxins produced by S. chartarum and Aspergillus versicolor (i.e., macrocyclic trichothecenes, trichoder- min, sterigmatocystin, and satratoxin G) could be present in most samples of materials and settled dust from buildings with current or past damage from dampness or water damage. Charpin-Kadouch6 compared the levels of macrocyclic trichothecenes in samples from 15 flooded dwellings known to be contaminated with S. chartarum or Chaetomium and a group of nine dwellings without visible mold. The level of macrocyclic trichothecenes was significantly higher in floor dust from the moldy houses than from the reference dwell- ings; the levels in wall samples from moldy houses were also higher.

• A link between other adverse health effects, such as acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage among infants, memory loss, or lethargy, and molds, including the mold S. chartarum (Stachybotrys atra), has not been proven. Further studies are needed to find out what causes acute idiopathic hemorrhage and other adverse health effects. • Standards for judging what is an acceptable, tolerable, or normal quantity of mold have not been established. • In summary, S. chartarum (S. atra) and other molds may cause health symptoms that are nonspecific. At present, there is no test that proves an association between S. chartarum (S. atra) and particular health symptoms. Individuals with persistent symptoms should see their phy- sician. However, if S. chartarum (S. atra) or other molds are found in a building, prudent practice recommends that they be removed.

## Water-Damaged Buildings

Water-damaged buildings expose their occupants to a diverse range of toxins, with many physiologically damaging effects. Chemical, micro- bial, and physical processes that break down building materials pro- duce toxins. Tables 24.1 and 24.2 list the metabolite toxins released, organisms involved, physiological effects induced, and disease associ- ations. Tables 24.3 and 24.4 shows that bacterial growth also releases toxins in water-damaged buildings. The strongest correlations to mold exposure and symptoms are neurological and immunological, but such exposure can affect all sys- tems of the body. Food-borne mycotoxins have been shown to cause cancer, impaired child growth, neural tube defects, immunotoxicity, gastroenteritis, and renal disease.8 Studies comparing mycotoxins with pesticides show that mycotoxins can be more toxic than pesticides.9 Even more concerning is the research showing that fungal metabolites have synergistic genotoxic and other harmful effects.10 mVOCs are low-molecular-weight compounds and include numer- ous alcohols, esters, ethers, ketones, aldehydes, terpenoids, thiols, and their derivatives. They diffuse into the air and enter the body through the lungs and skin. mVOCs are even more toxic than the chemicals traditionally thought of as being industrial toxins. A study comparing fungal VOCs showed a greater toxic effect than formaldehyde, xylene, benzene, and toluene.11 I-octen-3-ol studies predict it to be more toxic to human embryonic stems cells than toluene.12 Increased levels of biomarkers such as myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, and eosinophil cat- ionic protein are related to symptoms of headache, nausea, and muco- sal irritation as inflammation increases from exposures. Neurotoxicity is clearly associated with mold exposure and other toxin exposures. One study evaluated neurobehavioral and pulmonary

impairment via comparison among three groups: (1) those exposed to indoor molds, (2) those exposed to chemicals, and (3) “unexposed” community referents.13 Both the mold- and chemical-exposed groups had similar findings of decreased balance, longer reaction times, increased blink reflex latency, increased color discrimination errors, decreased visual field, and reduced grip strength; measures of cognitive and memory performance were abnormal. Another study of individuals exposed to mold in their homes found multiple neurological deficits in 70% and abnormalities in T and B cells in more than 80% of the patients.14 A study of individuals work- ing in a well-documented water-damaged school building compared with “unexposed” controls found statistically significant loss of visual contrast sensitivity (VCS), a sensitive measure of neurodysfunction, as well as increased respiratory problems.15 Exposure to mold/damp buildings increases the production of multiple inflammatory molecules and alters immune function medi- ators. The immune systems of those working in damp buildings react to exposure with a 2- to 1000-fold increased production of a wide vari- ety of these inflammatory/immune mediators.16 Animal studies clearly show mold-induced immunotoxicity as well. In some cases, multiple sclerosis could be a mold toxin disease from gliotoxin produced by various species of Aspergillus and Candida. Gliotoxin suppresses immune function, increases the permeability of the blood–brain barrier, and is highly neurotoxic.17 In a study on chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), a high correlation was found between the presence of mycotoxins in the patient’s urine and having a diagnosis of CFS. Of participants, 93% had one myco- toxin present, and 30% had two or more mycotoxins present.18 Importantly, as the incidence of autoimmune disorders increases, cases of autoimmune diseases and related symptoms have been reported among the occupants of damp buildings.19 When seeing patients with autoimmune diagnosis, it is important to consider mold exposure as an underlying trigger that is poten- tially treatable.

# ASSESSMENT OF MOLD EXPOSURE

<!-- chunk -->

## IgG or IgE Allergy Serum Testing

IgG or IgE allergy serum testing is an older method, but is sometimes helpful in raising the suspicion of current mold exposure. Some prac- titioners also use it to see if IgE and/or IgG levels are reduced with treatment, to evaluate the effectiveness of remediation/avoidance of exposure, and to consider immunotherapy. It is not conclusive, but levels of antibodies can correlate with the types and levels of mold the patient is being exposed to.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mycotoxin Urinary Levels

The latest acceptable technology tests urine samples. Results are not conclusive if negative because all mycotoxins cannot yet be tested for. See the advantages and disadvantages of the two available technologies in Table 24.5.

<!-- chunk -->

## Inflammatory Markers and Hormones

Inflammatory markers and hormones can be indicators for toxic expo- sures but are not conclusive if positive or negative. They can be help- ful in monitoring a patient’s progress. These markers are part of the Shoemaker protocol.

<!-- chunk -->

## Proteomics

Proteomic has promise in the assessment of mold exposure, but cur- rently this approach is used only in research and is expensive.

<!-- chunk -->

## Genetics

Genetic testing can be helpful to establish individual treatment pro- grams. Consider human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type, methylation, P450, COMT, glutathione, NAT, VDR, and mitochondrial and hista- mine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Toxins affect individ- uals in different ways depending on their genetics, synergistic toxins present, and nutritional status. Early genetic testing can help identify those most susceptible to mold toxins and other environmental toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

## Visual Contrast Sensitivity Testing

Visual contrast sensitivity (VCS) measures the ability to see details at low contrast levels. Although it is useful for early detection of neu- rodegeneration, it does not differentiate the cause. Biotoxins reduce available oxygen to the optic nerves as a result of reduced blood flow, which can affect the ability to detect the “edge” between light and dark and lead to a reduction in night vision and increased light sensitivity. This is an easily available and inexpensive test. However, it is a non- specific test of neurological function (i.e., not diagnostic for mycotoxin illness). A positive test may reveal a 92% chance that a patient has bio- toxin illness, but again, it does not determine which toxin—it could be mold toxins or an environmental neurotoxin, such as mercury. Positive tests usually indicate mold exposure but can also be attributed to Lyme disease or other biotoxins. Testing needs to be conducted at a distance of 18 inches from the screen and should be done in the daytime. False positives can occur with cataracts or other vision abnormalities

<!-- chunk -->

## Laboratory Testing Technology

Testing for the mycotoxin load present in humans via sampling tis- sue and body fluids is still very limited. There are likely hundreds of mycotoxins, possibly even an order of magnitude more, but only a few can be commercially tested for in human samples or the environment, except in research laboratories. Qualitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) can now be used to detect and quantify the presence of 45 molds in human tissue and the environment.

## Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is currently avail- able through Real Time Labs (RTL). • What it tests for: 16 of the most common mycotoxins, especially for Macrocyclic trichothecenes (most toxic trichothecenes), for which the laboratory has a U.S. patent • Ochratoxin A • Aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1, G2) • Trichothecenes (satratoxin G, satratoxin H, isosatratoxin F, rodirin A, rodirin E, rodirin H, rodirin L-2, verrucarin A, verrucarin J) • Gliotoxin • Chaetoglobosin A • What these mycotoxins correspond to regarding mold presence: • Aflatoxin = Aspergillus flavus • Ochratoxin A = Aspergillus ochraceus, Aspergillus niger, Penicil- lium verrucosum • Gliotoxin = Aspergillus fumigatus, possibly • Macrocyclic trichothecenes = S. chartarum • Simple trichothecenes = Fusarium species • Chaetoglobosin = Chaetomium • What it misses: More than 50,000 different species of mold are not test for; only 200 are currently documented to cause serious health risks to humans or animals. • Methods: College of American Pathologists (CAP) certified, Clin- ical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) accredited; ELISA (antibodies prepared against mycotoxins); very sensitive test (can detect traces of mycotoxins in the ng/mL [= ppb]) • Urine-based (blood test not validated in blood components, per RTL): turnaround is 10 days after receiving the sample. • Options are available to test for mycotoxins in the sputum, bron- choalveolar lavage (BAL), nasal wash, and tissue sample (requires consulting with medical team at RTL to discuss preparation). • Is there a test for food-based mycotoxins? Per RTL, it is “unlikely” that aflatoxin- or ochratoxin-positive urine cor- relates to food-based mycotoxins. • Troubleshooting: If the test result is negative but the patient is very sick, it can indicate that the individual has poor detoxification and isn’t able to remove/liberate mycotoxins from the body; a positive test does not differentiate current exposure from previous exposure. • Other tests: RTL can test clothing and other things for mycotox- ins and also performs Environmental Relative Moldiness index (ERMI) and mycotoxin testing from environmental samples; it can also test sinuses for mold (molecular fungal DNA panel).

## Mass Spectrometry

Mass spectrometry testing is currently available through Great Plains Labs. • What it tests for: Seven different mycotoxins from four species of mold, with more on the way • Aflatoxin M—main metabolite of aflatoxin B1 (from Aspergil- lus)

# TREATMENT

Unfortunately, there are no widely accepted protocols and very limited data on treatment efficacy. Treating environmental illness, including mold, requires a comprehensive approach.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Avoidance

The primary pillar of treatment is to minimize additional toxin expo- sure. Once an individual is symptomatic, he or she may become sicker, or not improve, if he or she is exposed to any other environmental tox- ins. Make sure that the patient eliminates all of the toxin exposures that he or she can. Guide the patient to avoid new cars, new paint, flame retardants, plastic, pumping gas, cosmetics, pesticide, and preserva- tives and other contaminants in food and water. Exposure to all toxins must be minimized as much as possible. The first step is to identify the source of the mold. Consider home, work, school, car, farming (silos, hay, and animal feed), and food. It is also possible that the patient is colonized/infected with mold that is producing the toxins. Even the brain has been shown to harbor mold, contributing to Alzheimer’s disease.20

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Enhance Detoxification Pathways

Enhancing detoxification pathways, optimizing the gastrointesti- nal tract, and supporting mitochondrial function are critical for most patients to fully recover. Although there is limited research directly related to mold, treatment options to consider include the following: • N-acetylcysteine (NAC): NAC reduces the oxidative damage and inhibits the apoptosis induced by Fusarium toxins in porcine kid- ney cells. It is effective through multiple pathways.21–23 • Binders: Clay, charcoal, modified citrus pectin, cholestyramine/ Welchol24,25 • Glycine • Sauna—infrared if possible26 • Hyperbaric: Hyperbaric oxygen treatment improved attention defi- cit disorder and slowed reaction time in mold-exposed subjects in 10 sessions.27 • Liposomal glutathione28 • Hormonal support as indicated, including thyroid, estrogen, dehy- droepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone, and melatonin29,30 • Curcumin31 • Vitamin E29,32 • Quercetin, selenium, glucomannan, nucleotides, antimicrobial pep- tides, probiotics, polyunsaturated fatty acids, oligosaccharides, and plant extracts: These products inhibit trichothecene-induced oxida- tive stress by (1) inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and induced DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, (2) increasing antioxidant enzyme activity, (3) blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)- κ B signaling path- ways, (4) inhibiting caspase activity and apoptosis, (5) protecting mitochondria, and (6) regulating anti-inflammatory actions.33

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Comprehensive, Integrated Care

Integration of genetic SNPs, proteomics, exposomics, and other mark- ers of the cellular function of the immune, detoxification, mitochon- drial, and methylation systems may help identify those most affected, as well as identify potential treatment options. In addition, assessing potential nutritional deficiencies and levels of other environmental toxins may help identify those with increased individual susceptibil- ity. Given the complex nature of the interaction between the human genome and environmental toxins, the science of bioinformatics will be necessary to more fully understand the full severity and magnitude of mold exposure and its effects on human health.


Mold metabolites have a harmful impact on human health. It is imper- ative that more research be done to further understand the effects of mold on human health, identify the best ways to test patients and indoor environments, and develop optimal treatment approaches for patients, especially given the common occurrence of water damage in buildings and the presence of mycotoxins in food.

# COMMON TOXIC CHEMICALS AND DISEASE

Some of the most common diseases associated with toxic chemical exposure include diabetes; impaired fertility; developmental disorders, such as attention deficit disorder and autism; psychiatric disorders; autoimmune diseases; neurotoxicity, including psychiatric disorders; and cancer.1 Because many toxic chemicals affect the function of mito- chondria, fatigue and exercise intolerance may be common in toxic exposures.5 The marked decline in sperm counts and testosterone in males over the past few decades poses an existential threat to the human race and even to all life on Earth.1 Excessive toxic chemical exposure should be ruled out as a cause of virtually any chronic dis- ease. Some have discounted this toxic load with remarks such as: Oh well, why should I worry about toxic chemical exposure if everyone has it? Although many people frequently have no detectable amount of specific toxic chemicals, every single person tested in the Great Plains Laboratory (GPL) had some detectable chemicals in their urine sam- ples. The most important factor for toxic chemical tests is not whether there are detectable amounts, but if there are high amounts compared with a normal population or if their level exceeds the threshold found to be associated with increased disease risk. Very high concentrations of toxic chemicals, such as those above the 95th percentiles of the entire population and especially values that are multiples of the 95th percentiles, are usually associated with severe health impairment. Those with multiple exposures are at even greater risk. Some of the highest toxic chemical values found at GPL have been in young children with autism. People who think they have healthy lifestyles and who consume organic food are often shocked at the amounts of chemicals found in their urine samples. For example, one of these individuals found her urine perchlorate value was more than 50 times the 95th percentile value for perchlorate. Organic farms frequently have nonorganic farms or golf courses as neighbors. When the golf course or nonorganic farm is sprayed, the chemicals used can travel many miles on a windy day or even evaporate and become a part of the next rainfall. One of the best sources of reference ranges is those from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).6 (Parenthetically, this NHANES group was the author’s first employer after earning his PhD degree in biochemistry.) The NHANES study is one of the best data sources for toxic chem- ical data because it selects the population to be evaluated using highly sophisticated statistical techniques that evaluate virtually all people of both sexes in the United States of every age, race, and geographical region. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and phys- ical examinations of the subjects tested. The survey uses top-notch analytical methods, employing mass spectrometry in most cases. The statistical analysis of the data is also top notch, and the number of subjects is quite large, ranging from 1000 to 2000. Fig. 25.1 shows an example of the NHANES data for dimethylphosphate, a major metab- olite of many different organophosphate pesticides. The NHANES reports have similar data for hundreds of environmental chemicals. Urine data are always reported with creatinine corrections, allowing for comparisons of data from individuals with differing fluid intakes. The statistical analyses of the data are performed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Some of the most important toxic chemicals are those used in agriculture as pesticides, primarily as insecticides and herbicides that kill weeds, which are considered to be any plants that grow where humans do not want them growing. Toxic chemicals may affect every organ in the body, but some of the toxic chemicals of greatest concern are those that affect the brain and nervous system, those that affect reproduction and fertility by muta- genesis or other mechanisms, and those that affect the development of children. In addition to chemicals that harm the human body directly, some chemicals may cause harm by altering the microbiome of the soil and the intestinal tracts of both humans and animals.

# INDICATIONS FOR TOXIC CHEMICAL TESTING

Toxic chemical testing should be used whenever the patient has an occupational exposure to chemicals used in the workplace, such as the following: • Pesticide applicators or agricultural workers exposed to glyphosate, organophosphate pesticides, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), or pyrethroid pesticides • Workers in plastics factories using phthalates or vinyl chloride • Workers in any type of industrial factories in which volatile sol- vents such as benzene, xylene, butadiene, propylene oxide, ethylene oxide, acrylonitrile, bromopropane, and others are regularly used • Patients who have been treated with intravenous solutions from plas- tic bags or administered through plastic intravenous tubing, and may currently be contaminated with phthalates or vinyl chloride • Workers in furniture, upholstery, and drapery industries using a variety of flame retardants, many of which are highly toxic • Individuals who commonly employ paints, stains, or varnishes in their employment (including individuals using these chemicals occasionally, such as repainting the inside of the house, who may sometimes have symptoms such as severe fatigue) • Individuals involved in dry cleaning or cleaning of industrial or military equipment • Firefighters, police officers, and other rescue workers exposed to a wide variety of chemicals in general disasters such as the 9/11 ter- rorist attacks or other large fires • Pilots, flight attendants, and even passengers because they can be exposed to jet engine exhaust and/or chemicals used to disinfect conduits that are circulated through the air system of the plane • Physicians, nurses, other medical personnel, and restaurant work- ers who frequently wash their hands using toxic antibacterial hand soaps containing hexachlorophene, para-chloro-metaxylenol (PCMX), triclosan, and triclocarban • Workers like police officers or car and airplane mechanics who may be exposed to vehicle exhaust fumes The list of conditions for which toxic chemicals should be tested for people who do not obviously have occupation exposures includes the following: • Patients with any illness that is life-threatening or severely debili- tating, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, autism, attention deficit disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, and many others • Patients with chronic illnesses that are not severely debilitating or life-threatening but are significantly reducing quality of life, such as arthritis, fatigue, and others • Patients (both men and women) with impaired fertility • Children with birth defects or failure to reach developmental mile- stones • Women and men who want to reduce their chances of having a baby with a significant disease • Any individual who wants to optimize his or her health and fitness A list of toxic chemicals that are commonly found in human urine samples is given in Table 25.1. Note that some of the chemicals tested are common metabolites of more than one parent toxic chemical. An entire book (such as Clinical Environmental Medicine) is needed to cover even most of the chemicals in Table 25.1 and the other chemi- cals7-39 that are usually tested in the blood. A few summaries of the use and toxicity of some of the most commonly used major toxic chemi- cals follow.

Fig. 25.1 Representative table from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES) publication Fourth National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals (February 2015, p. 128). The survey covers a number of years so that the reader or researcher can determine trends in the exposure of the population. Thus the values for the 75th, 90th, and 99th per- centile appear to be steadily increasing over the last 10 years (1999-2008) of the survey, indicating greater toxic exposure to the population. This trend is apparent in all age groups. (From Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fourth National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals.

# THE MOST COMMON TOXIC CHEMICALS

## Glyphosate

OO PN H OH HO Glyphosate is one of the most prevalent chemicals used in agriculture. Some countries use glyphosate in greater amounts than all other agri- cultural chemicals combined. Monsanto brought it to market in

relevant US patent expired in 2000.40 Many companies now produce the herbicide. By 2016 there was a 100-fold increase from the late 1970s in the frequency of application and volume of glyphosate-based herbi- cides applied, with further increases expected in the future, partly in response to the global emergence and spread of glyphosate-resistant weeds.40 The amount of glyphosate used as a weed killer or herbicide pro- liferated with the development of genetically modified foods that were genetically modified to be resistant to the plant-killing action of gly- phosate. The availability of genetically modified food plants that were patented by Monsanto was a major factor in the tremendous increase in glyphosate use. Corn and soy seeds were the first crops to be mar- keted as Roundup Ready. Current glyphosate-resistant crops include soy, corn, canola, alfalfa, sugar beets, and cotton, with wheat still under development. In 2015, 89% of corn, 94% of soybeans, and 89% of cotton produced in the United States were genetically modified to be glyphosate-tolerant.40 In addition to the use of glyphosate on genetically modified crops, glyphosate is also applied to many nongenetically modified crops as a

## desiccant in the process called preharvest crop desiccation, referring

to the application of an herbicide to a crop shortly before harvest. As a systemic herbicide, glyphosate is not a true desiccant because it can take weeks rather than days for the crop to die back after application.41 Nongenetically modified foods with which glyphosate has been used as a desiccant include wheat, barley, oats, sunflowers, potatoes, lentils, garbanzo beans, and many others.42 In addition, glyphosate is also used as a desiccant for nonfood crops such as cotton and tobacco.43 The shi- kimic acid pathway of weeds and common nongenetically modified (non-GMO) food plants produces aromatic amino acids needed for plant growth; glyphosate inhibits a key enzyme in this pathway, lead- ing to the death of the weed or non-GMO plant. The DNA of GMO corn, soy, and other food plants is modified so that it is relatively resis- tant to glyphosate. The makers of glyphosate claim that the toxicity of glyphosate is negligible because humans and other mammals lack the shikimic acid pathway, but research to disprove the toxic effects of glyphosate on many other biological processes is missing. The human safety of glyphosate has been seriously questioned by a broad group of 14 health experts who are predominantly professors in institutions of environmental health or medical schools or are other environmental professionals.44 Starting in the mid-1990s, a chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) was discovered among the rice paddy farmers in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka.45 Individuals with this kidney disease have substantially higher amounts of glyphosate in their urine than individuals without kidney disease. The government of Sri Lanka subsequently banned the use of glyphosate in that country. In the following two decades, the disease spread rapidly to other farming areas. The age-standardized prevalence of the disease is esti- mated at 15%,45 affecting a total population of 400,000 patients, with an estimated death toll of approximately 20,000 in the period45 The unique feature of CKDu is that its etiology does not include commonly known risk factors for CKD, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or glomerular nephritis.45 A similar incidence of deaths due to CKDu in sugar cane workers has been reported in Central America.45 In those cases, it is suspected that toxic chemicals such as arsenic may form chelation complexes with glyphosate that prolong the persistence of glyphosate in the soil and water and that may also lead to contamination of humans who drink water containing such metal chelates. Such chelates of glypho- sate prolong the life of glyphosate in the environment to as long as years. Although glyphosate was designed to kill weeds, it also kills sus- ceptible bacteria that have biochemical pathways similar to plants and weeds. Shehata et al.46 found that glyphosate exposure in poultry can lead to a marked increase in pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella and Clostridia species, that were resistant to glyphosate in the stool samples of the poultry and to a significant decrease in beneficial flora, such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus badius, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Lactobacillus species, which are sus- ceptible to glyphosate. In addition, ingestion of the herbicide could be a significant pre- disposing factor that has been associated with an increase in diseases mediated by Clostridium botulinum47,48 in cattle, and perhaps even in the farmers exposed to infected cattle.49 C. botulinum is one of three species of Clostridia bacteria that produce large quantities of the pre- cursors of 3-[3-hydroxyphenyl]-3- hydroxypropionic acid (HPHPA), a phenolic compound.50 This compound inhibits the enzyme dopamine– β -hydroxylase that converts dopamine to norepinephrine in neurons in

the brain and in the sympathetic nervous system.50 Excessive amounts of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid have been found to be prevalent in urine samples from children with autism.45 Shaw reported45 on a case study of triplets exposed to high amounts of glyphosate due to excessive ingestion of GMO corn tortillas. Two of the children had autism, and the third had a suspected seizure disorder. All of the children had high biochemical markers indicating mitochondrial damage. All three children had markedly elevated urinary glyphosate, with their mean baseline value—34.4 µ g/g creatinine—being 25.5 times the median value of 1.35 µ g/g creatinine and 24.1 times the mean value of 1.43 µ g/g creatinine of the study’s internal reference range. The glypho- sate value in the urine of one of the retested triplets decreased dramatically (94% decrease) after switching to an organic food diet, and symptoms of autism declined considerably after organic diet implementation. The female of the triplets did not have elevated phenolic compounds on either organic acid test but did have a significantly elevated value of the metabolite tiglylglycine, a marker for mitochondria complex 1 dys- function or mutations in the mitochondrial electron transport chain.45 In addition, the triplets mother also had significantly elevated tiglylglycine. All of the triplets had elevated succinic acid in their urine, an indicator of mitochondrial dysfunction (see Chapter 29, Urinary Organic Acids),45 on at least one of the two organic acids tests performed on these patients. Both males had elevated succinic acid on one of the two samples, whereas the female had elevated values on both organic acid tests. Succinic acid is metabolized by the enzyme succinic dehydrogenase, which is significant in that it is both a Krebs cycle enzyme and a compo- nent—complex 2—of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, making this metabolite a marker of mitochondrial complex 2 dysfunction. Succinic acid has been found to be a sensitive marker for a variety of other toxic chemicals as well, including both metal and nonmetal toxic chemicals. In addition to elevated markers associated with mitochondria dam- age, the high quantity of phenolic compounds produced by Clostridia bacteria in the two male members of the triplets is consistent with the previous reports that glyphosate can alter the intestinal flora of exposed animals and humans. Both males with the elevated Clostridia markers

## overproduction of dopamine, a feature prevalent in autism.45 The

pH of certain compartments of the neurons is a critical factor in main- taining neurotransmitters in the biochemical form that is most stable and least toxic. The synaptic vesicles that store dopamine and norepinephrine maintain an acidic pH of around 5.2, a pH that maintains the optimum stability of these neurotransmitters. These vesicles also contain dopa- mine-beta-hydroxylase that converts dopamine to norepinephrine. If this enzyme is blocked by Clostridia metabolites, dopamine accumu- lates in the synaptic vesicles to the point that excessive dopamine leaks out of the synaptic vesicles and enters the cytoplasm, which has a pH of 7.4, a pH at which dopamine is highly unstable and is converted to a number of highly unstable and toxic metabolites called dopamine quinones and aminochromes.45 Paradoxically, some of these toxic metabolites become even more toxic when they react with glutathi- one. Dopamine toxic metabolites covalently bind to the mitochondrial proteins and the neuronal structural proteins actin and a/b-tubulin of the cytoskeleton, inducing autophagy, the formation of clusters of con- densed chromatin, mitochondrial DNA damage, oxidative damage, impaired mitochondrial energy production, and finally cell death.45 In addition to autism and kidney disease associations, the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization (WHO) published a summary of its monograph on gly- phosate and classified it as probably carcinogenic in humans (category 2A) based on epidemiological, animal, and invitro studies.51 Seralini etal.52 reported that female rats exposed to glyphosate or to glyphosate in a commercial product called Roundup, in which other chemicals are present, developed mammary or pituitary tumors at a rate higher than controls. Treated male rats developed increased rates of liver necro- sis and kidney abnormalities compared with controls. The findings of abnormal kidneys in the exposed rats are consistent with the kidney disease described in Asia that is associated with thousands of deaths related to high glyphosate in the urine. A meta-analysis published in 2014 identified an increased risk of non-Hodgkins lymphoma in work- ers exposed to glyphosate formulations.53 One of the highest values for urine glyphosate recorded at The Great Plains Laboratory (GPL) was in a man who only ate organic food but who used chewing tobacco regularly. Tobacco that is dried appears to be saturated with glyphosate.43

## 2, 4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid (2, 4-D)

CICI OH O 4 5 3 2 1 6 O 2, 4-D is a major herbicide intended to kill unwanted vegetation such as broadleaf weeds and woody plants. It is used in agriculture and on residential properties. People can be exposed to herbicides by breath- ing them in the air, by skin contact from residential use or living near application sites, and by eating contaminated food and drinking contam- inated water.54 Neuritis, weakness, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, peripheral neuropathy, stupor, seizures, brain damage, and impaired reflexes have been associated with dermal or oral exposure.55 2, 4-D is a known endocrine disruptor and can block hormone distribution and cause glandular breakdown. It is linked to immune system damage, birth defects, and reproductive issues, possibly due to its frequent con- tamination with dioxins.55 Small amounts of 2, 4-D may be found in many urine samples because of widespread environmental contamina- tion. 2,4-D was a major component of a chemical mixture called Agent Orange used by the US military during the Vietnam War to increase the visibility for warplanes by destroying plant undergrowth and crops.54 Some of the toxicity of Agent Orange has been attributed to contam- inating molecules called dioxins that arose during manufacturing. 2, 4-D may not be as contaminated with dioxins as in the past.56 Although the presence of dioxins in 2, 4-D has been banned, they have recently still been detected. A July 2013 Four Corners investigation found elevated levels of dioxins in a generic version of 2, 4-D, one of Australias most widely used herbicides. One scientist said the product tested by Four Corners, which was imported from China, had one of the highest dioxin readings for 2, 4-D in the past 10 to 20 years, and could pose potential health risks.57 Recently, genetically modified food plants resistant to both glypho- sate and 2, 4-D have been introduced into agriculture, using herbicides containing both glyphosate and 2, 4-D.58 The highest value at GPL was that of a child with autism with a urine value 28 times the 95th percentile. The child had a urine suc- cinic acid (a marker for mitochondrial complex 2 abnormality) more than 10 times the upper limit of normal, a value more abnormal than individuals with proven mitochondrial DNA deletions. The tiglylgly- cine marker was in the normal range, indicating that the effects of the 2, 4-D were primarily on complex 2 versus complex 1 of the mito- chondrial respiratory chain. The child was treated by sauna therapy for about an hour almost daily for 3 months, along with an organic food diet, after which a repeat test found no detectable 2, 4-D and a considerable improvement in autistic symptoms. The source of 2, 4-D was unable to be identified.

## Organophosphates

CICI CH 3 CH 3 H 3 C H 3 CCH 3 CH 3 CH 3 CIN NN S Diazinon O O O P O O O Malathion O O S P N+ –O O O S S P O O Parathion Chlorpyrifos O O O O S P Organophosphates are one of the most toxic groups of substances used throughout the world. Four common organophosphate structures are illustrated in the accompanying graphic. There are nearly 3 million poisonings per year, resulting in 200,000 deaths.59 They are often used as biochemical weapons and terrorist agents but are most commonly used in pesticide formulations.59 Children exposed to organophos- phates have more than twice the risk of developing pervasive devel- opmental disorder (PDD), an autism spectrum disorder, and children born to mothers living within 500 m of fields where organochlorine pesticides were used were more than six times more likely to develop autism than children whose mothers did not live near such fields.60 Maternal organophosphate exposure has been associated with various adverse outcomes, including having shorter pregnancies and children with impaired reflexes.60 Approximately 340 million kilograms of pesticide active ingredient is used agriculturally in the United States annually, and 85% of US households store at least one pesticide for home use.61 These insecti- cides kill insects (and mammals such as humans) by the inhibition of the enzyme acetyl-cholinesterase and other enzymes in which serine is part of the enzyme active site, such as dipeptidyl peptidase IV. When acetylcholine breakdown is inhibited, overstimulation can lead to con- stant nerve transmission or overstimulation of neurons or muscles, resulting in excessive salivation, abnormal behavior, diarrhea, urinary incontinence, vomiting, tremors, muscle paralysis, and even death.62 High exposure levels have been associated with attention deficit, mem- ory impairment, and pervasive developmental disorders.60 Exposure has also been linked to violent behavior, depression, and suicide and may have played a role in the onset of Gulf War syndrome.63-65 If lev- els are high, toxicity can be measured by decreased cholinesterase or pseudocholinesterase activity in plasma.62 Acute toxicity is treated with atropine and/or pralidoxime.66 Organophosphate exposure can be reduced by eating organic foods, avoiding the use of pesticides in the house or garden, avoiding residence near agricultural areas or golf courses, and staying indoors if insecticides are being sprayed. Lice shampoo, pet flea collars, and flea spray are also major sources of organophosphates. Remove sources of exposure if possible. A total of 147 different organophosphate pesticides can be detected by their metabolites DEP and DMP67 (Table 25.1). Patients with values for organophosphates over the 95th percentile of the reference range with which GPL consulted included those with autism, Aspergers syn- drome (a form of mild autism), severe uncontrolled temper tantrums, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), vascular dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntingtons syndrome. One of the children with autism with high urine organophosphates was from the Miami, Florida, area, in which organophosphates had been widely sprayed to control mos- quitoes implicated in the spread of the Zika virus. Initial results from GPL suggest organophosphates are the most common toxic chemical group in which the urine values of patients commonly exceed the 95th percentile.

# TREATMENT OF NONMETAL TOXIC CHEMICAL

# EXPOSURE

The first and most important step in all chemical exposures is to iden- tify the source of the toxic chemical exposure and remove the patient from the exposure. This may be simple if the patient is industrially exposed in a chemical plant or is a pest exterminator who is exposed to pesticides every day. Chemicals in cosmetics, such as phthalates, triphenylphosphates, and solvents, may be absorbed through the skin. Many individuals are exposed to chemicals through their ingestion of food and water, so switching to an organic diet is highly effective in removing pesticides and herbicides from the body. It is important to understand the difference in the terms organic and non-GMO. Organic foods are foods that have not received treatment with synthetic pesti- cides, herbicides, or other restricted chemicals. Non-GMO labels on foods mean the foods are not from genetically modified plants, but the food could still be highly contaminated with toxic chemicals used as pesticides and herbicides. In the case of the triplets with autism dis- cussed previously, there was a 94% reduction of glyphosate in less than 2 months by switching to an organic diet. Use of supplements that combine with various metabolites of toxic chemicals is also useful to accelerate the detoxification of large numbers of toxic chemicals. Glutathione and glutathione precursors such as n-acetylcysteine frequently combine with oxidation products of Phase I detoxification enzymes to form less toxic Phase II detox- ification conjugates. Liposomal glutathione, taken orally, appears to be more effective than plain glutathione because of better absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Although glutathione may be given

intravenously as well, oral administration is often cheaper and more convenient than intravenous infusions for long detoxification proto- cols. Glycine, an amino acid, may also be used orally to increase the excretion of oxidized metabolites of benzene and xylene as glycine conjugates. Sauna treatment is another common treatment used for detoxifi- cation. Mercola and Crinnion have outlined a comprehensive sauna treatment for detoxification, with some protocols using flush niacin (not niacinamide or time-release niacin).68,69

The RDAT resultant time depends largely on the individual setting. However, the difference in the RDAT time between normal and vitamin A–deficient individuals is significant, and therefore standardization is easily achieved. The normal values depend on the age of the subject, with older subjects having an increased RDAT time.

of local digestive issues like constipation, gastroesophageal reflux dis- ease, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) but also for many chronic, systemic illnesses like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Hashimoto thyroiditis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and migraine. The following sections provide a broad-based overview of digestive physiology, followed by an in-depth look at key aspects of the gut uti- lizing the DIG framework—digestion/absorption (D), immunology/ inflammation/infectious processes (I), and gut microflora balance (G)—and the biomarkers that provide insight into their function and/ or dysfunction.

# DIGESTIVE PHYSIOLOGY

<!-- chunk -->

## Brain

As anyone watching a late-night food commercial may attest to, the process of digestion begins long before any food enters the mouth or stomach. The cephalic phase of digestion begins when anticipatory, visual, gustatory, and/or olfactory stimuli activate central nervous sys- tem (CNS) centers and result in parasympathetic stimulation of gastric activity.8

<!-- chunk -->

## Mouth

Homogenization of ingested food first occurs in the mouth via the grinding and mixing action of the teeth. Salivary glands provide hydration to form a bolus and protect the pharyngeal and esophageal mucosa, primarily with secretory immunoglobulin-A (IgA) antibod- ies. The process of starch and fat hydrolysis is initiated with the release of lingual lipase, salivary amylase, and ptyalin.9,10

<!-- chunk -->

## Esophagus

As the food bolus is swallowed, the epiglottis closes, providing a one- way valve that allows the food to pass into the GI tract and not the respiratory tract. Food is then transported down the esophagus in peri- staltic waves past the lower esophageal sphincter and into the stomach.

<!-- chunk -->

## Stomach

The stomach produces churning action and initiates protein and lipid hydrolysis. Peptides, amino acids, and fatty acids released in this pro- cess synchronize the release of pancreatic juice and bile into the small intestine.9 About 2 L of gastric juice is produced each day, containing several important components.11 Hydrochloric acid (secreted by the parietal cells) activates pepsinogen to convert to pepsin, which renders some minerals (e.g., calcium and iron) more absorbable. It also cre- ates an essentially sterile environment to prevent bacterial overgrowth. Mucus forms an acid- and pepsin-resistant coating for the stomach lining. Gastric lipase secreted by gastric mucosa begins to hydrolyze triglycerols, producing 1,2-diacylglycerols and fatty acids. The optimal pH of gastric lipase is about 4, but the enzyme is active up to pH or 6.5.12 Several GI hormones, including gastrin, somatostatin, and ghrelin, are also produced by cells within the stomach.13

## Liver and Biliary System

The liver is the largest gland in the body and performs an extraordinary number of tasks that affect every system of the body. Although the liver has critical vascular and metabolic functions, its secretory and excre- tory functions—especially as related to the synthesis and secretion of bile acids—are those that most directly affect digestion. Because the by-products of lipid digestion have limited ability to dissolve in water, they have difficulty reaching the epithelial surface of the small intestine, which is covered by the unstirred water layer. To be more effectively absorbed, they must form aggregates (micelles) with bile acids (which act as biological detergents) that can penetrate the unstirred water layer. Without bile acids, only a small number of lipid molecules permeate through the water layer to be taken up by the brush-border membrane of the enterocytes. Finally, fat-soluble anti- oxidants (vitamins A, D, E, and K, as well as lutein and lycopene) also require bile acids for optimal absorption and utilization.

<!-- chunk -->

## Pancreas

The pancreas plays a vital role in supporting the ongoing breakdown of the semifluid mass of partially digested food that flows from the stomach to the small intestine (chyme). Pancreatic duct cells secrete bicarbonate, which is critical for rapidly neutralizing gastric acid to preclude damage to the duodenal mucosa. In addition, pancreatic exocrine function results in the secretion of proteases, amylases, and lipases that further break down macronutrients (proteins, carbohy- drates, and lipids) so that their components are readily absorbed across the intestinal mucosa. Primary pancreatic exocrine insufficiency results from organic diseases of the pancreas (e.g., chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer). Secondary pancreatic exocrine insufficiency results from extrapancreatic dis- eases such as celiac disease and Crohn’s disease, GI and pancreatic surgical resection, as well as any condition that results in a compro- mise or blunting of the small intestinal brush border. These include inflammatory processes, infectious agents, food allergies, and dys- biosis and/or small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency has now been recognized to result from both type 1 dia- betes (26%–57%) and type 2 diabetes (20%–36%).14 Whether of pri- mary or secondary etiology, any compromise of pancreatic exocrine function can result in significant malnutrition-related morbidity and mortality.15

## Small Intestine

Most digestion and assimilation occur in the small intestine. Digestion is mediated chiefly by pancreatic enzymes, including proteolytic enzymes, nucleolytic enzymes, lipases, α -amylase, and phospholipase A 2 , which hydrolyze macromolecules to oligomers, dimers, or mono- mers.9 Pancreatic enzymes are most active in the neutral pH range,11,16 and bicarbonate begins the process of neutralizing stomach acid. Pancreatic proteases are secreted into the duodenum as inactive pre- cursors, trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and proelastase, and are acti- vated by brush-border enzymes, such as enterokinase, to form trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase, respectively.11 The digestive and absorption capacities of the small intestine are greatly enhanced by circular folds and fingerlike projections of the intestinal mucosa called microvilli. This region, dubbed the “brush border,” increases the luminal surface area of the intestinal wall by about 600 times, creating a total absorptive surface of approximately 200 to 250 m,2 essentially the size of a tennis court.11,16,17

## 229CHAPTER 28 Biomarkers for Stool Analysis

Even after prolonged contact with pancreatic enzymes, a substan- tial portion of ingested carbohydrates and amino acids depend on hydrolytic enzymes (disaccharidases such as maltase, sucrase, lactase, enterokinase, and peptidases) produced by the brush-border mem- brane to complete their digestion.11 For this reason, damage to the intestinal brush border—result- ing from inflammation, trauma, parasitical infection, bacterial over- growth, long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and other factors—may interfere significantly with the proper absorption of nutrients. Such damage also can disrupt the intercellular tight junc- tions that are vital to the protective-barrier function of the gut muco- sal layer, increasing the intestinal permeability of potentially harmful macromolecules, such as bacteria and toxins, into the systemic circula- tion. This state of increased intestinal permeability, sometimes referred to as “leaky gut,” has been cited as a potential contributory or causative factor in gluten enteropathy, Crohn’s disease, food allergy, various arthritides and autoimmune diseases, chemotherapy complications, and a variety of other clinical conditions.18–22 Recent work has implicated zonulin, the human analog to an endo- toxin produced by Vibrio cholera, as the master regulator of intercel- lular tight junctions. The two known triggers of zonulin release, which in turn lead to tight junction disassembly, are bacterial toxins and gliadin.23

## Large Intestine

A primary role of the large intestine is to absorb water, about 1 L/ day. The large intestine also provides an environment for microbial fermentation of soluble fiber, starch, and undigested carbohydrates. Soluble fibers are more readily fermented than insoluble fibers.24 Nondigestible carbohydrates (e.g., fiber), polysaccharides, and oli- gosaccharides contain chemical bonds that make them incapable of complete digestion by pancreatic or brush-border enzymes. As they move through the digestive tract, these undigested compounds play an important role in intestinal transport mechanisms. Once in the colon, they are cleaved and modified by enzymes produced by resident colonic bacteria to form short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and various gases, such as methane, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide.12

# ASSESSING GASTROINTESTINAL HEALTH: DIG

As noted previously, a clinical approach to evaluating the functional state of gut health can be one that is based on the primary physiologi- cal roles of the gut. This approach is captured by the mnemonic DIG: digestion/absorption (D), immunology/inflammation/infectious pro- cesses (I), and gut microflora balance (G).

# DIGESTION/ABSORPTION

<!-- chunk -->

## Digestive Dysfunction

The first step in optimizing GI health is optimizing digestive function. Because numerous organs are involved in the digestive process, maldi- gestion can occur with malfunction at any level of digestive physiology, resulting in both local and systemic signs and symptoms. Maldigestion may result from an inadequate cephalic phase, leading to inadequate secretion of salivary amylases and proteases; insufficient mastication; hypochlorhydria; pancreatic insufficiency; bile insufficiency; small intestinal villous atrophy; and brush-border enzyme destruction. As an example, hypochlorhydria has been hypothesized to be the root cause of a number of clinical conditions, including reduced min- eral and amino acid absorption, depression, and other syndromes.25,26 In addition, interest has been expressed in the medical literature about the connection between the robust use of pharmaceuticals promoting gastric acid blockade and chronic clinical complaints. Research indicates that small bowel bacterial overgrowth and associ- ated disorders, such as blunting of brush-border enzyme activity and decreased pancreatic exocrine function, may be an iatrogenic conse- quence of overprescribing of proton-pump inhibitors.27–29 Given that long-term use of drugs that markedly reduce gastric acid secretion may negatively affect dietary and nutraceutical calcium absorption, concern has also been raised about their potential to increase the risk of fracture in individuals with osteoporosis, although the greatest potential for this may be in patients already at risk for loss of bone mineral density.30–33 A 2019 meta-analysis, which included 32 studies and over 2 million individuals, found an increase in risk for any-site, hip, and spine frac- tures associated with the use of proton-pump inhibitors, which was strengthened by the duration of use, suggesting causality. Importantly, this increase in fracture risk was not associated with a decrease in bone mineral density.34 Maldigestion associated with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency results in inadequate delivery of enzymes to the small intestine and can lead to the inadequate breakdown of fats, carbohydrates, or protein. The net effect is poor nutrition and an unhealthy environment for the flora of the large intestine. Significant decreases in exocrine pancreatic secretion have been associated with the aging process35 and, clinically, are associated with osteoporosis36,37 and diabetes.38–40

## Absorptive Dysfunction

Malabsorption can be characterized by abnormal fecal excretion of fat (steatorrhea); abdominal pain; and variable malabsorption of fats, fat-soluble vitamins, other vitamins, proteins, carbohydrates, miner- als, and water. Common causes include the following: • Maldigestion • Hypochlorhydria • Small bowel bacterial overgrowth • Deficient bile production, resulting in inadequate solubility of fatty acids12 • Chronic inflammation of the small intestine • Rapid transit, which does not allow adequate time for absorption Malabsorption often increases with age41: atrophic gastritis is estimated to affect 10% to 30% of individuals more than 50 years old and often leads to inadequate absorption of key nutrients, such as vitamin B 12 .42 To date, deficiencies in vitamin B 12 , vitamin C, vita- min D, magnesium, calcium, and iron have all been associated with hypochlorhydria.43,44 General malabsorption syndromes are associated with many disor- ders of the intestinal tract, including celiac disease, gluten enteropathy, IBD, infectious processes such as giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis, lac- tose intolerance, and eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Because amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals are absorbed through different processes, individuals with malabsorption are at risk for the develop- ment of a wide range of nutrient deficiencies.

## Pancreatic Elastase

Pancreatic elastase 1 (PE1) is a proteolytic enzyme secreted exclusively by the human pancreas, and as such, it reflects overall pancreatic exo- crine function.45 It is an extremely stable, reliable, and specific marker46 and correlates well with gold-standard, stimulated pancreatic function tests.47 PE1 is concentrated fivefold to sixfold higher in feces than when it enters the duodenum, reflecting the overall stability of this bio- marker in the GI tract.48 It is not degraded during intestinal transit and is generally not affected by increases or decreases in intestinal transit time,49 although its sensitivity may be diminished in cases of liquid diarrhea.50 Unlike other pancreatic markers, such as chymotrypsin,

<!-- chunk -->

## 230SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

PE1 results are not affected by pancreatic enzyme replacement ther- apy,46,47 a feature that makes it a valuable marker for monitoring and adjusting exogenous enzyme replacement.46 PE1 appears to have less sensitivity when diagnosing mild exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and may have limited use in differentiating pancreatic from nonpancreatic steatorrhea or diarrhea.51 Previous analyses suggest a sensitivity of 54% to 65%, 75%, and 95% to 100% for mild, moderate, and severe insufficiency, respectively, with an overall specificity of 79%. It should be noted that other indirect assess- ments of pancreatic function, such as the 72-hour fecal fat test, have very poor sensitivity for mild/moderate insufficiency.52 Although research typically indicates levels of PE1 less than mcg/g to be consistent with normal pancreatic exocrine function, healthy individuals produce on average 500 mcg/g of PE1. PE1 levels greater than 200 mcg/g and less than 500 mcg/g suggest a deviation from optimal pancreatic function, values between 100 and 200 mcg/g suggest moderate pancreatic insufficiency, and values less than mcg/g are considered to be consistent with severe pancreatic insuffi- ciency.53,54 Enzymatic support of pancreatic insufficiency is warranted, and the strength of supplementation—typically based on the level of lipase units—should be modulated based on the degree of pancreatic insufficiency indicated by the PE1 level (Table 28.1). Reduced PE1 has been reported clinically in patients with type and type 2 diabetes,55,56 chronic pancreatitis,57,58 osteoporosis,37 cystic fibrosis,59 trauma states,55 and intestinal malabsorption states associ- ated with mucosal atrophy such as celiac disease.60,61

## Putrefactive Short-Chain Fatty Acids

Valerate, isovalerate, and isobutyrate are produced exclusively by bac- terial fermentation of proteinaceous material (polypeptides and amino acids). These SCFAs are putrefactive, and their presence suggests underlying maldigestion and/or malabsorption from dysfunctional states, such as hypochlorhydria or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency,62 or bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine. Other causes are GI dis- ease (resulting from the fermentation of blood or mucosal cells deliv- ered to the colon)63 and rapid transit time (resulting from inadequate time for digestion and absorption of peptides and amino acids).64 Increased levels of SCFAs, including acetate, propionate, butyr- ate, and valerate, have all been associated with increased adiposity and obesity, although decreased SCFA levels have been associated with colorectal cancer.65,66 A 2019 systematic review and meta-anal- ysis found that levels among those with IBS differed from healthy controls, but they were not consistently elevated. Those with consti- pation-predominant IBS had lower butyrate and propionate levels, whereas those with diarrhea-predominant IBS had elevated levels of butyrate only.67

## Fecal Fats

Fecal fats include triglycerides, long-chain fatty acids, cholesterol, and phospholipids, and are derived primarily from the dietary ingestion of fat. Elevated levels of fecal fats in the stool suggest fat malabsorption (steatorrhea), which can occur as a result of mal- digestion and/or impaired uptake of fatty acids. In addition, any condition that results in impairment of lipase activity and bile acid production and release may result in fat malabsorption. These include pancreatic insufficiency, cholestasis, short bowel syndrome, and celiac disease.68

# IMMUNOLOGY/INFLAMMATION/INFECTIOUS

# PROCESSES

As noted previously, more than 70% of the body’s immune tissue sits within the GI tract.69 This immune tissue has a complex and dynamic relationship with the commensal microflora that colonizes its sur- face—the primary interface with an external environment rich in both supportive dietary antigens as well as pathogenic agents. The gut com- mensal microflora exists in this macronutrient-dense intestinal envi- ronment and is a significant contributor to the process of digestion, building of essential nutrients, and holding nonbeneficial bacterial counts in check. How is it, then, that host immune function is modu- lated to allow for the acceptance of self (as well as supportive commen- sal organisms and dietary antigens), even as it is vigilantly surveying for and combating against pathogenic microorganisms? The answer appears to lie with an exquisitely balanced, ongoing inflammatory response by the intestinal immune system: it is capa- ble of mounting strong inflammatory responses against pathogenic agents while concomitantly providing inhibitory signals that preclude responses against commensal bacteria.70,71 Any alteration of this equi- librium, for example, as a result of gut microflora imbalance, genetic predisposition, or immune dysregulation, will result in an upregu- lation of the gut inflammatory response. Diagnostically, this may be reflected by the release of the biomarker calprotectin from neutro- phils.72 Clinically, the breakdown of this intestinal immune balance has been implicated in the development of diseases marked by significant inflammation, such as IBD,73–75 and has been postulated to play a role in the development of extraintestinal allergic and autoimmune disor- ders.76 For example, dysbiosis appears to be a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis, and the effectiveness of recently developed biopharmaceuti- cals, such as etanercept, may in part be due to a shift in the micro- biota composition.77 Alterations in microbiota populations have also been reported for conditions not recognized as having an autoimmune component, for example, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cardiovas- cular disease has been associated with microbial shifts.78,79 Similarly, changes to gut microbiota populations may drive a variety of pathways that contribute to diabetes and obesity (Fig. 28.2). Microflora imbal- ance has also been reported in patients with IBS.80

## Eosinophil Protein X

Eosinophil protein X (EPX), also known as eosinophil-derived neu- rotoxin (EDN), is a basic cellular protein with potent cytotoxic and neurotoxic properties and is a marker of eosinophil activation and degranulation. Mobilization of eosinophils in the gut appears to occur in response to immune-mediated inflammatory responses.81,82 Clinically, fecal elevations of EPX have been described in IBD, IgE-mediated food allergy, parasitical infections, and collagenous coli- tis.83–93 For example, in a small study, fecal EPX levels were shown to out-predict both skin-prick tests and atopy patch tests for diagnosing cow’s milk allergy in toddlers.94

## Calprotectin

Calprotectin belongs to a group of calcium-binding neutrophil-de- rived proteins. Because neutrophils are typically mobilized in response to increased mucosal permeability, cell or tissue damage, and infec- tious processes, elevations in calprotectin may be seen in the presence of inflammatory, neoplastic, and/or infectious disease processes.95,96 Clinical application of this biomarker has been directed toward dis- cerning the best approach for the patient with functional abdominal symptomology. Specifically, calprotectin has been evaluated (in con- junction with Rome criteria) as a diagnostic biomarker to distinguish between IBS and IBD.97–99 Surveys indicated that up to 12% of primary care visits comprised IBS-related complaints, and such visits accounted for 28% of referrals to gastroenterologists.100,101 Because symptoms often overlap, early IBD may be inappropriately labeled as IBS. At least one study reported that more than 25% of patients with Crohn’s dis- ease had been misdiagnosed as having IBS in the prodromal stages of their disease.102 Attempts to define organic disease in patients with IBS inevitably results in the application of more invasive diagnostic imag- ing procedures and escalated healthcare costs.6 Calprotectin has been found to correlate closely with IBD activ- ity103 and provides a highly sensitive, specific, and noninvasive alterna- tive for assessing inflammatory activity in IBD.99,104 Fecal calprotectin levels have been shown to correlate significantly with histological and endoscopic assessments of disease activity in ulcerative colitis105 and with indium-111–labeled white blood cells (the gold standard for assessing gut inflammation) in patients with Crohn’s disease.106 In one report, more than 95% of patients with IBD had elevated fecal calpro- tectin levels.107 Calprotectin has been used to predict relapse in patients with estab- lished IBD and to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic regimens as well.83,108,109 In 2017 a systematic review was published in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, which found that two consecutively elevated calprotec- tin values were associated with 53% to 83% likelihood of relapse within the next 2 to 3 months among asymptomatic patients with IBD.110 Because the severity of inflammation is indicated by varying levels of calprotectin, the treatment options and urgency of diagnostic inter- vention vary as well (Table 28.2).

## Infectious Agents

## Helicobacter pylori. Helicobacter pylori remains a prevalent

worldwide infection, with infection rates in middle-aged adults reaching more than 80% in areas of low socioeconomic status and 20% to 50% in most industrialized countries.111 H. pylori continues to be a causal link for the development of peptic ulcer disease (an estimated 10% to 20% lifetime risk in infected individuals),112 as well as a variety of other GI concerns ranging in severity from dyspepsia to gastric malignancy.113,114 Several diagnostic options exist in assessing possible H. pylori infec- tion. Although histological confirmation remains the gold standard, noninvasive measures such as urea breath testing, H. pylori stool anti- gen (HpSA) testing, and H. pylori polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are currently available. A 2018 Cochrane review found that at a 90% specificity, HpSA testing has a sensitivity of 83%, less accurate than urea breath testing for the diagnosis of infection.115 HpSA diagnostics have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the detection of H. pylori pre- and posteradication therapy. This biomarker indicates the presence of H. pylori antigens shed directly into the stool and provides increased ease of clinical use as well as diagnostic performance characteristics comparable to urea breath testing in both adult and pediatric populations.116,117 It has been shown to accurately indicate treatment failure at 7 days after comple- tion of eradication therapy (compared with 4 weeks for urea breath testing),117–119 an important consideration for directing additional clinical intervention in patients who remain symptomatic or develop recurrent symptoms posttherapy. Although PCR testing for H. pylori is currently offered as a nonin- vasive diagnostic alternative to endoscopy and biopsy as well, concerns have been raised about the high degree of false-positive results with this methodology.120,121

infection occurring after antibiotic therapy, the epidemiology of C. difficile infection has shifted significantly. Its incidence has increased dramatically worldwide in the past decade, and new at-risk populations include individuals with community-acquired infection and no previous exposure to antibiotics, children, and pregnant women.122 C. difficile produces two toxins, A and B, which are its main viru- lence factors, and human infection can take many forms. These range from asymptomatic carrier states123 and recurrent mild-to-moderate IBS-like manifestations to severe symptoms indistinguishable from colitis (cramping, diarrhea, urgency, mucus, and blood) that may result in a misdiagnosis of IBD.124

<!-- chunk -->

## Parasitical Agents

Research suggests that parasitical organisms may also act as etiologi- cal agents of gut inflammation and dysfunction, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation.125 One study found Blastocystis homi- nis to be present four times more frequently in patients with IBS com- pared with control subjects. In addition, symptoms resolved in 80% of subjects with IBS when B. hominis was treated.126 Other parasitical agents identified by stool analysis that have been isolated from patients with clinical symptomology include Dientamoeba fragilis, Entamoeba spp., Endolimax nana, and Giardia lamblia.127–129 A review by an American diagnostic laboratory rou- tinely surveying stool for parasitical agents found that 23.5% of nearly 14,000 clinical samples meeting International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition, criteria for IBS tested positive for the pres- ence of at least one parasite.130 B. hominis was the most commonly identified organism (12.5% of positive samples), followed by D. fra- gilis (3.8%), Entamoeba spp. (3.4%), E. nana (2.2%), and G. lamblia (0.7%). Similar results have been reported by laboratories outside of the United States as well.131 In 2017 a systematic review of 45 studies found that following infectious enteritis, more than 10% of individuals develop IBS, a more than fourfold increase in risk compared with those without infectious enteritis.132

# GUT MICROFLORA BALANCE

At birth, the human GI tract is sterile. Bacterial colonization begins within days of delivery and evolves continuously over the first 1 to 2 years of life.133 Early gut microflora development is affected by a variety of factors: location and type of birthing, breastfeeding versus formula-feeding, and antibiotic use in infancy and childhood.134–137 Bifidobacteria are typically the first organisms to populate the new- born gut, and research suggests that any event that results in inade- quate gut colonization during early life may lead to an increased risk of infectious, allergic, and autoimmune disorders later in life.138 Once established, the bacterial composition of the gut tends to remain rela- tively constant over the lifetime of an adult,139 although environmen- tal (pharmaceuticals, toxins, infectious agents), lifestyle (stress), and dietary (glycemic load, fiber content, essential fatty acid composition, macronutrient/micronutrient composition, and pH balance) factors may induce shifts in commensal flora balance.140,141 Bacteria are present at every level of the GI tract and can be found in increasing density as one progresses from the upper gut (esopha- gus and stomach, 103 to 105 organisms/mL luminal content) to the lower gut (large intestine, 1010 to 1012 organisms/mL luminal content; feces, 109 to 1011 organisms/mL luminal content). In addition, the human gut hosts a massive diversity of microflora species—estimates range from 2000 to 35,000 bacterial species in the human gut; because many of these species are not cultivatable, it is difficult to derive a definitive estimate.142,143 A recent project, the Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHit), cataloged nearly 10 million genes in the human gut microbiome.144 Anaerobic species comprise the vast majority of the microbiome in healthy individuals; these include obli- gate anaerobes such as Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Clostridium, as well as facultative anaerobes such as Escherichia coli, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Proteus, and Klebsiella.145 At counts of greater than 100 trillion bacteria colonizing the GI tract, these nonhuman cells vastly outnumber the total number of human cells in the body. With a metabolic capacity greater than the liver—and accounting for roughly 3 lb of body mass—this dynamic population of organisms could be considered a hidden organ in its own right.146 As noted previously, the bacteria that inhabit the human GI tract play a significant role in metabolic processes in the body. These include fermentation, SCFA and undigested dietary fiber metabo- lism, primary bile acid deconjugation, vitamin synthesis, and energy production. In addition, they are key immunomodulators, exert tro- phic effects on intestinal epithelia, and are a critical defense against pathogens—not only by competing for nutrients, space, and adher- ence intraluminally but also by producing bactericidal substances.147 For this reason, alterations in gut microbial balance (dysbiosis) may result in health-related consequences at both the intestinal and extraintestinal levels.80,148–150 In dysbiosis, organisms of typically low intrinsic virulence, includ- ing bacteria, yeasts, and protozoa, may grow or migrate beyond their normal limitations. This can result in intensified microbial competi- tion for nutrients, damage to the gut mucosal layer, and alterations of host immune function151 and, as a consequence, may increase the risk for nutritional deficiencies, inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and neoplasia.147,152–156 Given the potential for disease that results from altered host–flora dynamics, restoration of balance as a means of restoring health has been a fundamental tenet of natural medicine and an increasing area of research in traditional medical spheres. However, the question should be asked: What defines optimal gut ecology? Analysis of stool samples has been historically used to provide insight into the microbial composition of the gut. Specifically, levels of growth on plated culture media can be quantified and reflect the den- sity of bacteria in the distal colon. Studies comparing electron micro- scopical evaluation of the microflora with fecal culture suggest that 50% to 80% of the total microscopic composition is recovered with stool culture methodologies. Limitations presented with the utiliza- tion of culture techniques include selectivity of growth based on media used and challenges posed by recovering strict anaerobes in a standard culture environment. Despite these limitations, the use of molecular probes suggests that there is good agreement on the degree of bio- diversity when fecal culture is compared with 16S rDNA sequence analysis. In addition, biomarkers that reflect the metabolic activity of the GI microflora provide insight into the optimal functioning of the microbiome.157 With the advent of the Human Microbiome Project, increased focus has been placed on the use of molecular probe technology to charac- terize the microbial populations of the human body. A surprising 80% of the bacteria populating the human gut, previously unknown and thought to be unculturable, was revealed with these probe technolo- gies.158 What has emerged in recent years is the field of “culturomics,” a revolution in bacterial culture technology that has permitted the isolation of hundreds of new bacterial species using multiple culture conditions and prolonged incubation times, combined with matrix-as- sisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and 16S rRNA sequencing. There are a number of

techniques that have advanced culture technology, including the use of diffusion chambers (the use of membranes that allow nutrients to enter but confine bacterial cells); this alone increased the number of cultured colonies 300-fold.159,160 Fig. 28.3 shows all 2776 species iso- lated from humans at least once using culture, an incredible and very recent increase in the number of culturable species. Given ongoing evidence linking the GI microflora, health, and dis- ease, these research initiatives have sought to identify a core gut micro- biome. A limited number of common species have been demonstrated in the human intestinal microbiota to date, indicating the promise of applying molecular probe techniques in defining a beneficial bacte- rial composition. Given that research consistently demonstrates sig- nificant interindividual diversity and high intraindividual specificity, variability of microflora composition between individuals appears to be the norm, especially with aging.161,162 In addition, although molec- ular probes have the capability of identifying the vast pool of species inhabiting the human gut, questions have been raised about the clin- ical relevance of such identification, as was noted previously with H. pylori PCR versus stool antigen testing. This is of particular concern when parasitical and/or pathogenic organisms are identified because probe technology does not currently have the capacity to differenti- ate between the DNA of living organisms (active infection) and DNA fragments indicative of past infectious processes or incidental expo- sure (the so-called “viability bias”). Additionally, metagenomic studies are limited by the extraction bias; that is, the diversity of the bacterial revealed is a function of the extraction protocol.163 It seems likely that advanced culture methods combined with genomic analyses may pro- vide the best overall picture of gut microbial diversity. Ultimately, characterization of the microflora is undertaken to cor- rect imbalances that may be contributing to acute or chronic states of illness. Supportive therapies such as prebiotics and probiotics (see Chapters 104 and 105 on prebiotics and probiotics) are standard clin- ical tools for optimizing gut health, and supplementation has been shown to be of benefit in an array of medical conditions, including atopic dermatitis,145,164 acute infectious and antibiotic-associated diar- rhea,165–167 cancer prevention,154 IBS,168,169 prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis,170 prevention and treatment of Pouchitis,171 and ulcer- ative colitis.172–175 Although evidence exists that demonstrates clinical benefit, there is little consensus regarding what constitutes the most optimal ther- apeutic strain(s), concentrations, or timeline of treatment. With the emergence of molecular technology, there may be a point in the near future that allows individual targeting of probiotic therapies. Until that time, phenotypic markers that provide insight into the health of the microbiome—biomarkers reflecting digestion/absorption (D), immu- nology/inflammation/infectious processes (I), and gut microflora bal- ance (G)—may be utilized to identify and monitor patients needing support.

## Beneficial Bacteria

Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and nonpathogenic E. coli are the pre- dominant strains of beneficial flora,135 with the obligate anaerobic Bifidobacteria constituting about one fourth of the microbial flora found in adults.176 In the distal colon, Bifidobacteria outnumber Lactobacilli by 1000:1.177 Quantification of Bifidobacteria via stool culture typically demonstrates recovery in the 3+ or 4+ ranges in a healthy microbial milieu. The facultative aerobe Lactobacilli and nonpathogenic E. coli are both typically recovered in the 1+ or 2+ ranges.178 Adequate amounts of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and non- pathogenic E. coli are essential for the maintenance of optimal digestive functioning, and as such, these species are utilized in culture diagnos- tics as indicators of gut microflora health. Recovery of their numbers in less-than-optimal ranges suggests alterations in gut microbial balance and indicates a clinical need to ascertain the underlying etiology of the disruption and, ultimately, to assess the need for therapeutic support. The composition and distribution of the GI flora are affected by a vari- ety of factors, as noted previously, including dietary intake, infectious agents, pharmaceuticals, and age. Stress also exerts a profound impact on gut flora and physiology, including increasing intestinal permeabil- ity, increasing bacterial adherence, and decreasing intraluminal levels of Lactobacilli.141 Restoration of balance and improvement of clinical symptoms may be achieved by probiotic supplementation. As indicated in the peer-reviewed literature, increasing levels of probiotic support may be required with increasing levels of disease state severity (Fig. 28.4).179

## Additional Bacteria

Bacterial cultures are capable of identifying any number of additional organisms present in the individual human gut. These organisms may or may not exert a pathogenic effect depending on the state of balance or imbalance of the gut microbial milieu in toto. Putting it another way: sometimes these agents are the source of gut dysfunction, and sometimes their presence is merely a reflection of underlying gut dysfunction. Overgrowth of additional bacteria may cause clinical and subclin- ical malabsorption and increase bowel permeability to large mole- cules. Abnormalities of the immune or mechanical barriers can lead to enhanced uptake of inflammatory luminal macromolecules and pathogenic bacteria. Bacterial antigens are capable of inducing anti- bodies, which cross-react with host antibodies, forming systemic immune complexes.180,181 This process has been implicated in the eti- ology of chronic gut inflammation, as well as SLE and other connective tissue diseases.182,183

## 234SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

Bacterial species such as Klebsiella and Proteus are not routinely surveyed as components of standard microbiological assessments, but both have demonstrated antigenic cross-reactivity to human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). Klebsiella has been associated with anky- losing spondylitis when cross-reactivity occurs with the HLA-B27 antigen. Similarly, Proteus mirabilis has been associated with rheu- matoid arthritis and is known to cross-react with the HLA-DR4 antigen.184,185

## Mycology

The GI tract in healthy individuals normally harbors small amounts of yeast. However, colonic yeast infections have attracted attention and controversy as a possible cause of chronic complex illnesses.186 Investigators have hypothesized that Candida albicans may be involved in the etiology of allergic disorders such as scleroderma and asthma,152,187 chronic fatigue,188 chemical sensitivity,186 and IBD.189 For example, a recent analysis of 235 individuals with IBD found that the fungal microbiota is also shifted compared with healthy controls, including a reduced proportion of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and an increased proportion of C. albicans.190

## Biomarkers for Microflora Metabolic Activity

As mentioned previously, biomarkers that reflect the metabolic activ- ity of the GI microflora can provide an adjunctive assessment of the microbial status of the gut. Diagnostic assays utilized include those that evaluate SCFAs, β -glucuronidase, and bile acid metabolism.165

<!-- chunk -->

## Beneficial Short-Chain Fatty Acids

SCFAs are produced by the anaerobic bacterial fermentation of pri- marily nonabsorbed dietary fiber.191 The rate and amount of SCFA production depends on the composition and density of microflora present in the colon, the substrate source, and GI transit time.192 There are three primary beneficial SCFAs—acetate, n-butyrate, and propionate—yet most clinical and research emphasis has been placed on n-butyrate. Butyrate plays a major role in the physiology of the colonic mucosa and serves as the major energy source for the colono- cyte.193 In addition, research suggests that it may modulate inflamma- tion in IBD via regulation of proinflammatory cytokines194,195 and may play a role in the prevention of colon cancer.196

<!-- chunk -->

## Beta-Glucuronidase

Beta-glucuronidase is an inducible enzyme elaborated by anaerobic E. coli, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, and Clostridium.197,198 By uncou- pling glucuronides (xenobiotics and endogenous compounds detox- ified via the glucuronidation pathway), this enzyme can deconjugate potential toxins, enhancing the formation of local carcinogens in the bowel199 and promoting the enterohepatic recirculation of toxins, hormones,200 and various drugs201 in the body. For this reason, excess amounts of the enzyme may promote a higher risk of colon cancer. Both the incidence of colon cancer and levels of β -glucuronidase tend to be higher in individuals consuming Western diets (high in saturated fat, low in fiber) than in individuals consuming diets high in fiber and low in saturated fat.202 However, an adequate amount of β -glucuronidase activity is prob- ably important to maintain normal enterohepatic recirculation of endogenous compounds, such as vitamin D,203 thyroid hormone,204 and estrogen.205

<!-- chunk -->

## Bile Acids

The relationship between dietary fat and increased risk of colon cancer is believed to hinge on the excess production of bile acids and the bacte- rial conversion of conjugated primary bile acids to potentially dangerous unconjugated secondary bile acids.206 Studies have found that a higher ratio of secondary bile acids, specifically, an elevated ratio of lithocholic acid to deoxycholic acid (LCA/DCA ratio), is associated with higher sus- ceptibility to polyps and colorectal cancer.207 Increased secondary bile acid excretion and a rise in the LCA/DCA ratio have also been observed in patients with gallstones.208 An increase in secondary bile acids and a decrease in primary bile acids have recently been observed among patients with heart failure, with a tentative link to overall survival.209

## 235CHAPTER 28 Biomarkers for Stool Analysis

Bacterial overgrowth markedly increases the concentration of unconjugated bile acids, and this mechanism may play an important role in the pathophysiology of gut mucosal injury.210 Probiotic treat- ment with L. reuteri has been demonstrated to lower the bioavailable concentration of toxic bile acids.206


The philosophical framework that describes GI health to be the foun- dation of optimal health is not a new one. The Sushruta Samhita, an ancient Ayurvedic text, alludes to this in the following passage: “A person whose basic emotional and physical tendencies are in balance, whose digestive power is balanced, whose bodily tissues, elimination functions and activities are in balance, and whose mind, sense and soul are filled with vitality, that person is said to be healthy.” If we hold this tenet to be true, then tools that allow us to diagnostically illuminate the imbalances that create symptoms and disease states in our patients— and ultimately lead to interventions to support them—are clinically important. Biomarkers for stool analysis provide a useful approach to identify the underlying pathologies that present as gut dysfunction, thus eliminating the need for costly diagnostic testing where unneces- sary; highlighting those individuals specifically at risk for severe disease who do require significant diagnostic intervention; and identifying the source of gut dysfunction to apply simple, cost-effective treatments (Boxes 28.1 and 28.2).

through urine organic acid testing, and they have been studied in a variety of conditions. Clinically profiling bacterial metabolites can assist in the detec- tion of unhealthy gut bacteria alterations, commonly called dysbiosis. Antibiotic use has been correlated with decreased excretion of bacterial organic acids.10,11 Conversely, excessive bacterial growth in the gastro- intestinal (GI) tract (such as in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [SIBO]; see Chapter 9) may lead to a predictable global increase in bac- terial metabolite production.12 Evaluating bacterially derived organic acids can, therefore, provide insight into the relative abundance of GI microbiota and their metabolic activity. Other factors, such as dietary habits, can strongly influence the urine levels of these organic acids. Accordingly, individual test results require careful interpretation and clinical correlation, including an assessment of the dietary factors present at the time of testing.

## Malabsorption Markers (Tryptophan and Phenylalanine

<!-- chunk -->

## Metabolites)

Protein malabsorption can lead to excessive bacterial production of par- ticular organic acids. Hartnup disease is a well-researched example of this phenomenon. In this condition, amino acid absorption (particularly tryptophan) is impaired in the intestine and leads to excessive bacterial fermentation of tryptophan to indole metabolites (indole-3-acetate).13 Therefore Hartnup disease serves as a model for assessing bacterial fer- mentation products as markers of amino acid malabsorption.

<!-- chunk -->

## Indoleacetic acid (IAA), or indole-3-acetate, is produced by gut

bacterial fermentation of the amino acid tryptophan (as is seen in Hartnup disease).14 Urinary IAA may also function as a biomarker for abnormal tryptophan metabolism, which is a characteristic fea- ture in neurocognitive disorders.15 IAA is considered to be systemi- cally inflammatory, and the literature has correlated excessive IAA production with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease.16 Indoleacetic aciduria has also been found in autistic patients, which is intriguing, given that autism is commonly associated with both dysbi- osis and disordered tryptophan metabolism.17 IAA was previously thought to be primarily derived from the bac- teria Clostridia bartletti or similar Clostridia species18; however, com- mon gut microbes such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces spp. have demonstrated the ability to synthesize IAA.19,20 Therefore IAA ulti- mately may be shown to be another way that gut bacteria can produce systemically-active compounds that can disrupt metabolic pathways.

<!-- chunk -->

## Indican is another indole compound commonly correlated with protein

malabsorption and has been used to assess dysbiosis and overgrowth.21–23

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenylacetic acid and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid are also pro-

duced by gut bacterial fermentation of amino acids, similar to IAA.11,18 Clinicians have used them as malabsorption markers alongside IAA; however, other dietary factors contribute to their production (Table 29.1). Therefore these markers should also be thought of as phenolic metabolites, which are discussed in the next section.

## Dysbiosis Markers (Phenolic Metabolites): DHPPA3, 3-HPA,

<!-- chunk -->

## 4-HPA, PAA, HPHPA, Benzoic Acid, Hippuric Acid, D-Lactate

There are numerous organic acids that originate, at least in part, from gut microbiota. These acids have been used clinically as an indirect assessment of dysbiosis. Many of these bacterial metabolites originate from the fermentation of dietary phenols and flavonoids. Therefore the greater the bacterial numbers/activity in the GI tract, the higher the levels of bacterial metabolites found in the urine. Diets high in polyphenols can be reflected as elevated urine levels in organic acid testing (Table 29.2). Specifically, bacteria easily metab- olize dietary substrates such as flavonoids, catechins, and caffeic acids into these organic acids.24 This understanding leads to an alternate clinical utility for the phenolic metabolites. In the absence of dysbiosis, levels of phenolic metabolites may serve as a marker for the intake of healthy, antioxidant-rich foods. Clinically, urinary phenylacetic acid has been shown to inversely cor- relate to depressive symptoms.25–27 There are similar findings for both

## acid (4-HPAA).7,28 All of these microbial by-products may exhibit

COX-2 inhibition and free-radical–scavenging properties, which may reduce colon cancer risk. This lends further support to the utility of these markers as an indication of antioxidant consumption.29–31 When these biomarkers are not suspected to be elevated due to dietary influence, abnormalities may be due to imbalances in gut flora which often lead clinicians to assess GI function and treat where appropriate.7

## Bacterial metabolism of polyphenols results in the excretion of ben-

<!-- chunk -->

## zoic acid and hippuric acid. Urinary benzoic acid can also originate

from foods containing the preservative sodium benzoate. Hippuric acid is formed when sodium benzoate is conjugated with glycine.32 Elevated levels of urinary hippuric acid have been associated with several conditions that may be linked to dysbiosis.33,34 For example, elevated urinary hippurate was associated with an increase in blood pressure, which is due to the direct effect of gut-microbial products on blood pressure. However in other studies low hippuric acid excretion has also been attributed to dysbiosis, which supports its use as a bio- marker for gut microbial alterations.35

<!-- chunk -->

## 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylpropionic acid (DHPPA) is a fermentation

by-product of dietary phenols that are produced by several bacteria (includ- ing some Clostridia spp.).36–40 DHPPA and other bacterial metabolites were previously thought to identify the presence of specific dysbiotic bacteria. However, as with IAA, ongoing research has shown that there are more bacteria capable of synthesizing these metabolites than previously thought.

<!-- chunk -->

## Similarly, 3-(3’-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropionic acid (HPHPA)

has been associated with Clostridia spp. and autism in a few small stud- ies.41 However, elevated urinary levels of this metabolite have also been found after the consumption of tea, grapes, and citrus foods (partic- ularly orange juice).42–45 In the absence of high dietary intake of phe- nol-rich foods, production of HPHPA may be due to alterations in gut bacteria and always warrant follow-up stool testing to confirm a clinical suspicion of dysbiosis or infection.

<!-- chunk -->

## Urinary excretion of D-lactate has been used as a marker for carbo-

hydrate malabsorption and small bowel dysbiosis.46 There was initial debate around the origin of this metabolite. Early research suggested it was solely produced from gut bacteria (particularly Lactobacillus spp.).47 The most prevalent GI condition associated with D-lactic acidosis is short bowel syndrome.48,49 However, research now shows that D-lactate can also originate from human metabolism.50 Elevated urinary excretion has been found in multiple disease conditions, including diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), infection, and trauma, and may be relevant in chronic fatigue syndrome.50 Therefore D-lactate may be a better indicator of metabolic disturbance from chronic disease progression than gut dysbiosis.

Candidiasis is a controversial topic among integrative, functional, and natural medicine practitioners. Despite being a frequently used term, the diagnosis of “Candida overgrowth” or “systemic Candida” is still a topic of debate, except in invasive candidiasis, a fungal sepsis. That being said, gastrointestinal yeast is a relatively common finding that ultimately may or may not reflect dysbiosis and/or infection.

Candida spp., and high urinary levels have been found in individuals with systemic invasive candidiasis.51,52 However, it is not known if uri- nary D-arabinitol levels correlate to GI Candida spp.

<!-- chunk -->

## Conversely, arabinose is not made by Candida but, rather, is a

pentose sugar that can be fermented by Candida into D-arabinitol.

<!-- chunk -->

## Arabinose, citramalic acid, and tartaric acid were reported to be ele-

vated in one case study of children with autistic features.53 However, there is no research, to date, correlating these markers to clinical can- didiasis. Because these organic acids are likely dietary in origin (partic- ularly fruit),54–58 abnormal markers warrant follow-up stool testing to confirm a suspicion of gastrointestinal candidiasis.59 As these markers may come from fruit intake, and given that many clinicians anecdot- ally monitor fruit intake when suspecting GI candidiasis, the former organic acids can aid in the management of GI yeast; however, this hypothesis has not been fully evaluated in the literature. Looking ahead, the field of metabolomic profiling has been ana- lyzing organic acid patterns in multiple disease populations. As more becomes known, it may eventually lead to an expanded application of bacterial metabolite profiling. If we know which organic acids are of bacterial origin and what “organic acid footprint” is associated with a disease, we can then begin to unravel the role that our gut flora plays in the development or prevention of that specific disease.60 At this time we work with non-specific indicators of the “bacterial organic acid footprint” to demonstrate the presence or absence of dysbiosis.

## Organic Acids of Mitochondrial Dysfunction

Clinicians use these organic acids as indicators of mitochondrial func- tion, and abnormalities can provide therapeutic opportunities to sup- port cellular and metabolic energy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fatty Acid Oxidation (Adipic Acid, Suberic Acid, and

<!-- chunk -->

## Ethylmalonic Acid)

In the mitochondria, fatty acids are converted into fuel sources through a process called beta-oxidation. Beta-oxidation is a critical step in meeting cellular energy demands. The first step in beta-oxidation is the conversion of fatty acids into acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which is the fuel used by the citric acid cycle to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Fatty acid conversion is dependent on carnitine because these fatty acids must be transported across the mitochondrial membrane via the “carnitine shuttle.”80 When beta-oxidation is impaired, fats are increasingly metabolized by an alternate pathway (omega-oxidation), resulting in elevated levels

<!-- chunk -->

## of specific dicarboxylic acids, such as adipic, suberic, and ethylma-

<!-- chunk -->

## lonic acids.81,82 Impaired beta-oxidation can occur due to carnitine

deficiency or dysfunction of the enzymes involved and may lead to an accumulation of these dicarboxylic acids.83,84 These dicarboxylic acids are then excreted in the urine. Elevated adipic, suberic, or ethylmalonic acid excretion is also characteristic of ketosis, such as in insulin resis- tance/diabetes, fasting, or low carbohydrate intake.84 Beyond metabolic ketosis, free fatty acid accumulation is a significant independent clinical finding because these acids lead to mitochondrial dysfunction by injuring the cell membrane and increasing free-radical production.80,85 Therefore monitoring these acids provides insight into mitochondrial impairment. Adipic acid excretion has been found to be elevated in chronic alcohol use in males, suggesting another source of mitochondrial dysfunction.86 However, clinicians should be aware that a high intake of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT oil, coconut, etc.) could also lead to isolated elevations of fatty acid metabolites.87 The “carnitine shuttle” is critically important to beta-oxidation. Therefore carnitine supplementation may help attenuate mitochon- drial dysfunction and improve ATP synthesis.80,88 Vitamin B 2 and magnesium availability also play an important role in optimal beta-ox- idation, making them viable intervention options for elevated urinary fatty acids (such as in glutaric aciduria).89–91 Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated as a characteristic in innumerable chronic diseases. Therefore organic acid profiling can be a method to uncover subclinical disruptions of beta-oxidation and is a valuable tool for investigating mitochondrial dysfunction in the clinical setting.92 Nutritional intervention, including, but not limited to, B vitamins, antioxidants, and carnitine, may be helpful when labo- ratory signs of mitochondrial dysfunction are found.93

## Glycolysis (Pyruvic Acid and Lactic Acid)

Carbohydrates are another source of the cellular fuel acetyl-CoA. Carbohydrates typically contain glucose as a component, which is con-

<!-- chunk -->

## verted into pyruvic acid by a large enzyme called the pyruvate dehy-

drogenase complex (PDC). PDC requires multiple cofactors derived from vitamins B 1 , B 2 , B 3 , and B 5 . Thiamine (vitamin B 1 ) appears to be particularly important to the PDC enzyme.94 In cases of an increased rate of glycolysis, vitamin B 1 supplementation was able to decrease lac- tic acid and pyruvic acid.95 Pyruvic acid is also metabolized by another enzyme named pyruvate carboxylase, which requires biotin as a cofac- tor. When elevated pyruvic acid is paired with elevated 3-hydroxyiso- valeric acid (discussed later), clinicians may evaluate biotin needs. Conversely, elevated lactic acid and pyruvic acid in the urine can be caused by several inborn errors, such as pyruvate carboxylase

<!-- chunk -->

## deficiency.96,97 Elevated urinary lactic acid may also originate from

impaired glycemic control, such as is seen in insulin resistance and alcohol dependence.98–100 Furthermore, lactic acid increases during hypoxic states and has been found to be elevated in sleep apnea.101 Lastly, lactic acid is produced during strenuous exercise and has been used as a biomarker for exercise exertion.102

## Citric Acid Cycle Metabolites

The citric acid cycle, or tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), is a group of biochemical interactions that occur in every living cell’s mitochondria. This cycle of reactions provides the necessary molecules for oxidative phos- phorylation and is the biggest source for producing ATP, the main cellular energy source (Fig. 29.1).103,104 Each step of the citric acid cycle is depen- dent on nutrient cofactors to assist in catalyzing each chemical reaction.

## β-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) is a ketone body. Ketones are gen-

erated in the liver when glucose metabolism is unable to meet energy demands. Heightened ketone production (ketosis) occurs during states such as prolonged fasting, exercise, and metabolic disease.105 Elevations of β -hydroxybutyric acid can be used as an early risk indica- tor for diabetes, predicting impaired glucose tolerance and worsening glycemic control.106–108 Low carbohydrate intake and ketogenic diets are likely to contribute to BHBA levels.

## β-hydroxymethylglutaric acid (HMG) is another keto acid made

from the molecule HMG-CoA and is a precursor to cholesterol and coenzyme Q 10 synthesis. Inhibition of HMG-CoA (through statin therapy) may lead to higher circulating levels of HMG, showing up as elevated urinary HMG. Several inborn errors are known to produce 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria, with varying degrees of onset and clinical manifestations, ranging from neurodevelopmental disor- ders to cardiomyopathy.109

up the backbone of the TCA cycle. The predominance of literature surrounding abnormal citric acid cycle organic acid excretion is in the field of inborn errors of metabolism. However, advancing metab- olomics research has begun to investigate metabolic “footprints” of various chronic diseases.110–113 For example, altered urinary cit- ric acid excretion has been demonstrated in metabolomics studies of diabetes/metabolic disease,114–116 major depressive disorder,28 hypertension,117 fibromyalgia,118 cancer,119,120 and immune-me- diated inflammatory disease (e.g., IBD).121 Excretion of citric acid intermediates may also be abnormal in autism.5,122,123 Furthermore, alterations in TCA cycle mechanics, leading to abnormal excretion of intermediates, has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunc- tion,124,125 linking them to conditions such as neurocognitive disease, diabetes, cancer, mood disorders, cardiovascular disease, and chronic fatigue syndrome.92

## 241CHAPTER 29 Organic Acid Profiling

Many nutrient cofactors, particularly B vitamins and essential minerals, have demonstrated the capacity to protect mitochondrial function and are critical to the citric acid cycle.94,126 Abnormal TCA cycle intermediates may reflect dysfunction of the TCA enzymes due to nutritional status, vitamin deficiency, toxicity, genetic polymor- phism, or disease condition.5,6,127–134 Abnormal urinary excretion of these acids may provide a window into various clinical conditions, as well as a potential therapeutic target to correct mitochondrial dysfunction.103 Genomics research may lead us to a greater understanding of how genetic individuality plays a role in the subclinical disruption of cit- ric acid cycle mechanics. This information generates a novel utility for interpreting organic acids in the urine.127 For example, homozygous enzyme defects of the citric acid cycle have been extensively studied. Recent studies suggest heterozygous defects may be tumorigenic.131 If nutritional supplementation can attenuate these enzymatic weak- nesses, whether they are genetic or acquired, clinical analysis of these metabolites may have vast clinical applications.132 Attenuating subtle metabolic disruptions with adequate vitamin cofactor supplementation may significantly aid in chronic disease prevention or management.

## Organic Acids of Neurotransmitter Metabolism

Neurotransmitter metabolites are an important group of organic acids. These compounds are breakdown products of neurotransmit- ter metabolism and can offer insight into neurotransmitter synthesis and degradation. Altered neurotransmitter metabolism can be due to enzyme impairment from chronic disease states, stress, genetic suscep- tibility, environmental toxins, and/or nutritional deficiencies.

## Vanilmandelic acid (VMA) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylgly-

<!-- chunk -->

## col (MHPG) originate from the breakdown of catecholamines, such

as epinephrine and norepinephrine (Fig. 29.2). Catecholamines are integrally related to the stress response, both in the brain and periph- erally. Therefore catecholamine metabolites have been used to assess sympathetic activity.133 Much of the research on these markers has been focused on detecting neuroendocrine tumors and paraganglio- mas (particularly with VMA).134–136 Elevated urinary VMA correlates to other physiological stress conditions, such as during competition, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and daily psycho-emotional stress.137–140 Low levels of catecholamine metabolites, particularly MHPG, have been found in mood and behavioral disorders.141,142 Researchers have used this organic acid as an index for depression.143 It is also inter- esting to note that because catecholamines are increased in response to exercise, MHPG has been explored as a method to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise as a therapeutic intervention in patients with affective disorders.143,144 Lower urinary MHPG has also been found in patients with atten- tion deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).145,146 Disruption of cat- echolamine neurotransmission is a central hypothesis in ADHD, in both animal and human models.147 Atomoxetine (a selective norepi- nephrine reuptake inhibitor) has efficacy in ADHD and may block norepinephrine in the central nervous system (CNS), allowing its breakdown and excretion.148 Therefore urinary MHPG may be use- ful as a biomarker for serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) therapy.148,149

<!-- chunk -->

## Homovanillic acid (HVA) originates from dopamine. Similar to

vanilmandelic acid, urinary HVA is elevated in neural crest tumors, such as neuroblastoma.135,150 Dopamine is involved in learning and behavior modulation, and elevated urinary HVA has also been used as a dopamine turnover biomarker, seen in autism and other neuro- behavioral disorders.151 Dopamine also plays a role in the circadian rhythm, and elevated HVA correlates to dopamine-induced tired- ness. For example, patients with obstructive sleep apnea present with varying degrees of sleepiness, and patients with apnea presenting with sleepiness and fatigue have much higher dopamine metabolite levels compared with patients with apnea with less sleepiness.152 Conversely, low HVA levels may reflect low dopamine turnover in mood disor- ders, whereby medications that increase HVA correlate to therapeutic responsiveness.153

## 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) is a metabolic by-product of

serotonin.154 Urinary 5-HIAA has been used as a predictive and prog- nostic biomarker for neuroendocrine tumors.155–158 However, because it is a breakdown product of serotonin, patients taking over-the- counter 5-HTP, those taking psychiatric medications, or those who consume tryptophan-rich foods may anecdotally have high 5-HIAA levels in their urine.158–160 Aside from these factors, elevated 5-HIAA has been used as a marker of excess serotonin turnover in the periphery, which is associ- ated with several clinical conditions. For example, higher levels have been associated with serotonin-induced infertility in men.161 Similar risk associations have been found in chronic migraine, inflamma- tion, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease.162–164 Low urinary 5-HIAA levels has been found in some patient populations. One hypothesis of this association is that the need for niacin (vita- min B 3 ) shunts tryptophan away from serotonin production and into the kynurenine pathway which leads to NAD synthesis. Clinically, one may consider additional niacin support to correct this metabolic disturbance.165 OHOH OH OHOH OH OH VanilmandelateHomovanillate OH SAMe OH Vit.C BH 4 B o C u 2 2 COOH 2 2 CHCH 2 2 2 2 2 2 COOH TyrosineDihydroxyphenylalanineDopamineNorepinephrineEpinephrine CH 3

## 242SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

The overwhelming majority of circulating serotonin is produced in the GI tract, not the central nervous system.166 Therefore urinary 5-HIAA is primarily a reflection of gut-derived serotonin.167,168 In the GI tract, alterations of serotonin metabolism have been associated with IBS. Higher urinary 5-HIAA was found in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),169 whereas lower levels have been found in diarrhea-predominant IBS.170 In a recent IBS study, 5-HTP supplementation led to increased turnover to 5-HIAA compared with controls (suggesting dysfunctional serotonin metabolism); however, supplementation ultimately improved intestinal barrier function.171

## Tryptophan metabolism produces urinary kynurenic acid and

<!-- chunk -->

## quinolinic acid. Tryptophan is the amino acid precursor of serotonin.

However, tryptophan is primarily metabolized in a different pathway, known as the kynurenine pathway. This alternate pathway is upregu- lated in response to inflammation and stress, which may cause deficient serotonin production.172 Therefore urinary kynurenic acid and quino- linic acid are relevant in mood disorders and chronic inflammation.173 Kynurenic acid can become further metabolized into quinolinic acid, which is an inflammatory and neurotoxic metabolite associated with depression.174 Some laboratories calculate the ratio of kynurenic acid to quinolinic acid, whereby a low kyurenic:quinolinic ratio is sugges- tive of disturbed kynurenine metabolism leading to excessive quino- linic acid production (seen in mood disorders).175 These metabolites also play a role in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes, which are common findings in depressed patients.173 The kynurenine pathway is particularly sensitive to vitamin B 6 defi- ciency, which has been shown to increase urinary kynurenic acid and xanthurenic acid (discussed in the next section).176,177 Altered trypto- phan metabolism and vitamin B 6 deficiency are suspected complica- tions of the use of the oral contraceptive pill (OCP).177,178 Vitamin B 6 supplementation has also been used to attenuate these alterations (at least partly); however, OCP use may disrupt tryptophan metabolism through other unknown mechanisms. Also, as previously mentioned, a major end-product of the kynurenine pathway is NAD, usually supplied by vitamin B 3 . Therefore, clinicians may look at elevated kynurenine metabolites as an indication for needs for vitamin B 3 .165

## Organic Acids Related to Vitamin-Dependent Pathways

Some organic acids are used as specific markers to assess functional levels of vitamin cofactors. By examining pathways that are strongly influenced by nutrient availability, clinicians can home in on potential nutrient insufficiencies that can be targeted therapeutically.

## Branch-Chain Amino Acid Intermediates (

## α

<!-- chunk -->

## -Keto Acids)

In the body, amino acids can be broken down to provide metabo- lites used in energy production. To do so, branch-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) must be transported into the mito- chondria via the carnitine shuttle. They are then converted into α -keto

<!-- chunk -->

## acids: α-ketoisovaleric, α-ketoisocaproic, and α-keto-β-methyl-

<!-- chunk -->

## valeric acids.

After entering the mitochondria, α -keto acids are further metab- olized by an enzyme complex known as the branch-chain α -keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC). BCKDC is the same enzyme responsible for the inborn metabolism error maple syrup urine dis- ease. This enzyme complex requires multiple cofactors derived from vitamins B 1 , B 2 , B 3 , and B 5 and lipoic acid. Because the breakdown of α -keto acids is dependent on BCKDC, deficiencies in the enzyme’s cofactors may lead to increased α -keto acids in the systemic circulation and the urine (Fig. 29.3).179 Optimally functioning branch-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabo- lism is important in a variety of clinical conditions. As a group, BCAAs participate in protein synthesis, stimulate insulin release, spare lean muscle during weight loss or aging, and promote wound healing.180 Elevated plasma BCAAs are associated with insulin resistance, which may be a result of decreased BCAA catabolism for energy produc- tion.181 This metabolic disturbance could be compounded if nutrient deficiencies (such as vitamins B 1 , B 2 , B 3 , and B 5 ) limit the activity of BCKDC.179 Therapeutically, B-vitamin support may be indicated with elevated urinary α -keto acids levels. In one study, supplementation demon- strated the ability to reduce α -keto acid excretion in healthy individu- als, suggesting that elevated urinary α -keto acids is an indicator of the need for B vitamins.182 Also, high BCAA turnover (such as in strenuous exercise, catabolic states, or BCAA supplementation) may contribute to the excretion of α -keto acids. The ability of B vitamins to attenuate these clinical states has not been fully researched.

## Folate and B

<!-- chunk -->

## Markers: Formiminoglutamic Acid and

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylmalonic Acid

<!-- chunk -->

## Formiminoglutamic acid (FIGlu) is the intermediate metabolite in

the pathway that converts histidine to glutamic acid.183 FIGlu metab- olism depends on tetrahydrofolate (BH 4 ), a folate derivative, and accumulates with inadequate available folate. FIGlu accumulation is seen most dramatically in the inborn error formiminoglutamic acid- uria. However, urinary FIGlu measurements have also been used as an indirect assessment of folate deficiency, dating back to the 1950s.184 Initially called the “FIGlu test,” patients with folate deficiency were shown to produce higher urinary FIGlu when given a large dose of L-histidine.184 In the literature, urinary FIGlu testing continues to be a marker for folate deficiency.185,186 Compared with known folate-deficient patients, one study demonstrated that FIGlu has a high degree of specificity for Valine Thiamin (B 1 ) Riboflavin (B 2 ) Niacin (B 3 ) Lipoate Pantothenate Adenosylcobalamin (B 12 ) Biotin α- Ketoisovalerate α- Ketoisocaproate α- Keto-β-Methylvalerate Leucine Isoleucine Methylmalonate Amino Acid Catabolism Transamination CO 2 + H 2 O Methylmalonyl-CoA dismutase BCKA Dehydrogenase β-Hydroxyisovalerate

detecting folate deficiency.187 Multiple clinical conditions are asso- ciated with high urinary FIGlu, such as alcohol consumption, preg- nancy, and birth control use.188,189 Whether this is due to true folate depletion or another unknown mechanism is still debated. Aside from folate evaluation, formiminoglutamic acid may reflect vitamin B 12 status because folate recycling requires B 12 as a cofac- tor. Vitamin B 12 replacement decreased FIGlu levels in one study.190 Both folate and vitamin B 12 are critically important to methylation, which may support the utility of urinary FIGlu as a marker for disor- dered methylation capacity, as is seen in alcoholism.191 Lending fur- ther clinical evidence, nitrous oxide (NO) is a known inhibitor of the enzyme that recycles folate (using B 12 ), and exposure to NO transiently increased urinary FIGlu, mimicking B 12 deficiency.192

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylmalonic acid (MMA) is an intermediate of methionine

conversion to succinic acid for energy use. This pathway is vitamin B 12 dependent, and MMA accumulation is indicative of the inborn error methylmalonic acidemia.193 This inborn error can arise from variants in multiple genes, and it can present itself at any time in life, with vary- ing degrees of severity.194 Also, subtle genetic variants (SNPs) that can predispose individuals to B 12 deficiency have been discovered.195 Because MMA conversion requires vitamin B 12 , elevated levels of MMA are indicative of B 12 deficiency.196–199 Methylmalonic acid, as a functional biomarker, is considered a more sensitive index of B 12 status compared with serum B 12 .200–204 Urinary MMA correlates with serum MMA, making the simple urine test a useful screening tool for B 12 defi- ciency in at-risk populations, such as the elderly or patients with GI dysfunction.196,202 Vitamin B 12 therapy lowers MMA, and monitoring this metabolite may help prevent the consequences of B 12 deficiency, such as cognitive decline and neuropathy.204–206

## Other B-Vitamin Markers: Xanthurenic Acid,

<!-- chunk -->

## 3-Hydroxypropionic Acid, 3-Hydroxyisovaleric Acid, Glutaric

<!-- chunk -->

## Acid, Isovalerylglycine

<!-- chunk -->

## Xanthurenic acid is a product of the tryptophan-kynurenine path-

way discussed previously. Disturbances in this pathway have been evaluated in a variety of clinical conditions, including immune sup- pression, cancer progression, and immune/inflammatory reactions (such as in IBD).207 The entire pathway is heavily dependent on vita- min B 6 availability; therefore xanthurenic acid has been studied as a biomarker for B 6 status.208–210 Functional B 6 deficiency can be a consequence of dysglycemia, caused by inflammatory upregulation of the kynurenine pathway, ultimately leading to elevated levels of xanthurenic acid.211 Also previously mentioned, kynurenine metab- olites may become elevated when there are needs for vitamin B 3 , which may lead clinicians to consider vitamin B 3 supplementation to address tryptophan-kynurenine abnormalities.165 Biotin, also referred to as vitamin B 7 , is an essential vitamin cofac- tor in several enzymatic pathways. Certain clinical circumstances, such as pregnancy, vegetarianism, and anticonvulsant therapy, have been demonstrated to induce marginal biotin deficiency.212,213 The

marker that has been studied; however, it does not appear to have the same diagnostic sensitivity.217

<!-- chunk -->

## Glutaric acid and isovalerylglycine are two acids that are extremely

elevated in inborn errors of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. There are mul- tiple forms of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies, and most of them are diagnosed in neonates.218 However, milder forms of this rare mitochondrial disorder exist, can have adult-onset presentation, and are responsive to riboflavin (vitamin B 2 ) and carnitine therapy.218,219 Another interesting study demonstrated that elevated urinary levels of isovalerylglycine were found in anorexia nervosa patients. This is believed to be due to the effect of poor thyroid conversion of vita- min B 2 into active FAD, which is normalized in some patients after a refeeding program. Therefore vitamin B 2 need may be demonstrated by this urinary marker. Other causes of mitochondrial dysfunction may have a similar effect on beta-oxidation causing abnormalities of these markers.

## Organic Acids From Toxic Exposures and Detoxification

<!-- chunk -->

## Pathways

Some organic acids relate to toxic exposure and detoxification capac- ity. These discrete biomarkers have increasing clinical utility in today’s world (see Chapter 30, Urinary Porphyrins, and Chapter 35, Environmental Medicine). The following subsections provide a few examples of markers that help identify current exposures and the potential need for detoxification support.

<!-- chunk -->

## Toxic Exposure Metabolites:

## α

## -Ketophenylacetic Acid,

<!-- chunk -->

## α

<!-- chunk -->

## -Hydroxyisobutyric Acid, 2-Methylhippurate

α

<!-- chunk -->

## -Ketophenylacetic acid (more commonly known as phenylglyoxylic

acid) is a breakdown product of the petrochemical styrene. Styrene is a plastic ingredient found in numerous products, including insula- tion, fiberglass, carpet backing, pipes, and car and boat parts.220 The most common source of styrene exposure is plastic food containers. Phenylglyoxylic acid (PGA) accounts for the majority of styrene detox- ification in the body and serves as an exposure biomarker.221 PGA can also originate from benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene expo- sure.222–224 Therefore high levels of urinary PGA warrant an inves- tigation of any petrochemical contact because these chemicals are suspected to cause DNA damage.221,224

<!-- chunk -->

## α-Hydroxyisobutyric acid is the major urinary metabolite of an

industrial solvent called methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). MTBE was used as an additive to gasoline until the mid-2000s, when it was gradu- ally phased out. However, considerable underground leakage has led to widespread groundwater and soil contamination.225 Concerns about the tumorigenicity of chronic exposure to MTBE has been debated in the literature for a long time and played a significant role in remov- ing MTBE from gasoline. However, it is still used in other industrial settings. Interestingly, MTBE is a powerful solvent, and injection of MTBE into the gallbladder has been a successful intervention to dis- solve gallstones.226,227

<!-- chunk -->

## Another organic acid commonly found in the urine is 2-meth-

<!-- chunk -->

## ylhippurate, which is a xylene-breakdown metabolite. Humans are

exposed to xylene most commonly through volatile organic com- pounds (VOCs) from paints and varnish.228 2-methylhippuratue has also been found to be elevated in individuals exposed to pesticides.229

<!-- chunk -->

## Detoxification Pathway Markers: Glucaric Acid,

<!-- chunk -->

## P-Hydroxyphenyllactic Acid, Orotic Acid, Pyroglutamic Acid,

<!-- chunk -->

## α

<!-- chunk -->

## -Hydroxybutyric Acid

<!-- chunk -->

## Glucaric acid (or glucarate) is frequently used as an indirect marker for

Phase I detoxification.230–232 Many environmental chemicals, includ- ing pesticides and xenobiotics, are detoxified through Phase I enzymes. Therefore urinary glucaric acid is a valuable biomarker for exposure, as well as exposure-induced upregulation of detoxification enzymes.233,234 Glucaric salts (such as calcium-D-glucarate), along with antioxi- dant-rich foods, are often used therapeutically to support detoxification. Therefore it is important to know that these therapies provide sources of glucaric acid that could influence urinary results.235,236

<!-- chunk -->

## Traditionally, urine screening for elevated orotic acid was used to

identify the inborn error orotic aciduria and as a means of evaluat- ing other hyperammonemias.237 Orotic acid has also been interpreted,

<!-- chunk -->

## 244SECTION 2 Primary and Adjunctive Diagnostic Procedures

anecdotally, as a reflection of arginine status and urea cycle dysfunc- tion; however, routine use of this biomarker to assess subclinical nutrient deficiency or hepatotoxicity is not well established in the liter- ature.238,239 Also, urinary orotic acid may arise from inhibition of other biochemical pathways. For example, the pyrimidine pathway used in nucleotide synthesis is inhibited by drug therapies such as allopuri- nol. This inhibition results in elevated urinary orotic acid.240 Similar

<!-- chunk -->

## to orotic acid, urinary sulfate has also been used by clinicians to assess

detoxification capacity. However, urinary sulfate has been shown to be heavily influenced by dietary habits, and therefore it is a relatively nonspecific biomarker.241

<!-- chunk -->

## Pyroglutamic acid (also known as 5-oxoproline) is a metabolite

of the gamma-glutamyl cycle. The gamma-glutamyl cycle is important because it assists in glutathione production and recycling (Fig. 29.4).242 Glutathione is a powerful antioxidant, primarily responsible for cellu- lar detoxification and redox balance.242 Glutathione is a tripeptide, consisting of three amino acids: gluta- mate, cysteine, and glycine. Glutathione synthesis requires sufficient availability of these amino acids, and deficiency of any of the three amino acids can affect glutathione production.242 Elevated pyroglu- tamic acid may reflect nutritional needs for the amino acid glutathi- one precursors, particular glycine.243,244 In individuals consuming low-protein/vegetarian diets, elevated pyroglutamic acid levels were significantly reduced when protein was supplemented.245 To lend fur- ther support to pyroglutamic acid as a marker for glycine need, glycine supplementation has demonstrated the capacity to return high pyro- glutamic acid excretion to normal and increase glutathione levels.246 Whereas the gamma-glutamyl cycle is responsible for recycling glu- tathione, it is the transsulfuration pathway that produces glutathione.

<!-- chunk -->

## The biomarker α-hydroxybutyrate (2-hydroxybuturic acid [2-HB]) is

hypothesized to be a marker for upregulation of the transsulfuration pathway.238 However, the majority of the literature demonstrates that 2-HB has a stronger correlation with dysglycemia. Some articles have suggested that it is one of the most significant biomarkers available for early determination of insulin resistance and metabolic disturbance.247,248 Metabolic stress creates an imbalance in NADH/NAD ratios, which leads directly to the production of 2-HB.249,250 2-HB levels may be affected by smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, and dietary habits. Thus 2-HB could prove to be a biomarker for unhealthy lifestyle habits.251


Organic acid analysis is a powerful clinical tool. Originating as a way to diagnose inborn errors of metabolism, it now has been adopted into the evolving field of metabolomics, genomics, and personalized med- icine. Clinicians aiming to target individual metabolic weaknesses use organic acid analysis as a backbone assessment. Numerous examples have been discussed in the medical profession of the dramatic positive clinical outcomes that have resulted from targeted treatments based on organic acid abnormalities. Looking to the future, many more organic acids will likely be evalu- ated and added to current organic acid profiles. Organic acid profiling will continue to expand our understanding of the multitude of fac- tors that precipitate individual susceptibility to chronic diseases and, therefore, guide the therapies that can help prevent them. Organic acid analysis provides insight into genetic metabolic weaknesses, environmental insults, and diet and lifestyle factors that limit opti- mal biochemical function. These abnormalities are likely at the root of innumerable chronic diseases, and correcting these abnormalities could have profound application in overall disease regression or pre- vention. Tomorrow’s medicine will be an integration of Dr. Garrod’s genetic individuality concept with functional profiling of biochemical pathways, ultimately making organic acid profiling critically important to clinicians focused on personalized medical care.

## 247CHAPTER 33 Urinary Porphyrins for the Detection of Heavy Metal

porphyrin analysis may be considered as part of monitoring lead expo- sure in combination with blood lead levels.10,11 More recently, the use of urinary porphyrin profiles has been researched with respect to mercury exposure and toxicity. The bulk of this scientific exploration is attributed to Dr. James Wood’s work at the Department of Environmental Health at the University of Washington.12–19 In multiple animal and human studies, a pattern of porphyrin excretion was detected as a result of mercury exposure (Table 30.2). A statistically significant increase was seen in the excretion of three discrete porphyrins: copropor- phyrin, pentacarboxylporphyrin, and an atypical porphyrin they referred to as precoproporphyrin.12,13,15,19,20 This atypical porphyrin would later be renamed keto-isocoproporphyrin.21,22 This pattern correlated with the dose and timing of mercury exposure. These three porphyrins were also elevated in dentists routinely exposed to mercury vapors, specifically in dentists with higher urinary mercury excretion.19 Interestingly, in another study involving dentists, these three porphyrins were also significantly decreased after chelation therapy.13 One study of dentists found that por- phyrin excretion was better correlated with clinical symptoms associated with mercury toxicity than urine mercury levels.23 Ultimately, a few pub- lished articles claimed that this porphyrin pattern was a useful biomarker for assessing the total body burden of mercury.24–26 Additionally, these researchers suggested that porphyrin profiling may be more reliable than urine mercury testing for detecting subclinical mercury exposure correlat- ing with the toxic neurological effects.20,24 Altered urinary porphyrin excretion has been documented in other environmental toxic exposures, such as arsenic,27–31 cadmium, organic chemicals,6 and alcohol,32 and in combinations of multiple toxic expo- sures.33 Many other toxicants may play a role in porphyrinuria and need further investigation. Although urinary porphyrin excretion appears to consistently correlate with toxic metal exposure, the degree to which an individual’s detoxification capacity plays a role in suscep- tibility to toxins is still under investigation.17,34 It may ultimately be determined that both increased environmental exposure and reduced detoxification contribute to the degree of heme-pathway disruption.

# CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF PORPHYRINURIA

Porphyrin profiles have been used clinically in assessing certain patient populations. The most recent intrigue regarding porphyrin assessment is in autism. Investigation into risk factors that might contribute to the rise in autism over recent years led to concern about the role mercury expo- sure plays in autism pathogenesis.35–38 As more research began to impli- cate mercury exposure as a plausible factor in the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), porphyrin testing was used as a noninvasive and independent method for assessing exposure.39 Indeed, several stud- ies of autism patients showed significant porphyrin excretion compared with controls, often corresponding to the porphyrin patterns character- istic of mercury exposure.40 These results were replicated across multiple continents.41,42 Clinically, porphyrin profiles are still used in this patient population to assess toxic metal body burden. However, reduced detox- ification capacity and increased oxidative stress have also been suspected in autism.43–45 Therefore the multifactorial nature of childhood neuro- behavioral disorders should be strongly emphasized.46 Reduction in por- phyrin excretion after chelation therapy, along with emerging evidence surrounding mercury, ASD, and heme disturbances, makes porphyrin profiling an important clinical tool.14,29,47 Aside from managing autism and toxic exposures, the association between oxidative stress and porphyrin excretion is clinically significant. Knowing the amount of oxidative stressors the average patient encoun- ters daily, clinicians must consider the role these exposures play in other chronic health complaints. With the growing understanding of genetic individuality and variation, porphyrin excretion may provide a window into genetic susceptibility to oxidative stress.17 Further studies are needed to evaluate these roles in various patient populations, such as neurological disorders,48 malignancy,49 and mood disorders, to name a few.


Urine porphyrin profiling can be a noninvasive and valuable tool for chronic disease assessment and management. There is compelling evi- dence that environmental exposure, whether severe or nascent, has the potential to be a major contributing factor in the pathogenesis of chronic illness. Specific toxicants may also demonstrate unique patterns of por- phyrin excretion because eof specific heme-synthesis enzyme abnormal- ities. Often, the difficulty in clinically assessing toxicity is the degree to which these toxins are stored in tissues rather than in the circulation, making it difficult to assess the total body burden. Because heme synthe- sis takes place in specific tissues (predominantly bone, kidney, and the liver), tissue toxins may affect heme synthesis, leading to porphyrinuria. It should be noted that many common medications can affect the heme pathway. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the triggers leading to altered urine porphyrin levels. Therefore clinical correlation and dis- cretion are important when interpreting any given test result. Finally, care and expertise should be applied in the management of environmental exposure and toxicity. The primary approach is the identification and removal of ongoing exposures. In addition to the physical examination, a thorough exposure history, combined with a well-designed environmental questionnaire, can help identify toxic triggers. Second, intake of antioxidant-rich nutrients and vitamins helps increase detoxification and elimination. Last, ensuring optimal detoxification via gastrointestinal elimination, appropriate skin care, and sweat depuration therapy goes a long way toward toxin removal.

ALA, δ-aminolevulinic acid. Note: Certain environmental exposures have demonstrated particular patterns of porphyrin excretion. However, when interpreting urinary porphyrin testing, due diligence should be applied to rule out any inherited porphyria if suspected. Toxic metal analysis can aid in the diagnosis of metal toxicity. aThese patterns have been demonstrated in the literature and in clinical practice; however, it should be stated that these are general guidelines. Positive findings warrant further investigation into toxic exposure. Also, other factors (e.g., medications, liver disease, malignancy, and other chronic conditions) can contribute to altered porphyrin excretion. bPorphyrin excretion patterns have been studied in a limited number of organic chemical exposures. A comprehensive workup is recom- mended when assessing any form of environmental toxic exposure.

## 249CHAPTER 31 Urine Indican Test (Obermeyer Test)

• Urine color: 0 (negative or normal) • Light blue or light green: +1 • Blue, green, or golden brown: +2 • Violet, indigo, or dark brown: +3 • Jet black: +4


A positive result can be associated with the disorders listed in Table 31.1, hypochlorhydria, pancreatic insufficiency, SIBO, an excessively high pro- tein intake. The latter indication can be controlled by the institution of a diet with moderate protein (less than 60 g daily) for 2 days before testing.


The Obermeyer test is an in-office diagnostic test that can be used to identify gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction or dysbiosis. A positive test may indicate the need for additional testing for gastrointestinal patho- gens, SIBO, or altered GI function. The Obermeyer test for urine indi- can can be a clinically useful tool for identifying underlying causes of GI-related disorders and for optimizing GI health.

# Therapeutic Modalities and

# Practice Specialties

This section presents a historical, scientific, and clinical review of the schools of thought and modalities of natural medicine by its various names. We have compiled the work of experts in their fields into what we hope the reader will find a concise, yet useful, description of these practices, modalities, and specialties. Because of the clinically oriented and unconventional nature of these disciplines, the scientific evaluation of their theories and efficacy has been limited in the past. Happily, published research in natural medicine has increased dramatically since A Textbook of Natural Medicine was first published in 1985. Although this textbook is strongly oriented to the scientific method and the use of the peer-reviewed research for docu- mentation of the efficacy of a therapy, the widespread clinical use and long history of patient satisfaction demand that they be given far more clinical attention. Although the mechanisms of action of several have yet to be elicited, their research foundation continues to strengthen.

## 252SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

• National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA; founded in 1985): a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) training and advocacy organization that encourages community wellness through the use of a standardized 5-point ear acupuncture protocol initially developed to assist in substance abuse with- drawal11 • American Society of Acupuncturists (ASA; founded in 2017): an umbrella organization that grew out of the informal Council of State [Acupuncture] Associations. This 501(c)(6) not-for-profit organization has 24 state associations with a total current mem- bership of 4000. It seeks to provide resources for the promotion of professional acupuncture practitioners in their respective state practice situations.12 As a result of the ongoing work of these organizations, the follow- ing milestones had been achieved as of 20183,5,11: • Licensure: 47 states plus Washington, DC • Licensed acupuncturists: estimated 25,000 to 30,000 • CCAOM schools and branches: • NCCAOM diplomates since 1982: 22,000 • NADA-trained providers in 23 states There are several types of providers who receive training in acu- puncture,3–9,11,12 as noted in Box 32.1. On occasion, professionals such as medical doctors, naturopathic physicians, and chiropractors undergo extensive training in acupunc- ture, but it is more common to receive specific professional training composed of far fewer hours. For perspective and comparative purposes, Table 32.1 provides tra- ditional Chinese medicine (TCM) statistics from mainland China for the years 2007 and 2008. Acupuncture is considered a key component of the practice of “modern” TCM, along with herbal medicine, mas- sage, nutrition, qigong, and health promotion.13–19 The World Health Organization stated in 2001 that “Chinese med- icine, particularly acupuncture, is the most widely used traditional medicine. It is practiced in every region of the world.”20 Although this statement has not been revised as of 2018, there is every reason to believe that this remains true.

# TERMINOLOGY

When it comes to discussing acupuncture in the context of its inte- gration into Western health care systems, we should recognize that term acupuncture is ambiguous, and its meaning can differ based on its context of use. For clarification, the common different meanings of acupuncture are as follows: 1. Acupuncture is a physical medicine procedure involving the insertion of filiform needles into the body at specific points to effect therapeutic functional changes in nerve, connective tis- sue, muscular, and vascular structures and internal organ sys- tems. Procedures that elicit these therapeutic responses through point stimulation using heat (moxibustion), pressure, laser light frequencies, sound frequencies, and electrical currents in the milli- to microampere range are best termed “acupuncture- related techniques,” which can be more clearly described by adding clarifying terms, such as electroacupuncture, sonopunc- ture, acupressure, and so forth.21 2. Acupuncture is a multicomponent health care practice: The “practice of acupuncture” involves history taking, physical examination, diagnosis, patient education, and acupuncture procedure planning regarding point selection, stimulation intensity, and session frequency. In the practice of acupunc- ture, a practitioner typically incorporates other traditional or modern physical medicine interventions, such as heating of acupoints (traditional moxibustion), suction cupping, bleed- ing, soft tissue scraping, manual tissue and joint manipulation, electrostimulation, laser stimulation, and therapeutic exercise. The practice of acupuncture can be relevant to patient out- come goals, including goals in acute care, chronic illness care, and preventive or wellness care. The present-day theories and methods of the practice of acupuncture grew out of the health care traditions from China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam and the dissemination of this practice through the West since the 17th century. Recent acupuncture basic science research is illumi- nating the biomedical correlations to aspects of acupuncture methods and practice that were previously only understood via translations of the metaphors used in the ancient Chinese acu- puncture texts.22 3. The term acupuncture is used in many cases to refer to the dis- tinct entry-level health profession that specializes in the practice of acupuncture and related techniques according to a licensed or registered scope of practice delimited by U.S. state laws. The designation of these “professional acupuncturists” varies, with the most familiar terms being licensed acupuncturist (LAc), certi- fied acupuncturist (CA), East Asian medicine provider (EAMP), Oriental medical doctor (OMD), and doctor of acupuncture and oriental medicine (DAOM). Although the initial licensing authorities were concerned with the safety and competency of practitioners inserting needles into patients, most professional acupuncturists in the United States have been trained in East Asian traditional diagnostic and therapeutic models that are broader in scope than the traditional application of needle-based physical medicine treatments. This profession has worked to pro- gressively expanded the legal scope of practice to reflect the prac- tice of a comprehensive natural health care system. In the state of California, for example, acupuncture licensure was expanded to reflect this trend within the professional acupunc- turist community. “The theory and practice of acupuncture is based

on Asian medicine (also known as traditional, classical Chinese or Oriental medicine), a comprehensive natural health care system that has been in use in Asian countries for thousands of years to preserve health and diagnose, treat, and prevent illness.”23 The practice of the California licensed acupuncture profession, according to Business and Professions Code Section 4937(b) of California, now legally includes the following: “to perform or prescribe the use of oriental massage, acupressure, breathing techniques, exer- cise, or nutrition, including the incorporation of drugless substances and herbs as dietary supplements to promote health.”24 In this process of expanding the scope of practice beyond the phys- ical medicine practice of acupuncture, the profession in Washington State redefined itself in legislation as East Asian medical practitioners (EAMPs). This expansion of the scope of professional acupuncturists beyond the clinical practice of a physical medicine–based needling procedure into a broad-based “natural medicine” scope involving herbal treat- ments, manual therapies, and lifestyle practices is likely a result of two factors: first, the perceived need among the public for more personal- ized, “natural,” and gentler health services than those of typical bio- medicine; and second, the creation of TCM as an organized diagnostic and treatment practice style in the modern Peoples Republic and the resulting export of TCM as the principal type of diagnosis and treat- ment approach taught in U.S. acupuncture programs and colleges. The TCM style is most compatible with the use of herbal treatments for internal medicine problems and with the use of needling as an adjunct therapy. For clarity, there are many styles of acupuncture practice. In Japan, for example, traditional Japanese medicine includes the acu- puncture practitioners who use needles, moxa, and other tools to deal with the physical medicine aspects of health and illness and includes the 10,000+ regular medical doctors who use Kampo medicines (stan- dardized herbal formulae) to complement pharmaceutical drugs and diet and lifestyle intervention for the care of internal medicine health problems.25 In November 1997, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) con- vened a consensus development conference on the subject of acupunc- ture. After discussion among a board of experts, the following working definition was included in the NIH Consensus Statement: Acupuncture describes a family of procedures involving stimula- tion of anatomical locations on the skin by a variety of techniques. There are a variety of approaches to diagnosis and treatment in American acupuncture, which incorporates medical traditions from China, Japan, Korea, and other countries. The most studied mechanism of stimulation of acupuncture points employs penetra- tion of the skin by thin, solid, metallic needles, which are manipu- lated manually or by electrical stimulation.26 The NIH conference has had a lasting positive effect on the growth of acupuncture in the United States. The definitions and recommen- dations for further research have sparked wider acceptance within the medical profession and promoted the consensus that acupuncture as a procedure and as a mode of practice is ready to be incorporated into the education, research, and practice schemes of Western medicine. Because of the increasing basic and clinical research in acupuncture, the NIH con- ference documents kept the NIH definition of the practice of American acupuncture within definition levels 1 and 2 in the previous list. It did not include the diagnostic and therapeutic practices of TCM herbal internal medicine as part of the necessary model of “acupuncture practice.” We describe acupuncture and related physical medicine tech- niques as a standalone health care practice and also discuss the types of licensed providers who currently offer it within their scope of prac- tice, including the LAc providers of East Asian natural medicine, the medical and osteopathic physicians, the chiropractic and naturopathic physicians, the physical therapists, and the drug detox technicians. All of these providers have been contributing to the dissemination of acupuncture throughout the health care system and to its accessibil- ity to the general public. This chapter describes the various styles of acupuncture practice and the evidence-informed clinical applications of acupuncture so that readers will be better informed about effective clinical referrals based on patients’ needs and desires.


The clinical applications of acupuncture can be divided into three areas: biomechanical medicine, internal medicine, and mind–body medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Biomechanical medicine refers to approaches that improve or

restore the structure and functions of the muscles, nerves, connective tissue, ligaments, and bones that support pain-free movement and resilience to mechanical stress. Examples include low back pain, joint strains, radiculopathies, and sports injuries.

<!-- chunk -->

## Internal medicine refers to disorders of internal organ systems and

the neuroendocrine regulation of the body; examples are migraine headaches, diabetes, constipation, and infertility.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mind–body medicine refers to psychological and emotional dis-

orders ranging from stress reactions to anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction, and interpersonal and social adjustment disorders.

# THEORY AND PRACTICE STYLES

Acupuncture is the Western name for a technique involving stimula- tion of particular anatomically mapped locations or palpable tender zones of the body by heat applications, mechanical stimulation, or the insertion of fine needles. Classical approaches to the theory and orga- nization of this health care practice date back as many as 4000 to years. For contemporary practitioners, their practice styles of acupunc- ture are based on an understanding of several fundamental concepts, as discussed in the following subsections.

<!-- chunk -->

## Yin/Yang Balance

Yin/yang balance is the central theory in the practice of acupunc- ture. It refers to relative biophysiological balance and can be clinically observed in neurological signaling or in cellular and organ metabo- lism as activation versus inhibition, in tissues as inflammation versus inflammation control, in thermoregulation as heating versus cooling, in autonomic activity as sympathetic versus parasympathetic tone, and in vascular tone as vasodilation versus vasoconstriction.

<!-- chunk -->

## Qi, Blood, and Fluid

Qi, blood, and fluid can be clinically observed in the vascular system as oxygenated versus deoxygenated blood flow, as venous drainage versus venous congestion, in lymphatic flow as determined by tissue tension and by intravascular versus extravascular fluid exchange, and by phys- icochemical phase shifts in biological fluids between liquid, solid, and gel (traditionally translated as “phlegm”) states.

<!-- chunk -->

## Five Phases

The five phases (or five elements or five movements) are clinically observable patterns of genetically expressed physiological tendencies and body morphotypes, which resonate with personality strengths and weaknesses and with environmental and dietary preferences and susceptibilities. This approach can be clinically useful in determining which acu-stimulation targets could rebalance specific physiology or psychological factors that are promoting the yin/yang or qi, blood,

and fluid imbalances. This treatment approach varies from the TCM approach by being a more indirect or nonlinear approach to achieving healthier homeostasis. Five-element acupuncture is a refined form of constitutional acupuncture. Practitioners of this style will identify the deeper and lifelong biopsychosocial patterns underlying their patients’ ailments. They attempt an artful rebalancing of the interwoven pat- terns of dysfunction using the special channel acupoints that classically have inherent nourishing and controlling relationships among the five-phase physiology of that particular person.

## Zang Fu Organ Functional Metabolism Qualities

The Zang Fu are the Chinese “organs” and related physiological func- tions. There are five solid “Zang” yin organs (liver, heart, spleen/ pancreas, kidneys, and lungs) and five hollow “Fu” yang organs (gall- bladder, small intestines, stomach, large intestine, and urinary bladder). In addition, there are two “organs” that represent distributed physi- ological functions that the ancient Chinese associated with a related body anatomy. The San Jiao or “triple energizer” is a yang organ that roughly corresponds to the overall restorative and functional activities of all the organs in the upper, middle, and lower body cavities. In tra- ditional teaching, it is considered to be a Fu organ with the function of transporting water. In modern thinking, it seems to correspond to the physiological function of the mitochondria, whose activities provide the metabolic energy of the internal organs. The paired yin “organ” is the Xin-Bao, or “heart protector,” which has been poorly translated in English as “pericardium.” Depending solely on the Western name without a thorough under- standing of the traditional Chinese meaning leads to much confusion clinically. In clinical practice, the heart-protector function often corre- sponds to the regulation of sympathetic tone. In practice, the Chinese term for urinary bladder function seems to correspond to the embryo- logical and functional aspects associated with the entire cloacal region in comparative anatomy. The liver in the Chinese sense is much more a functional system with many body-wide interactions. Among other things, the Chinese Gan (liver) stores blood and qi and is responsible for the smooth transmission of qi and blood throughout the body. It also has a chief role in emotions; an unbalanced Gan (liver) results in anger, high blood pressure, and a general state of agitation. In the TCM diagnostic approach, the Zang Fu and yin/yang principles lead to poetic explanatory diagnoses. Clinical symptoms such as dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, dry throat, and lumbago could be ascribed to a deficiency of liver and kidney yin. Cold limbs, lumbago, diarrhea, and scanty urine could be ascribed to a deficiency of spleen and kidney yang.

## Six-Channel Acupuncture (Jing Luo)

Six-channel acupuncture (Jing Luo) is explained in the classical text Sang Han Lung. This approach facilitates interactions among organs, tissues, nerves, and blood vessels via electromechanical needle stimu- lation of the semiconductive connective tissue web that permeates the body but can be accessed by major acupoints.

## Neuroanatomical Acupuncture

Neuroanatomical acupuncture is a style of practice inclusive of recent biomedical studies in animals of electroacupuncture effects on the cen- tral and peripheral nervous system27 and anecdotal clinical experience with myofascial “trigger-point” mechanisms.24,26,28,29-37 The treatment of tender knots in muscles by intramuscular stim- ulation is a “non–channel-based acupuncture. It was termed “Ashi” or “ouch point” acupuncture by the ancients and was probably the first form of acupuncture practiced in the West from the time of the Dutch physician Willem Ten Rhyne, who visited Japan sometime in the early 17th century.38 Dr. Franklin Bache (Benjamin Franklin’s great-grandson) described his clinical trials utilizing acupuncture on prisoners with various conditions in an 1825 article in the North American Medical and Surgical Journal. The descriptions of his empir- ical needling intervention suggest he knew nothing about classical point, channel, or related theories.39 This form of acupuncture was essentially rediscovered by Dr. Janet Travell, who, along with Dr. David Simon, published texts for the treat- ment of myofascial pain with trigger-point therapy. They discovered that the stimulation of these palpable points with hydremic needles was effective even if they did not inject local anesthetics. Over the intervening several decades, this has led to the promotion of a simplified “dry-nee- dling” style of acupuncture among U.S. physical therapists and some chi- ropractic physicians. Conversely, basic research done in modern China with electroacupuncture has contributed to the broader neuroanatom- ical style of acupuncture by demonstrating that different frequencies of electronic stimulation via acupoints and myotome and sclerotome regions can boost specific types of endorphins and enkephalins, achiev- ing a level of pain relief not seen with simple trigger-point releases or channel-based manipulation with needles and moxibustion.27 Modern research has found a high degree of overlap between the mapped trigger points of Travell and Simons and the classical acu- points that are related to the anatomy of the connective tissue major and auxiliary channels37: Microsytem acupuncture Ear (auricular) acupuncture Korean hand acupuncture Scalp acupuncture: Chinese, YNSA (Yamamoto New Scalp Acupuncture)

# SCOPE OF PRACTICE

Similar to the challenges in universal acceptance of an exact defini- tion of the term acupuncture, the clinical practice of acupuncture also varies across the world and in different U.S. jurisdictions. As noted, there were acupuncture practice acts in 47 U.S. states and the District of Columbia as of early 2018. Although there is a core of therapeutic acceptance from state to state, there are wide variations in expanded scopes. Although most states use the designation “LAc,” a few have begun to use other credentials, such as “doctor of acupuncture” in Rhode Island, “doctor of Oriental medicine” in a few other states, and “East Asian medicine practitioner” in Washington State.40 New Mexico is a good example of perhaps the broadest acu- puncture scope in the United States. In New Mexico, the practice of “Oriental medicine” includes homeopathy, prescriptive drug author- ity (with expanded practice certification), laser therapy, injection, and intravenous (IV) therapy within its doctor of Oriental medicine (DOM) designation.41 Although California law has in many ways set the pace for the pro- fession through the years, with a scope that now defines acupuncturists as primary health care professionals with a practice inclusive of Asian massage, acupuncture, herbal medicine, exercises, breathing tech- niques, and dietary supplements, among others, it is the Washington State law that forged entirely new ground for acupuncturists in the United States. The stage was set for the renaming and overhaul of the state acu- puncture law for a number of reasons, including the strong desire by a Korean Washington State legislator to rid the Western world of the term Oriental, an upcoming sunset review, and several confusing and deficient parts of current acupuncture law. What resulted was the insertion of the term Asian in place of Oriental in the Washington State acupuncture regulations. “East Asian medicine means a health care service utilizing East Asian medicine diagnosis and treatment to

promote health and treat organic or functional disorders and includes the following: Acupuncture (or lancets), electrical, mechanical, mag- netic devices, moxibustion, acupressure, cupping, dermal friction technique, infrared, sonopuncture, laserpuncture, point injection therapy (aquapuncture), dietary advice (including recommendation and sale of herbs, vitamins, minerals), breathing, relaxation and East Asian exercise, Qi Gong, East Asian massage and Tui na, and superfi- cial heat and cold therapies.”42 Acupuncturists in the state of Washington are now licensed under the EAMP credential.43

# SAFETY

Acupuncture therapy is generally regarded as a safe and relatively pain-free procedure. There are many forms and styles of acupuncture therapy practiced; some have a reputation for potentially being more painful at times, but generally the procedure in the United States is accompanied by very little reporting of adverse effects. The treatment provided by most licensed acupuncturists is painless. Millions of treat- ments have been performed by licensed acupuncturists in the United States who have taken “clean needle” training as part of their basic acupuncture training. For the past 15 years, it has been the standard of care in acupuncture practice that single-use disposable needles are used in all treatments. Recently, there has been renewed discussion about the safety of acupuncture, sparked by a British Medical Journal (BMJ) editorial piece that put a cautionary spin on the view that acupuncture needling is entirely safe or at least has virtually no side effects. The article, “Acupuncture Transmitted Infections,” although high- lighting the skin infection risk of acupuncture needling, also identified only “more than 50 cases” to date (2010) worldwide. Nevertheless, the authors’ main opinion stated that these types of infections were underreported.44 An older report also published in the BMJ by Vincent seems appropriately titled: “The Safety of Acupuncture; Acupuncture Is Safe in the Hands of Competent Practitioners.” Vincent stated, “The conclusion that acupuncture is a very safe intervention in the hands of a competent practitioner seems justified on the evidence available.”45 A large review study published in 2008 focused on acupuncture safety and efficacy in pediatrics. The authors “found evidence of some efficacy and low risk associated with acupuncture in pediatrics.” They stated some caution as well, noting “the safety of acupuncture is a serious concern, particularly in pediatrics. Because acupuncture’s mechanism is not known, the use of needles in children becomes questionable.” They also stated, “nevertheless, it seems acupuncture is a safe com- plementary/alternative medicine modality for pediatric patients on the basis of the data we reviewed.”46 The NCCAOM and the AAAOM jointly authored a response to the BMJ editorial, stating that “the article neglected to mention that the inci- dent of infections is drastically reduced when a consumer seeks a qual- ified practitioner who has met the rigorous standards of the NCCAOM certification which includes passing of the Council of Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (CCAOM) clean needle tech- nique course, a prerequisite to becoming an NCCAOM certified prac- titioner.”47 They stated in another article that “while acupuncture is a highly effective and valuable form of healthcare, it is not an entirely risk- free medical procedure, and should be administered by practitioners with the proper training who follow accepted guidelines of practice.”48 Acupuncture has a low relative risk. The NIH Consensus Statement on Acupuncture published in 1998 found that the incidence of adverse effects is substantially lower than that of many drugs or other accepted procedures for the same conditions.49 Systematic reviews and surveys have clarified that acupuncture is safe when performed by appropriately trained practitioners, with infrequent minor side effects, such as feeling relaxed, elated, tired, or having sensation or itching at the point of insertion. Rare, serious complications, such as infection or pneumothorax, are directly related to insufficient training. Safe use of acupuncture has also been established in pediatrics and for women who are pregnant.49

# EVIDENCE-BASED AND EVIDENCE-INFORMED

# ACUPUNCTURE

Acupuncture practice has steadily increased across the world since the 1970s. Although it was once viewed as a strictly Asian practice, acu- puncture is now practiced by a wide variety of medical and nonmed- ical practitioners. Each type of health care discipline has at least some of its members practicing acupuncture. Of course, the popularity and spread of the practice do not mean acupuncture has become main- stream or effective. Where is the evidence proving or disapproving the practice? Skeptics abound within established medical practice. At the same time, there is an increasing body of acupuncture research to con- sider, review, and evaluate. According to the Society for Acupuncture Research, “every month, an average of 100 acupuncture-related arti- cles are published in more than 50 journals.”50 Although this may not seem impressive in the greater context of evidence-based medicine as a whole, it does represent a great increase over the years in research focused on the field. A defining moment in acupuncture research in the West came with the conclusion of the NIH Consensus Conference in 1997. For the first time, a Western panel of medical experts gathered to review, critique, and set guidelines for the use of acupuncture in the medical field in the United States. Before this conference, research in acupuncture was acknowledged by some Western doctors but largely dismissed. The view of Asian studies and of studies from other countries in general did not make an effect on the U.S. radar. The conference helped focus the attention, collect what research had been completed to date, and con- cluded that there was merit in the use of acupuncture for certain con- ditions and, most importantly, that there was a real need and demand that acupuncture be better studied and used. Acupuncture was finally “on the map” in the West.51 Progress was made in the 10 years after the NIH conference, as was detailed by the 2007 Society for Acupuncture Research (SAR) International Symposium.52 The symposium detailed a number of important research conclusions, highlighting growing evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment for chronic pain while detail- ing the issues concerning sham acupuncture in trials and a number of basic science trials demonstrating the physiological effects of needling. Conventional medical practice has grown within a system of great scrutiny and self-analysis. A massive research culture spins off stud- ies by the thousands. The double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial has become the hallmark of the “appropriately conducted research trial.” Acupuncture evolved in a completely different culture, that of China, where, ironically, as we were “discovering” the Chinese traditional system of acupuncture, not so many years ago, the Chinese began a wholesale discovery of traditional Western medicine. Acupuncture and all that is TCM have been extensively researched in China. The quality and breadth of acupuncture research in China and Asia in gen- eral have increased greatly since the first edition of this textbook. Large research academies, such as the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Beijing, and numerous universities and schools of TCM have greatly improved the research culture in China since the 1970s. Although there is considerable emphasis on herbal research, there is still quite a lot of research examining the other areas of TCM, including acupuncture.53-56

## 256SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

In 2014, the Veterans Administration (VA) published an evidence map of acupuncture.57,66-81 This document is a broad overview of the evidence base for acupuncture and is based on 183 systemic reviews from 2005 through 2013. The map estimated the research volume and effectiveness of acupuncture on the basis of the published reviews. According to the document, assessments to evaluate the value of acu- puncture need to take into account multiple factors, including the following: • Clinical efficiency • Risk and benefits compared with standard treatment • Costs and cost-effectiveness • Patient satisfaction • Patient preferences for a particular diagnosis The evidence map of acupuncture for pain summarizes the clini- cal indication of pain. The bubble plot summarizes the results of systematic reviews for 21 distinct indications relevant to the outcome of pain. Evidence of a positive effect with high confidence was found for dys- menorrhea, cancer pain, and labor pain. The wellness-relevant indica- tions and outcomes bubble plot summarize 43 systematic reviews and large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 20 distinct indications. Evidence of a potential positive effect with high confidence was found for insomnia, smoking cessation, and restless leg syndrome. Results for the mental health bubble map represented 17 systematic reviews with summary effects for 9 clinical indications. There was a potential positive effect with high confidence for depression and schizophrenia. Medium confidence was found for the treatment of anxiety and post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).57 An excellent source of current research studies regarding integra- tive medicine including acupuncture is the Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine and Health. The organization’s website notes the following: “The Consortium was founded in 1999 by eight aca- demic health centers including Duke University, Harvard University, Stanford University, University of California, San Francisco, University of Arizona, University of Maryland, University of Massachusetts, and the University of Minnesota. Now with 72 institutional members, the Consortium continues to grow and represents thousands of scientists, educators, clinicians and other health professionals who share an inter- est in the field of Integrative Medicine and Health.”58 One of the topic areas within the Consortium is “moving beyond medications” to an area of collected information on evidence-based nonpharmacological pain approaches. Available for review is a white paper on strategies for comprehensive pain care. Also included in this section are evidence summaries for treating pain, as follows: • Acupuncture in the management of cancer pain • Acupuncture therapy for chronic pain • Acupuncture therapy for postoperative pain with opioid sparing • Acupuncture therapy acute pain (not perioperative)58 One of the studies highlighted included a review of several stud- ies performed in emergency departments (EDs) in the United States between 2014 and 2016 and provided evidence of the effective use of acupuncture for acute nonperioperative pain. A randomized study involved 300 ED patients who received either IV morphine or acupuncture. Acupuncture proved better than mor- phine in pain relief by 14%. Acupuncture also provided pain relief in a shorter time frame, by 6 to 18 minutes. There were also far fewer side effects, only 4 compared with 86 in the morphine group.59 In another summarized study, this one of feasibility and accept- ability, 182 ED patients who received only acupuncture had a decrease in pain comparable to that of patients who had received analgesics. In addition, the acupuncture-only group had a reduction in anxiety levels.60 The 2017 Clinical Guidelines of the American College of Physicians for acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain recommend that patients should select nonpharmacologic treatment with superficial heat, massage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation.59 In multiple systematic reviews with meta-analyses, acupuncture was found to be effective in reducing postsurgical pain compared with sham acupuncture, controls, and usual care, with a reduction in opioid need (21% opioid reduction at 8 hours, 23% at 24 hours, and 29% at 72 hours postsurgery) and with lowered incidence of opioid-related side effects such as nausea, dizziness, sedation, pruritus, and urinary retention.60-65


By most accounts, acupuncture has been around for approximately 5000 years. The basic practice of placing needles (made of metal, stone, bone, wood, or other materials) into select points on the body to effect change, be it pain relief or the calming of anxiety, has not really changed much. As we have briefly touched on in this chapter, the history of acupuncture is rich. Standards of practice vary widely, and critical areas of study have yet to be adequately delineated. Yet here we are in 2018 with a much larger and richer database of study—from RCTs to therapeutic outcomes—at our fingertips to discuss than we had in 1985 when this text was first published.

## Philosophy

Ayurvedic philosophy is based on the Samkhya philosophy of creation. It has influenced major strains of philosophy in both Eastern and Western civilizations. The word Samkhya is derived from the Sanskrit words Sat (“truth”) and Khya (“to know”). The Rishi Kapila (Rishi means “realized beings” or “seers of truth”) realized the Samkhya phi- losophy of creation. They perceived the following: • The close relationship between humans and the universe: humans are a microcosm, a universe within themselves, whereas the external environment is the macrocosm. • The source of all existence is cosmic consciousness, manifest as male (Shiva or Purusha) and female (Shakti or Prakriti) energy. Purusha is formless, colorless, and “beyond” attribute. Prakriti has form, color, awareness, and choice. Prakriti creates all the forms of the universe and has three attributes (Gunas): Satva (essence), Rajas (movement), and Tamas (inertia). It is also represented by Brahma (the god of creation), Vishnu (the god of protection), and Shiva (the god of destruction), which together comprise a cycle active in this universe. In Prakriti, the three attributes are in balance. Whenever this balance is disturbed, the attributes interact to bring about the evo- lution of the universe, yielding the cosmic vibration of Aum. The cos- mic intellect (the Mahad) manifests itself as ego (Ahamkar), which, through the help of Satva, manifests the five senses and five motor organs, which together constitute the “organic universe.” Ego fur- ther manifests into the five basic elements (space, air, fire, water, and earth), which, under the influence of Tamas, create the “inorganic universe.” Satva is a creative potential (Brahma), Rajas is a kinetic protective force (Vishnu), and Tamas is a potentially destructive force (Shiva). These three—Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva—are constantly operating in the universe.

## Five Basic Elements and the Universe (Panchbhuta

## Philosophy)

The Rishis perceived that consciousness consists of five basic elements: ether (space), air, fire, water, and earth. At the beginning of the world, consciousness was without form, existing as the subtle vibration of the cosmic “soundless” sound Aum. Within these vibrations appeared the element ether. Ether started to move, creating air. The movement of ether also produced friction and, through friction, generated heat, then fire. From the heat of the fire, ethereal elements dissolved and liquefied into water. Water then solidified to form molecules of earth. Thus all matter was born from the five elements. These five elements exist in energy forms.

## Five Elements and the Senses

The five elements also connect with the five senses: ether—hearing, air—touch, fire—vision, water—taste, and earth—smell, and they are present in certain physiological functions. Expressing the functions of the sensory organs are five actions (Table 33.2).

elements are directly related to humans’ abilities both to perceive the external environment in which they live and to respond to it: • Ether is the medium through which sound travels. The ear is the organ of hearing, expressing its action through the organ of speech, which creates meaningful sound. • Air is related to skin and the sense of touch. Its organ of action is the hand, which is especially sensitive. The hand performs the actions of holding, giving, and receiving. • Fire produces light, heat, and color and is thus related to vision and direction. Its organ is the eye. • Water relates to the organ of taste. The tongue is also related to the action of the genitals, the penis and clitoris. In Ayurveda, the penis and clitoris are called the lower tongues. By controlling the upper tongue, one naturally controls the lower tongue. • The earth element relates to the sense of smell, and the nose is its organ.

## Physiology

The five elements manifest within the body as the Tridosha (Dosha means “protective” or, when out of balance, “disease producing”). The Tridosha are the three humors, or basic principles, described earli- er—Vat, Pit, and Kaph. From the bodily combination of ether and air comes the bodily air principle, Vat Dosha. Likewise, fire and water combine as Pit Dosha, or fire principle, and earth and water produce the Kaph Dosha, or water principle. These three control all biological, psychological, and physio- pathologic functions of the body, mind, and consciousness. They produce natural urges and individual tastes in food, flavor, and tem- perature. They govern the maintenance and destruction of bodily tis- sue and the elimination of waste products. They also are responsible for psychological phenomena, including the emotions of fear, anger, greed, and the highest order of emotions: understanding, compas- sion, and love.

<!-- chunk -->

## Properties of Dosha

Vat, Pit, and Kaph control all human biological, psychological, and physiopathologic functions and have subtle properties, as shown in Box 33.1. The Doshas increase by similar properties and are diminished by opposite properties. For example, Vat is dry, light, and cold, so any food, medicine, lifestyle, or behavior that increases these qualities increases Vat within the body. Conversely, oily, heavy, or hot factors decrease Vat.

<!-- chunk -->

## Functions of Tridosha

Each humor has a specific action. Vat is the principle of movement and may be called the bodily air principle, as opposed to the environ- mental air principle. Vat is a subtle energy governing all biological movement—breathing, blinking, muscle and joint movement, heart- beat, and all nerve and membrane contractions and expansions. In addition, it controls the psychological functions governing the emotions of fear and anxiety. Vat also controls pain, tremors, and spasms. Broadly speaking, the whole nervous system can be labeled as Vat function. The large intestine, pelvic cavity, bones, skin, ears, and thighs are the places of Vat. Any excess of Vat accumulates in these areas. Pit, or bodily fire, governs digestion, absorption, assimilation, nutrition, temperature, skin color, luster of the eye, intelligence, and understanding. It arouses anger, hate, and jealousy. The small intes- tine, stomach, blood, sweat glands, fat, eyes, and skin are the places of Pit; all metabolism is governed by Pit. Kaph, biological water, is the cement of the body, providing for physical structure. It is responsible for body resistance and biological strength. It lubricates the joints; provides moisture to skin; and pro- motes wound healing, strength, vigor, and stability. It supports mem- ory, gives energy to the heart and lungs, and maintains immunity. Kaph is present within the throat, chest, head, sinuses, nose, mouth, stom- ach, joints, cytoplasm, plasma, and liquid secretions. Psychologically, Kaph governs attachment, greed, long-standing envy, calmness, for- giveness, and love. A balance of the Dosha is necessary for optimal health. Together, they govern all metabolic activities: anabolism (Kaph), catabolism (Vat), and metabolism (Pit).

## Individual Psychosomatic Constitutions—Prakriti

Prakriti, a Sanskrit word composed of pra (“before”) and akriti (“cre- ativity”), denotes the constitution of each individual as determined at conception. At the time of fertilization, permutations of Vat, Pit, and Kaph determine the constitution of the new individual, with male- ness or femaleness dominating other traits. These basic traits are also shaped by other important factors, such as diet, lifestyle, behavior, emotions, and seasons. As illustrated in Box 33.2, up to seven different constitutions can exist depending on the permutation and combination of Vat, Pit, and Kaph. Prakriti is genetically determined; the basic constitution, the combination of the three humors, remains unchanged throughout an individual’s lifetime. The combination can, however, respond to envi- ronmental changes. Life is considered a sacred path in Ayurveda, a ceaseless interaction between the internal (Tridosha) environment and the external envi- ronment, or the sum of cosmic forces. To counteract external change, an individual may create a balance in the internal forces by altering diet, lifestyle, and behavior. The characteristics of the corresponding psychosomatic constitutions are listed in Table 33.3.

## Mental Constitutions

On the mental and astral planes, three Gunas (attributes of female energy or Prakriti) correspond to the three humors that make up the physical constitution. In the Ayurvedic system, the Gunas are Satva, Rajas, and Tamas. They provide the basis for the distinctions in human temperament and individual differences in psychological and moral dispositions. These attributes are further subdivided, but that is beyond the scope of this chapter.

<!-- chunk -->

## Satva

The Satva type of mind expresses essence, understanding, purity, clarity, compassion, and love. People of Satvic psyche (Satva temper- ament) have healthy bodies and pure behavior and consciousness. They believe in the existence of God, are religious, and are often holy persons.

<!-- chunk -->

## Rajas

The Raja type of mind operates on the sensual level. Such persons are interested in business, prosperity, power, prestige, and position. They enjoy wealth, are generally extroverted, and are politically minded.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tamas

The Tamas type is distinguished by its ignorance, inertia, heaviness, and dullness. Tamasic people are lazy, selfish, and destructive by nature. They show little respect to others. All their activities are ego- centric. The Satvic person attains self-realization without much effort, whereas those of Rajasic or Tamasic mind have difficulty. These three subtle mental energies are responsible for behavior patterns that may be altered and improved through practice and spiritual discipline, such as yoga and meditation.

# HEALTH AND DISEASE

Health is defined in Ayurveda as the soundness of body (Shrira), mind (Manas), and soul (Atma). Each part of this tripod of life should receive equal attention to ensure that the individual achieves sound health. Ayurvedic medicine stresses that psychic influences strongly affect the body in health and disease, a fact that must also be taken into account in modern therapeutics. Modern science takes pride in its understanding of physiology but, in doing so, has emphasized fragmentation, isolation, and disunity. Instead of wholeness and interaction, this modern view accepts only physical objects as causes of disease, whereas these objects are merely the agents of disease, able to cause specific symptoms but only in a sus- ceptible host. Disease is the result of a disruption of the spontaneous flow of nature’s intelligence within physiology. When people violate nature’s laws and cannot adequately rid themselves of the results of this action, they acquire diseases. Ayurveda conceives the body as being composed of three princi- pal divisions: three Doshas (humors), seven Dhatus (tissues), and three Malas (excretions). The three Doshas regulate cell functions. Pit gives energy and is responsible for cellular, enzymatic, and metabolic functions; Kaph

<!-- chunk -->

## TABLE 33.3 Psychosomatic Constitutions (Prakriti)

<!-- chunk -->

## 261CHAPTER 33 Ayurveda: The Science of Life and Mother of the Healing Arts

helps in synthesizing blocks of cells; and Vat controls the other two. A balance of these Doshas, good-quality tissues (the seven Dhatus), and a certain character of excretions are essential for maintaining health. As explained earlier, an individual is born with a particular Dosha predominating in his or her constitution (Prakriti). This predomi- nant Dosha, quite apart from genetic, age, environment, and dietary factors, may make an individual susceptible to a certain disease. For example, Pit Prakriti individuals are more prone to develop a disease syndrome with symptoms similar to a peptic ulcer. This is a result of hyperactivity of the Pit Dosha, which regulates enzymatic activity. Hyperpepsinogenemic individuals are more susceptible to duodenal ulcer formation.2 Ayurveda teaches that the origin of most diseases is found either in an exogenous or endogenous Dosha imbalance or in an inherent or acquired weakness of the tissues. Therefore, the successful treatment or prevention of disease consists of normalizing cellular functions by correcting any Dosha imbalance or improving inherent tissue vitality. For example, in the treatment of cancer, the use of agents cytotoxic to the cancer cells is important. However, equally important is potentia- tion of the immune system and stimulation of the body’s own healing mechanisms.

# MODES OF THERAPY

Once a diagnosis is made, Ayurveda offers various modes of therapy. The treatment is chosen according to patient constitution and the disease process. Modalities include dietary alterations, botanical med- icines, minerals, animal products, exercise, yoga, meditation, counsel- ing, and surgery.

<!-- chunk -->

## Diet

Ayurveda places great emphasis on diet, for both its direct effect on the individual’s physiological state and its influence on the action of medicines. Proper assimilation of dietary constituents is essential for the maintenance of good health. Improper assimilation results in the formation of intermediary products of digestion that have toxic properties and are therefore treated as foreign by the body. Such toxic products are called Ama (this leads to the concepts of immune and autoimmune disorders). Arthritic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis are attributed to an accumulation of Ama. Could these toxic intermediates—macro- molecules absorbed transmucosally from the intestine (in nutrition- ally insignificant amounts)—provoke strong immune reactions? The human gut has a complex system to control the continuous onslaught of antigenic substances derived from food, microorganisms, and tox- ins.3 It has been suggested that absorption of such compounds could underlie the pathogenesis of disease in the gut and in distant sites such as the liver and spleen.4 Ayurveda stresses prevention of the formation and accumulation of Ama through appropriate diet and the use of therapies to improve digestion. It also considers various dietary factors that trigger or elim- inate certain diseases.5 That is why Ayurveda places emphasis on diet according to the patient’s psychosomatic constitution (Prakriti), time of day (Dincharya), and season (Ritucharya). For example, a person with the Pit psychosomatic constitution should not eat foods that are hot, pungent, or spicy at noon in the summer because this tends to increase diseases of inflammation. Ayurveda prescribes specific diets for several psychiatric dis- orders. Recent research supports this approach. Brain levels of the neurotransmitters 5-hydroxytryptamine, catecholamine, and ace- tylcholine have been found to be influenced by dietary constituents. Consequently, it has been suggested that normal brain functions and mental disease can be altered by diet.6 Recent exciting developments include the successful treatment of mental depression with neu- rotransmitter precursors.7,8 Ayurveda also prescribes certain diets (Pathya) during drug thera- pies because dietary constituents are believed to influence drug action.

## Individualization of Medicinal Therapy

Medicinal therapy is highly individualized in Ayurveda.9 The choice and dose of medicine are influenced not only by disease but by the individual’s constitution and the environmental conditions likely to affect that individual’s Doshas. For example, Piper rotudum (black pepper) and Zingiber offici- nale (ginger), which increase Pit (increasing stomach acid and pepsin secretion), are used cautiously in individuals with a Pit constitution. Another example is in the treatment of the patient with hypertension. Ayurveda prescribes Terminalia chebula for the treatment of hyperten- sive patients who have Vat Prakriti, whereas for the patient with Pit Prakriti, one uses Terminalia arjuna. In the Vimanastrana, Charak presented an interesting discussion of host- and drug-related factors that help in the determination of the drug and dosage (Box 33.3). Ayurveda also emphasizes proper timing for the administration of medicines. Considering that chronopharmacology (the study of the timing of drug administration in relation to physiological function) has only recently been developed as a branch of modern therapeutics, it seems remarkable that such astute observations about the timing of medicaments were made so many centuries ago.

## Pharmacy in Ayurveda

In Ayurveda, pharmacy is highly developed. Almost 70 books contain more than 8000 recipes for the preparation of different medicines, most of which are derived from minerals and plants. Many formu- lations are available, including simple distillates (Arka), decoctions (Kwatha), tinctures (Avleha), powders (Churna), pills (Vati, Goti, and

<!-- chunk -->

## 262SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

Modak), fermented products (Asva), and medicated oils (Taila and Ghrita). The oil preparations are particularly useful because they help target the sites of action. Detailed descriptions of the methods are recommended to ensure a medicine is suitable for human use.10 One pharmaceutic technique, Samskara (“refinement”), is known as Shudhi (“purification”), a pro- cess that eliminates the toxicity of some minerals and plants. Another practice is the administration of drugs in combination (Samyoga) to reduce toxicity and increase efficacy.

# RESEARCH

Considerable modern research has proven the efficacy of Ayurvedic herbal preparations, and research has now moved to elucidating their mechanisms and sites of action.11 Recent studies demonstrated prob- able genomic bases for metabolic differences as predicted by Prakriti. This genetic variant may provide newer approaches to pharmacog- enomics. Extensive studies on Prakriti subtypes and genome mapping, especially of other important drug-metabolizing enzyme polymor- phisms (e.g., CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, TPMT), would be useful to understand a possible Prakriti pharmacogenomics rela- tionship to its correlating genotype, Prakriti, and drug metabolism.12 Curcumin, the active principle of Curcuma longa, has been found to exert a powerful anti-inflammatory effect by blocking many inflam- matory pathways, reversing insulin resistance, and reversing cancer by repairing defective genes.13 Further, it has been shown to selectively inhibit platelet prostaglandin production while sparing vascular endo- thelial prostaglandin synthesis. Many plant preparations have been used to strengthen general host resistance. Rasayna, Jeevaniya, and Balya increase tissue resistance to disease, a concept similar to “prohost therapy” as put forward by Hadden.14 Prohost therapy claims to augment cellular responses and, consequently, ameliorate disease states.15 A paper published in Phytotherapy Research in May 2011 found that aqueous extract of Withania somnifera root had an ability to inhibit the formation of mature amyloid- β fibrils in vitro. Amyloid plaques in the brain cause Alzheimer’s disease. This is an exciting discovery and may help many people prevent Alzheimer’s disease.16 Perhaps most exciting, however, is the current research demonstrating the efficacy of Ayurvedic herbal preparations in conditions for which modern medi- cine has had limited or no success. For example, animal studies showed that Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) can reverse the immuno- suppression of cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and prednisolone, and a 50% alcoholic extract of Phyllanthus emblica protects the liver from paracetamol.17,18 Recent human studies found that patients with acne vulgaris demonstrated substantial improvement, with no sig- nificant side effects, after using Sunder vati compared with placebo. Interestingly, the study found three other Ayurvedic formulas ineffec- tive. Patients with osteoarthritis experienced substantial, highly signifi- cant improvement in pain and disability with no significant side effects (however, the radiological findings did not improve).19

# AYURVEDIC AND MODERN MEDICINE

In evaluating Ayurvedic medicine by modern standards, one encoun- ters a number of difficulties. First, there is a wide variation in the quan- tity of pharmacologically active substances in plants. In addition, many findings are more subjective than objective. The modern scientist has difficulty recognizing subjective experiences because no reliable meth- odology has been developed to measure and reproduce such experi- ences. Yet totally objective experience, which completely disregards the subjective, may be wrong and even dangerous. There is no such thing as complete objectivity. What people claim as such is merely agreement among many minds. Subjective experi- ence is limited. Senses vary in ability, and reality for one is unreality for another. When using the tools of quantitative, technical science to describe biological and living systems phenomena, one soon encoun- ters limits. Artificial distinctions must be imposed to reduce variables and interpret nonlinear events intelligibly. Science has often confused the map for the actual reality. Take the example of color vision in bees. The eye of a bee is more sensitive to blue, violet, and ultraviolet light, whereas receptors in the human eye more readily detect red, green, and blue wavelengths. Thus bees are nearly blind to red light, and humans are quite blind to ultraviolet light. These differing characteristics result in members of each species forming a completely different perception of the same object. Color, rather than being a part of the “reality” of a perceived object, is an expression of sensory apparatus, determined by each species’ or indi- vidual’s unique pattern of interneural connections. Even more inter- esting is the fact that, within the same species, perception may vary considerably. Ayurvedic philosophy may strike the contemporary reader as unnecessarily complex for the conceptual territory it addresses. However, it is actually quite succinct and relevant to modern life. Its precepts have influenced many systems of healing, including naturo- pathic medicine, through several paths of its root traditions. It emerged alongside systems known to early Persians, Greeks, and the Chinese. Modern medicine is itself a distillation of these same rich traditions. When one compares Ayurvedic concepts with those of preindustrial Europe, much similarity becomes apparent.

## Understanding Ayurvedic Insights Toward Individualized

<!-- chunk -->

## Genomic Medicine

Individualized medicine is the core essence of Ayurveda. The Tridosha system in Ayurveda is used to guide the individualization of treat- ments. The Ayurvedic physicians observe the patient’s body type, men- tal activity, emotional tendencies, and physiological functions to make an assessment of the unique combination of Tridosha, called Prakriti. The Prakriti of the individual is like the expression of the individual’s genome today. A unique, integrative “Ayurgenomics” medicine approach can be used to reinforce the essence of Ayurveda with the modern science of genomics. Ayurveda follows an approach that has noteworthy paral- lels with modern-day personalized genomic medicine advances in the understanding and management of health and disease. Every individ- ual is born with a specific proportion of Tridosha, which is partially determined genetically but also affected by the environment during fetal development. In Ayurvedic medicine, diseases are believed to originate based on the imbalances in Doshas, and the primary goal of Ayurveda is to make sure that the Doshas maintain their homeostatic state. The individuation explained by Dosha balance is a precursor to the modern genomic individuation. Even when the modern technology did not exist, ancient Vedic sages used the power of observation to determine the constitution of an individual. The Vedic sages gave com- plete attention to the patient by interviewing the patient and examin- ing the patient. Old Ayurvedic texts give an immense amount of details about symptoms, disease progression, and physical examination, and these details were translated into the language of Tridosha. This knowledge informs the practitioner about the genomic individuality (i.e., Prakriti) of the person. In the contemporary world, the Prakriti or constitution of the individual is the sum expression of the individ- ual’s genome. This individual genomic signature is expressed by the

individual’s symptoms, likes and dislikes, mental and emotional ten- dencies, and modern physiological measures. Recently, the field of Ayurgenomics has emerged to test the val- idation of the works of traditional Ayurvedic physicians. In one study, researchers performed genetic testing of individuals with three unique constitutions: Vat, Pit, or Kaph.20 The genetic study was matched with the constitution, and genetic patterns were observed. The Vat individuals had more active transport components. The Pit individuals had greater activity and responsiveness of blood compo- nents such as various blood cells, platelets, and immune cells. The Kaph individuals had a larger share of lipid components, such as cho- lesterol, triglycerides, and structural proteins. These results clearly demonstrated the qualities of Doshas seen in Ayurvedic texts: Vat— movement, Pit—metabolism, Kaph—structure and stability. In another investigation, the constitutional expression of individ- uals from distinct climates was tested.21 The scientists looked at the EGLN1 gene, an oxygen sensor that activates other genes in the body to adapt to low oxygen concentrations. It was hypothesized that expres- sion of the EGLN1 gene would be greater in high-altitude populations. Because this gene is linked to adapting and oxygen metabolism, it was also thought that this population might have more Pit individuals. They found both hypotheses to be true: individuals in higher altitudes had greater expression of the EGLN1 gene, and there was a higher number of Pit individuals in this population. Another Ayurgenomics research study looked at rheumatoid arthritis.22 Rheumatoid arthritis involves inflammation and joint pain. Hence, there is an increased activation of inflammatory path- ways. According to Ayurveda, the fundamental characteristics between Vat-dominant and Pit-dominant individuals suffering from rheuma- toid arthritis are unique. The study reaffirms constitutional-based individuality. The Vat individuals had greater expression of inflam- matory markers, interleukin-1-beta (IL-1 β ) and tumor necrosis fac- tor-alpha (TNF- α ), whereas the Pit individuals had greater expression of oxidative stress markers SOD3 and PON1. Kaph individuals did not demonstrate either inflammatory or oxidative pathways. Overall, Ayurgenomics established some underlying mechanisms of the destructive process of rheumatoid arthritis based on Prakriti. The idea of Prakriti in Ayurveda and its correlation with genom- ics was observed more than a decade ago. Some studies did find the relationship between Prakriti classification with genetic information and the link of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HLA- DRB1, CYP2C19, EGLN1, genes related to inflammatory and oxida- tive stress, cardiovascular disease markers for various blood cells, DNA methylation alterations, and risk factors for cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. Perhaps these studies have demonstrated the association of specific genes with the phenotype of a particular Prakriti, but the first attempt to organize the Prakritis using genome-wide SNP markers and find a scientific basis for Prakriti classification was made in 2015.23 The investigators performed genome-wide SNP analysis of male individuals belonging to three different Prakritis. They discovered that 52 SNPs were significantly different between Prakritis. The scien- tists also analyzed 297 Indian population samples with known ances- try. They found out that the PGM1 gene correlates with the phenotype of Pit. We know that in Ayurveda, characteristics of Pitta include diges- tion, metabolism, and energy production. Interestingly, the PGM1 gene is in the center of many metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Research shows that the function of the gene directly correlates with the role of Pit in metabolism as described in ancient Ayurvedic literature, Charak Samhita. This provides evidence that the phenotypic classification of Ayurveda has a genetic basis, and its Prakriti-based practice complements personalized medicine.


Only some glimpses of Ayurveda are presented here. This ancient system of medicine, developed over centuries, has a consistent and logical framework. Ayurveda gives detailed instructions for the pres- ervation of health and the treatment of disease. The ancient system faced a setback when modern medicine subjected all knowledge to experimental and statistical verification, which, although useful, is limited by the tools available and the perceptions underlying the questions asked. Furthermore, modern medicine finds human bodies to have no variability within studies, creating the inability to study a pattern in differences in body types. Now that considerable knowl- edge of cellular physiology has accumulated and more sensitive mod- ern biomedical research tools exist, we may be able to evaluate the concepts of Ayurveda more effectively. Ayurgenomics is already being practiced in Ayurvedic clinics all over the globe, filling in gaps pres- ent in modern medical science and creating a platform for integrative medicine.

## 265CHAPTER 34 Botanical Medicine—A Modern Perspective

in Europe of regulatory policies and practices that made it economi- cally feasible for companies to do research. For example, in Germany, beginning in 1978, regulations were instituted that allowed herbal products to be marketed with drug claims if they are proven to be safe and effective through a special monograph system.3 A special commis- sion (Commission E) authored the initial series of 400 monographs on herbal products similar to the over-the-counter (OTC) monographs in the United States. Whether the herbal product was made available by prescription or OTC was based on its application and safety of use based on its monograph. If a manufacturer of an herbal product meets the quality requirements of the monograph or produces additional evi- dence of safety and effectiveness, which can include data from existing literature, anecdotal information from practicing physicians, and lim- ited clinical studies, it is viewed as safe and effective. Herbal products sold in pharmacies are also reimbursed by insurance if they are pre- scribed by a physician. In contrast, in the United States, extracts identical to those approved in Germany and other countries as drugs are available as “dietary sup- plements,” and manufacturers are prohibited from making any thera- peutic claims for their products. No medicinal claims are allowed for most herbal products in the United States because the FDA requires the same standard of absolute proof as required for new drugs. For decades, the FDA has rejected the idea of establishing an independent “expert advisory panel” for the development of monographs similar to Germany’s Commission E monographs, as well as other ideas to create a suitable framework for the marketing of herbal products in the United States. The monograph system in Germany allows companies to market their products according to the guidelines of Commission E. With the ability to make appropriate claims, many companies have achieved success with their products, enabling them to fund the necessary research to gain greater acceptance within mainstream, conventional medicine. The use of St. John’s wort extract in the treatment of depres- sion is a perfect case in point to illustrate how Commission E mono- graphs led to significant documentation of the efficacy of plants with a long history of folk use for depression. When the Commission E monograph for St. John’s wort came out in 1984, it identified the constituent hypericin as the active constituent and permitted the medicinal use of the herb (in average doses of 2 to 4 g of herb, or 0.2 to1 mg total hypericin) for depression, anxiety, or nervous excitement. Originally, it was thought that hypericin acted as an inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase, thereby resulting in the increase of central nervous system monoamines such as serotonin and dopa- mine. However, it was later shown that St. John’s wort does not inhibit monoamine oxidase in vivo.4 The antidepressant activities appear to be related more to serotonin-reuptake inhibition as occurs with the drugs Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft; modulation of neuroendocrine func- tion; downregulation of β -adrenergic receptors; and upregulation of serotonin receptors in the brain areas that are implicated in depres- sion.4,5 In addition, it appears that although hypericin is an important marker, other compounds such as flavonoids are also thought to play a major role in the pharmacology of St. John’s wort. The key point here is that the further understanding and documentation of the clinical effectiveness of St. John’s wort extract was largely the direct result of a commercial incentive created by the existence of Commission E.6

## Science Fueled the “Herbal Renaissance”

Improvements in analytic techniques and modern pharmacology gave researchers the tools and understanding necessary to better evaluate herbal medicines. Improvements in plant cultivation techniques and the quality of herbal extracts (quality control and standardization) have also led to the development of some effective plant medicines. These advances have created a renaissance in the appreciation and use of herbal medicine. It seems that science and medicine have finally advanced to a level where nature can be appreciated rather than dis- counted. The scientific investigation of plant medicines is replacing some of the mystery and romance of herbalism with a greater under- standing of the ways in which herbs work. Thirty years ago, it was impossible to determine exactly how herbs promoted their healing effects because analytic science had not advanced to a sufficient level of sophistication. This point is well illustrated by the fact that the main mechanism of action responsible for aspirin’s anti-inflammatory effect was not understood until the early 1970s, and its mechanism of action for pain relief has yet to be fully understood. Because the mechanism of therapeutic action of a particular herb or its constituents could not be fully elicited, many effective plant medicines were erroneously labeled as possessing no pharmacological activity. Now, researchers equipped with greater understanding and more sophisticated technology are rediscovering the wonder of plants as medicinal agents. Much of the increased understanding is, interest- ingly, a result of synthetic drug research. For example, one of the modern classes of drugs is calcium channel blockers. These agents block the entry of calcium into smooth muscle cells, thereby inhibiting contraction and promoting muscular relax- ation. Calcium-channel-blocking drugs are currently being used in the treatment of high blood pressure, angina, asthma, and other con- ditions associated with smooth muscle contraction. They represent a highly evolved stage of modern drug pharmacy. After calcium channel drugs became better understood, it was discovered that many herbs contain components that possess calcium-channel-blocking activity. In most cases, the historical use of these herbs corresponded to their calcium-channel-blocking activity. In addition to possessing currently understood pharmacological activity, many herbs possess pharmacological actions that are not con- sistent with modern pharmacological understanding. For example, an herb often appears to affect homeostatic control mechanisms to aid normalization of many bodily processes. When there is a hyperstate, the herb has a lowering effect, and when there is a hypostate, it has a heightening effect. This action is totally baffling to orthodox pharma- cologists but not to experienced herbalists, who have used terms such as alterative, amphoteric, adaptogen, or tonic to describe this effect.

## The Advantages of Herbal Medicines

In general, herbal preparations are thought to have three major advan- tages: lower cost, fewer side effects, and medicinal effects that tend to normalize physiological function. When used most effectively, the mechanism of action of an herb often corrects the underlying cause of a disorder. In contrast, synthetic drugs are often designed to alleviate the symptom or effect without addressing the underlying cause. They gen- erally act as specific agonists or inhibitors of enzymes or receptor sites. Interestingly, research has often shown that for many plants, the whole plant or crude extract is much more effective than isolated constituents. In many instances, multiple components produce multiple pharmaco- logical actions. This is a key concept because, in general, most drugs poison a specific enzyme. In contrast, herbal medicines, with their mul- tiple constituents, work broadly, modulating multiple enzyme systems. Herbal medicine will certainly play a major role in future medicine. As modern medicine gains more knowledge and understanding about health and disease, it is adopting therapies that are more natural and less toxic. Lifestyle modification, stress reduction, exercise, meditation, dietary changes, and many other traditional naturopathic therapies are becoming much more popular in standard medical circles. This illus- trates the paradigm shift that is occurring in medicine.

## 266SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

With the continuing advancement in science and technology, there has been a great improvement in the quality of herbal medi- cines available and in the understanding of their optimal clinical use. Improvements in cultivation techniques coupled with improvements in quality control and standardization of potency will continue to increase the effectiveness of herbal medicines.

# THE STUDY OF HERBAL MEDICINE

The study of herbal medicine spans the breadth of pharmacology, the study of the history, source, physical and chemical properties, mechanisms of action, absorption, distribution, biotransformation, excretion, and therapeutic uses of “drugs.” In many respects, the phar- macological investigation of herbal medicine is just beginning. This textbook is replete with examples of herbs whose historical use is being justified by new investigations into their pharmacology.

## The History of Herbal Medicine

The history of the use of plants as medicines is full of interesting stories and fascinating facts. The evolution that occurred in herbal medicine over the centuries is only beginning to be recognized as more natural medicines gain acceptance. Interestingly, this acceptance is largely a result of increased scientific investigation. A trend exists toward using natural substances, including com- pounds found in the human body, such as interferon, interleukin, insulin, and human growth hormone, as well as foods, food compo- nents, herbs, and herbal compounds. More and more researchers are discovering the tremendous healing properties of these natural com- pounds and their advantages over synthetic medicines and surgery in the treatment of many health conditions. Through these scientific investigations, a trend toward natural medicine is emerging. To better appreciate this evolutionary trend, this section presents some of the historical aspects of herbal medicine. Much of the following discussion is derived from Barbara Griggs’s Green Pharmacy: A History of Herbal Medicine.7

<!-- chunk -->

## In the Beginning

Plants have been used as medicines since the dawn of animal life. The initial use of plants as medicines by humans is thought to have been a result of “instinctive” dowsing. Animals in the wild still provide evidence that this phenomenon occurs. Animals, with a few notable exceptions, eat plants that heal them and avoid plants that do them harm. Presumably humans also possessed this instinct at one time. As civilizations developed, medicine men and women were respon- sible for transmitting the information on herbs to their successors. Before the advent of written language, this information was handed down by verbal and experiential means. Besides instinctive dowsing, it was commonly believed that plants had been signed by the “creator” with some visible or other clue that would indicate its therapeutic use. This concept is commonly referred to as the “doctrine of signatures.” Common examples of this doctrine are the following: • Panax ginseng (ginseng): its roots bear a strong resemblance to a human figure, and its general use is as a tonic. • Caulophyllum thalictroides (blue cohosh): its branches are arranged like limbs in spasm, indicating its usefulness in the treatment of muscular spasm. • Sanguinaria canadensis (bloodroot): its roots and sap are a beautiful blood color, corresponding to its traditional use as a “blood puri- fier.” • Lobelia inflata (lobelia): its flowers are shaped like a stomach, cor- responding to its emetic qualities. • Hydrastis canadensis (goldenseal): its yellow-green root signifies its use in jaundice as well as infectious processes. All of these uses have been confirmed by recent research.

## Materia Medicas

With the development of written language, materia medicas (books containing prescribing information on herbs) became the vehicle of passing information about the medicinal use of herbs to future herbal- ists. Materia medicas were recorded in ancient China, Babylon, Egypt, India, Greece, and other parts of the world. From these materia med- icas, it is quite obvious that herbal medicines were highly respected therapies in ancient times.

<!-- chunk -->

## Galen’s Influence

No system, rules, or classification of Western herbal materia medicas existed until the first century ad, when Galen, the Greek physician who founded experimental physiology, established his system of rules and classification. Galen’s classification was based on Hippocratic medi- cine (i.e., balance of the four humors: blood, yellow and black bile, and phlegm) and a profound belief in a beneficent nature. Although his system is considered seriously flawed in the light of modern medical knowledge, Galen is historically considered to be the founder of sci- entific herbalism. Galen evaluated and classified each plant according to its relation to Hippocratic medical theory. Although based initially in Hippocratic principles, Galen constructed his own elaborate, and rigid, system of medicine. Galen’s work also signified the beginning of a clear division between the professional physician and the traditional healer. Because only the well educated could understand Galen’s system, and even with the best schooling it remained a mystery to many, all challenges to the professional physician were effectively squelched by dogma. Galen’s system dominated European medical thinking for years. Perhaps if the Roman Empire had continued to flourish, others would have surfaced to develop alternative theories. Instead, Galenical medicine reigned unchallenged throughout the Middle Ages. By the 19th century, the “professional” physician, confident in his supposedly superior knowledge, took Galenical philosophy to an extreme proba- bly never imagined by Galen, by the adoption of bloodletting, purging, and administering exotic medicines. This was in direct contrast to the traditional healer’s patient use of traditional herbs and tremendous faith in the healing power of nature.

## The Black Plague and Syphilis

Although Galenical medicine dominated the Middle Ages, herbal med- icine was still deeply entrenched in European culture. The Black Plague of 1348 may have been the beginning of a change in medical thought because conventional medicine was totally useless. As nearly one third of Europeans died during this plague, the public began to lose faith in Galenical medicine. Nearly 150 years later, another blow was dealt to Galenical medicine, when syphilis became the major medical problem. Unlike the Black Death, patients with syphilis tended to survive lon- ger, giving physicians more time to experiment with treatments. At this time, perhaps the greatest hoax in the history of medicine began. Mercury became the standard medical treatment for syphilis despite the fact that even Galen thought mercury too poisonous to use. Syphilis did, however, open the door for the use of some new herbs from the Americas. A French physician, Nicholas Monardes, pub- lished a comprehensive account of sarsaparilla and several other “new” drugs in the treatment of syphilis in 1574. Many Europeans at the time believed that syphilis had come to Europe from the West Indies with Columbus’s sailors, and because there was a general belief that what- ever disease was native to a country might be cured by the medicinal

## 267CHAPTER 34 Botanical Medicine—A Modern Perspective

herbs growing in that region, it was only natural for sarsaparilla to become a popular remedy. Because the standard treatment for syph- ilis was the use of mercury, which often resulted in greater morbidity than did syphilis, sarsaparilla was a welcome alternative. Despite initial excitement, Monardes’s sarsaparilla cure eventually lost favor, prob- ably due to other components in the cure; specifically, patients were confined to a warm room for 30 days and for the following 40 days were required to abstain from both wine and sexual intercourse. Although the public popularity of sarsaparilla waned, it continued to be used in the treatment of syphilis. During military operations in Portugal in 1812, a British Inspector General of Hospitals noted that the Portuguese soldiers suffering from syphilis who used sarsaparilla recovered much faster and more completely than their British coun- terparts who were treated with mercury. Sarsaparilla was also used by the Chinese in the treatment of syph- ilis. Later clinical observations in China would demonstrate, through the use of blood tests, that sarsaparilla is effective in about 90% of cases of acute syphilis and 50% of cases of chronic syphilis. Although sarsaparilla was clearly more beneficial than mercury in the treatment of syphilis, mercury was the standard medical treatment of choice for more than four and a half centuries. Some historians have stated that “the use of mercury in the treatment of syphilis may have been the most colossal hoax ever perpetrated” in the history of medicine. Mercury represented a new kind of medicine, one formulated and prepared in a lab- oratory using the new techniques of chemistry. It helped prepare the way for future synthetic and mineral drugs at the expense of herbal medicines.

## Challenges to Galenical Medicine

The 1500s also saw a strong challenge to Galenical medicine from within the traditional circles. Specifically, Paracelsus, an alchemist who believed strongly in the doctrine of signatures, was responsible for founding modern pharmaceutical medicine. Paracelsus is proba- bly most remembered for the development of laudanum (tincture of opium). After Paracelsus, Galenical preparations and treatments fell greatly out of favor. In public circles, herbal medicine was regaining some respect as well. In the early 1600s, Culpepper, an English pharmacist, published his book The English Physician. Instead of requiring patients to pur- chase expensive exotic or imported drugs, Culpepper recommended the herbs his clients and readers had growing in their own backyards. Although Culpepper’s herbal philosophy is based on astrological ratio- nalizations, it reinforced a strong English tradition of domestic herbal medicine. This came at a time when professional physicians were beginning to become contemptuous of herbal medicine. Meanwhile, in the Americas during the 1600s and 1700s, herbs used traditionally by Native Americans were becoming quite popular, espe- cially in the treatment of malaria and scurvy. Herbal medicine con- tinued to gain even greater respect in the late 1700s, as exemplified by English physician Withering’s classic description of digitalis. However, mercury, bleeding, and purging were still the “standard” medical treat- ments, epitomized by George Washington’s death from complications incurred during treatment of a sore throat (i.e., he was bled to death).

## The Thomsonian and Eclectic Movements

During the early 1800s, standard medicine may have been ready to reconsider traditional herbal remedies, but then came the Thomsonian movement. Samuel Thomson (1769 to 1843) patented a system of herbal medicine that, in 1839, claimed more than 3 million faithful followers. Although Thomson brought back to medicine the vitalistic Hippocratic idea of vis medicatrix naturae and gained widespread pub- lic support for the use of herbal medicine, the Thomsonian movement was probably detrimental to medical reform. Thomsonians became locked in prejudice and dogma and insisted that all medical knowledge was complete and could be found in Thomson’s works. These and other claims roused scorn, indignation, rage, and resentment in the average North American doctor. Frequently based on purging through the use of herbal emetics, Thomson’s treat- ments were often as harsh as the standard treatments of the times (for further discussion, see Chapter 4). During the 1800s, the eclectic movement attempted to bridge the gaps among standard medical thought, Thomsonianism, and tradi- tional herbal medicines. Rather than attack the existing medical sys- tem, the eclectic movement sought to bring about reform by educating physicians about the use of herbal medicines. Several eclectic medical colleges were established, and for a while it appeared that the eclectic movement was making headway in its attempt to reform the medical system from within. The movement eventually failed, however. Several factors were probably responsible for this: a split in the ranks, which diluted the movement; harsh measures like mercury, calomel, and bloodletting were finally discarded by the conventional professional physician, due to a decrease in infectious disease as a result of improved sanitation and hygiene; and perhaps most important, the failure to establish and sustain quality medical schools. The Flexner report on medical education in 1910 spelled doom for the eclectics; by 1920, seven of the eight schools that had existed before the report closed, with the last school closing in 1938. Meanwhile, the standard medical schools, aided by the Rockefeller Foundation, flour- ished, promoting the growth of the modern pharmaceutical industry and the current near-monopoly of the medical profession.

## The Growth of the Pharmaceutical Industry

Because a plant cannot be patented, little research was done before the latter part of the 20th century. Instead, pharmaceutical firms and researchers screened plants for biological activity, and then the so-called active constituents were isolated and chemically modified to produce unique, patentable compounds. Much to the dismay of the researchers was the discovery that in many instances, the isolated con- stituents were less biologically active than the crude herb. Because the crude herb provided no economic reward to the American pharma- ceutical firm, the crude herb or extract never reached the marketplace. In contrast, European policies on herbal medicines made it economi- cally feasible for companies to research and develop phytopharmaceu- ticals. The policies in the United States contributed to the tremendous growth of the pharmaceutical industry and loss of appreciation and respect for herbal medicine. The herbal industry further compounded the problem by failing to provide quality herbal products or take advantage of technological advances that allowed for the standardization of chemical constituents. The herb that best exemplifies the failure to adopt standardization techniques is digitalis. One batch of crude digitalis might have a low level of active constituents, making the crude herb ineffective, whereas the next batch might be unusually high in active constituents, result- ing in toxicity or even death when standard amounts are used. The lack of standardization made it easier for U.S. pharmaceutical firms to rationalize their economic need to isolate, purify, and chemically modify the active constituents of digitalis so they could market these compounds as drugs. The problem with using the pure active constit- uent is that the safe dosage range is smaller: digitalis toxicity and death have increased dramatically as a result of purification. Toxicity was less of a factor when using the crude herb because overconsumption of potentially toxic doses resulted in vomiting or diarrhea, thus avoiding the severe heart disturbance and death that now occur with pure digi- talis cardiac glycoside drugs.

## 268SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

Fortunately, several European and Asian pharmaceutical firms began specializing in phytopharmaceuticals in the latter half of the 20th century. These companies have played a prominent role in researching, developing, and promoting herbal medicines. Research is demonstrating that crude extracts often have greater therapeutic benefit than the isolated “active” constituent. This occur- rence has been long known in other parts of the world, but in this country, isolated plant drugs are still thought of as having the greatest therapeutic effect. This myth is gradually being eroded as our knowl- edge of herbal medicines increases. If current standardization techniques had been available earlier in this century, it is possible that many current prescription drugs would be herbal extracts instead of isolated and modified active constituents or synthetic chemicals.

## The American Botanical Council

One of the critical entities in promoting the responsible use of botan- ical medicine in the United States has been the American Botanical Council (ABC), an independent, nonprofit research and education organization dedicated to providing accurate and reliable informa- tion on botanical medicine for consumers, health care practitioners, researchers, educators, industry, and the media. Founded by Mark Blumenthal in 1988, the ABC has a robust website and publishes HerbalGram, a peer-reviewed quarterly journal, along with providing other useful publications and services. For example, Blumenthal and the ABC were largely responsible for translating the entire Commission E monographs into English, and the complete expanded version is now provided on the ABC website.8 ABC is also the publisher of four books, including The ABC Clinical Guide to Herbs, a continuing education and reference book, which contains extensive monographs on the safety and efficacy of 30 popular herbs. In addition, the ABC provides proactive, science-based informa- tion about herbal medicine to the media through its Media Education program. The ABC also provides an internship program for students of pharmacy and dietetics, as well as other training and certification programs. For more information, go to http://www.herbalgram.org.

## American Herbal Pharmacopoeia

The American Herbal Pharmacopoeia (AHP) was founded in 1995 by herbalist Roy Upton, with unrestricted funding initially provided by Planetary Herbals and now by many organizations. The AHP produces critically reviewed and scientifically validated monographs that pro- vide an internationally recognized standard for herbal medicine iden- tification, adulteration recognition, extraction, and quality control. These standards help ensure the identity, purity, and quality of botan- ical raw materials and manufactured products. Each monograph also presents a complete and critical review of the traditional and scientific literature regarding the efficacy and safety of herbal medicines. More information can be found at http://www.herbal-ahp.org.

# FINAL COMMENTS

Although the future looks extremely promising for herbal medicine, its growth and continued success will ultimately be determined by the following: • Continued scientific investigation and clinical research • Adoption of recognized standards of quality by manufacturers • Governmental regulations that allow meaningful therapeutic and health claims

samples.11 Included in the meconium toxicant assays were organo- phosphate pesticide (OP) metabolites that were not looked for in the EWG cord blood study. This is quite a load for each child to start out with, especially because the liver, brain, and endocrine and immune systems are all still developing, and many of these compounds are toxic to those tissues. Table 35.3 shows a typical report from the CDC. As can be seen, the body load of this common metabolite of neurotoxic OPs has been increasing relentlessly in the general population.12

<!-- chunk -->

## Other Factors Affecting Clinical Impact of Total Load

EM physicians also consider many other factors besides toxicant levels as part of the total load on an individual. Many of these factors will negatively affect the ability of the body to clear these toxicants from the blood or the tissue or to protect itself from the damage caused by these compounds. Such factors include the following:

<!-- chunk -->

## • Genetics. Polymorphisms in liver Phase I and Phase II biotransfor-

mation enzymes can reduce the ability of the body to metabolize xenobiotic toxicants.13

<!-- chunk -->

## • Nutrient deficiencies. Deficiencies of nutrients needed for bio-

transformation (Phases I and II), excretion (Phase III), and pro- tection against toxicant damage can result in reduced clearance and increased oxidative damage.14

<!-- chunk -->

## • Dietary choices. The amounts and ratios of proteins, fats, and car-

bohydrates can either enhance or inhibit the clearance of toxicants from the bloodstream.15

<!-- chunk -->

## • Emotional/mental/spiritual stressors. Stresses from family, jobs,

society, relationships, and other sources can directly affect health, toxin clearance, and clinical reaction to environmental toxicants.16

<!-- chunk -->

## • Lifestyle. Daily choices can have a direct bearing on pollutant

exposures and how well the body responds to its toxic burden. This includes the amount of sleep, exercise, and leisure time one gets.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Overall health and wellness.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Infections, disease, organ function. The health of organs, tissues,

and cells has a profound influence on the ability to clear toxicants efficiently17 and to resist toxic damage. The presence of pathogenic organisms that release their own toxins can be a decisive contribu- tor to the total load.

## • Microbiome. Especially if endotoxicity is present.

## • Electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure.

## Sources of Environmental Toxins

• Maternal-fetal transfer • Air, indoor and outdoor • Food • Personal care products • Water In the previous section, the EWG newborn study10 highlighted the fact that mothers unwittingly pass a host of toxic compounds to their children during gestation. After birth, the toxic exposures primarily come from indoor air (especially in one’s residence) and the food that is consumed. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency did a num- ber of total exposure assessment methodology studies in the 1980s,

which showed that indoor air typically contained higher levels of envi- ronmental chemicals than outdoor air (even in towns with multiple chemical plants). The majority of compounds found in the indoor air were solvents from smoking, dry-cleaned clothes, home furnishings, and home cleaning agents. Pesticide use in the home and garden is also a contributing factor to the burden of pollutants in indoor air and dust.18,19 Food is the other route through which the majority of our xenobi- otic load is delivered. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has an ongoing Total Diet Study that measures a set list of foods for a variety of environmental contaminants, including heavy metals and plasticizer compounds.20 The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has also been doing an ongoing measurement of pesticide residues on the most commonly consumed fruits and vegetables.21 The data published in this USDA report form the basis for the “dirty dozen” list of the most toxic fruits and vegetables, which are pub- lished on the web by the EWG.22 This listing gives the consumer information on how to avoid produce containing high levels of agri- cultural chemicals. High levels of glyphosate residues are found in all Roundup Ready soybeans, whereas no residue was found in organically raised soy- beans.23 All soy protein isolates from genetically modified (GM) soy contained residues of glyphosate and its metabolite in levels up to 2.7 ug/g.24 Fortunately, no residues were found in soy milk or soybean oil, nor were any found in corn oil, cow’s milk, whole-milk powder, or breast milk. However, glyphosate residues have been found in wheat.25 High-molecular-weight phthalates (plasticizers) contaminate food based on the length of time food is stored in plastic wrapping, the fat content of the food, and whether or not heat is involved. Microwaving foods in plastic wrap increases phthalate migration.26 Levels of plasticiz- ers are high in store-wrapped meat, poultry, fish, and cheese, with cheese having the highest level of plasticizers. This is most likely due to the fat content of each of these foods. Contrary to an ongoing Internet myth, freezing food in plastic containers does not increase plastic levels in the food. Plastic levels in unheated plastic-wrapped foods only increased in those foods after they were heated.27 Exposure to low-molecular-weight phthalates, however, comes primarily from fragrances and other per- sonal care products.28 On average, the consumption of one canned food item daily increased urinary bisphenol A (BPA) by 24%, and consum- ing two items increased urinary BPA by 54%.29 However, not all canned foods increased urinary BPA to the same degree. Consumption of one canned soup increased urinary levels by 229%, canned pasta by 70%, and canned fruits and vegetables by 41%. Consuming one can of soup daily for 5 days has been shown to increase urinary BPA levels by more than 1000%.30 Data from NHANES 2005–2006 revealed that drinking soda pop and consuming school lunches and meals prepared outside of the home were the most significant sources of BPA.31 Butter has been used as a sampling agent to assess the regional and global distribution of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other per- sistent organic pollutants (POPs) around the globe. When butter was sampled for these compounds, the highest levels of PCBs were found in butter from Europe and North America.32 For individuals living in North America, the greatest source of PCB exposure came from butter and fish.33 Sardines have the highest concentration of the highly toxic PCBs 138, 153, and 180, followed closely by farmed salmon and then hamburger.34 In the 2004–2005 FDA Total Diet Study, 100% of the salmon samples were found to contain PCBs and dichlorodiphenyldichlo- roethylene (DDE). Currently 50% of world fish consumption comes from aquaculture,35 and two thirds of all salmon consumed in North America is farmed.36 Farmed salmon is estimated to be responsi- ble for 97% of dietary POP exposure.37 POP levels were assessed in 700+ salmon (totaling approximately 2 metric tons of farmed and wild salmon) from around the globe.38 Fourteen persistent chlori- nated compounds were found in significantly higher levels in farmed salmon than in wild salmon. The only compound that did not reach statistical significance was lindane, which was still higher in farmed versus wild salmon. The four compounds with the greatest differ- ences were PCBs, dioxins, Toxaphene, and dieldrin. The PCB con- tent in farmed salmon averaged 42.5 ng/g, whereas the wild Alaskan salmon averaged only 3.2 ng/g. Fish samples from farms off the coast of Washington State and Chile had lower PCB concentrations than salmon farmed by Scotland and the Faroe Islands. POP levels in the fish samples paralleled the POP levels in the fish pellets used in those areas.39 Another study revealed the average PCB content in farm- raised Atlantic Salmon to be 28 to 38 ng/g, whereas total PCB content in wild Alaskan salmon averaged 2.8 to 13.7 ng/g.40 The PCBs found in Atlantic salmon, dominated by highly toxic PCBs 138, 153, and 180, are different from those in Alaskan salmon, which have fewer chlorine molecules, have greater water solubility, and are far less toxic to humans. Some changes have been made to the fish pellets that are fed to farmed salmon, resulting in a decrease in some of the POPs present in the fish.41 Unfortunately, the levels of PCBs 135, 153, and 180 have remained about the same. Farmed shrimp and tilapia, along with cod, are relatively free of the POPs found in farmed salmon, pro- viding less toxic fish alternatives. Lead and arsenic are common water contaminants that vary by geographical area as well as the age of the water pipes and the type of disinfection used. Many areas, including much of the United States, have high levels of inorganic arsenic in the groundwater (Fig. 35.1).42 Other commonly found water pollutants are the gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE),43,44 hexavalent chromium,45,46 per- chlorate (rocket fuel),47 perfluorocarbons (in areas where industry is using perfluorinated compounds [PFCs]),48,49 and trichloroeth- ylene (TCE),50 along with fluoride,51 trihalomethanes,52 pesticides, solvents,53 other industrial chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.54–56 In contrast, commonly used personal care products contain low-molecu- lar-weight phthalates57 and parabens.58

# ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS

Numerous studies have been published on the adverse health effects of individual xenobiotic pollutants. Although the areas of impact cover all the systems in the body, this chapter focuses on the documented immu- notoxic, neurotoxic, and endocrinotoxic effects of these chemicals.

## Immunotoxicity

Of the three major systems affected by xenobiotic burden (immune, neurological, and endocrine), the signs and symptoms of immunotox- icity are very often the first to occur in a patient’s history. The classic picture of immunotoxicity is reduced cell-mediated immunity lead- ing to chronic infections (reduced Th1 function), allergies and asthma (increased Th2 function), chemical sensitivity, and autoimmunity (overactive Th2 or Th17 activity).59 The first manifestation of immu- notoxicity often seen in a case history is the development of asthma and allergies. Multiple environmental toxicants are associated with increased incidences of allergic reactivity to the environment and to foods (Table 35.4). The chemicals that lead the way in causing atopic reactions include both OPs and chlorinated pesticides, solvents, and combustion by-products, including tobacco smoke and diesel exhaust.

## Cell-Mediated Immune Dysfunction

responses. DDE (the main metabolite of dichlorodiphenyltrichlo- roethane [DDT]) causes apoptosis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, resulting in fewer macrophages roaming the body to phagocytize invading pathogens and trigger an immune response.83,84 Mercury, another commonly found xenobiotic, also increases apoptosis of both monocytes and lymphocytes and reduces the phagocytic ability of the monocytes. It has been demonstrated that workers occupa- tionally exposed to mercury vapor exhibited a diminished capacity to produce both tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF- α ) and interleukin-1.85 The chemicals produced by combustion, polyaromatic hydrocar- bons (PAHs), have been shown to have similar depressing effects on the immune system, including decreased T-cell–dependent antibody response, decreased splenic activity, diminished T-cell effector func- tions, and suppression of T-cell cytotoxic induction, and they lower the activity of natural killer (NK) cells.86 PAH exposure results in impaired systemic immunity and increased risk of allergy in humans.87 The OPs, which are not as biologically persistent as chlorinated pesti- cides, are also toxic to the immune system. They have been found to cause decreased percentages of CD4 and CD5 cells, increased num- bers and percentages of CD26 cells, increased incidence of atopy and antibiotic sensitivity, and high rates of autoimmunity. This elevation in autoimmunity is reflected by high levels of antibodies to smooth muscle, parietal cells, brush border, thyroid, and myelin and elevated antinuclear antibody (ANA).88

continue to be exposed to vehicular exhaust, their risk of developing food allergies by age 4 increases by 230%, far higher than their risk of having pollen allergies by that age (83% increase).90 Multiple studies have demonstrated a clear association between vehicular exhaust and asthma in both children and adults.91–93 Children living in areas with denser traffic were 250% more likely to present to a local emergency department with asthma.94 The spikes of asthmatic symptoms in chil- dren rise with daily spikes of vehicular pollution and can persist for up to 2 days after a spike.95 When exposure to high traffic was combined with mycotoxin (mold contamination) exposure in the home, the risk for asthma went from a 75% increase to 5.85-fold increase.96 Diesel vehicles, which are most closely associated with these immu- nological effects, comprised 70% of all new vehicle sales in France and 50% in the rest of Europe in 2010.97 In the United States, the sale of diesel vehicles increased by almost 40% in 2010 alone. Diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) interfere with immune system regulation by suppressing nuclear factor kappa B (NF- κ B), reducing NF- κ B cyto- kine production.98 DEPs reduce levels of the antiviral cytokine inter- feron-gamma (IFN- γ ) and IFN- γ mRNA more potently than either dexamethasone or cyclosporine A.99 DEP also dramatically dimin- ishes NK cell function in human volunteers.100,101 This reduction of Th1 function, resulting in diminished cell-mediated immunity, is the likely cause for DEP exposure also increasing the rates of respiratory infections.102–105 DEP exposure in animals results in increased allergen-specific Th2/ TH17 cells in the lungs, which enhances allergic reactivity. Not sur- prisingly, when mice were exposed to egg albumin after DEP expo- sure, they produced more immunoglobulin E (IgE) to ovalbumin than mice that were not exposed to DEP.106 In atopic individuals with null GSTT1 genotypes, DEP exposure resulted in even higher interleukin (IL)-5 production.107 Other studies have confirmed the increase in Th2 cytokine production after DEP exposure and have shown that this exposure leads to increased reactivity to ragweed,108 cedar pollen,109 birch pollen,110 and egg protein.111 Simultaneous exposure to DEP and allergens leads to a more rapid development of allergic reactivity to those allergens than would occur without DEP presence.112

## Autoimmunity

In the past 30 years, the incidence and prevalence of autoimmune dis- eases have been steadily rising.113 Currently, rheumatic, endocrine, gastrointestinal, and neurological autoimmune diseases are increas- ing annually at a rate of 7.1%, 6.3%, 6.2%, and 3.7%, respectively. Comparing old rates with current rates, the greatest jumps are found in celiac disease, diabetes 1, and myasthenia gravis. These increases in autoimmunity have been linked to common environmental pol- lutants. The notion of chemically induced autoimmune states is, of course, not new because many chemicals are known to induce the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus. Some chemicals, like formalde- hyde and other volatile organic compounds, may induce tissue-specific autoimmune reactions by acting as haptens.114 These low-molecu- lar-weight molecules bind to various tissues in the body, making a new antigenic combination. But the elevation of Th2 and Th17 cytokine pictures secondary to pollutant exposure is the clearest pathway for these autoimmune problems. Autoimmunity highlighted by connec- tive tissue destruction is associated with an increased Th17 immune response. Published research has already shown that particulate mat- ter, diesel exhaust, BPA, trichloroethylene, cigarette smoke, PCBs, and paraquat have been linked to conditions of increased Th17. Most of those have also been clearly linked to increased rates of autoimmune disorders. Although the findings have not yet been associated with increasing Th17 levels, women in the NHANES 1999–2004 study with the highest versus lowest levels of hair and blood mercury were either 410% or 232% more likely to have elevated ANA levels, respectively.115 Individuals with higher levels of mercury exposure are also more likely to have elevated ANA levels.116,117 In the 2003–2004 NHANES, those persons with the highest levels of PCBs were over four times more likely to have elevated ANA levels than those with a lower PCB burden.118 Twelve persons who were residentially exposed to the chlorpyrifos were found to have elevated antibody levels between 1 and 4.5 years after the exposure occurred.119 The most common autoimmune anti- bodies found were anti–smooth muscle, causing autoimmune hepati- tis (odds ratio [OR] 3.99), and anti–parietal cell, leading to diminished hydrochloric acid production (OR 9.7), along with antithyroid and antimyelin antibodies. Animals exposed simultaneously to mercury and trichloroethylene developed autoimmune hepatitis, whereas those exposed to only one of those two compounds for 8 weeks failed to show this pathology.120 Four groups of patients with long-term form- aldehyde exposure (mobile home dwellers, office workers in closed buildings, persons who had been removed from their formaldehyde exposure for 1 year, and persons with occupational exposure) demon- strated similar autoantibody production.121 Mobile home dwellers had a 144-fold higher risk of having anti–parietal cell antibodies than nonmobile home dwellers, whereas office workers were 40.5-fold more likely to have anti–parietal cell antibodies. Levels of anti–smooth mus- cle, antimitochondrial, and anti–brush border were also higher in those with formaldehyde exposure. Elevated levels of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 -containing traffic-re- lated air pollution have been associated with circulating levels of anti- dsDNA, a classic marker for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).122 Persons exposed to higher levels of PM 2.5 in Quebec were more likely to have SLE or one of the other autoimmune connective tissue disor- ders (Sjogren’s syndrome, scleroderma, polymyositis, or dermatomyo- sitis).123 PM 10 , NO 2 , and CO have all been shown to be risk factors for juvenile-onset SLE, with each increase of 13.4 ug/m3 in PM 10 increas- ing disease risk by 34%.124

## Chemical Sensitivity

Chemical sensitivity (CS), also termed multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), idiopathic environmental intolerance (IEI),125 and toxicant-in- duced loss of tolerance (TILT),126,127 is a modern medical phenome- non that is now present in up to 30% of the population.128 Individuals with CS experience adverse physical, mental, or emotional symptoms after being exposed to ambient levels of common environmental chemicals. Individuals with chemical sensitivity often show the same cytokine imbalances already discussed in this section.129 However, CS may not be a manifestation of only immunotoxicity—there is also evi- dence of limbic kindling or neural sensitization in persons with this problem.130,131

## Neurotoxicity

The neurological system is also a frequent target for xenobiotic com- pounds. Some patients will present primarily with neurotoxicity symp- toms, whereas others may exhibit immunotoxicity signs and symptoms first. The most common neurotoxicity symptoms include reduced cog- nitive functioning (often referred to by the patient as “brain fog” or “crooked brain”), headache, memory problems, and mood disorders. Tremors, balance problems, and anxiety can also be present (Box 35.1). The nervous system is a unique target for toxic agents in several ways: 1. The adult neuron does not divide, and therefore, replacement of lost neurons is not possible. Nerve cells killed by toxins cannot regenerate. 2. The blood–brain barrier does not block nonpolar substances or items that are actively transported.

<!-- chunk -->

## 275CHAPTER 35 Environmental Medicine

3. Because the normal function of the nervous system requires the action of a complex, integrated network, damage to even a small portion of the nervous system sometimes can result in marked effects on function. 4. Neurons are dependent on glucose and oxygen, and some cell bod- ies exist at borderline levels of oxygen. If high energy demands are placed on the system and the delivery of oxygen is reduced, then cell death may occur. 5. Because of the high lipid content (myelin), there is an accumulation and storage of lipophilic xenobiotics. 6. Neurons have high surface areas and, therefore, increased exposure to toxic compounds. 7. Neuroinflammation is fairly easy to start and very difficult to allevi- ate. Unfortunately, a great many of the common toxic xenobiotics in our bodies are potent neurotoxins. All of the major classes of pesti- cides kill pests by virtue of their neurotoxic actions. Chlorinated pes- ticides and pyrethroids disrupt the ion flow along the axon, whereas OPs (developed in Germany between the First and Second World Wars for use in warfare132) and carbamates are potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (resulting in excessive acetylcholine levels in the synaptic clefts). Solvents, some of which were originally used as anesthetics, dampen the propagation and transmission of electrical impulses along the nerve axons. All of these agents produce various forms of toxic encephalopathy (acute or chronic, selective, or diffuse toxic enceph- alopathies). Many environmentally ill patients present to their physi- cians with chief complaints that fit this diagnostic category. Other common pollutants are indirect neurotoxins and affect the neurological system adversely by causing neuroinflammation, result- ing in cognitive decline, mood imbalances, pain disorders, and chronic neurological diseases.

## Pesticide Neurotoxicity

## Organophosphates. The average clinician will rarely see an

individual with acute organophosphate poisoning. Instead, they will see persons presenting with depression, headache, fatigue, cognitive issues, and other problems that could tend to be attributed to other issues of aging. The following OP worker studies highlight these problems. Greenhouse workers who were exposed to OPs exhibited higher incidences of depression, headache, tremors, and paresthesias.133 Polish female greenhouse workers exposed to OPs exhibited longer reaction time and reduced motor steadiness than unexposed work- ers. They also reported increased tension, depression, and fatigue more often than controls.134 Dutch farmers and gardeners who used OPs frequently had a much higher risk of developing mild cognitive dysfunction than others.135 Farmers repeatedly exposed to OPs from sheep dip showed much greater vulnerability to psychiatric disorders than controls (quarry workers). They also performed worse than con- trols on cognitive testing that assessed attention span and how fast they processed information.136 None of the persons in any of these studies fit the definition of acute OP poisoning as set by the field of toxicology, including no evidence of low acetylcholinesterase levels. A study of persons previously poisoned by OPs revealed that OP-induced neurotoxicity can persist after the incident, manifesting as problems with memory, abstraction, intellectual functioning, mood, and motor reflexes. They also had greater distress and complaints of disability.137

## Chlorinated pesticides. The use of chlorinated pesticides was

almost completely banned in the United States by the 1980s, and thus the symptomatic picture of acute organochlorine poisoning is rarely seen. Instead, low-level organochlorine neurotoxicity presents with generalized neurological dysfunction very similar to what is found with OPs. Early controlled trials of airborne exposure to low levels of DDT revealed that exposed subjects would experience neurological symp- toms, including dimming of vision, a drawing sensation at the base of the nose or behind the eyes, a sense of fullness deep inside the skull, headache, slowness of thought, inability to concentrate, and short- term memory loss.138 Various muscle symptoms also occurred, includ- ing weakness, fatigue, dysphagia, and ataxia. A study of retired malaria control workers and non-DDT-exposed controls revealed that the exposed group had significantly poorer performance on cognitive, sensory, and motor testing that persisted long after exposure ended.139 They did particularly poorly on the cog- nitive testing (verbal attention, visuomotor speed, and sequencing) and reported significantly more psychiatric symptoms than controls reported. Additionally, children who were exposed to “background, low-level concentrations” of DDT while in utero revealed decreases of up to 7.86 (standard error, 3.21) points in the verbal scale and 10.86 (standard error, 4.33) points in the memory scale compared with chil- dren whose concentrations were <0.05 ng/mL.140 The neurological effects of chlordane exposure were studied in a group of persons who lived in an apartment complex where chlor- dane was used. Seven years after the application occurred, residents and former residents of the complex were assessed with neuropsychi- atric testing.141 Significant changes were found in the exposed per- sons, including reduced reaction time; balance dysfunction (shown by increased sway speed); and reductions in cognitive function, percep- tual motor speed, and immediate and delayed verbal recall. They also had worse scores for mood, including increased tension, depression, anger, and fatigue.

## Solvents. Chronic toxic encephalopathy (CTE) from solvent

exposure will often gradually improve in 50% of cases with the elimination of solvent exposure (Box 35.2). However, 50% will not improve from mere avoidance in the time frame of 6 to 42 months after initial assessment, far longer than the clearance of solvents would suggest. It is interesting to note that in one study, persons on

## 276SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

antidepressants were nearly four times more likely to have persistent solvent-induced CTE than those not on the medications.142 Although the study failed to list which antidepressants were used, many of the commonly used antidepressant medications are known inhibitors of the CYP system in the liver, thereby prolonging the half-life of xenobiotics. Workers with a genetic polymorphism affecting glutathione conjugation also had a dramatically increased risk for the development of CTE.143 White-collar employees with low-level toluene exposure have exhib- ited significant deficiencies in continuous performances tests and tests measuring processing speed and memory.144 Additionally, shipyard painters were found to have significantly higher scores for neurotic behaviors than controls.145 They were also found to have significantly greater problems with short-term memory, concentration, fatigue, diz- ziness, and insomnia and noted more trouble with a feeling of pressure in the chest and perspiration without work. One of the questions most frequently answered affirmatively by the group (in significantly higher levels than controls) was, “Do you often have to go back to check things that you have done, such as turned off the stove, locked the door, etc.?”146 Female workers exposed to toluene showed significantly more problems with manual dexterity, visual scanning, and verbal mem- ory.147 The authors of this study noted that the workers who exhibited these changes on neurobehavioral testing showed absolutely no clinical signs of toxicity!

## Heavy Metal Neurotoxicity

<!-- chunk -->

## Lead. Lead is a well-recognized neurotoxin that causes multiple

problems in exposed children, including reduced IQ scores148 and attention and behavioral problems.149 Parents of children with lead burdens have reported that their children experienced more somatic complaints and delinquent, aggressive, internalizing, and externalizing behavior.150 Their teachers have reported that the children had more problems with anxious/depressed behavior; social problems; attention problems; and delinquent, aggressive, internalizing, and externalizing behavior. Such findings contributed to the removal of lead from gasoline and paint in the United States in 1978. When persons who were exposed to lead in childhood were stud- ied 20 years later, neurological deficits were still found. In this group, significant adverse central and peripheral neurological effects were present. Peripheral nerve function was altered, as were measures of coordination, reaction time, dexterity, learning, and mood.151 When bone lead burden was measured in older individuals, none of whom had industrial exposures to lead, a clear association was correlated with mental function. As the total bone lead (measured by fluoros- copy of the tibia) increased, cognitive function decreased in a group of older individuals from Baltimore.152 The cumulative lifetime lead burden has been associated with increased risk for the development of parkinsonism.153,154 Even though blood lead levels (BLLs) have been steadily dropping in the past few decades, these lower lead levels are still associated with neurological deficits in children, leading some to propose that there is not a safe BLL. Approximately 7.4 IQ points were lost in children with a BLL of <10 ug/dL versus 4.6 IQ points in those with a per-unit increase in BLL of >10 ug/dL.155 The IQ losses in children with a BLL of <10 ug/dL were confirmed in a subsequent study of 6-year-old chil- dren156 and in children in seven international population studies.157 IQ loss with BLLs above 1.71 ug/dL has also been found in a study of Italian adolescents. In this study, a doubling of the BLL equated to a 2.4-pt reduction in IQ. The researchers stated that for each 0.19-ug/ dL increase in BLL, 1 IQ point was lost.158 In a North Carolina study, BLLs as low as 2 ug/dL were associated with poorer performance in the classroom for school-aged children.159

## Mercury-Induced Neurotoxicity. Mercury in both organic and

elemental forms is neurotoxic, and methylmercury (organic) is the most well-known neurotoxin. The widespread pollution of Minamata Bay, Japan, by methylmercury in the 1950s provided researchers with a clear picture of methylmercury poisoning through daily fish consumption. Known as Minamata disease, the neurotoxic signs included ataxia, speech impairment, constriction of visual fields, hypoesthesia, dysarthria, hearing impairment, and sensory disturbances. These neurological problems persisted and were found in other areas of Japan as the mercury contamination spread through fish consumption.160 Follow-up studies in the Minamata area almost 40 years after the spill and almost 30 years since a fishing ban was enacted for the area showed the persistence of mercury neurotoxicity. Male residents in fishing villages in the area in reported significantly higher prevalence than town-resident controls for the following complaints: stiffness, dysesthesia, hand tremor, dizziness, loss of pain sensation, cramping, atrophy of the upper arm musculature, arthralgia, insomnia, and lumbago. Female residents of the fishing villages had significantly higher incidents of complaints of leg tremor, tinnitus, loss of touch sensation, leg muscular atrophy, and muscular weakness.161 Fish-eating Amazonian children with hair mercury levels above mcg/g showed deficits in neuropsychological tests for motor function, attention, and visuospatial performance that correlated with their hair mercury concentrations.162 Patients in an internal medicine practice in San Francisco who consumed large fish regularly and had mercury blood levels above 5 mcg/L were most likely to present with fatigue, hair loss, trouble thinking, memory loss, muscle aches, headaches, and a metallic taste in the mouth.163 The majority of individuals who had their amalgam fillings removed noted psychological improvements, including a reduction in anger outbursts, depression, irritability, and fatigue.164

## Indirect Neurotoxicity—Neuroinflammation

All of the environmental pollutants have demonstrated powerful prooxidant activity; in addition, they deplete the levels of reduced glutathione in the brain tissue and inhibit the function of the antiox- idant enzymes. Neurons and their supporting glial cells are directly affected by this oxidative stress and diminished antioxidant pro- tective ability. Oxidative stress activates the glial cells, leading to increased production and release of the proinflammatory chemicals interleukin β (IL-1 β ), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10), IFN- γ , and TNF- α . The resulting neuroinflammation is a key component in the patho- biology of headaches and chronic pain,165 cognitive decline,166,167 mood disorders,168 traumatic brain injury,169 and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease,170 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),171 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),172 autism,173 Data from World Health Organization meeting on Organic Solvents, Copenhagen, Denmark, 1985.

## 277CHAPTER 35 Environmental Medicine

multiple sclerosis,174 bipolarity,175 seizures,176 and parkinsonism.177 Neuroinflammation has been shown to be present in parkinsonism and appears to be responsible for all the non–dopamine-depletion-re- lated manifestations.178 Neuroinflammation is triggered by traumatic brain injury,179 endo- toxicity (circulating levels of lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacterial cell walls),180 elevated blood sugar (glycation end prod- ucts),181 stress,182 and a host of environmental toxicants such as air pollutants,183 heavy metals,184 and OPs.185 Vehicular exhaust produces particulate matter in a range of sizes, all of which carry a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

## Endocrine Toxicity

The most common endocrine diagnoses associated with xenobiotic burden include the following: 1. Infertility (both male and female) 2. Low testosterone in males less than 55 years of age 3. Hypothyroidism (especially autoimmune) 4. Adult-onset diabetes 5. Obesity

## Infertility

## Herbicides and organophosphate pesticides. Ontario women

who used pesticides were 3.8-fold more likely to be infertile.186 Five compounds reduced females’ fecundity rates to between 24% and 49%: dicamba (0.51), glyphosate (0.61), 2,4-D (0.71), organophosphates (0.75), and thiocarbamates (0.76). Spanish greenhouse sprayers exposed to OPs had higher rates of spontaneous abortion rates, along with higher rates of depression and headaches.187 Although these health problems were clearly evident, no significant decrease in erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase was found. This reproduced the findings of other studies showing apparent adverse neurological organophosphate health effects without markers of acute OP toxicity. A study in California farming counties showed a clear association with pesticide spraying and fetal death due to congenital anomalies.188 In this study, when an OP or carbamate pesticide was sprayed in one of 8 adjacent square miles of women’s residences during the third to eighth week of pregnancy, the OR of fetal death was 1.4. When the spraying occurred within 1 square mile of a residence, the OR increased to 2.2.

## Chlorinated pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls.

Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) serum levels were significantly associated with miscarriage history and uterine fibroid presence among patients in a German reproductive clinic.189 Higher HCH and PCB levels were also noted more frequently in women with antithyroid and antinuclear antibodies. PCB exposure and elevated antithyroid antibodies have also been reported elsewhere.190 PCB serum levels were significantly associated with endometriosis, and increasing DDT levels with reduced conception. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) levels were also found to be associated with increased miscarriage rates and levels of ANA. A noncontrolled study in Canada looked for the presence of cer- tain xenobiotics in the serum and follicular fluid from infertile females and seminal plasma from their male partners.191 These 18 couples all attended an in vitro fertilization program in hopes of becoming par- ents. The researchers found DDE, mirex, HCH, trichlorobenzene, and three different PCBs in more than 50% of all follicular fluid samples. Four different PCBs, DDE, and endosulfan were also found in over 50% of all serum samples. DDE was the most frequently found con- taminant, had the highest residue, and was negatively associated with fertilization. Of the couples tested, those who failed to achieve preg- nancy with in vitro fertilization methods generally had higher toxic levels than successful couples. It is unfortunate that these authors did not get a matched control group of fertile couples to compare the toxic burden. In the same Canadian study, women with higher DDE levels had greater trouble conceiving. This finding was also noted in the pre- viously mentioned German study and was recently redocumented as a generational effect as well in a group of women from Oakland, California.192 In this study, serum levels of DDT/DDE were measured from maternal samples at the time of birth. The time it took their daughters to conceive was then followed for 28 to 31 years. Differing generational effects were found for both DDT and DDE. Maternal lev- els of DDT were associated with reduced fecundity (32% less) in their daughters, whereas DDE levels were associated with increased fecun- dity (16% greater).

## Solvents. Reduced fecundity has also been shown in female

toluene workers (fecundity rate [FR] 0.47) and in laboratory workers exposed to organic solvents (FR 0.79).193,194 Wives of men who worked around organic solvents also showed decreased fecundity (FR 0.36).195 Occupational exposure to organic solvents is associated with both longer time to pregnancy and increased risk for spontaneous abortion once conception occurs.196 Chinese female chemical plant workers exposed to organic solvents experienced a very high risk for spontaneous abortions (OR 2.9).197 Of the myriad of petrochemicals they were exposed to, benzene (OR 2.5), gasoline (OR 1.8), and hydrogen sulfide (OR 2.3) all showed independent significant association with miscarriages. Solvent-exposed pharmaceutical factory workers also showed increased spontaneous abortion risk from multiple solvent exposures that increased along with the number of solvents they were exposed to.198

## Air pollutants. Smoking more than 10 cigarettes daily has been

associated with reduced fertility in women (FR 0.66), with the OR for infertility being 1.64.199 Because tobacco smoke contains high benzene and styrene levels, along with heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, it is difficult to say which xenobiotic would have the greatest effect on fertility. Female smokers also experience higher rates of ectopic pregnancies and spontaneous abortions,200 along with greater rates of stillbirths (OR 2.0) and infant mortality (OR 1.8).201 Mothers who quit smoking in the first trimester showed the same rates of stillbirth and infant mortality as nonsmoking women. When Ireland banned smoking in the workplace, rates of preterm births dropped by 25%.202 Women living closest to busy roadways have slightly higher rates of infertility than those living further away.203,204 Brief exposure to ele- vated levels of PM 10 has been shown to increase the rates of miscarriage by up to 2.6 times.205 Mothers exposed to higher ambient air pollution were found to have significantly higher levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-DNA adducts in the white blood cells of their cord blood.206 The PAH-DNA adducts were also significantly higher in infertile men than in fertile men.

## Hypothyroidism

PCBs have been closely studied for their possible adverse effects on thy- roid hormonal status and function. Both PCBs and thyroxine are made of two connected benzene rings with attached halogens, with PCBs having chlorine molecules and thyroxine having iodine. Interestingly, the common human contaminant BPA is also structurally similar, with two bromine molecules on each of the rings. PCBs have demonstrated in vitro activity in binding transthyretin, a transport protein mecha- nism for thyroxine.207 POPs also appear to adversely affect the thyroid hormone–metabolizing enzymes (uridine-diphosphate-glucuronyl- transferases, iodothyronine deiodinases, and sulfotransferases) found in the liver and brain.208

## 278SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

Elevated levels of both antiperoxidase and antithyroglobu- lin were found in workers in a PCB manufacturing plant.209 This is reflective of the earlier noted study,188 in which PCBs and HCH were frequently found in infertile German women with antithyroid and antinuclear antibodies. Surprisingly, no difference was found in the levels of T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in these 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) workers versus the con- trol group. PCB serum levels of consumers of fish from the Baltic Sea were found to have a significant inverse correlation between PCB levels and TT3, along with a nonstatistically significant inverse correlation with TT4.210 German children showed a significant positive correla- tion between PCB serum levels and elevation of TSH,211 and they also exhibited a significant inverse correlation between serum PCB levels and FT4, as one would expect with increasing TSH levels. Chlorinated pesticides have also been associated with hypothyroid- ism. A study of Indian women looked for any association between DDT and dieldrin in women with elevated TSH and depleted T4. DDT was found to be higher in all of the hypothyroid women, although not sig- nificantly, but dieldrin was significantly associated with low T4 levels.212

## Adult-Onset Diabetes

The incidence of adult-onset diabetes has risen in the past decade at rates much higher than previously recorded.213 Although type 2 dia- betes mellitus (T2DM) has long been associated with a variety of life- style choices, new information is powerfully pointing to a number of common pollutants as major risk factors.214 Inorganic arsenic, natu- rally present in groundwater throughout the world, has been clearly linked to the development of T2DM, whereas arsenic from food-based sources has not.215,216 The presence of persistent organic pollutants has also been linked to the development of diabetes. The NHANES partic- ipants with the lowest levels of PCB 153 in their blood were 2.5 times more likely to develop diabetes than persons without PCB 153, whereas those individuals in the highest quartiles of this toxicant were 6.8 times more likely to have this disorder.217 The termiticides transnonachlor and oxychlordane each increased the risk of T2DM from 2.7-fold, for those with the lowest blood levels of these chlordane residues, to 11.8- and 6.5-fold, respectively, for those with the highest blood levels. When the sums of all six bioaccumulative toxins were combined, the odds of developing diabetes went from a low of fourteenfold to a high of 37.7-fold for those with the greatest fat-soluble burden. Evidence of the increased risk for T2DM from a variety of POPs continues to mount.218,219 Not all persons are living in areas with higher groundwater arsenic, and exposure to POPs is not as common as it was several decades ago. But all persons are exposed to various levels of air pollution, which is strongly associated with the development of both obesity and diabe- tes. Ambient nitrogen dioxide has been positively linked to reduced B-cell function and reduced insulin sensitivity in Latino youth living in Los Angeles, in whom it was also found to contribute to increased weight.220 Additionally, ambient levels of PM 2.5 have been positively associated with the incidence of T2DM.221,222 Urinary phthalate and BPA levels have also been associated with increased diabetes risk, although not all BPA studies demonstrate a significant risk.223–226 Urinary phthalate levels are also positively asso- ciated with increased weight and waist circumference.227,228

# ASSESSMENT

## History

A comprehensive history is the cornerstone of detecting xenobiotic-in- duced health problems. When taking a history, attention should be paid to both occupational and nonoccupational chemical exposures. Occupational exposures can be the ones the client is most aware of and should always be followed up with a request for the Material Safety Data Sheet on each chemical from the employer. Nonoccupational exposures are harder to document, but in a family practice they are often found to be the main culprit. Specific questions should be asked about the history of residences: where the patient lived, how new the structure is, age of carpeting, time of remodel, type of heating, use of indoor or outdoor pesticides, attached garage, and so forth. The pres- ence of environmentally induced illnesses will often become very clear when the clinician compares the chronological history of all the cli- ent’s health complaints with the client’s residential and occupational exposures. However, because of the ubiquitous nature of the chemicals in question, a history may not always give a clear picture of which chem- ical caused the illness in question.

<!-- chunk -->

## Laboratory Tests

Laboratory tests may be helpful in cases where the history is not. A standard complete blood count and general blood chemistry test is usually nonremarkable in cases of chronic low-level exposures (although Crinnion often finds leukopenia present in his population of toxic patients). In his patient population, the author (Crinnion) has rarely found elevated levels of liver enzymes, even when solvents and pesticides are present in the serum. This has also been reported in the literature with persons occupationally exposed to solvents.229 Serum tests for the most commonly found PCBs, chlorinated pes- ticides, and aromatic solvents are currently available. Urine assays for the metabolites of organophosphate pesticides, glyphosate (from Roundup), low- and high-molecular-weight phthalates, and other common chemical pollutants are also currently available to the clini- cian. The publication of the CDC’s national reports provides national reference values for many of these compounds that the clinician can use when interpreting the laboratory reports. For the biologically per- sistent PCBs and chlorinated pesticides, the CDC gives levels both in parts per billion and as lipid-adjusted (nanogram per gram lipid) values. These fat-soluble toxins are released from adipose tissue along with triglycerides and cholesterol.230 Previously published research actually found that quantifying the fat-soluble xenobiotics accord- ing to the amount of lipids in the blood corresponded well with the concentration of xenobiotics present in adipose biopsies of the same person.231 These findings are the reason why the CDC presented lip- id-adjusted levels for these specific POPs. Lipid-adjusted values offer a glimpse of the POP adipose burden and allow the clinician an opportu- nity to monitor the effectiveness of depuration treatments. Current OP exposure can be identified by the presence of OP metabolites in the urine. Similar testing can be done for phthalate (plasticizers) metabolites, BPA, and parabens. All of these compounds are nonpersistent, and their presence indicates regular, ongoing expo- sure. These tests can be highly useful in helping people attain a diet and lifestyle that are free from several serious toxic families. Heavy metals can be measured in the hair, blood, urine, and stool. Blood levels are mostly indicative of current exposure levels and are still considered by many physicians to be the only valid method of heavy-metal assessment. Unfortunately, the blood reference values for heavy metals are typically based on industrial medicine standards for toxicity in the workplace. Fortunately, the CDC national reports again provide the national normal ranges for most of the heavy metals in blood and in urine (given as microgram per liter and microgram per gram creatinine). A nonchallenged random or first-morning urine test will provide information on total body cadmium levels and current exposures to mercury, lead, and arsenic.232,233

<!-- chunk -->

## 279CHAPTER 35 Environmental Medicine

An estimation of the body burden of mercury and lead can be derived from a metal-mobilization test (MMT). MMTs use urine metal assess- ment before and after the administration of a metal-mobilizing agent. The total amount of metal in the pre- and postchallenge urine samples needs to be calculated as part of this method (ug/sample). Intravenous calcium edetate (CaEDTA) and oral 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) have both been used for lead-mobilization testing.234–238 DMPS has been used for mercury-mobilization testing, and DMSA can also be used.239

# TREATMENT

Effective treatment for chemically induced illnesses begins with avoid- ance of further exposures, which is the major step for all nonpersistent pollutants. Supplementation to support xenobiotic elimination and antioxidant protection is always beneficial. For persistent compounds, depuration techniques are necessary to reduce their body burden.

<!-- chunk -->

## Avoidance of Further Chemical Exposure

This step is critical, although it is often the most difficult step in terms of compliance. In cases of multiple chemical sensitivities, simply hav- ing a chemically safe dwelling can bring improvement.240 Compounds to be avoided include solvents, paints, exhaust fumes, perfumes, hair sprays, new furniture, carpeting, cabinetry, plastics, and gas or oil heat, among others. Because the home is the environment that is most in one’s control, the home must be made a “safe oasis.” If there are build- ing materials that are off-gassing chemicals and these materials cannot be removed, they should be sealed. There are a number of good books available to help with these issues.241 The single greatest source of solvent exposure in the home comes from smoking inside, which also provides combustion by-products, cancer-causing chemicals, and heavy metals. After smoking, the next greatest sources are carpeting, new cabinetry, and new paint. Cleaning supplies, including tile cleaners, perfumes, air fresheners, and the presence of dry-cleaned clothing, complete the rest of the top indoor polluters. Exposure to all of these can be reduced with simple lifestyle choices, such as the following: • Do not wear shoes indoors. • Replace furnace filters every 6 weeks with high-quality pleated fil- ters (rated minimum efficiency reporting value [MERV] 7–9). • Air out dry-cleaned clothing in the garage or car trunk for a week before bringing it into the house. • Do not smoke indoors. • Consider replacing carpet with tile or stone flooring. • Use nonscented laundry detergent and fabric softener. • Consider getting an air purifier that has both charcoal and high- efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters (e.g., IQAir and Blue Air). Make sure to get one with enough cubic feet of air purified each minute to clear the air in the bedroom at least once every 30 minutes. In addition to avoiding environmental chemicals, any foods that cause adverse reactions should be avoided (see Chapter 14 on food hypersensitivities). Organic foods should be chosen wherever possible, as well as purified water. Avoiding the “dirty dozen” fruits and vege- tables (www.foodnews.org), along with all farmed salmon, high-mer- cury fish, and nonorganic dairy products, will significantly reduce toxin exposures through the diet.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dietary Support

The best macrodiet choice (in addition to organic foods) is to consume a high-protein, low-carbohydrate, and low-fat diet. Such a diet helps Phase I biotransformation significantly.

<!-- chunk -->

## Protein

The metabolism of toxic chemicals and drugs has been shown to be impaired by protein deprivation. Increased toxicity of chemical compounds and drugs has been reported with protein deficiency. Protein deficiency decreases the activity of liver mixed-function oxi- dase (MFO) systems, which increases the half-life of numerous toxic chemicals and drugs and potentiates drug action and toxicity. The quantity and quality of protein in the diet alters both Phase I and Phase II reactions in drug metabolism (a gelatin diet induces very low MFO activity). The toxicity of organochlorinated compounds (OCCs), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, herbicides, and fungicides have all been shown to be increased severalfold by protein defi- ciency. Reduced clearance of antipyrine and increased half-life of antipyrine have been found in Asian vegetarians with low dietary protein intake. This was not found in white vegetarians with ade- quate protein intake. Although protein deficiency clearly reduces the ability of the body to adequately metabolize chemicals,242 the opposite also appears to be true. Isocalorically increasing the ratio of dietary protein to car- bohydrate ratio in well-nourished volunteers was shown to enhance the clearance of antipyrine and theophylline. Although it is not clear if the effect of the protein was due to the amino acid content alone, it is known that methionine and cysteine deficiency led to a reduc- tion of intestinal and hepatic Phase I enzyme activity. Hepatic Phase I activity can also be suppressed by folic acid and choline deficiency. Low methionine intake also affects selenium metabolism by making less selenium available for glutathione-peroxidase biosynthesis. High sugar intake is also known to reduce the clearance of certain chemicals from the liver.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fiber

Rice bran fiber (RBF), which can be found in a diet high in brown rice or using RBF as a fiber supplement, has been shown to have a high binding ability for PCBs and other toxins, including the combustion by-product benzo(a)pyrene, in a laboratory setting.243 When mea- sured against other fibers, RBF demonstrated the ability to dramat- ically reduce the reabsorption (termed “hepatic recycling”) of PCBs from the intestines in animals.244 Hepatic recycling occurs after the liver dumps some of these toxins into the intestines with bile, but when these compounds make it to the intestine, they are reabsorbed into the bloodstream and sent back to the liver—a process facilitated by low fiber and deconjugating bacteria in the gut. This recycling pat- tern is the main reason why such a minute amount of these toxicants actually makes it out of the body. Although RBF helps break this recy- cling and gets more toxic xenobiotics to leave, wheat bran showed absolutely no benefit in this regard.245 A study using either spinach fiber or RBF in PCB-exposed animals showed that RBF increased fecal PCB excretion by 6.6 times and spinach fiber by 4.1 times.246 In another animal study, 10% RBF in the diet increased the excretion of toxic furans by 4.5 times that of placebo.247 A study of PCB-burdened patients who consumed 7 to 10 g of a fermented RBF product (which is available as a food item in Japan) three times daily (after each meal) for a year found that they had twice the amount of dioxin excretion as controls.248 While bran fiber has shown many benefits, as much of rice is contaminated with arsenic. The prescriber must ensure the recommended product is not contaminated.

## Chlorophyll, Seaweed, Chlorella

Chlorophyll has long been thought of as a blood purifier, and recent studies have documented its effectiveness at helping clear POPs, but not toxic metals, from the body. As previously mentioned, both

## 280SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

chlorophyll-containing spinach fiber and matcha green tea increase the excretion of POPs. The seaweed nori, which also contains chlo- rophyll, was tested in rats to measure its power in helping clear diox- ins. Rats fed a diet of 10% nori had an increase in fecal excretion of two different dioxins at levels 5.5 and 6.0 times more than the control group.249 Chlorella, long a popular “detoxification” agent, was also tried with dioxin-contaminated rats. The group of rats given chlorella had increased dioxin excretion that varied from 30% to over 300% higher than the control group.250 Postulating that it was the chloro- phyll content of the chlorella that was the active ingredient, this group of researchers then set out to measure that hypothesis. The effectiveness of chlorophyll alone on the excretion of dioxins and furans from rats was quickly established. The higher the content of chlo- rophyll in the diet, the greater the excretion of these persistent fat-soluble toxins in the feces. The ranges of chlorophyll went from a low of 0.1% to a high of 0.5% in the diet. A diet with 0.1% chlorophyll is roughly equiva- lent to consuming 10% of your diet as spinach or 20% as seaweed. In the 0.1% group, the fecal excretion of the various toxins ranged from 40% to 80% greater than that of the control group. At the end of the study, all of the animals that were given chlorophyll had a lower total body burden of these persistent toxins than their counterparts.250 Similar results were found with chlorophyll-containing vegetables. When POP-burdened rats were fed a diet with or without 10% dioxin and furan, elimination occurred in proportion to the chlorophyll con- tent of the vegetables.251 The vegetables with the smallest increase in fecal dioxin excretion (60% to 300% increase) were Chinese cabbage, broccoli, onion, Welsh onion, cabbage, and celery. Kale, Chinese chive, Shungiku, Chingensai, green lettuce, and sweet peppers increased dioxin excretion by 330% to 480%. Topping the charts with an increased dioxin excretion of 760% to 1160% were Komatsuna, mit- suba, spinach, and perilla.

## Nutritional Supplementation

In cases of toxic overload, supplementation can be tricky because some persons with severe chemical reactivity can react to many of the nutri- ents that are normally needed. In his four-volume treatise Chemical Sensitivity, Rea stated that his chemically burdened patients were typ- ically deficient in magnesium, selenium, and vitamin B 6 (whether or not they were taking oral supplements of these).3,4 Supplementation with high levels of antioxidants is typically recommended because all of these xenobiotics have been shown to cause oxidative damage.

<!-- chunk -->

## Depuration (Cleansing)

The removal of impurities from the body is known as depuration. Colonic irrigations and sauna have been used for depuration in addi- tion to the use of RBF and chlorophyll. The earliest articles on the use of saunas for depuration came from clinics associated with the Church of Scientology, using the “Hubbard Purification Rundown.” Designed by L. Ron Hubbard, the protocol uses exercise, high-temperature saunas, increasing doses of niacin, and electrolyte replacement.252 This protocol has been used to reduce levels of PCBs, polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), and hexachlorobenzene.253 More recently, Genuis et al. have published studies on the effectiveness of sweating for depuration. A small group of patients with chronic ill- ness along with an equal number of healthy controls provided serum, urine, and sweat samples. Far-infrared (FIR) saunas were used by 10, standard Finnish steam saunas by 7, and exercise alone by 3. Both BPA and phthalates were documented in the sweat and urine from individ- uals in the study who used either FIR or Finnish saunas.254,255 BPA and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) were both found to be present in the sweat of individuals who did not have these toxicants present in their serum, indicating that both have some degree of storage in the subcutaneous fat pads. Mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) was found in the sweat at concentrations double that in the urine. Five polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants found in the serum of these individuals were also mobilized into their sweat with sauna use.256 As with both BPA and phthalates, some PBDE cogeners were present in the sweat while not being present in the serum. A comprehensive naturopathic protocol of diet, supplements, hydrotherapy, colonic irrigations, and sauna for treating environmen- tally poisoned individuals was developed by the author (Crinnion) and has been in use for more than 20 years. An outcome study on persons using this protocol for a variety of chemically induced ills revealed it to be surprisingly effective. Of all the various problems treated with the depuration protocol, 83% of the participants rated their results as good or great. The two conditions in which 100% of the participants reported great results were asthma (n = 3), and addiction recovery (n = 1). There were several problem (chief complaint) categories in which 100% of the participants rated their results as moderate/good or great. Those categories were autoimmune, dermatological, gastrointestinal, and/or liver. The categories with the next highest ratings of moderate/good and great were fatigue, with 92% improvement; allergies, with 85% improvement; and chemical sensitivities, with 84% improvement.257

## The Crinnion Depuration Protocol

The Crinnion Depuration Protocol consists of the following components:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Daily exercise. Exercise usually consists of using an exercycle,

rebounder, or brisk walking to begin lipolysis and diaphoresis.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Thermal chambers. Up to three 60-minute “sauna” sessions,

with temperatures at a range of 120°F to 135°F, followed by 10- to 15-minute cool-down periods. Glass-bottled spring water was given along with electrolyte replacement. Although the Hubbard clinics use higher temperatures, it was observed that lower temperatures reduced the frequency of adverse effects and increased the release of chemicals in the sweat.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Constitutional hydrotherapy. This uses alternating hot and cold tow-

els with sine-wave stimulation as done by O. G. Carrol, ND, and Har- old Dick, ND.258 This therapy has been used for decades to stimulate the body’s own self-healing activity. We found that it also increased the amount of toxin-laden bile dumped from the liver into the intes- tines. Also assisting the choleretic and cholagogue action on the liver is an herbal capsule taken daily consisting of Chelidonium, Chionanthus, Taraxacum, Arctium lappa, Silybum mar., and Urtica dioca.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Colonic irrigation. Gravity-fed machines are used to gently intro-

duce triple-filtered water into the large intestines, providing an ave- nue for toxic bile to rapidly leave the body. Individuals will routinely have “liver dumps” of bile that range in color from yellow to red, with occasional gray or brown. The color of bile normally ranges from green to yellow to orange to red, depending on the amount of time of exposure to bacterial action in the bowel. However, in this situation, we believe that it is dumped from the liver and rapidly passed through the small intestines, similar to what is seen in “gas- tric dumping” syndrome. We are therefore unable to account for the differences in the color of this effluent. In some patients with heavy agricultural exposure, we have seen higher amounts of fluorescent yellow bile. Hence, the color of the bile may be more attributable to the chemical compounds in the bile than the bacterial action upon the bile. We have documented that chlorinated pesticides are pres- ent in the effluent, which we refer to as “bile dumps.”

## 5. Constitutional homeopathy. This has been used primarily

as a stand-alone treatment, with the use of any other supple- mental and treatments prohibited. However, we have found it to be a valuable component of this protocol and completely

compatible with all the other treatment methods involved. It appears most beneficial in those individuals who need a boost for their vital force to get them moving toward healing and for those who are stuck in emotional issues that they have not been willing to look at.

<!-- chunk -->

## 6. Body therapies (massage, Shiatsu, craniosacral, visceral, chiro-

<!-- chunk -->

## practic). These are done as needed for the individual to treat spe-

cific musculoskeletal problems and to assist in mobilizing toxins that are stored in the tissues.

<!-- chunk -->

## 7. Counseling. Mental and emotional toxins are as big of a problem

as physical and/or chemical toxicants. When people are exposed to powerful emotional toxins (abuse, etc.) that they have no out- let for handling, they end up “stuffing” the emotional toxins. When this emotional stuffing occurs, any physical toxins that they are exposed to at that time are also stuffed (stored) rather than being eliminated. Because of this, when they start to mobilize the physical toxins, the old emotional issues will come back into consciousness. When individuals choose to again suppress the emotional issues (rather than facing them), their physical cleans- ing will also stop. This is evidenced by the observations that they will stop sweating in the thermal chambers, stop heating the cold towels in the hydrotherapy, and stop having good liver releases in the colonic therapy. When the emotional “toxins” are faced and released, then these cleansing parameters are returned to former levels. Assisting all of the individuals going through this depura- tion protocol with their emotional issues helps them cleanse phys- ically. This protocol is run on a daily basis that usually lasts between and 8 weeks (five sessions weekly). This protocol begins the depuration process, which then must be continued once the individual returns home. Most individuals will need to continue regular cleansing (use of home saunas, hydrotherapy, and colon therapy) for at least 12 months after completing their intensive in-office cleansing. When testing for serum levels of chlorinated pesticides, PCBs, and solvents is repeated along with immune parameters after 12 months, improvements are routinely seen. In addition to symptomatic relief, improvements in the laboratory reports (decrease in serum xenobiotics and reduction in autoantibodies, etc.) are clearly evident.


Environmental chemicals and toxic metals are ubiquitous in our envi- ronment and in all humans at varying levels. Damage by these xeno- biotics can be found in virtually every cell, tissue, and organ system in the human body. The most susceptible systems appear to be the immune, neurological, and hormonal systems. Many of the chronic health problems caused by toxic xenobiotics in these systems often present as classic degenerations that are considered to be the result of aging. Classic immunotoxicity manifestations include the develop- ment of allergies and asthma, chemical reactivity, chronic infections, and autoimmunity. Neurotoxicity typically presents with decreased cognition, headache, fatigue, short-term memory loss, and mood disorders. Endocrine toxicity can result in hypothyroidism, obesity, infertility, and diabetes. Exposure to many of the ubiquitous xenobiotic toxicants can be easily eliminated by simple lifestyle choices (Box 33.3), although the burden of fat-stored pollutants can be reduced by depuration techniques that often can be handled through dietary changes. The diagnosis of xenobiotic-induced damage can be elucidated by a com- prehensive history, along with the presence of pollutant-specific biomarkers.

## 283CHAPTER 36 The Exercise Prescription

Moderate-intensity exercise, much like aerobic exercise today, was also a part of life. However, this exercise did not take the shape of going for a jog or leisure run. Aerobic exercise was mostly in the form of spo- radic running after food and dancing, which occupied an important place in the culture of ancient peoples and still does in modern-day hunter–gatherer societies. These dances can last from one to a few hours and take place several times during the week.5–7 The movement patterns of our historical ancestors were a necessary part of life and were fully integrated into the lifestyle. This movement was what could be best described as “cross-training,” with elements of lifting, jumping, running, walking, throwing, climbing, hauling, hiking, or whatever movement pattern was required to procure food, stay protected from the elements, and defend territory. Our species is adapted from an environment where food was not guaranteed and a nomadic hunter–gatherer way of living dominated. This understand- ing is essential for the appropriate prescription of exercise. Hunter– gatherer societies in the past and present have been analyzed through a number of different scientific tools, which show that they do not experience the same degenerative and chronic diseases of modern, Westernized peoples.4,8,9 After taking into account body weight, the modern-day human energy expenditure is estimated to be only 38% of that of our hunter– gatherer ancestors.5 It has been shown that for modern-day humans to approximate the level of activity of hunter–gatherers, they would have to walk 12 miles/day in addition to other activity. 5 Policy leaders on appropriate levels of human activity, such as the American College of Sports Medicine, recommend movement patterns estimated to be 44% less than that of our prehistoric ancestors and modern-day hunter–gatherers.5 Several studies have shown that total energy consumption from exercise may be the primary health-promoting property of move- ment.5,10,11 Given the drastically different environment in which humans now reside, we are left with a serious dilemma. How do we get people to do an activity not required for their survival, that takes time, and is not an enjoyable activity for many? It is useful to remem- ber that the number-one reason given for not participating in exercise is time.12 These facts, and the historical frame of reference provided by evolutionary movement patterns, create a problem. Exercise pre- scriptions must deliver acceptable caloric expenditure, should mimic the cross-training attributes of our ancestors, but must also be time conscious and “doable” for the average population.

# A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON MOVEMENT

It is easy to look at the data presented and quickly move to a “more is better” approach to exercise. However, movement quality is an important consideration before simply instructing more exercise. Quality in this segment is discussed in terms of more functional and efficient movement. In other words, movement that provides the per- fect balance of range of motion and stability leads to more efficient animation of the body. The body is a chain of parts that are completely integrated. Individual exercises, although viewed in isolation by us, are actually complex and highly entrained patterns of neurological con- nections translated into muscular action. These “movement patterns” are the building blocks on which all exercise is constructed. Without a strong foundation, the benefits of exercise can sometimes become a liability, increasing the risk of injury, pain, and dysfunction. It is both irresponsible and shortsighted to focus exercise prescrip- tions solely on delivering greater metabolic stimulus if there is not a strong and appropriate base of mobility and stability through basic movement patterns. In other words, doing more activity may not be beneficial if it simply reinforces poor movement mechanics. We must keep in mind that our ancestors were able to move more because they also moved better. Human development and survival from infancy to adulthood required mastery of movement. The neurological and muscular sys- tems are built as a unit and cannot be separated. Movement should not be thought of in terms of isolated anatomy but rather as an integrated system that moves in patterns. A squat, for example, is not simply a matter of contracting certain muscles that move joints. It is instead a coded and rehearsed pattern of neurological firing translated into physical movement. Gray Cook, physical therapist and the foremost expert on func- tional movement, is the author of two of the most foundational pieces of work in movement science. In his books Athletic Body in Balance: Optimal Movement Skills and Conditioning for Performance and Movement: Functional Movement Systems, Cook described movement science as analogous to the relationship between computer software and hardware.13,14 The muscles and joints act as the hardware, but the neuromuscular firing pattern is the software. Software obviously is what controls and informs the computer, and so it is with the ner- vous system controlling the muscle. To address movement, he rightly pointed out that we need to work movement patterns and not simply isolate parts. The brain does not view exercise as individual muscles working. Instead, the brain has a code or a pattern for each movement. This pattern consists of thousands of different neurons firing in very spe- cific ways to elicit a coordinated action, resulting in a movement. Each movement is to the brain like a computer software program; move- ment science calls this a motor program. It is these motor programs that need to be attended to in terms of movement quality. Although exercise science has developed core principles and pro- tocols to be followed, movement has not developed such protocols. Up until very recently, there has been no standardized understanding of what constitutes normal functional movement. This gap has now been filled by the work of Gray Cook and his colleagues. They have put together a system of screening and analyzing movement so that it can be objectively measured, tracked, and corrected. If we are to use movement as medicine and stay true to the natural medicine axiom of “first, do no harm,” we must establish a standard of practice in move- ment medicine.

## The Functional Movement Screen and Selective

<!-- chunk -->

## Functional Movement Assessment

The Functional Movement Screen, or FMS, as it is popularly known, is “a ranking and grading system that documents movement patterns that are key to normal function.” By acting as a screen for movement, the FMS pinpoints movement dysfunctions that may predispose to injury and/or inefficiency. The FMS has a scoring system that allows for a hierarchical ranking of the most limiting patterns or asymmetries unique to an individual. This in turn provides direction to clinicians as to what corrective strat- egies should be implemented and when. The FMS score can then be used to systematically address underlying movement dysfunctions and restore a base of movement from which conditioning can be built. The FMS is complimented by the Selective Functional Movement Assessment (SFMA). The SFMA is the diagnostic system of functional movement. For the clinician concerned with movement, the two work hand-in-hand. The FMS is both the precursor to and the follow-up from the SFMA. The FMS looks at seven key movement patterns, including a squat, lunge, and hurdle step. Its purpose is to ascertain a baseline of mobility and stability and to determine whether movement

is pain-free. The SFMA is the clinician’s tool for the diagnostic deter- mination of when pain is present. Together, the screen and the assess- ment provide a movement system that allows tailored movement plans that can find, address, and track changes in movement from pain and dysfunction to recovery and optimal movement. The FMS is a screening tool for the clinician; it is not diagnostic but rather prognostic. The SFMA is diagnostic and helps the clinician pinpoint the issue and further prioritize treatment. Once a patient has been discharged from treatment and no longer has pain with move- ment, movement quality must still be measured. This is where again the FMS is used. Several recent studies showed the FMS to be a reliable and repeat- able screening tool for movement quality, but they also proved its abil- ity to predict injury in several high-population groups. Minick et al.15 showed that the FMS demonstrated substantial interrater reliability by both novice and expert users. This demonstrates an important quality of any clinical tool, that of repeatability and objective evaluation in the hands of different users. When the FMS was put to the test in very active population groups, its usefulness became clear. American football players were analyzed in a 2009 study in the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine, Science and Sports; they demonstrated reliable improvements in FMS scores from a standardized intervention based on the screening examination and established an FMS score cutoff predictive of increased injuries.16 Firefighters benefitted from an FMS-guided functional exercise program.16The FMS-guided intervention resulted in a 62% reduction in time off of work because of injuries and reduced injuries by 42% during a 12-month period. Movement pattern performance is an important precursor to increased exercise participation and is an important addition to the exercise world. The FMS and SFMA are new and essential tools for the use of exercise as medicine. They provide a much-needed “stan- dard operating procedure” for movement quality. Gray Cook and col- leagues have a clinical website (http://www.functionalmovement.com) that teaches and instructs on movement systems and provides valuable clinical tools for clinicians.

## New Insights on Exercise for Weight Loss

Once movement quality is attended to, exercise quality needs to be addressed. The current approaches of exercise for weight loss and health are still centered on the low-intensity, “aerobic-zone,” calo- rie-burning paradigms. Recent understanding is redefining this narrow approach to health and fitness. A caloric-focused model of metabolism may not be the most useful way to view exercise. If we look at track ath- letes, both elite marathoners and sprinters have very low percentages of body fat. Sprinters, however, have less body fat and higher amounts of muscle mass, yet they exercise in a very different way.17–19 Sprinters engage in short bursts of anaerobic effort lasting seconds, whereas marathoners run in an “aerobic zone” for hours and use large amounts of caloric energy. If the aerobic model of exercise truly is the best way to gain fitness and fat loss, why is there a discrepancy between these two groups of athletes? In analyzing recent data, we can see that anaer- obic contributions to energy expenditure now need to be considered in exercise prescription.20–22 There is a common misunderstanding of fat-burning percentages in exercise. Many still perceive exercise done in the aerobic zone, usually defined as between 65% and 80% of maximum heart rate (MHR), as burning the most fat per unit time. This is not the case. Lower exercise intensities burn a higher proportion of fat compared with sugar, relatively speaking. However, exercise beyond the aerobic training zone burns more total energy and fat because it is a higher intensity. Suppose two people exercise for 30 minutes. Person A jogs at an intensity of 60% MHR, whereas person B jogs at an intensity of 60% MHR and then, every few minutes, sprints for a short period, reaching over 90% MHR before returning to a lower intensity. Assume person A burned 200 calories, 60% coming from fat and 40% from sugar. Person A therefore used 120 total units of fat and 80 units of sugar (200 calo- ries × 0.60 = 120 fat calories). Person B exercised at a higher intensity, burning a lower percentage of fat. Assume Person B used 50% fat and 50% sugar but burned 100 more calories because of the higher work- load. Person B therefore burned 150 units of fat and 150 units of sugar (300 × 0.50 = 150 fat calories). When the energy burned is totaled, per- son B burns more energy (300 calories) and more total fat (150 units compared with 120 units) than person A, despite using a lower per- centage of the energy as fat. This example shows that higher-intensity exercise of the same duration surpasses lower-intensity exercise in fat calorie use. There are further metabolic consequences created through higher-intensity exercise that make its application in exercise prescrip- tion for fitness and fat loss more intriguing.

## Does Aerobic Exercise Work for Weight Loss?

A 2009 review by Melanson et al.23 looked at the effect exercise had on metabolic stimulation. The study primarily looked at moderate-inten- sity aerobic exercises like jogging, biking, or swimming while including a small sample of anaerobic exercise studies. It showed that aerobic exercise of moderate intensity did not provide a metabolic advantage aside from the calories burned during activity. A previous meta-anal- ysis done over a 25-year period came to a similar conclusion.24 This study analyzed the data from over 400 studies comparing the effects of diet alone, aerobic exercise alone, or diet plus aerobic exercise on weight loss. The results showed that aerobic exercise did not provide a significant advantage to weight loss over diet by itself. Although aer- obic exercise has been shown to be a reliable tool in the maintenance of weight loss,22,23 these studies suggest it may not be enough to elicit significant fat-loss effects.24–27 At the same time, new lines of research show potentially promising effects from more anaerobic modalities. High-intensity interval train- ing (HIIT) is a method of alternating highly anaerobic activity with more relaxed aerobic movement. This method allows the benefits of intense exertion under more tolerable conditions. Rest is required to sustain intense activity for any length of time. Weight training is another anaerobic-centered activity. These more anaerobic-domi- nated exercise approaches have unique benefits that may complement the calorie-burning effects of aerobic exercise.

## Aerobic Versus Anaerobic Exercise

In very simple terms, aerobic metabolism takes place in the mitochon- dria and requires the use of oxygen. Anaerobic metabolism proceeds through a different pathway and requires neither the involvement of the electron transport chain nor oxygen. It is well known that as exercise intensity increases, anaerobic metabolism dominates; unfor- tunately, the exact anaerobic contribution to energy production is exceedingly difficult to measure. The standard way to approximate calorie expenditure and substrate utilization during exercise is through the measure of respiratory gases. The ratio of carbon dioxide expelled to oxygen consumed can give a predictable evaluation of not only energy use but also fuel utilization—glucose versus fat. However, this method is only valid at lower exercise intensi- ties. At higher intensities, the relationship is less clear. To help address this error, researchers also measure excess postexercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). This is a measure of the recov- ery energy expenditure after exercise, and it has been thought to consist of anaerobic contributions to exercise as well. There is

<!-- chunk -->

## 285CHAPTER 36 The Exercise Prescription

some argument as to how meaningful this EPOC effect can be. Many researchers claim the effect does not last long, only several hours, and amounts to, at best, 15% of total calories burned.28–30 However, these approximations come largely from studies with lower exercise intensities involving standard aerobic exercise protocols. Studies using highly anaerobic protocols including cardiovascular interval protocols and weight training showed a much different pic- ture. In 2001 Schuenke et al.31 showed that circuit resistance training, using heavy weights and short rest periods lasting only 31 minutes, were able to generate an EPOC that persisted for 48 hours. The results showed that metabolism 24 and 48 hours after the exercise session was increased by 21% and 19%, respectively. The researchers pointed out that for a typical 180-lb individual, “this equates to 773 calories expended post exercise” while resting and as a result of the work- out. This is far from insignificant and greatly exceeds the 15% many researchers quote for EPOC. Similar findings were shown in women using a similar resistance-training protocol. In women, the elevation in metabolic rate lasted 16 hours.32–34 The same findings were seen with HIIT protocols, with significant EPOC values lasting up to hours.33–35

## Exercise Burn and “After-Burn”

Dr. Christopher Scott of the University of Southern Maine published extensively in this area and is the author of one of the authoritative textbooks in this field, A Primer for Exercise and Nutritional Sciences: Thermodynamics, Bioenergetics, and Metabolism.36 In his works, Dr. Scott points out that EPOC does not fully explain anaerobic energy use and that the anaerobic contributions to exercise might be even greater than originally thought, especially where lactic acid produc- tion is concerned. Dr. Scott emphasized that to fully account for cal- ories burned during exercise, three components must be measured: (1) calories burned aerobically during exercise, (2) calories burned aerobically after exercise (EPOC), and (3) anaerobic calories burned from exercise.37–41 EPOC and the anaerobic lactic acid measure- ments for exercise should be considered separately according to Dr. Scott. A 2005 study by Dr. Scott demonstrated the potential ramifica- tions of anaerobic exercise. This study compared a 3.5-minute aero- bic exercise challenge with three work-equivalent 15-second sprints.42 Calorie use during the exercise bout was calculated to be 29 kcal for the aerobic exercise and approximately 4 kcal for the sprinting. However, when the EPOC contribution was added to the two exercise bouts, energy use rose to 36 kcal for the aerobic bout and 39 kcal for the sprint exercise. Finally, when the purely anaerobic contribution was added to the calorie totals, the numbers for the anaerobic sprint exercise rose significantly. The final tally was 39 kcal for the aerobic exercise compared with 65 kcal for the sprint exercise. By adding both EPOC and the anaerobic contribution to the original calorie total, the sprint exercise was shown to far surpass the aerobic exercise in calories burned. This is interesting when one considers the aerobic exercise session took over four times longer to complete (210 vs. seconds). Without including both the EPOC and anaerobic energy use, a full 94% of the calories used during the sprinting would go uncounted. In studies published in 2006 and 2009 in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, the same researchers quantified anaerobic energy use during weight lifting.37,41 Using the method of measuring and quantifying all three components of calorie burn (aerobic metabo- lism during exercise, EPOC, and anaerobic contributions), these stud- ies showed that weight-training exercise burned 70% more calories than originally thought.

## Hormonal Versus Caloric Exercise

To understand the full ramifications of this new exercise science, the discussion must move to hormonal metabolism. Hormones as we describe them in this chapter refer to all signaling molecules in the body, including steroid hormones, muscle-derived cytokines (myok- ines), and other signaling molecules. Hormonal messengers directly influence the fat-burning stimulus during exercise and may be respon- sible for part of the EPOC after-burn as well. Brief bouts of anaerobic exercise appear to adjust hormones for greater caloric burn during and after exercise.43 This increased energy use is partly explained by EPOC. This is a measure of how much oxygen the body consumes in the hours and days after a workout. An example of EPOC in the acute sense is climbing a long flight of stairs. While walking up the stairs, breathing is labored, but respiration becomes most difficult after reaching the top. The body does this to recover the “debt” of oxygen used during activity. The EPOC created by climbing a flight of steps is an example of the much larger metabolic effect created from intense movement. Exercise of sufficient intensity elevates stress hormones like adrena- line, noradrenaline, and cortisol. Together these hormones ensure the switch to glucose metabolism, which historically supplied the energy to fight or flee. As exercise intensity is elevated further, anaerobic contributions to metabolism increase. This produces lactate (lactic acid), which, contrary to common belief, is not a waste product, but a physiological buffer and signaling molecule.44–46 As lactate rises, it is correlated with, and some studies suggest actually induces, the ana- bolic steroids testosterone and human growth hormone (HGH).47–49 This “hormonal soup,” catecholamines along with cortisol, HGH, and testosterone, acts synergistically to increase postexercise fat loss and lean muscle tissue production, thus creating a more fit and functional physiology. Aerobic and anaerobic exercise have different hormonal effects. Hormones do not work in isolation, and like people, they behave differently depending on the social environment. Interestingly, the hormone cortisol, often seen as a fat-storing hormone because of its insulin-desensitizing effect, behaves differently when combined with growth hormone and testosterone.46,50,51 When cortisol is “socializing” with testosterone and growth hormone, its catabolic action on muscle is blocked, fat storing at the belly is attenuated, and the three may syn- ergistically enhance fat burning.51–54 Attempting to blunt the cortisol response to high-intensity exercise may be counterproductive for fat burning and not necessary in the context of growth hormones.55–58 Long-duration, lower-intensity cardiovascular exercise behaves differently in regard to cortisol. There are also key changes in hunger hormones that are different between lower-intensity aerobic exercises compared with higher-intensity anaerobic workouts. With aero- bic-zone exercise, there is a danger of cortisol increasing unopposed by the growth-promoting hormones.50 This, along with a lowering of leptin and an increase in ghrelin, can lead to compensatory eating with specific cravings for fatty, sugary, and salty foods.59–65 Higher- intensity, shorter-duration activity has the opposite effect on ghrelin, with a more balanced ratio of catabolic versus anabolic hormones.62,63 This may explain why standard aerobic prescriptions have not been shown to be as effective for optimal body composition.23,24,66–69

## Aerobic Zone Versus Interval Training

A 2001 study compared standard aerobic-zone training and anaero- bic-interval exercise in women.70 The anaerobic-interval group exer- cised for 2 minutes at a highly intense 97% of MHR. They then rested by doing 3 minutes of low-intensity activity. The more aerobic group performed moderately intense activity at close to 70% of MHR. The researchers made sure that each group burned 300 calories. Despite

## 286SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

exercising longer and burning the same amount of calories, the aerobic group lost less body fat at the end of the study compared with the inter- val group. In addition, fitness in the interval group was substantially greater than in the aerobic group. A similar study published in the same journal in 1996 showed that an anaerobic-interval group burned significantly more fat than their aerobically trained counterparts.71 Not only did the interval group burn greater amounts of fat during exercise, but they also exhibited increased fat-burning effects that persisted for 24 hours after the exer- cise had stopped. The interval group was able to accomplish this with an exercise session that was a full 15 minutes shorter than the aerobic group. A 1994 study35 tracked two groups of people, one group doing aer- obic training for a period of 20 weeks, whereas a second group was fol- lowed for 15 weeks and engaged in HIIT. The researchers wanted to see how each program would affect body composition. The aerobic group burned 48% more calories than the interval group (120.4 vs. 57.9 MJ) during exercise. The interval group, however, enjoyed a ninefold greater loss in subcutaneous fat. At the conclusion of the study, muscle biopsy analysis showed that resting levels of 3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase, a marker of fatty acid oxidation, were significantly elevated in the interval group but not in the aerobic group.35 A 2008 study looked at intense intermittent exercise compared with steady-state aerobics.72 Forty-five healthy women between the ages of 18 and 30 were recruited for the study, divided into three groups, and studied for 15 weeks. One group did HIIT, where they sprinted on a bike for 8 seconds followed by a 12-second rest. This was repeated for 20 minutes. Another group did moderately intense peddling that was sustained for 40 minutes. The final group did no exercise. At the end of the 15 weeks, the high-intensity interval group lost 2.5 lb of fat, whereas the aerobic group actually gained 0.6 lb of fat. A mea- sure of the fat-related hormones leptin and insulin were also positively affected in the HIIT group compared with the steady-state group. This was accomplished with a workout that was half as long (20 vs. 40 min- utes) as the steady-state’s group.

## Resistance Training Studies

Research hints that resistance training may also provide unique ben- efits for fat loss and fitness. Recent analyses showed that the clear dis- tinctions once set for aerobic exercise and resistance training are no longer delineated so clearly. Circuit training routines have been shown to provide an aerobic stimulus great enough for cardiovascular bene- fit while providing strength-training benefits.73,74 Resistance training may also have great applicability for not just fitness and fat loss but also diseases of insulin resistance.75,76 Weight training, compared with aerobic exercise, greatly attenuates the natural loss of muscle mass that occurs with aging and dieting77 and improves body composition and self-esteem better than aerobic exercise modalities.78–80 Resistance training may also have a much greater effect on EPOC. Two studies already discussed32 showed significant metabolic eleva- tions in men lasting up to 48 hours and in women lasting up to hours. These workouts used exercise regimens that were more intense than most studied resistance-training programs, but they were also shorter. Combining the benefits of resistance training with cardiovas- cular exercise seems to have the most benefit.81 This type of training is called concurrent exercise and involves resistance-training workouts that are followed immediately by aerobic exercise or vice versa. Studies showed that these approaches afforded the benefits of both aerobic and resistance-training workouts.82–85 This “cross-training” approach falls in line with historical movement patterns and saves time. Concurrent exercise approaches follow two patterns, serial con- current exercise (SCE) and integrated concurrent exercise (ICE). In SCE, the two modalities (aerobic and resistance training) are done one right after the other, whereas in the integrated format, the two modal- ities are alternated; a weight-training movement is done, followed by a cardiovascular “burst” of exercise. Based on studies, it appears the benefits of this type of approach can be amplified further using the ICE approach. In a series of three studies in 2008, all published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, Davis et al.86–88 showed the potential benefit of ICE protocols. An ICE workout consisted of brief 60-second bursts of “cardio-acceleration” placed between tra- ditional weight-training sets. This protocol was able to dramatically amplify multiple fitness parameters over and above the same workout volume done in an SCE format.87 Fat loss in the ICE group was close to 10 times greater than in the SCE group over an 11-week period. This constituted a time commitment of just over 4 h/week. Because the work was equivalent in both groups, it was the combination of exercises that made the difference. This same workout protocol showed the ability to improve cardiorespiratory and cardiovascular parameters even in well- trained athletes.86 It also decreased the delayed-onset muscle soreness, the feeling of soreness lasting 24 to 48 hours after the workout, in the ICE group.88 Similar protocols showed the same promising results in body composition change and cardiovascular benefits.89,90

## Safety of Interval Exercise

HIIT, and intense weight training, can be used effectively and safely when combined with the appropriate use of heart rate (HR) monitor- ing, perceived exertion rate (PER), and the use of intervals: periods of exertion followed by rest. Studies show that this type of activity is manageable in several illness models, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,91,92 post–coronary artery bypass patients,93 con- gestive heart failure,93 and heart transplantation patients.94 This type of anaerobic stimulus more realistically mimics real-world challenge and allows for self-paced exercise that is safe, tolerable, and more beneficial for many heart and lung patients.91–98 Cardiac patients also may have less risk with this type of activity because it has more favorable effects on ST-segment changes and heart rate variability (HRV).96–98 Monitoring HR is useful for any health care provider prescribing exercise. It is important to understand that HR equations are merely estimates based on age; there is much variability. HR equations, in gen- eral, underestimate HRs in the very fit. The old HR equation of 220 − age is an inferior HR equation that underestimates HR in the old and overestimates in the young.99 Newer equations allow for better predic- tive value. Based on current understanding, women and men should use separate equations for predicted HR percentages. For men, the MHR equation should be 208 − age (0.7).99 For women, this equation should be 206 − age (0.88).100 It is also useful to know the equation for translating percent of MHR to percent of oxygen uptake (VO 2 ), and vice versa. That equation is %MHR = (0.64) %VO 2 + 37. Because multiple drugs and disease states can interfere with HR, exertion ratings used alone or combined with HR are a more useful clinical tool. In exercise research, a 16-point exertion scale called the Borg scale is used. It is a cumbersome tool to use and teach in clinical practice. A simple 1 to 10, with 10 being maximum exertion and being at rest, is a far more useful tool clinically. It is easy to teach and implement. Traditional aerobic exercise scores between 6 and 8 on the 1 to 10 scale. HIIT will reach between 8 and 10 on the work phase and between 1 and 4 on the rest phase. In clinical practice, this is a useful aid in working with exercise intensity. Combining HR percent monitoring with PERs and heart rate recovery (HRR) allows for tight control of workout safety. Two other useful clinical tools for health care practitioners are the “talk test” and HRR. Exertion and respiration are closely linked. The ability of a person to talk during exercise is a direct indication

## 287CHAPTER 36 The Exercise Prescription

of whether they have crossed into the anaerobic zone.101 For the unfit, this usually occurs around 55% of VO 2 max, and for the very fit, it occurs around 85% VO 2 max. This corresponds to 72% MHR and 91% MHR, respectively, leaving the average healthy exerciser right around 80% of MHR for the anaerobic threshold, at which point the ability to talk will be compromised. Correlating this “talk test” with an individual’s HR allows practitioners to closely moni- tor exercise. HRR is a measure of how fast the heart recovers from exertion and is an indication of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. A healthy heart should recover at least 25 beats/min or more within 1 minute after exertion. A heart that recovers 10 or fewer beats in 1 minute is a concern that should constitute a referral to a cardiologist.102

## Muscle–Body Messengers and Inflammation

If we were able to see, in real-time, the molecular interactions occur- ring within muscles and fat tissue, we would see a unique interaction of muscle communication via myokines. Every time the body moves, muscles release signaling molecules that communicate to the rest of the body. The endocrine properties of muscle, like fat, have been con- firmed.103–105 We are now learning that myokines, cytokines derived specifically from muscle, give instructions to the body about how to function and adapt and may very well hold the key to controlling chronic inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Interleukin-6: The Exercise Factor

Of the numerous myokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of the most important in understanding the inflammatory response. IL-6 is gen- erally known as a proinflammatory cytokine and a member of the inflammatory triad: tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α ), IL-1, and IL-6. When all three of these molecules are released in the blood- stream, we find a proinflammatory effect, typically found with infec- tion and sepsis. However, when released during exercise, IL-6 can have protective effects.106,107 Skeletal muscle contraction induces increases in IL-6 while keeping TNF-alpha and IL-1 levels at bay via IL-1 recep- tor antagonist (IL-1ra) and soluble TNF receptors (sTNFRs).108–110 IL-1ra inhibits interleukin-1-beta (IL-1 β ), a major proinflammatory cytokine, but also induces IL-10, which is not only anti-inflammatory itself but sets off a cascade stimulating other anti-inflammatory cyto- kines while concurrently inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF- α . 106,109,110 The IL-6 effect implicates exercise as a first-line defense against inflammation and thus suggests the benefits of resistance training in chronic illness and inflammatory conditions such as rheuma- toid arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.111–115 Increasing exercise intensity, full-body muscle contraction, and muscle gly- cogen depletion are the major exercise elements enhancing IL-6 release from muscle.104,116–118 These factors together can induce an increase of plasma IL-6 that is 20- to 100-fold over resting lev- els.104,118 At these levels, IL-6 begins to exert influence over the body, relaying messages about the metabolic needs of the mus- cle. In this way, IL-6 acts more like a hormone than a cytokine by sending communications from muscle to adipose tissue, immune cells, and the liver instructing the body to burn fat via adenos- ine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) 116,119 and hormone-sensitive lipase (LPL),113 control glucose regulation by improving insulin sensitivity,120 and inhibit the production of the proinflammatory cytokines.121,122

## Interleukin-15: The Arnold Cytokine

A potent antiobesity and anti-inflammatory myokine, IL-15 has gained the title the “Arnold cytokine” after the famous bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger. This myokine is a potent anabolic factor123 that is upregulated in trained skeletal muscle, particularly type muscle fibers, which are most activated in resistance training over endurance exercise.124,125 Furthermore, IL-15 decreases fat deposition, reduces white adipose tissue, lowers visceral adiposity, and possibly may inhibit TNF- α , thus promoting an anti-inflammatory benefit. These effects are desirable because muscle mass is frequently lost along with fat in aerobic-centered exercise programs. We do know that an accumulation of adipose tissue, particularly visceral adipose tissue, induces chronic systemic inflammation via macrophage infiltration, thus leading to many downstream effects, such as insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neu- rodegenerative disease. IL-15, like IL-6, crosses over, having hor- mone-like action affecting the body systemically, thus explaining the important role these myokines play in the anti-inflammatory benefits of exercise.126

## Lactate

Lactate has been correlated with several positive benefits to exercise. It is now believed that lactate is directly related to some of these benefi- cial changes through hormone-like action. As exercise intensity esca- lates, there is a large surge in catecholamine production. This occurs to supply the body with much-needed blood sugar to fuel intense exer- cise. As the exercise intensity increases, aerobic physiology becomes “maxed out,” forcing the body to become more anaerobic. This switch, believed in the past to be caused by an oxygen deficit, is currently understood to indicate mitochondrial shuttle saturation. When this occurs, pyruvate and hydrogen ions begin to accumulate in the cyto- sol. It is the accumulation of hydrogen ions that lowers the pH of the cell, causing fatigue and the familiar muscle burn of intense exercise. In this situation, lactate is quickly formed. Lactate can then be recycled back to glucose via gluconeogenesis, be burned directly by conversion back to pyruvate and entry into the Krebs cycle, and/or engage cellular machinery as a signaling molecule. The major signal sent by lactate during exercise seems to be an “adap- tation signal.” Analysis of this action shows that lactate has two major functions: first, it increases cellular events, leading to mitochondrial generation,127,128 and second, it stimulates the release of growth-pro- moting hormones, including HGH and testosterone.46,129–131 The major action on cellular signaling seems to be the upregulation of MCT-1.128 MCT-1 is an embedded protein in the mitochondrial membrane that speeds the formation of pyruvate from lactate, thus making existing mitochondria more efficient. In addition, research by Hashimoto et al.127 in 2007 elucidated a complex mechanism whereby lactate interacts directly with key genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. Taken together, this opens a whole new understanding for improving metabolic efficiency. By harnessing the power of lactate, mitochondrial levels can be increased and enhanced, resulting in many beneficial effects on total physiology. The idea of lactate as a hormone is a novel concept. However, it has been made clear through several studies over the past few years that lac- tate is a key signaling molecule in exercise metabolism. Interestingly, a lactate receptor called GPR81 was recently isolated in rats, confirming it does act like a hormone.132 Other studies have shown that lactate can directly stimulate the release of testosterone, progesterone, and HGH.44,129,133–135 This lends further credibility to lactate’s role in help- ing the body adapt and grow.136

## Exercise Approaches to Inflammation

IL-6’s release from muscle cells is not a nervous system phenomenon and is not based on muscle injury. It seems the impetus for IL-6 release is mechanical.105,118 In other words, just the act of movement is all that is required. However, there are ways to amplify IL-6 production during exercise. The science of exercise metabolism now goes far beyond simple calories. The ability to harness the far-ranging hormonal and cytokine effects of exercise can be accomplished through the use of short-duration, high-intensity exercise techniques used in athletic pop- ulations for decades. Although the term high intensity has the tendency to cause reservation, these tools and techniques can be adapted for use in even the least fit and most populations with inflammation.32,112,137 Before discussing the techniques in this approach to exercise, it is important to define why short, intense exercise may be more use- ful than traditional approaches. The damage associated with chronic inflammation is compounded by a lack of offsetting growth factors. The body produces these growth factors in response to intense exer- cise. Testosterone and especially growth hormone are known to be factors linked closely with intensity. The word intense as used here means exercise that is glycogen depleting—that is, it significantly reduces the body’s muscle and liver sugar stores. Only two types of exercise are likely to produce these effects, long-duration exercise last- ing hours or short, intense, sprint-type exercise. There are obvious constraints to prescribing hour-long exercise sessions because lack of time is the number-one reason cited for lack of exercise participation, making short, intense exercise more realistic. In addition, the over- all hormonal response to long-duration exercise is counterproductive because it raises cortisol levels above the body’s ability to compensate with growth promoters.51–57,138 This type of exercise also makes sense because it creates a hor- monal environment that produces sustained fat burning and muscle growth.32,58,70 The amount of glycogen reduction is directly correlated with IL-6 release, and high-intensity exercise is shown to increase IL-6 and catecholamines together.105,109,117,118 Catecholamines have their own independent effect in lowering TNF- α and IL-1, synergistically enhancing IL-6. Combining these known effects with techniques that can deliver the same benefit in less time presents the opportunity to supply these anti-inflammatory effects in short time periods.109,122,139

# EXERCISE PROTOCOLS

## Holistic Fitness Prescription

Based on the research reviewed in this chapter of the new under- standings emerging from exercise research, it seems a cross-training approach in line with our historic movement patterns would provide the most benefit. This approach would include walking, aerobic-zone exercise, resistance training, and cardiovascular interval training. However, realizing exercise prescription needs to be feasible and time consciousness necessitates combining elements to generate the most health benefit. Putting this information in the historical context, it would appear that daily walking should be done as much as feasible. Walking should be viewed as a necessity rather than exercise. Based on his- torical information, walking constituted the predominant activity of our ancestors. Walking not only burns calories but also has restor- ative and relaxing effects. Because walking and eating are generally incompatible, it may be a suitable replacement for eating behavior. Walking may best be done in the evening and for hormonal benefit; walking in a natural setting may be more beneficial than walking in more urban settings.140 Studies have shown positive effects on lower- ing cortisol.141 In addition to walking, aerobic-zone training should be instituted as well. Based on most data, an aerobic program lasting between 20 and 60 minutes 3 to 5 days/week seems optimal. Based on new information, aerobic exercise may be best for weight maintenance and not the most optimal for attaining weight loss. Given the new data on HIIT, the time spent doing aerobic exercise may be able to be cut in half. A HIIT pro- gram done 3 times/week for 20 to 40 minutes could save considerable time72 and provide the same cardiovascular benefit and perhaps better weight-loss results without the compensatory food behaviors.59–65 Recommendations capitalizing on the concept of non–exercise-as- sociated thermogenesis (NEAT)142 and burst training140-143 may have special applicability in today’s time-starved world. NEAT involves accumulating as much non–exercise-related activity as possible and includes everything from washing the dishes to fidgeting with a pencil, to nervously bouncing a leg up and down and even nonsitting time. Burst training is a concept popularized by Mark Smith, PhD, and involves accumulating several 1-minute anaerobic bouts of activity throughout the day. Several interesting studies showed this approach was able to generate clinically meaningful weight-loss results with only minutes of exercise per day.142,143 Instituting behavioral changes that involve parking further away, doing a burst of activity by running up the steps, standing rather than sitting, and even fidgeting when standing or sitting still can all have a significant effect on total energy expenditure.144 Weight-training programs should also be a center point of health, fitness, and fat loss.145 Resistance exercise excels at maintaining mus- cle mass and helps attenuate rebound weight gain.146 Three full-body workouts per week, using moderately heavy weights in the 8 to 12 rep- etition range for 3 to 5 sets appears optimal. Again, because time is an increasingly limiting factor, integrating resistance training with inter- val training into one workout 3 to 5 times/week for 30 to 60 minutes can save considerable time yet still yield significant caloric expenditure and fat loss.

## Rest-Based Training Method for Exercise Prescription

Rest and movement are often seen as opposites, but they are actually complementary and dependent on each other. Exercisers told to run as fast as possible for 10 minutes will necessarily regulate intensity to complete the task. If they were instead told to run as fast as possible for 10 seconds, the intensity could be dramatically elevated. True high-in- tensity exercise is impossible to achieve without rest. Quality rest leads to quality work, and vice versa. HIIT and intense weight lifting have always coupled work with rest. One issue with these workouts is the rigid structure. The work/ rest ratios “force” individuals of varying fitness levels to work at man- dated levels. This works to lower intensity, inducing the same pacing effect seen in traditional aerobic exercise. These types of workouts are often too intense for many and can create psychological resistance to participating. Rest-based training (RBT) uses rest, autonomy, and time manipu- lation to optimize intensity for all fitness levels. It combines the latest in exercise science and motivational psychology. RBT enjoys the same physiological benefits of intense interval exercise and weight training but with key psychological benefits. RBT differs in the application of rest. Although interval training and weight training have clearly defined work and rest ratios, RBT leaves the exerciser in charge of the duration of rest. The language employed in this type of training is “push until you can’t, rest until you can.” This shift in paradigm acts as reverse psychology for exercisers.

## 289CHAPTER 36 The Exercise Prescription

The motivational psychology of exercise is an important consid- eration regarding exercise consistency, frequency, and intensity. The primary goal or purpose of interval training is to maximize work effort across all work bouts and employ the shortest recovery time possible to maximize the training stimulus. Contrary to popular belief, research has shown that exercisers who have autonomy over their workout parameters will often work harder and are able to self-regulate to an optimal work/rest ratio for their physiology.146,147 There are four key attributes in our RBT system. All are geared toward maximizing work effort in a safe and scalable way. The key tenets of rest-based exercise are represented by the acronym REST.

<!-- chunk -->

## Rest Based

Pushing to the point of rest is actually the goal of a rest-based workout. By putting the focus on rest as opposed to work, RBT not only auto- matically increases the quality of work but also makes exercise psycho- logically easier.146–148 When exercisers know they have permission to rest, they may voluntarily work harder without even being consciously aware they are doing so. Interestingly, animal research showed that intermittent exercise is inherent and may be an evolutionary adaptation to maximize distances covered per unit time.147 Animals naturally engage in sporadic work/ rest ratios during movement and self-regulate exercise to optimize both performance and recovery. Research showed that humans have the same capability.146

<!-- chunk -->

## Extrinsic Focus

A major inhibitor of intensity is exercisers’ focus on intrinsic sensa- tions such as breathlessness, burning, and other uncomfortable feel- ings.146,148 RBT uses strategies that focus participants away from these intrinsic sensations to more extrinsic factors. Workout parameters change quickly, monotony is minimized, circuits are used, exercise timing is limited, and different movement strategies are incorporated in the same workout. All of this is designed almost as a distraction technique so that the exercisers focus more on what they are doing versus what they are feeling. This helps them work harder and there- fore rest more often.

<!-- chunk -->

## Self-Determined

In psychology research, self-determination theory posits that when people are given control and choice over their options, internal moti- vation automatically increases.149–151 With RBT, there is structure in the workout, but the exerciser is left in complete control over how hard to work, when to rest, and for how long and even has flexibility regard- ing exercise choice and modifications. These factors not only serve to increase the quality of work within a session146 but can also improve exercise adherence from session to session.146,149–153

<!-- chunk -->

## Time Conscious

Given that time and intensity are so closely linked, harder workouts by necessity must be shorter. RBT workouts can be as short as a 1-min- ute burst repeated multiple times throughout the day to as long as minutes of continuous exercise employing start-and-stop working and resting. Workouts lasting over 40 minutes suffer in intensity and may have negative hormonal consequences.62,63,72 Work/rest ratios employed by traditional interval and weight-lift- ing workouts work for some but can be imperfect for most. By focusing on rest in a workout and allowing exercisers control over when they rest and for how long, optimal intensity for results can be achieved in a safe, scalable way. A 96-year-old grandfather would be able to use the same workout approach to deliver optimal intensity for him, whereas a 24-year-old elite athlete could use the concept to deliver an optimal intensity as well. Rest-based exercise can be seen as a new functional model for fitness and fat loss.

## Exercise and the Heart

Aerobic-zone exercise is a well-known preventive and treatment strat- egy for cardiovascular disease. Virtually all health care providers are aware of the aerobic exercise prescription advocated by most policy- making organizations as “20 to 60 minutes of aerobic exercise done at an intensity of 65% to 80% of MHR on all or most days.”156 Given that these recommendations are well established and universally accepted, we will focus our attention here on new research related to the heart. Since the publication of the book Aerobics by Kenneth Cooper in 1968, participation in activities such as jogging, biking, swimming, marathons, and triathlon training has steadily risen. Newer research suggests, however, that this approach can be taken too far and that exercise for health, fitness, and fat loss should not be so one-dimen- sional. Dr. Cooper himself has conceded “In that book I said, ‘The more exercise, the better.’ But by 1982, after too many telephone calls from distraught widows whose 55-year-old, overweight smoker hus- bands had died jogging, I realized I had made a mistake. … Exercise wasn’t a panacea that could fix everything, it had risks. … There may be a point of diminishing returns.”157 To improve our return on exercise investment, there must be adequate rest between sessions. Resting may also include active resting such as walking, restorative yoga, medita- tion, and tai qi. However, sleep is certainly the most important aspect of restoration, with 8 to 10 hours being necessary to reap the most from exercise. Of note is that the older the age, the more rest that may be needed between exercise sessions. The risks of excessive aerobic exercise are now better understood. Ultra-endurance exercise, such as marathon running and triathlons, can have a negative effect on heart function. Intense, long-duration aerobic activity dramatically elevates oxidative stress in the heart, alters left and right ventricle function, and causes damage in otherwise nor- mal hearts.158–160 This is not to say aerobic exercise is dangerous but rather to highlight the potential downside of an aerobically dominated exercise prescription. Research studying ultramarathon runners has found that these athletes experience significant detrimental changes in their immuno- logical, hematological, and biochemical parameters. Ultra-endurance training in cold conditions may significantly impair immune function via changes in neutrophils, immature neutrophils, and monocytes, suggesting an increased risk of infection.154 Furthermore, cardiovas- cular illness and renal dysfunction are evident with increases in blood viscosity,155 postexercise anemia, increased creatine kinase (CK) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and increased copeptin.156,157 On the other hand, there is some research suggesting that at least at the cellular level, certain biochemical processes are put into play with ultra-endurance athletes that suggest such exercise may impart lon- gevity. One of the ways this can be assessed is via telomere length and cellular senescence. Aerobic exercise prolongs and prevents shorten- ing of leukocyte telomeres and promotes telomere homeostasis by the action of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), the shelterin complex (or telosome), and miRNA.158,159 Cellular senescence appears to be slowed in endurance athletes compared with their sedentary counterparts, with reductions in DNA damage, inflammatory markers, and induction of telomerase, which is associated with longer telomere length and longevity.160 Obesity may actually be a better target for exercise therapy because it is so closely related to heart disease. Any exercise approach that helps lower body fat can be viewed as a heart-healthy plan. Because

so many view exercise as a time-consuming chore and because lack of time is the number-one reason cited for lack of participation in exercise, interval-training exercise prescriptions may be better suited to heart protection. High-intensity interval training, as evident in sev- eral studies, provides both the cardiovascular and aerobic benefits of endurance and moderate-intensity training while providing the ben- efits of weight-resistance exercise. Improvements in insulin sensitiv- ity, VO 2 max, and cardiac function161 and increased muscular irisin are seen with high-intensity training over moderate intensity.162 Yet a key limiting factor in exercise is actually physically exercising, but compared with moderate continuous exercise, high-intensity exercise with short bursts of action is more enjoyable and improves patient compliance.163,164

## Interval Training and the Heart and Vascular System

The theory behind interval training is that the heart, like all muscles, needs to be challenged to repair and grow stronger. Theoretically, interval training allows the advantage of a harder challenge with less risk because each high-intensity bout is followed by recovery. If done correctly, the heart is forced to alternate between sympathetic stimula- tion and parasympathetic recovery. This, it is argued, is a more func- tional way to exercise because it trains HRR and heart stimulation. Because many cardiac events come from sudden unexpected anaerobic challenges, like shoveling the first winter snow, running through an airport to catch a plane, or walking up a large flight of steps, HIIT is believed to help the body prepare for these challenges by teaching the heart to work and recover quickly. HRV and spontaneous cardiac baroreflex provide functional measures of cardiac parasympathetic activity. A study in April showed the effect of interval training on both.96 Eleven healthy elderly men, mean age 74 years, underwent an intensive 14-week interval training program involving nine 1-minute bouts of exercise at 85% MHR followed by 4 minutes of recovery at 65% MHR. Aerobic capac- ity increased 18.6%, whereas HRV showed a significant parasympa- thetic shift at night from pre- to posttraining. The cardiac baroreflex response also improved, with 10 of the 11 participants showing a favorable response. Benefits of HIIT may be good for peripheral vascular disease and cardiovascular disease. A 2006 study reported an observational study on the effect of HIIT on intermittent claudication.165 A total of patients were included in the study. Patients were asked to walk on a treadmill to maximal claudication pain six times in each exercise session with 3 minutes of rest in between. Once a patient could walk continuously for 6 minutes without reaching maximal pain, the speed and/or grade was increased. A rehabilitation score was calculated as the product of speed and grade achieved by the participants. Results showed that HIIT led to clinical improvement in symptoms and a higher tolerable workload by patients. No adverse effects were seen from the treatment, suggesting those with peripheral arterial disease could both tolerate and benefit from HIIT. In 2007, Wisløff et al.166 shed some light on the cardiovascular effects of HIIT versus traditional aerobic training for heart failure patients. Twenty-seven patients with stable postinfarction heart fail- ure were randomized to either aerobic exercise (70% MHR) or HIIT (95% MHR for 4 minutes separated by 3 minutes at 50%–70% MHR) 3 times/week for 12 weeks or to a control group. The control group was told to follow the exercise advice of their family doctor and met for 47 minutes of walking at 70% MHR every third week. All groups did exercise on a treadmill. The major finding was that HIIT was supe- rior to traditional aerobic training with regard to reversal of left ven- tricular (LV) remodeling, aerobic capacity, endothelial function, and quality of life. With respect to LV remodeling, in the HIIT group, the LV diastolic and systolic diameters decreased by 12% and 15%, and estimated LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes dropped by 18% and 25%, respectively. Prohormone BNP, a marker of hypertrophy and severity of heart failure, declined by 40% in the HIIT group. There was no change in the traditional aerobic group or control group in LV remodeling, pointing to a rather profound effect of HIIT on traditional aerobic exercise in this patient population. As mentioned, HIIT has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,91,92 postbypass patients,93 congestive heart failure,93 and even heart transplantation patients.94 As discussed, HIIT may realistically mimic real-world challenges. It can also be tailored into a self-paced format that is safe, tolerable, and beneficial for many cardiovascular conditions.95–97 It was shown in one study to have more favorable effects on ST-segment changes than traditional aerobic exercise, in addition to the positive effects on HRV.96–98,100 Obviously, physicians prescribing exercise for high-risk patients will not want to completely abandon traditional aerobic exercise in favor of HIIT. Traditional aerobic exercise is well established to both treat and prevent cardiovascular diseases. More studies need to be done on HIIT, but it appears it may have some unique cardiovascular benefits. There are some considerations when prescribing this form of exercise. Work/rest ratios should be larger for the more fit and smaller for the less fit or more frail. A beginning exercise protocol for a younger fit person wanting to optimize cardiac prevention would be a work/rest ratio of 1:2. More frail and less fit clients will want to start with a work/ rest ratio of 1:4 or greater. The RBT approach highlighted previously may provide increased benefit and safety when using intervals.

## Exercise and Bone

When prescribing exercise for bone, there are several important con- siderations: the mechanostat theory, the concept of osteogenic shear forces, and most importantly, knowing that bone density does not nec- essarily equal bone strength. A strong bone is both dense and flexible, whereas a weak bone has only one or neither of those qualities.167 The mechanostat theory states that bone has set points of mini- mum effective strain (MES) that determine whether or not bone will be gained or lost.168–170 If forces on bone increase more than what the bone is accustomed to (i.e., relative MES), mineral flux into bone increases. This, along with compensatory structural changes, helps bone become competent enough to deal with increased functional demand. Likewise, if demands on bone decrease and fall below the MES threshold, bone metabolism changes result in weaker bone.170 The latter scenario often prevails in age and illness and can happen very quickly. During periods of immobilization, bone mineral density can decline as fast as 1% per month.171,172 To understand the concept of osteogenic shear forces, one must have some idea of the bone’s anatomy. Cortical bone contains lacunae (hollowed-out areas) that are connected via canals (canaliculi). These lacunae house osteocytes that extend dendritic arms through the can- aliculi to communicate with other osteocytes. Osteocytes act as mech- anoreceptors. The osteocyte and its dendritic arms are bathed in fluid. The movement of this fluid is believed to be “sensed” by the osteocytes. The degree of intensity of this fluid movement dictates the degree of bone-building stimulation. Research hints that exercise that creates large “shear forces,” such as jumping, creates the most potent stimuli for bone growth. Another key factor in this physiology is that small jostling forces have a much weaker effect, and continuous exercise may work against bone building by causing desensitization of osteo- cytes. Optimal bone-building exercise therefore is sporadic in nature, alternating work and rest, and creates large strain and shear forces. Multidirectional jumps and hops seem to be most ideal.

## 291CHAPTER 36 The Exercise Prescription

Measuring bone density alone does not provide an adequate mea- sure of bone strength.167 To determine the full effect of exercise, all bone parameters should be assessed. To properly ascertain bone strength, cortical thickness and bone diameter are equally important compared with bone mass. Cortical bone, the outer portion of bone, is responsi- ble for 80% of bone strength. Thicker bones are also stronger bones. By measuring density, cortical bone, and thickness, we get a much more accurate picture of how much force a bone can handle. Effective exer- cise should address all these areas. In addition, bone-building exercise should be aimed at developing functional parameters that prevent a fall in the first place.17,173 This means that exercise modalities that build strength, flexibility, balance, and reaction speed should not be ignored.

Yoga therapy has been shown to predict survivability in breast can- cer,174 is correlated with better outcomes in cancers of the head and neck,175 and allays anxiety- and stress-related dysfunction in cancer treatment.176,177 The research on yoga and its use in cancer is gain- ing ground. A report by Brauer et al.178 in 2010 looked at the leading cancer treatment hospitals in America. This study showed that 56% of these centers incorporated yoga into their clinic offerings. The wasting of cancer, cachexia, is a difficult condition to treat, with few therapeutic options. Resistance training has several unique mech- anisms that seem to address several of the underlying mechanisms of cachexia.179 Resistance exercise is able to increase phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) substrates and p70S6 k.180 This suggests it has the potential to induce mTOR, a major contributor to decreased muscle synthesis.181 Resistance training is also a powerful modulator of adenosine triphosphate–dependent ubiquitin-protea- some system (UPS) activity by way of inflammatory cytokine mod- ulation. Two review articles in 2007 by Pajak et al.182 and Al Majid et al.183 showed several complicated mechanisms of how resistance exercise works. Resistance exercise can release IL-6, which is anti- inflammatory when released by muscle,85 and IL-15, which is strongly anabolic. Muscle-derived IL-6 suppresses TNF- α and IL-1. This action strongly decreases the overactivity of adenosine triphosphate–depen- dent UPS, which may be the most important component of cancer cachexia. IL-15 also will increase the type II muscle fibers that seem to be selectively lost in cachexia.

## Exercise and Brain Neuroplasticity

Conditions of the brain that cause, or have the potential to cause, dementia-like illnesses are at epidemic proportions, with some experts suggesting that by 2050, upwards of 130 million people worldwide will have dementia.184 With recent studies showing the strong connection and mechanism by which blood glucose and insulin resistance worsen neurocognitive health,185 it would also be legitimate to suggest exercise to be a protective tool against neurocognitive disorders; the research is surely in agreement. If there is one medication that outperforms any other drug in improving outcomes in Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), stroke recovery, depression, anxiety, attention deficit hyperac- tive disorder (ADHD), age-related cognitive decline, and multiple scle- rosis, then exercise is it. The mechanism by which exercise exhibits these significant ben- efits is via induction of neuroplasticity, neurogenesis, and neurotro- phy. The ability of the brain to reorganize, create new neural pathways, induce neuronal activity, and enhance the growth and survival of neu- ronal tissue is influenced by exercise. Neurotrophic factors such as BDNF, IGF-1, and VEGF play an intricate role as neuroprotective agents, with BDNF seeming to be the most potent.186 Exercise induces the production of BDNF, which freely crosses the blood–brain barrier (BBB),187 resulting in hippocampal neurogenesis, dendritic complexity, and synaptic plasticity.188,189 One mechanism through which environmental toxins induce dementia is by impairing the production of BDNF. Increased BDNF levels may be responsible for enhancing hippocampal volume and improving cog- nitive function, whereas decreased levels of BDNF, along with IGF-1, are associated with Alzheimer’s disease.190 It is suspected that the ben- efits of BDNF are derived from its ability to induce hippocampal and cortical neuronal growth and mitochondrial biogenesis and reduce neuroinflammation.191 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), induced by exercise, is known for improving vascular circulation, and its role in inducing hippocampal neurogenesis is evident in humans.192 Additionally, IGF- 1, which is positively correlated with exercise intensity, is released into the blood postexercise and can, like BDNF, bypass the BBB and affect neuroprotective actions in the brain.193 IGF-1 works in tandem with BDNF to improve neuroplasticity, and furthermore, it provides pro- tection against oxidative damage and neuro-excitotoxicity.194,195 These mechanistic pathways explain the ability of exercise to atten- uate cognitive decline. These mechanisms then translate to actual out- comes in human trials. Physical activity and exercise have been shown to improve learning capacity196 in adults and offspring197; enhance recovery from traumatic brain injuries198; improve gait and function in PD; and improve memory,199 language ability, attention, and other cognitive parameters in AD.200,201 Exercise and physical activity not only spare brain volume, which slowly declines with age, but also increase gray and white matter in various areas of the brain in older adults.202 The volume of gray and white matter in the prefrontal cortex (involved with working memory and executive functions) and temporal lobe (involved with long-term memory) has been shown to be preserved with physical activity, along with attenuation of hippocampal volume, which is a predictor of time to progression in AD.203 Increases in gray matter were shown in as early as 6 months and lasting up to 13 years, suggesting exercise has a prolonged benefit on neuroplasticity.204 Furthermore, increased gray matter not only reduces the risk of cognitive impairment but improves cognitive function and prevents dementia in the elderly.204,205 Overall, exercise, whether it is aerobic or resistance training, is ben- eficial for neuroplasticity and cognitive health. However, most benefits have been observed with high-intensity training, exceeding 30 minutes daily and done for more than 6 months.206 Including resistance exer- cise not only provides neurological benefits but also tackles many of the comorbidities of aging as discussed in this chapter, such as frailty, sarcopenia, and cardiometabolic disease.

## Exercise for the Brain and Mood

Exercise increases cerebral blood flow and metabolism and therefore affects both mood and cognitive function. Exercise has been shown to have many positive benefits on mood, especially in the realm of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem.207 In one depression study, adults classified with depressed mood on the Profile of Mood States- Short Form Depression Scale (POMS) were studied over 10 weeks.208 The treatment consisted of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for 30 minutes three times per week. At the end of the study, 62% of the exercise group was classified as normal on the POMS compared with 29% in the control group. Another study in the elderly showed com- parable results.209 Several mood parameters were assessed, including both depression and anxiety. The study group had decreased scores for depression and anxiety and showed significant improvement in qual- ity-of-life scores. Two other studies on depression showed exercise as a potential pri- mary therapy in major depression and among patients refractory to

drug therapy. A study published in 2001 showed that a small group of subjects with major depression who underwent a daily 30-minute walking program had a clinically relevant and statistically significant benefit from exercise in as little as 12 days.210 The program was a mod- erate-intensity interval-walking program alternating from “somewhat hard” to half that pace on the rest phase. Even subjects refractive to drug therapy were able to improve with the exercise program. Considering the well-known response delay of 2 to 4 weeks with the use of medica- tions, this study showed aerobic exercise as a more immediate fix and a smart integrative approach with drug treatment. Direct comparisons of exercise versus drug therapy (sertraline) for major depression showed exercise as a powerful mood enhancer.211 Subjects performed aerobic exercise on a treadmill three times per week and were followed over a 12-month period with respect to Zoloft therapy, exercise and Zoloft therapy, and exercise alone. The exercise- alone group had significantly better outcomes in terms of treatment effect, remission, and relapse than either the Zoloft group or the Zoloft group plus exercise. Although it is not completely understood, the mechanism by which exercise improves depression and mood-related disorders is multifactorial but does show similar mechanisms to anti- depressant medications, but it also surpasses the palliative effects of medications and improves neurocognitive markers.212 Exercise has been shown to inhibit GSK-3-beta, improve hippocampal neurogen- esis, increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and increase regulation of mTOR.213,214

## Exercise and Anxiety

Exercise has favorable effects on anxiety. Past studies have shown exercise to be an anxiolytic in symptoms induced by caffeine and car- bon dioxide,215,216 but these compounds did not result in panic. One study showed that direct treatment of patients with panic disorder with aerobic exercise led to significant improvement compared with placebo.217 The study was over a 10-week period, and the maximum effect was seen toward the end of the study. This points to exercise as both a preventative and alternative treatment strategy for anxiety. The acute effects of exercise may even be able to allay panic attacks. A recent study used exercise as a treatment against induced panic attacks.218 Cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) is a reliable inducer of panic attacks in humans and mimics the mechanisms associated with anxiety-induced panic attacks. Fifteen subjects were studied in a crossover design. Exercise for 30 minutes at 70% of maximum oxygen consumption was compared against no exercise. The next day, subjects received a bolus of CCK-4 and were monitored for signs and symp- toms of panic attack. Previous exercise the day before produced half as many panic attacks, 6 compared with 12. This appears to indicate exercise as a modifier of anxiety-induced panic attacks.

## Exercise and Memory

Exercise also affects memory and has shown benefit in multiple brain parameters.219 Even weight lifting can improve brain function in the elderly.220 Exercise is known to increase neurotransmission and myelin synthesis. Taken together, this can increase both the speed and quality of mental activity. Studies have shown that exercise positively affects attention deficit disorder/ADHD, dementia, AD, and other mental dis- orders.192–195 Recent studies also showed that exercise has the potential to create new neurons.221,222


This chapter illustrated the vast potential of exercise to both prevent and treat multiple medical issues, from obesity to mental and emo- tional dysfunction. There are many aspects of exercise and health that were not covered or were only discussed briefly. However, the key con- cepts covered should allow smart manipulation of exercise parame- ters to fit many conditions. It is our hope that understanding the new science of exercise, and the historical construct in which movement evolved, will allow health practitioners to move beyond one-dimen- sional exercise models focused solely on aerobic exercise to a more holistic and functional model of prescriptive movement.

human physiological responses to fasting. Metabolic processes were described in five phases based on the transition through the postab- sorptive state and near-steady state of prolonged fasting (Table 37.1).11 Throughout this transition, metabolic states are often concurrent and have variable rates depending on an individual’s age, sex, and nutrient reserves.87 It should be noted that there appear to be marked differ- ences between the metabolism of lean and obese individuals.73,74,88,89 For example, lean individuals have increased concentrations of ketone bodies and an increased percentage of energy derived from protein oxidation while fasting.73

<!-- chunk -->

## Metabolic Phase I (0–4/6 Hours)

Phase I begins immediately after caloric ingestion, when carbohy- drates, proteins, and fats are digested into sugars (primarily glucose), amino acids (single or peptides), and fatty acids (triacylglycerol, TAG), respectively.11 All macronutrients are absorbed into the blood, trans- ported to the liver for processing and/or storage, and transported back to the blood to maintain physiological processes. Glucose and amino acids are absorbed directly into the bloodstream through the small intestine. TAGs are broken down into glycerols and free fatty acids, which form micelles that enter enterocytes where they are reconverted to TAGs and packaged in chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are absorbed into the lymphoid system through the small intestine and then released into the bloodstream. In this phase, high blood glucose levels stimulate the pancreatic β cells to secrete insulin above basal levels. Insulin reg- ulates the uptake and metabolism of glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids. At this phase, all tissues preferentially utilize glucose as fuel, except the liver and heart, which prefer α -ketoacids and fatty acids, respectively. Glucose is transported into cells where it is catabolized through glycolysis. During glycolysis, glucose is converted to pyruvate that is oxidized to acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) that enters the tricarbox- ylic (TCA) cycle, ultimately producing adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP). Increased glycolysis in the liver results in an excess of acetyl-CoA that is used to synthesize TAGs, which are packaged into very-low-den- sity lipoproteins for storage and secretion when blood glucose is low. Insulin also regulates the uptake of glucose by adipocytes, where it is converted through glycolysis to glycerol 3-phosphate and acetyl-CoA, which are then synthesized into TAG. High levels of blood glucose enable hepatocytes and muscle cells to convert glucose to glycogen— the storage form of glucose—through glycogenesis. The liver and mus- cles store approximately 100 and 300 grams of glycogen, respectively.8

## Metabolic Stage Phase II (4–6 hours)

Phase II begins approximately 4 to 6 hours after final caloric intake.11 Decreased blood glucose levels stimulate pancreatic α cells to secrete glucagon above basal levels. Glucagon is an insulin antagonist that stimulates glycogenolysis of hepatic glycogen to glucose. Hepatic gly- cogen reserves are depleted within approximately 24 hours of fasting. Glycogenolysis also converts muscle glycogen to glucose 6-phosphate. However, muscle cells lack the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase that is required to release glucose; therefore muscle glycogen is not used to meet whole-body glucose requirements. During this early fasted phase, hepatic glycogenolysis provides about 75% and gluconeogenesis accounts for the other 25% of daily glucose requirements of all tissue except the liver.8

<!-- chunk -->

## Metabolic Phase III (1–2 days)

Phase III lasts from approximately 24 to 48 hours after final caloric intake.11 During this time, gluconeogenesis is the primary metabolic pathway supplying daily glucose requirements.38-40,90 Gluconeogenesis, primarily in the liver, produces glucose from the noncarbohydrate car- bon substrates glycerol, lactate, and amino acids.8,91 TAG hydrolysis forms glycerol and fatty acids in adipose tissue. Glycerol is converted to dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which is used to produce glucose in the liver, after which it is exported to extrahepatic tissue. In skeletal muscle, when rates of glycolysis exceed the TCA cycle, excess lactate is produced and transported to the liver where it is converted to pyruvate and then to glucose through the Cori cycle. Glucose is then transported back to muscle cells or used to meet whole-body glucose requirements.85 Amino acids are primarily used to make protein, but when glucose is

low, the breakdown of digestive and glycolytic enzymes, skeletal mus- cle, and other connective tissue provides amino acids for gluconeo- genesis. In skeletal muscle, ammonium is produced as a by-product of protein catabolism, but it is unable to be converted to urea for removal through urine, as in the liver. Excess ammonium results in transam- ination of surplus pyruvate to ultimately form alanine. The glucose- alanine or Cahill cycle transports the glucogenic amino acid, alanine, from skeletal muscle to the liver to produce glucose that can then be used by extrahepatic tissue. Although all amino acids, with the excep- tion of lysine and leucine, are glucogenic, alanine and glutamine are the predominate amino acids used in gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidneys, respectively.92,93 Eventually, the renal cortex synthesizes more glucose through gluconeogenesis than does the liver.64 During this phase, blood glucose begins to decline, but glucose is still utilized by all tissue except the liver.8,91 In the fasted state, blood glucose levels routinely drop down to 40 mg/dL or lower.11,90,94,95

<!-- chunk -->

## Metabolic Phase IV (2–5/7 days)

Phase IV begins approximately 48 hours after final caloric intake and lasts until approximately day 5 to 7.11 At this phase, renal glucone- ogenesis becomes progressively more important in the maintenance of blood glucose levels. Additionally, reduced blood glucose and increased glucagon levels induce adipocytes to increase lipolysis of TAGs into fatty acids and glycerol. Glycerol is converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis as described previously. Fatty acids bound to albumin are transported to the liver, muscle, and other tissues. Fatty acids in the liver are broken down by β oxidation to form acetyl-CoA. When acetyl-CoA exceeds the capacity of the TCA cycle because of reduced oxaloacetate availability, it is used to synthesize the ketone bodies acetoacetic acid (AcAc), acetone, and β -hydroxybutyric acid ( β OHB) through ketogenesis.8 The liver is unable to utilize ketone bodies for fuel, which results in large quantities of ketones, primar- ily AcAc and β OHB, to be secreted into the bloodstream. Within the mitochondria of extrahepatic tissue, β OHB is further oxidized to AcAc that is then transported to the TCA cycle. Increased ketones are typically identified through urinalysis by day three of the fasted state.90 Except for red blood cells, the renal medulla, and the liver, all tissues, including the brain, is able to utilize ketone bodies for energy. By the end of Phase IV, the brain’s energy requirements are met primarily by ketone bodies.8,11

## Metabolic Phase V (Until Nutrient Depletion Begins)

Phase V begins when rates of ketogenesis exceed gluconeogenesis and continues until starvation begins.11 The length of this phase depends on an individual’s body mass index, fat and muscle percentages, physical activity levels, and state of health. Studies on respiratory quotient and urinary nitrogen have demonstrated that adipose TAG stores meet the majority of whole-body energy requirements during prolonged fast- ing.35,49,51,56,85 Meeting energy requirements through fat metabolism decreases dependency on gluconeogenesis, thus sparing protein.86,96 The brain begins utilizing ketone bodies, primarily β OHB, after approximately 4 days. This adaption is essential because brain glycogen content is very low (0.1%). The brain (40 g/day) and other tissues (40 g/day) still have an obligatory need for approximately 80 g/day of glu- cose, which is met through gluconeogenesis.8,97 Starvation begins when essential proteins are catabolized to meet energy requirements.8 Based on average nutrient reserves, a 70-kg human can fast for 2 to 3 months before entering starvation (Tables 37.2 and 37.3).8,35,49,51,97,185-189

# PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS

Although data in mammalian model organisms suggest that intermit- tent fasting has various effects on the neuroendocrine system, such as increased synaptic plasticity and parasympathetic tone,98 data on neu- ronal and endocrine adaptations during prolonged water-only fasting in humans are lacking. Preliminary research has shown that during pro- longed fasting human growth hormone, reverse T3, adrenaline, nor- adrenaline, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol increase,94,95,99-102 whereas thyroid-stimulating hormone, T3, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and testosterone decrease.94,95,99-101 Specific details on fluctuations over the course of a prolonged fast; differences between individuals based on age, sex, and nutrient reserves; and the downstream effects of these changes remain to be elucidated. Weight decreases in response to caloric deprivation. During pro- longed fasting, weight loss averages 0.9 kg/day during the first week and decreases to 0.3 kg/day by the third week.90 Initial rapid weight loss

is primarily caused by water and sodium diuresis.90,103 Other changes include decreased pulse rate9,35 and blood pressure (BP),9,35,37,104 as well as a transient small increase and then a slow drop in the basal met- abolic rate by about 1% per day until stabilizing at about 75% of nor- mal.104 Electrocardiography often demonstrates cardiac adaptations, including sinus bradycardia, decreased QRS complex and T-wave amplitude, elongation of the QT interval, and shifts to the right of the QRS and T-wave axes, which normalize upon refeeding.9,90,104,105 Physiological responses typically return to prefast levels upon caloric consumption.

# CLINICAL RESEARCH

Research, primarily conducted in model organisms, has uncovered several potentially health-promoting cellular and molecular responses to nutrient deprivation, such as hormone modulation, reduced oxida- tive stress, and increased autophagy.3,4 Additional research is needed to conclusively determine whether fasting produces similar mecha- nistic responses or how these responses might affect clinical outcomes in humans. A century of fasting literature1,106 and limited clinical evidence15,17,107-110 suggest that the method has beneficial health out- comes, but the substantial amount of data is largely inconclusive as a result of methodological limitations. For example, there are essentially no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy of fasting in the treatment of any disease. There is an unsubstantiated perception that therapeutic fasting is unsafe.5 The misconception is associated with a period during which an extreme form of water-only fasting was used to treat obesity.111,112 During this period, there were several deaths111,113-115 reported out of approximately 1000 documented fasting cases.112,116-123 These deaths could likely have been prevented had unintentionally harmful fasting practices, such as arbitrarily long fasting lengths, uninformed elec- trolyte monitoring and refeeding practices, and fasting patients with contraindications,114,120,124-129 not been used. Until recently, there were no peer-reviewed assessments of adverse events during fasting. A recent retrospective study describes the adverse events (AEs; classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and MedDRA terminology) that occurred during prolonged water- only fasting visits (2–40 days; n = 768) at a medically supervised fast- ing center.7 The study found that the highest-grade AEs experienced during the majority visits (72%; n = 555) were mild to moderate in nature and are known to commonly occur during fasting (e.g., nausea, back pain, headache, and presyncope). There were two serious adverse events (grade 4 hyponatremia on fasting day 7 and grade 3 dehydration on fasting day 3), which resolved without further complication, and there were zero deaths. Overall, the data suggest that the method is safe, when conducted under medical supervision using the protocol described. The following is a description of literature published on the effects of therapeutic fasting during which only water or, in some cases of early research, acaloric liquids and/or vitamin/mineral supplementa- tion was administered. Unfortunately, in many early publications, the fasting method was not adequately described, and these studies are not included here.

# CASE REPORTS

Case reports describe novel, informative clinical cases of 1 to 3 patients. They can inform clinicians and patients and guide the course of clinical research. In addition to the reports presented here, there are numerous case reports describing physiology and on the use of fasting to treat obesity.

## Appendicitis

A 46-year-old male presented with abdominal pain that was progres- sively worsening and tenderness with an accompanying mass in the lower right quadrant. He had a normal white blood cell count and slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A retroperitoneal sonogram confirmed an enlarged appendix. The patient opted to undergo a medically supervised, water-only fast for 7 days with 4 days of refeeding rather than surgically remove his appendix. He fasted and refed for 7 and 4 days, respectively. There were no serious complica- tions, and upon termination he had reduced abdominal swelling, no pain or fever, and a normal white blood count. He remained symp- tom-free at the 3-month, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up visits.107

## Follicular Lymphoma

A 42-year-old woman with stage IIIa, low-grade follicular lymphoma was reported in BMJ Case Reports. After a 21-day water-only fast fol- lowed by 10 days of supervised refeeding, her enlarged lymph nodes were no longer palpable and computerized tomography (CT) scans confirmed the size reduction. She did not undergo standard cancer treatment, has maintained a healthy lifestyle, and was symptom-free at the 6-month follow-up visit.15 At the 3-year follow-up visit, the patient remained symptom-free as indicated by CT/PET scans.

## Chronic Posttraumatic Headache

A 52-year-old woman with a 16-year history of chronic posttraumatic head- ache presented with a constant headache that was described as “dull and achy” with a pain level of 6 to 8/10 that did not improve with standard phar- maceutical medications. She underwent two 40-day medically supervised, water-only fasts with a 6-month intervening period of an exclusively plant- foods diet. At the end of the second fast, she was free of headache symp- toms with the exception of an occasional headache that lasted less than minutes with a pain level 1/10. Her body mass index (BMI) reduced from 33.1 kg/m2 to 18.8 kg/m2. There were no serious complications, and her serological values remained normal with the exception of slightly increased liver enzymes, which resolved upon refeeding. At the 5-year follow-up visit, she was still symptom-free and had maintained a normal BMI.110

# CLINICAL STUDIES

Studies on the clinical effects of fasting have been primarily observa- tional in nature. Many studies lack the necessary sample size and con- trols to conclusively determine outcomes. RCTs are needed to draw conclusions about this method.

## Cardiovascular Disease

Early studies suggest that fasting reduces serum triglycerides,130 BP,9,35,90,131 and symptoms of congestive heart failure.125 More recently, medically supervised, water-only fasting was shown to reduce borderline and high hypertension.14,109 In 68 consecutive patients with borderline high BP, an average of 13 days of water-only fasting reduced systolic BP by an average of 20 mm Hg, with 82% of patients achieving systolic BP below 120 mm Hg.109 In 174 consecutive patients with high BP, an average of 10 days of water-only fasting resulted in more than 90% of patients becoming normotensive. In patients with systolic BP greater than 180 mm Hg, the average reduction in systolic BP exceeded 60 mm Hg.108 Preliminary data also suggest that treatment of hypertension with a 14-day medically supervised, water-only fast could reduce combined medical and drug costs by almost $2700 per year per patient.132

commonly reported chemotherapy side effects.17,133 There is currently a randomized trial being conducted on the effects of 72 hours of water- only fasting in conjunction with chemotherapy.133

## Diabetes Mellitus

Reports, as early as 1912, suggest that prolonged water-only fasting improves diabetes.9,134,135 In obese diabetic patients, prolonged water- only fasting substantially improved most parameters of insulin func- tion independent of weight loss.136

## Epilepsy

Therapeutic fasting has been used since the early 1900s to treat sei- zures.135,137 Ketosis, initiated by fasting, decreased the duration, sever- ity, and number of seizures.138

## Autoimmune Disorders

Several reports suggest that fasting has a beneficial effect on autoim- mune disorders, such as chronic urticaria.139,140 It was found that fast- ing shortened the early stages of acute glomerulonephritis (reduced glomerular filtration rate, high BP, and edema) and improved progno- sis.141 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) appears to respond particularly well to fasting. Studies have shown that fasting in arthritis patients results in decreased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), arthralgia, pain, stiff- ness, and need for medication.142-149 Consistent with those findings, a study of 43 patients with definite or classic RA found that a water-only fast of 7 days significantly improved grip strength, pain, swelling of proximal interphalangeal joints, ESR, and functional activity.150

## Obesity

Therapeutic fasting as a treatment for obesity was popularized in the 1960s.81,111-114,117-119,121,122,125,131,151-153 In general, fasting results in an ini- tial weight loss of approximately 0.9 kg/day with a gradual decrease to 0.3 kg per day over 30 days.154 The initial weight lost is primarily that of water, glycogen, and sodium. A study monitoring 121 obese patients for approx- imately 7 years after fasting an average of 2 months found that after 2 to years, 50% of patients returned to their prefast weights, and that by the end of the study, 90% weighed the same as before their fasts.122


Although rigorous clinical research is lacking, there is substantial clin- ical anecdotal evidence supporting the use of medically supervised, therapeutic fasting as a safe and effective treatment for a variety of dis- eases. TrueNorth Health Center (TNHC), the only center in the United States that trains and certifies medical practitioners in water-only fast- ing,155 has conducted more than 20,000 medically supervised fasts since 1984. The vast majority of these patients benefited from fasting; less than 1% experienced a serious adverse event and no patients died.7 Clinicians at TNHC have observed improvement in diseases ranging from lupus to hyperhidrosis to follicular lymphoma. Additional thera- peutic fasting centers now exist in the United States, Canada, England, and Australia. Like TNHC, these centers follow the standards of care and principles of ethics established by the International Association of Hygienic Physicians.156 Therapeutic fasting conducted under medical supervision at an inpatient facility minimizes adverse events that can arise during fast- ing because clinical staff can monitor symptoms, order and analyze necessary clinical laboratory tests and procedures, approve adjunc- tive therapies, appropriately terminate the fast, and supervise post- fast recuperation. In most cases, fasting is therapeutically superior to a restricted diet because (1) hunger almost totally disappears,9,131 (2) ketosis occurs more quickly and efficiently,9,131 (3) famine edema does not occur,9 (4) sodium diuresis is more pronounced,112 (5) weight loss is greater and is typically from fat loss rather than protein catabolism, (6) healing time is shorter, and (7) patient strength may be greater.31 Restricted diets of vegetable broth or fruit and vegetable juices do not initiate fasting metabolic processes because they contain carbohy- drates, protein, and/or fat. Nonetheless, restricted diets are often use- ful before and after fasting, for patients in whom a healing crisis (i.e., where chronic conditions/symptoms become acute) develops during a fast, and when a fast is contraindicated.30 Therapeutic fasting can be described in three clinical stages (Table 37.4). It should be noted that the clinical stages of fasting do not directly correspond with the metabolic phases described previously. This is because rates of metabolic change occur at a faster rate than patients typically transition through clinical symptoms. For example, clinical stage I can last up to 7 days, at which time metabolism has already progressed into Phase IV or possibly Phase V. There is also a lack of data on how clinical symptoms directly correlate with the met- abolic changes that occur while fasting. Stage I, or early fasting, lasts up to 7 days during which patients can present with common detoxification symptoms of malaise, headaches, and muscle aches that are typically transitory. Patients often express con- cern for their health and a preoccupation with eating, but any desire for food is likely psychological and has little to do with serious physiological need. Stage II, or balanced fasting, is the most clinically significant fasting stage and can last for weeks to months. This stage typically begins after the patient has entered into a near-steady state of ketosis and adjusted from their dietary habits before fasting. Patients often experience one or more “healing crises” and/or go through less significant detoxification reactions. Extending a fast beyond a notable healing crisis/detoxification reaction rather than stopping midcourse may result in more beneficial health out- comes. During this time, health should gradually return; if not, the patient should be given a thorough medical evaluation. Stage III, also called star- vation, occurs when the body increases protein catabolism and can poten- tially damage essential tissue and, ultimately, terminate in death. Fasting should be discontinued before this stage begins. Predicting optimal fast length is difficult because it is based on many factors, including protein, fat, and electrolyte reserves, individual metabolism, mental health, finan- cial limitations, work and family obligations, severity of disease, age, and sex. Overall, “[the] doctor will look for good practical recovery where the patient is symptom free and signs of regeneration are present.”157 “Fasting to completion” (i.e., exhaustion of nutrient reserves) is no longer prac- ticed nor is it necessary, as consecutive fasting with intervening refeeding appears to be safer and as effective.157

severity during fasting and avoiding complications during refeeding. This diet also promotes prefast bowel movements, which should occur at least daily before fasting, as well as postfast bowel movements, which should quickly develop and pass without complication. It is necessary to adopt a health-promoting lifestyle, including a whole-plant-foods diet, postfast to maximize and maintain any benefits obtained while fasting. Consumption of 64 to 96 oz/day of pure water (distilled, filtered, or reverse osmosis) is recommended,31,158 but upwards of 160 oz is com- monly ingested without affecting serum sodium levels. Increased water intake appears to reduce detoxification reactions, but excess consump- tion can cause electrolyte imbalances that are clinically significant and require refeeding. Physiologically, the body is able to modulate “available water” through reduced obligatory water excretion (caused by lower excretion of urea, the major osmotic solute) and by accessing water released from fat catabolism.85 Upon refeeding there is a sudden shift from a low level of insulin and ketosis to a high level of insulin and glycolysis. As the plasma insulin rises, potassium, phosphate, and mag- nesium are driven intracellularly and sodium extracellularly, which dilutes the circulating concentrations.159,160 Sodium restriction during refeeding should be emphasized to not precipitate dilution, edema, or acute heart failure.78 In addition to maintaining optimal hydration, rest is essential during fasting. Patients may nap throughout the day. It is also common to experience reduced sleep at night, possibly because of decreased daily activity and increased daytime rest. Brief walks or light stretching are permissible. Rigorous exercise while fasting is discouraged because fuel conservation is necessary to maximize healing and avoid unnecessary gluconeogenesis.31,158 Even moderate activity can double caloric utiliza- tion.59 In serious chronic disease, an excess of activity has been suspected as cause of death during fasting.161 Sunlight is also important for general health during fasting, and patients should try to obtain 10 to 20 min/day. However, dehydration resulting from sun exposure can promote ortho- static hypotension and subsequent injury from falls. An increase in heart rate by 10 to 15 beats per minute may indicate excessive sun exposure.

# LABORATORY VALUES

Assessment of a fasting patient’s progress is not based on a single sign or symptom but on the total clinical picture. Therefore vital signs, including blood pressure and pulse, should be checked daily. Laboratory tests such as a complete blood count and serum chemistry panel and urinalysis are performed weekly and other tests are performed as necessary. Laboratory values during fasting are typically unique to the individual and disease process, but some general observations have been made.121,154

<!-- chunk -->

## Complete Blood Count

Complete blood counts usually show no significant change. Low hemoglobin and hematocrit values10,162 require that hemolysis or hemorrhage are ruled out, whereas elevations in hematocrit, hemoglo- bin, and red blood cell counts usually indicate reduced hydration.78,163 White blood cell (WBC) counts are usually unchanged or decrease slightly with fasting. However, WBCs may increase if infection is pres- ent or if WBC counts are low before fasting.

<!-- chunk -->

## Serum Electrolytes

Serum electrolyte levels are not good indicators of tissue stores, but they are considered the most important blood values during fasting because any significant change necessitates immediate clinical management. All electrolytes decrease over the course of a long fast as mobilized stores are lost, but stores appear to be redistributed even when distilled water is used during prolonged fasts. Serum calcium and chloride concentrations are usually stable but can decrease, especially if vomiting or diarrhea is pres- ent. There is a tendency for serum potassium concentrations to decrease, although they can also increase, and values less than 3 mmol/L or higher than 6 mmol/L often require the fast to be terminated. Similarly, serum sodium concentrations can decrease and values less than 130 mmol/L require immediate attention. The total body store of potassium is approx- imately 55 mEq/kg of body weight, of which 98% is intracellular.164,165 The total body store of sodium is estimated at 50 mEq/kg, of which approxi- mately 70% is exchangeable.166,167 The typical daily dietary intake of potas- sium is 3 to 5 g and sodium is 3 to 7 g. During early fasting, each day the body loses 1.6 to 1.8 g (40–45 mEq) of potassium and 3.5 to 5.8 g (150–250 mEq) of sodium, and these values eventually drop to 0.4 to 0.6 g (10–15 mEq) and 0.02 to 0.35 g (1–15 mEq), respectively.

<!-- chunk -->

## Liver Enzymes

During medically supervised fasting, the enzymes serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT/AST) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT/ALT) are used as biomarkers to assess liver func- tion. These values typically remain in the normal range. However, the values may increase considerably if liver disease is present and may rise even if liver disease is not present. This is usually not a cause for con- cern as values typically return to normal postfast. For example, at the end of a 40-day fast, an obese patient with a history of chronic phar- maceutical use had a substantial increase in both SGOT and SGPT val- ues. At the beginning of the patient’s second fast (6 months later), the values of both enzymes had normalized and had increased only slightly at the end of the second 40-day fast. The enzyme values were at the low end of the reference range at 3-month and 5-year follow-up visits.16

<!-- chunk -->

## Other Blood Values

Triglyceride, cholesterol, and uric acid levels usually rise during fast- ing,168,169 indicating mobilization of tissue stores. Postfast values often show a decrease from prefast values,168,170 but lipid panels may not nor- malize until 4 to 6 weeks postfast. Serum protein and pancreatic lipase and amylase values usually decline with fasting. A rise in blood urea nitro- gen (BUN) value may occur, but a decrease has also been reported.9,10 Serum creatinine levels can increase,170 remain stable,171 or decrease. In cases of increased levels, prompt retesting and/or fast termination are required. In cases of increased levels, prompt retesting and/or fast termi- nation are required. Blood glucose values drop in most patients.134,172 In some patients, values below 40 mg/dL have been observed and are not typically a cause for concern in the absence of additional signs of hypo- glycemia. If the blood glucose value is low before fasting, it may rise after fasting. ESR and C-reactive protein usually drop after fasting, although they may rise during the fast.148,149

<!-- chunk -->

## Urinalysis

Urinalysis is conducted weekly, but it might be difficult to interpret during fasting because the body discards considerable waste via the kidneys. It is not uncommon to see various types of casts, red blood cells, WBC, bilirubin (+1 to +2), protein (trace, +2), and ketones (+4) and, if liver disease is present, urobilinogen elevation. Trace leukocytes and blood are common incidental findings, particularly in women. Specific gravity is commonly elevated (possibly to 1.035), a finding that may reflect inadequate hydration.

## Adjunctive Care

<!-- chunk -->

## Dietary Supplements

During prolonged fasting, macro- and micronutrient imbalance is rare. Protein catabolism and vitamin and mineral excretion decreases as the fast progresses, and typically by day 10 is low enough to maintain homeo- stasis. Fast termination is preferred to supplementation. Problems such

## 299CHAPTER 37 Fasting

as nausea and indigestion have been reported when vitamin and min- eral supplements were taken during fasting.122,171 In a report describing vitamin deficiency during fasting, the actual fasting protocol was not described; in addition, the patient’s physical activity was not restricted and oral medication for intercurrent illness was maintained during fasting.122

<!-- chunk -->

## Enemas

Enemas are generally not administered or necessary if the fasting patient has daily, healthy bowel movements before fasting begins. To help prevent constipation, a raw and cooked plant-foods diet free from any additives, animal products, or refined carbohydrates for at least days will help promote bowel movement prefast and prevent postfast constipation. If bowel movements do not start early during refeeding, then precautionary methods to avoid fecal compaction should be con- sidered, including stewed prunes, enema, and/or colon hydrotherapy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hydrotherapy

Constitutional hydrotherapy and sitz baths have been implemented with fasting. Strong treatments, both in frequency and/or temperature interval size, should be limited to early fasting.

<!-- chunk -->

## Intravenous Therapy

Intravenous administration requires much care and is best avoided entirely, except for emergent conditions. Saline should be avoided as a result of plasma expansion and edema, which has precipitated acute heart failure. Glucose, in contrast, should be accompanied by vitamin B 1 and B 6 coadministration to avoid acute thiamine deficiency and lac- tic acidosis.173-175

<!-- chunk -->

## Pharmaceuticals

Pharmaceutical use is contraindicated during prolonged fasting. The pri- mary concern regarding fasting medicated patients is the potentiation of drug action during the fasted state, altered urinary/hepatic metabolism, and known drug side effects and adverse events. Appropriately remov- ing pharmaceuticals allows for ease of clinical assessment while ensuring patient safety. Successful fasts have been administered while maintaining some hormonal medications including insulin, thyroid, and reproduc- tive hormones, often at reduced dosage.

# CONTRAINDICATIONS

Contraindications to fasting are few, and each case must be judged individually (Table 37.5). For example, an inexperienced practitioner may assume that emaciated patients should not fast, but in cases of extreme emaciation a short fast (1–3 days) or a series of such short fasts with longer periods of proper intervening feeding may be beneficial.31 With regard to fasting contraindications Alec Burton stated: I have found few health problems which are absolute contraindi- cations to fasting. In my experience, if the need is evident, the only genuine contraindication is fear … . As for the other conditions often mentioned, e.g. kidney disease, heart impairment, [tuberculosis], etc., they merely require extreme caution, because of the limits imposed by pathology, but they are not inexorable contraindications.157 Relative contraindications to fasting include severe anemia, porphyria, cachexia, anorexia, severe liver or kidney disease, medium-chain acyl- CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, advanced cerebral vascular insufficiency, higher-grade cardiac arrhythmias, certain cancers or psychological dis- orders, and active gastric ulcer disease.176 Although fasting is contraindi- cated in severe renal insufficiency, patients with 65% renal function often normalize as a result of fasting and dietary management. Additionally, fasting pregnant women and children is controversial. Short, medically supervised fasts may be appropriate for pregnant women and children on an individual basis, but long fasts are typically strongly contraindicated and precaution is indicated. Doctors (e.g., Shelton, Benesh, Sidwha, and Burton) with considerable experience fasting pregnant women during all three trimesters have found no adverse effects with fasts of a few days to to 3 weeks, but there are insufficient data to conclude if the practice is safe. Fasting during lactation is not generally advised because milk flow is halted by fasting and is difficult to resume.31

# SIDE EFFECTS

Medically supervised, prolonged water-only fasting as a therapeutic pro- cedure is generally safe.7 Side effects of fasting are rarely serious, with the exception of rare electrolyte imbalance, but fasting may uncover disease and reveal weaknesses that were previously subclinical.117,177 Discomfort during fasting may be due to withdrawal from stimulants, hypoglycemia, acidosis, elimination of wastes, and enhancement of repair. Patients may experience headaches, insomnia, nausea, back pain, dyspepsia, fatigue, skin irritations, presyncope, coated tongue, body odor, aching limbs, palpitations, mucus discharge, and visual and hearing disturbances. Hair growth is usually arrested, and skin may become dry and scaly. Most signs and symptoms are usually brief in duration. In certain cases, complications occur that may necessitate breaking the fast prematurely. Examples of such conditions are shown in Table 37.5. Fasting also elevates serum uric acid values and uric acid excretion, and if fluid intake is insufficient, gout or renal stones may be precipi- tated.178 A few reports have also discussed the development of Wernicke encephalopathy during prolonged fasting,174,175 but this rarely occurs during therapeutic fasting. Therefore it is difficult to determine whether the condition is related to methodology. Furthermore, the incidence of death at fasting institutions is low, and there is no evidence in the scien- tific literature to suggest that fasting or starvation can be considered a cause of death. Death during fasting indicates that the remedial efforts of the body have been overpowered by the pathological process. This situa- tion occurs in serious disease, whether the patient is eating or fasting. In examining the fallacy of attributing the cause of death to fasting, Stewart and Fleming wrote, “Fasting short of emaciation is not hazardous; if death results, reasons other than those of the fast should be considered before concluding that all supervised fasts should be discouraged.”179


Prolonged water-only fasting conducted under medical supervision is increasingly recognized as a safe and effective therapy for a number of dis- eases, but the practice is not for everyone and postfast lifestyle modifica- tions are necessary to maintain any health benefits obtained from fasting. Preliminary research indicates that there is at least some degree of overlap between the physiological responses induced by caloric restriction, inter- mittent fasting, prolonged fasting, and exercise, such as increased auto- phagy and insulin sensitivity.3,180-184 Additional research is necessary to determine the extent to which these methods induce similar physiologi- cal responses in humans and if the responses result in clinical health out- comes. Nonetheless, used alone or in combination, these natural therapies could help reduce the overwhelming rates of chronic diseases that humans are experiencing globally. As it is more beneficial and cost effective to maintain rather than repair health, it will be important to determine the effect of these therapies on health span over the course of a life.

precipitation method is that no toxic solvents are used to separate the fatty material. The downside is the increased salt content of the product.

<!-- chunk -->

## Freeze-Drying

The freeze-drying process involves quickly freezing the glandular material at temperatures of −40°F to −60°F and then placing the mate- rial into a vacuum chamber, which removes the water by direct vapor- ization from its frozen state (hence the term freeze-drying). The benefit of freeze-drying is that the product contains a higher concentration of unaltered protein, enzymes, and all of the fat-soluble components. Because the fat is not removed, it is critical that the glands are derived from livestock that have grazed on open ranges not sprayed with pes- ticides or herbicides. The animals must also be free from antibiotics, synthetic hormones, and infection.

<!-- chunk -->

## Predigestion

The predigestion method employs plant and animal enzymes or some other method to partially digest or hydrolyze the glandular material. The partially digested material is then passed through a series of fil- trations to separate out fat-soluble and large molecules. The purified material is then freeze-dried. This method of extraction is best for glandulars (e.g., liver and thymus) where the polypeptide and other water-soluble fractions are desired.

# SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY

Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as mad cow disease, is a transmissible, slowly progressive, degenerative, fatal dis- ease affecting the central nervous system of adult cattle. The trans- missible agent in BSE is a modified form of a normal cell surface component known as a prion protein. Unlike infectious organisms, prions are resistant to common treatments, such as heat and diges- tive secretions. Eating the meat of an animal with BSE may lead to a disease similar to BSE in humans called variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD). BSE was first reported among cattle in the United Kingdom in and has been a major concern since then. The outbreak in the United Kingdom may have started from the feeding of scrapie-contaminated sheep meat-and-bone meal to cattle. Scrapie is a disease of sheep that is related to BSE in cattle. The evidence is strong that the outbreak in cat- tle was amplified in the United Kingdom by feeding rendered bovine meat-and-bone meal to young calves. BSE has been reported in cattle throughout Europe. There has been a single case in Canada and in the United States from a cow imported from Canada. Wild game in the United States, such as deer and elk, have been affected by a similar disease known as chronic wasting dis- ease. The reason American cattle have been spared may be because of the active surveillance and import measures taken by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA has restricted the importation of live ruminants, such as cows and sheep, and food products from these animals from BSE countries since 1989 and from all European countries since 1997. In addition, the FDA prohibits the use of most mammalian protein in the manufacture of animal feeds given to ruminants because this kind of feeding practice is believed to have initiated and amplified the out- break of BSE in the United Kingdom. To reduce the risk of ingesting beef with BSE, it is critical to use products manufactured under the following guidelines: • The June 2000 European Commission Decision regulating the use of material presenting risks for BSE • A “Certification of Suitability” by the European Directorate of Quality of Medicines to ensure that the highest-quality, pharma- ceutic-grade material is being used • The FDA’s guidelines for sourcing and processing of bovine material The incidence of all prion diseases (Kuru, CJD, Gerstmann– Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia) world- wide is about 1 to 2 per million people per year.1

# EVIDENCE FOR INTACT PROTEIN ABSORPTION

There is now considerable evidence that large macromolecules pass intact from the normal human gut into the bloodstream. In some instances, the body appears to recognize which molecules it needs to absorb intact and which molecules it needs to break down into smaller units. This phenomenon may help explain the effectiveness of glandular therapy. Numerous whole proteins have been shown in human and ani- mal studies to be absorbed intact into the bloodstream after oral administration.2–8 These include human albumin and lactalbumin, bovine albumin, ovalbumin, lactoglobulin, ferritin (molecular weight 500,000), chymotrypsinogen, elastase, and other large molecules. Furthermore, proteins and polypeptides, as well as various hor- mones that are absorbed intact from the gut, have been shown to exert effects in target tissues. For example, in addition to thyroxine or thy- roid hormone and cortisone, several peptide hormones are known to be biologically active when administered orally, including luteinizing hormone–releasing factor and thyrotropin-releasing hormone.9,10 Even insulin has been shown to be absorbed orally under certain cir- cumstances (e.g., in the presence of protease inhibitors or hypertonic solutions in the intestines).11,12 These data indicate that at least some of the larger molecules in glan- dular products are absorbed intact to induce physiological effects, par- ticularly polypeptides, which exert hormone or hormone-like action.


An adequate body of research now exists to support the use of orally administered glandular extracts. The following is a brief discussion of several glandular preparations and their use. Table 38.1 lists the pri- mary conditions responding to glandular therapy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Adrenal Extracts

Oral adrenal extracts have been used in medicine since at least 1931.13 Adrenal extracts may be made from the whole adrenal gland or just from the adrenal cortex. Whole adrenal extracts (usually in combination with essential nutrients for the adrenal gland) are most often used in cases of low adrenal function, presenting as fatigue, inability to cope with stress, and reduced resistance. Because extracts made from the adrenal cortex contain small amounts of corticoste- roids, they are typically used as a “natural” cortisone in severe cases of allergy and inflammation (e.g., asthma, eczema, psoriasis, rheu- matoid arthritis).


The dosage of adrenal extract depends on the quality and potency of the product. The best measure of an effective dose for a preparation may be the level of stimulation (irritability, restlessness, and insomnia) the patient experiences. When prescribing adrenal extracts, start at one third of the recommended dosage on the label and slowly increase the dosage every 2 days until a stimulatory effect is noted. Once this effect is noticed, reduce the dosage to a level just below the level that pro- duces stimulation.

## Aortic Glycosaminoglycans

A mixture of highly purified bovine-derived glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is naturally present in the aorta, including dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, and chondroitin sulfate; related hexosaminoglycans have been shown to protect and promote normal artery and vein function. More than 50 clinical studies have shown an orally administered complex of aortic GAGs to be effective in a num- ber of vascular disorders, including the following: • Cerebral and peripheral arterial insufficiency • Venous insufficiency and varicose veins • Hemorrhoids • Vascular retinopathies, including macular degeneration postsurgi- cal edema14–23 Significant improvements in both symptoms and blood flow have been noted. In addition, aortic GAGs have many important effects that interfere with the progression of atherosclerosis, including prevention of dam- age to the surface of the artery, formation of damaging blood clots, migration of smooth muscle cells into the intima, formation of fat and cholesterol deposits, and lowering total cholesterol levels while raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.24–28


The dosage of the mixture of highly purified bovine-derived GAGs naturally present in the aorta is 100 mg/day. Similar, but not nearly as impressive, results in the treatment of atherosclerosis have been noted with chondroitin sulfate at a daily dose of 3 g (1 g, three times daily).29

## Liver Extracts

Beef (bovine) liver extracts and concentrates are a rich natural source of many vitamins and minerals, including iron. Liver extracts can con- tain as much as 3 to 4 mg of heme iron per gram. In addition to its use as a source of iron and other nutrients, hydrolyzed liver extracts have been used to treat chronic liver diseases since 1896. Numerous scientific investigations into the therapeutic efficacy of liver extracts demonstrated that these extracts improved fat utilization, promoted tissue regeneration, and prevented damage to the liver.30–33 In short, clinical studies demonstrated that oral administration of hydrolyzed liver extracts can be quite effective in improving liver function. For example, in one double-blind study, 556 patients with chronic hepatitis were given either 70 mg of liver hydrolysate or a placebo three times daily.33 After 3 months of treatment, the group that received the liver extract had far lower serum liver enzyme levels. Because the level of liver enzymes in the blood reflects damage to the liver, it can be con- cluded that liver extract is effective in chronic hepatitis via an ability to improve the function of damaged liver cells, and to prevent further damage to the liver.


The dosage is entirely dependent on the concentration, method of preparation, and quality of the liver extract. The highest-qual- ity products are aqueous hydrolyzed extracts because they have the fat-soluble components removed and typically contain more than times the nutritional content of raw liver, including 3 to 4 mg of heme iron per gram.

## Contraindication

Liver extracts should not be used in patients experiencing an iron- storage disorder, such as hemochromatosis.

## Pancreatic Extracts

Pancreatic enzymes are most often employed in the treatment of pancreatic insufficiency. Pancreatic insufficiency is characterized by impaired digestion, malabsorption, nutrient deficiencies, and abdom- inal discomfort. Pancreatic enzymes are also used by physicians in the treatment of the following: • Cystic fibrosis • Inflammatory and autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, athletic injuries, and tendinitis • Cancer • Infections For a full discussion of pancreatic enzymes, see Chapter 111.

Full-strength products are preferred to lower-potency pancreatin products because lower-potency products are often diluted with salt, lactose, or galactose to achieve the desired strength (e.g., 4× or 1×). The dosage recommendation for a 10× U.S. Pharmacopoeia (USP) pancreatic enzyme product is 500 to 1000 mg three times a day imme- diately before meals when used as a digestive aid and at least 20 min- utes before meals or on an empty stomach when anti-inflammatory effects are desired. Pancreatic extracts are generally well tolerated and are not associ- ated with any significant side effects.

## Spleen Extracts

As early as the 1930s, orally administered bovine spleen extracts were shown to possess some physiological action in increasing white blood cell counts in patients with extreme deficiencies of white blood cells and being of some benefit in patients with malaria and typhoid fever.34–36 Like thymus extracts, pharmaceutical-grade bovine spleen extracts are currently quite popular in Germany for the treatment of infectious conditions and as immune-enhancing agents in cancer. Spleen tissue extracts may be of benefit in enhancing general immune function because many potent immune system–enhancing compounds secreted by the spleen are low-molecular-weight peptides. For example, the potent immunostimulants tuftsin and splenopentin are composed of only four and five amino acids, respectively. Both tuftsin and splenopentin have been shown to exert profound immune-enhancing activity. Tuftsin stimulates macrophages that have taken up residence in specific tissues like the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. Tuftsin also helps mobilize other white blood cells to fight against infection and cancer. A deficiency of tuftsin has been associated with signs and symptoms of frequent infections.37 Splenopentin, like tuftsin, has also demonstrated significant immune-enhancing effects. Its effects are primarily directed toward enhancing the immune system’s response to regulating compounds such as colony-stimulating factors.38 Colony-stimulating factors, such as interleukin-3, and granulocyte/macrophage colony–stimulating factors stimulate the production of white blood cells. Splenopentin is probably the factor responsible for the results noted in clinical studies during the 1930s in which spleen extracts were used in the treatment of depressed white blood cell counts. Splenopentin has also been shown to enhance the activity of natural killer cells.39 Natural killer cells destroy cells that have become can- cerous or infected with viruses and are the body’s first line of defense against cancer. In addition to tuftsin and splenopentin, hydrolyzed (predigested) spleen extracts concentrated for peptides demonstrated impressive immune restorative properties in mice.40 In one study, mice were exposed to radiation to significantly damage the immune system. Mice treated with the spleen extract recovered within 6 to 8 weeks. In contrast, those treated with a placebo recovered after 10 weeks at the earliest. The primary clinical uses of spleen extracts are after removal of the spleen, and the conditions associated with low spleen function (hypo- splenia) are shown in Table 38.2. Spleen extracts may also be useful in the treatment of low white blood cell counts, bacterial infections, and as an adjunct in cancer ther- apy. Individuals who have had splenectomies or who have low tuftsin levels or autoimmune conditions linked to low activity of the reticulo- endothelial system should use spleen extracts. Because the spleen is difficult to repair, severe spleen trauma usu- ally requires splenectomy to stop the severe hemorrhage. The spleen is also removed in the medical treatment of certain diseases, such as idiopathic thrombocytic purpura and to determine the extent of Hodgkin disease. Removal of the spleen is associated with an increased risk for infection. This increased risk of infection makes children and adults particularly susceptible to pneumococcal pneumonia. About 2.5% of patients who have their spleen removed die of pneumococcal pneu- monia within 5 years of splenectomy. It is often recommended that a child who has undergone a splenectomy receive a pneumococcal vac- cine and receive long-term antibiotic treatment. Use of spleen extracts, especially those rich in tuftsin, may be a natural alternative. Spleen extracts should probably be viewed as a necessary medicine for people who have had their spleen removed. If the thyroid, adrenals, or ovaries are removed, most patients would be prescribed the corre- sponding hormone. It only makes sense that if the spleen is removed, the body should be supplied with necessary spleen substances like tuftsin and splenopentin. The increased risk of infection is attributed primarily to a defi- ciency of tuftsin.41,42 Tuftsin is produced only in the spleen; without the spleen, there simply is no tuftsin in the circulation. Without tuftsin, the body is without one of its key stimulators of the immune system. Individuals without spleens need an outside source of tuftsin, like spleen extracts.


Clinically, hydrolyzed (predigested) products concentrated for tuftsin and splenopentin content are preferable to crude preparations. The daily dose should provide 50 mg tuftsin and splenopentin or roughly 1.5 g of total spleen peptides. No side effects or adverse effects have been reported with the use of oral spleen preparations.

## Polyerga

Before the development of manufacturing techniques for human insu- lin to be used in the treatment of diabetes, the source was insulin iso- lated from pig pancreas. In Germany, after World War II, there was a shortage of pigs and subsequently a shortage of insulin. A German researcher, Walter Kuhlmey, MD, PhD, subsequently sought to pro- duce insulin from other animal organs, most notably the spleen. In the process, this led to the serendipitous discovery of Polyerga. Kuhlmey found that the pig spleen extract not only had some insulin-like activ- ity but that it also increased the general sense of well-being and gave people more energy. He named his new product Polyerga (in Latin, poly means “multiple,” and erga means “power”). Initially, Polyerga had a general use. In 1951 an event changed Polyerga’s clinical use. Julia Meir was a patient of oncologist Heinrich Pophanken, MD. She had an advanced cancer of the pancreas. She was considered incurable, and her death was expected shortly. In an effort to ease her pain, lift her fatigue, and stimulate a sense of well-being in Julia, Pophanken gave her Polyerga (via injection). Surprisingly, the

dying patient began to recover. Pophanken gave Julia three to six intra- muscular injections of Polyerga per week during the first 2 months and then just two injections a week thereafter. In 1954 Julia died of causes unrelated to her cancer. When the autopsy was conducted, the egg-sized tumor in her pancreas had disappeared entirely. This single case history led to the focus of research on Polyerga as a cancer therapy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cancer Therapy

Polyerga has been evaluated in several clinical studies in cancer patients. In one of the largest trials, 158 breast cancer patients were divided into two groups. The women in the Polyerga group received injections of Polyerga three times per week, whereas the women in the control group received a placebo injection. In the Polyerga group, the percentage of white blood cells, various parameters of immune func- tion, body weight, and general sense of well-being all improved signifi- cantly compared with the control group.43 In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with head and neck cancers, Polyerga was shown to support patients who received the chemotherapy drugs 5-FU and cisplatin.44 Polyerga was shown to stabilize the levels of lymphocytes. Typically, patients receiving 5-FU, cisplatin, and other chemotherapy drugs experienced a reduction in lymphocytes. This effect was noted in the placebo group but not in the patients receiving Polyerga. In addition, the Polyerga group reported less fatigue and higher energy levels than the placebo group, and there was no weight loss. Prevention of weight loss is a major goal in sup- port of the cancer patient because significant weight loss reduces the tolerance to anticancer drugs, reduces the functioning of the immune system, and is considered to be a major cause of death in the cancer patient. In another study of 248 cancer patients, giving them Polyerga orally for 4 months improved appetite, reduced pain, increased energy and activity levels, and improved their general sense of well-being.45 Furthermore, a reduction of the extent of the illness, along with a clear improvement of health, was recorded by observing physicians. The best results were obtained in breast cancer patients and patients expe- riencing colon and other carcinomas, whereas lung cancer patients and patients with metastases did not seem to respond as well to Polyerga. Other studies have shown Polyerga to produce similar benefits, as well as enhance survival time and reduce metastasis (spreading) in patients with cancers of the colon, stomach, and lungs.46 From the totality of existing clinical studies, animal studies, and test tube (in vitro) studies, it can be concluded that Polyerga does the following: • Exerts significant immune-enhancing effects • Prevents some side effects of chemotherapy, especially the detri- mental effects on the immune system • Enhances the effectiveness of conventional chemotherapy and radi- ation treatment • Prevents metastasis • Enhances the general sense of well-being, improves energy levels, and prevents detrimental weight loss in cancer patients • Enhances both the quality of life and survival time in cancer patients

<!-- chunk -->

## The Mechanism of Action

Many effects of Polyerga may be the result of boosting the output of γ -interferon.47 This important chemical acts as the communication link between the macrophages and lymphocytes. Reduction in the level of γ -interferon results in significantly impaired immune function. Low γ -interferon levels are common in cancer patients. By increasing γ -interferon levels, Polyerga creates a cascading of effects that lead to enhanced immune function in cancer patients. Polyerga increases the activation of natural killer cells.48–51

<!-- chunk -->

## Other Uses

Polyerga may be helpful any time immune support is required, such as in chronic viral infections, including hepatitis C, human immu- nodeficiency virus (HIV), and Epstein–Barr syndrome. In a study of 10 patients with chronic hepatitis B, Polyerga administration (intra- muscularly twice weekly and orally three tablets daily for 24 weeks) led to complete resolution in 3 of the 10 patients and lowering of liver enzymes in individuals with lower viral loads.52 Polyerga may also be quite helpful to people who have had their spleens removed.


Most studies with Polyerga used injectable preparations. Based on dose-effect studies in animals, as well as human clinical data, an effec- tive oral dosage was determined. Each Polyerga tablet contains mg of polypeptides. The optimum dosage recommendation is one to two tablets three times per day. For patients up to 140 lb body weight, the dosage is one tablet three times per day. For each additional 40 lb body weight, add a tablet (e.g., a 220-lb person would take five tab- lets daily in divided dosages). There is no toxicity with Polyerga, so there is no concern about overdosage.53 However, taking more than the recommended dose does not necessarily produce better results. For best results, Polyerga should be ingested on an empty stomach before meals.

## Thymus Extracts

A substantial amount of clinical research supports the effectiveness of orally administered thymus extracts. Specifically, numerous clinical trials have shown that oral administration of predigested calf thymus extract, rich in thymus-derived polypeptides, is effective in doing the following: • Preventing recurrent respiratory infections in children • Correcting the T-cell defects in HIV infections (acquired immuno- deficiency syndrome [AIDS]) • Treating acute hepatitis B infections • Restoring the number of peripheral leukocytes in cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced depression of white blood cell counts • Treating asthma, hay fever, and food allergies in children54,55 The effectiveness of the thymus extract in these conditions is reflec- tive of broad-spectrum immune system enhancement presumably mediated by improved thymus gland activity. This effect fits in nicely with one of the basic concepts of glandular therapy (i.e., that the oral ingestion of glandular material of a certain animal gland strengthens the corresponding human gland). The result is a broad general effect indicative of improved glandular function. Interestingly, thymus extracts have been shown to normalize the ratio of T-helper cells to suppressor cells, whether the ratio is low, as in AIDS, chronic infec- tions, and cancer, or high, as in allergies, migraine headaches, and autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.

<!-- chunk -->

## Chronic Viral Infections

Recurrent or chronic infections, including chronic fatigue syndrome and chronic postviral syndrome, are characterized by a depressed immune system. This is a difficult condition to treat because of the repetitive cycle of a compromised immune system leading to infection, which leads to damage to the immune system, further weakening resis- tance to viral infection. Thymus extracts may provide the answer to chronic infections by restoring healthy immune function. The ability of thymus extracts to treat and then reduce the number of recurrent infections has been studied in groups of children with a history of recurrent respiratory tract infections. Controlled clini- cal studies revealed not only that orally administered thymus extracts were able to effectively eliminate infection, but also that treatment

<!-- chunk -->

## 306SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

over the course of a year significantly reduced the number of respi- ratory infections and significantly improved numerous immune parameters.56 One of the most difficult viral infections for the body to elim- inate is type B viral hepatitis. Thymus extracts have been shown to be effective in several clinical studies in both acute and chronic cases. In these studies, a therapeutic effect was noted by accelerated decreases of liver enzymes (transaminases), elimination of the virus, and a higher rate of seroconversion to anti-HBe, signifying clinical remission.57,58 The most extreme example of a chronic viral infection is AIDS. Although thymus extracts have not been shown to reverse this diffi- cult disease, studies have shown an ability to improve several immune parameters, including an ability to increase the T-helper cells, a critical goal in AIDS treatment.59

<!-- chunk -->

## Cancer

The primary application of thymus extracts in cancer has been to counteract the immune-suppressing effects of radiation and chemo- therapy. The net effect of thymus extract administration is to prevent the tremendous depression of white blood cell levels and activity that result from chemotherapy or radiation.55,60

<!-- chunk -->

## Allergies

In patients with allergies, levels of the allergic immunoglobulin-E antibody and eosinophils are typically elevated, whereas levels of sup- pressor T cells are typically depressed. These abnormalities are clear indications of altered immune function. The oral administration of thymus extracts has been shown in double-blind clinical studies to improve the symptoms and course of hay fever, allergic rhinitis, asthma, eczema, and food allergies.55,61–63 Presumably, this clinical improvement is the result of the restoration of proper immune function because levels of immunoglobulin-E and eosinophils have been shown to be reduced, whereas the ratio of helper to suppressor T cells is improved. Interestingly, in several clinical studies, children receiving thymus extracts during food allergy elimination diets were often able to tolerate foods that had previously been allergenic and symptom producing.62,63

<!-- chunk -->

## Autoimmune Disorders

Autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are charac- terized by autoimmunity. Central to this immune dysfunction is a high ratio of T-helper to suppressor cells. A high ratio of T-helper to suppressor cells results in increased antibody formation. The higher the ratio, the higher the number of antibodies being produced to damage body structures. In one clinical study, rheumatoid arthritis patients with a ratio of T-helper to suppressor cells of 3.3 achieved normal ratios (1.02–2.46) after 3 months of therapy with a thymus extract.55 Although the use of a thymus extract may not result in substan- tial clinical improvement, it appears to be useful in restoring proper immune function in autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and scleroderma.


From a practical view, products concentrated and standardized for polypeptide content are preferable to crude preparations. The daily dose should be equivalent to 120 mg pure polypeptides with molecular weights less than 10,000, or roughly 750 mg of the crude polypeptide fraction. No side effects or adverse effects have been reported with the use of thymus preparations.

## Thyroid Extracts

Desiccated natural thyroid is available by prescription according to USP guidelines. Preparations are derived from porcine thyroid glands. Many naturopathic physicians prefer natural thyroid to isolated syn- thetic T 4 because it contains both thyroxine (T 4 ) and tri-iodothyronine (T 3 ). Typical levels of thyroid hormone contained per grain in USP thyroid are 38 mcg of T 4 and 9 mcg of T 3 . The thyroid extracts sold as “nutritional supplements” are required by the FDA to be thyroxine-free. However, it is nearly impossible to remove all the hormone from the gland. These nutritional thyroid preparations can be considered milder forms of desiccated natural thyroid. The primary use of thyroid preparations is in the medical treatment of hypothyroidism. In all but its mildest forms, treatment involves the use of desiccated thyroid or synthetic thyroid hormone. For more dis- cussion, see Chapter 209.


Dosage is determined by clinical evaluation, including blood measure- ments of thyroid hormones (see Chapter 209 for directions).


From the scientific data that currently exist, there is enough evidence to support the use of orally administered glandular extracts. For the best results, physicians should choose glandular products made by rep- utable companies that employ established methods of manufacture to produce extracts of known concentration.

## 308SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

astringent qualities yet had no specific action on fevers. As an exper- iment, Hahnemann took four drachms of cinchona twice daily and soon developed the paroxysmal symptoms characteristic of intermit- tent fevers. This duplication of symptoms was a revelation to him and ulti- mately resulted in his formulation of the concept of determining the properties of a medicine by studying its effects on healthy humans. Although homeopathy offers a profoundly deep and unified evalu- ation in the treatment of chronic diseases (see the section “Follow-Up and Case Evaluation”), it gained most of its early reputation in the treatment of acute and epidemic diseases. An uproar was caused in Cincinnati in 1849 when two immigrant German homeopaths, treat- ing cholera with camphor and other homeopathically prescribed rem- edies, published statistics in newspapers indicating that only 35 of their 1116 treated cases had died. During the 19th century, 33% to 50% of patients with cholera who were given standard medical care died. In the 1879 epidemic of yellow fever, New Orleans homeopaths treated 1945 cases with a mortality rate of 5.6%, whereas standard medical doctors were losing 16% of patients. These and similar statistics had a profound effect on Congress and public opinion.2 Over time, homeopaths established their own network of treatment facilities. By 1892, in the United States, they controlled 110 hospitals, 145 dispensaries, 62 orphan asylums and retirement homes, more than 30 nursing homes and sanatoria, and 16 insane asylums. Constantine Hering established the first homeopathic medical school in the United States in 1835. It later moved from its original site in Allentown, Pennsylvania, to Philadelphia, where it remains today as an orthodox medical school: the Hahnemann Medical College and Hospital. Hering’s promotion of homeopathy and development of the materia medica were equaled only by Hahnemann himself. Hering’s 10-volume work, The Guiding Symptoms of Our Materia Medica, remains a definitive work on the clinical verifications of the homeo- pathic approach. Unfortunately, of the many medicines introduced by Hering, only nitroglycerine remains in orthodox medical practice as a tribute to his medical genius. Throughout the world, homeopathy has maintained a consistent tradition. Frederick Harvey Foster Quinn introduced it to England in the 1840s. It has since become a postgraduate medical specialty, recog- nized by the Department of Health by virtue of an Act of Parliament. Homeopathic hospitals and outpatient clinics are part of England’s national health system. Homeopaths have been engaged as personal physicians to the royal family for the past four generations. Homeopathy is widely practiced in Europe, India, Argentina, and Mexico and is experiencing a renaissance in the United States.

## Provings

Hahnemann defined his method of testing medicines on healthy peo- ple as “provings.” He expanded his investigations to include a wide range of substances, using his family, friends, and associates as exper- imental subjects. Historically, Hahnemann was not the first to use this methodology. In 1760 Anton Stoerck reported testing stramonium (Datura) by rub- bing it on the skin, inhaling the vapors of the freshly crushed leaves, and finally, ingesting the fresh extract. He theorized that if stramonium disturbs the senses and produces mental derangements in healthy peo- ple, it might be administered to maniacs for the purpose of restoring the senses by effecting a change of ideas. The medical literature contains examples of inadvertent provings: in 1983 a study in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that pyridoxine (vitamin B 6 ), which is used in the treatment of some types of peripheral neuropathy, was also capable of producing neuropa- thies when given in large doses.3 In 1796 Hahnemann published, in Hufeland’s Journal, the fruit of his investigations in the article “Essay on a New Principle for Ascertaining the Curative Power of Drugs, with a Few Glances at Those Hitherto Employed.”

## Like Treating Like

Hahnemann also recognized the tendency of a natural disease to have a “homeopathic effect” (i.e., a preventive or therapeutic effect) on other diseases with similar symptomatology. Although he ascribed this to the stimulation of the organism to eradicate the disease, he felt the deliber- ate induction of a disease to be difficult, uncertain, and dangerous.4 This concept has many parallels in modern medical science. Descriptions of viral interference under natural conditions were described in 1937 by G. Findlely and F. MacCallum, who found that monkeys infected with the Rift Valley fever virus were protected from the more fatal yellow fever virus. They adopted the term “virus interference” and believed that when one virus infects a group of cells, a second virus is somehow excluded.5 This eventually led to the discovery of interferon in 1957 by Alick Isaacs and Jean Lindenmann. These methods of inducing self-regulation are critical in enhancing the body’s ability to recognize and resolve illness. In 1799 Hahnemann gained increased professional acceptance of his ideas by the successful application of Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade) in the prevention and treatment of scarlet fever (which had at that time reached epidemic proportions). In 1860 it was recom- mended as the treatment of choice in the National Dispensatory, which stated: “As long as persons are under the influence of belladonna the liability to contract scarlatina is very much diminished.”6

## The Organon of Medicine

In 1810 Hahnemann published his Organon of Medicine, a book that, through six editions, formed the foundation and definition of the homeopathic practice of medicine. It contains the philosophy, obser- vations, and clinical applications of homeopathy, as well as citations from the historical and current literature of the time. Hahnemann challenged the reductionistic and mechanistic practices of his time, stating that the nature of disease is dynamic and cannot be defined by isolating processes, grasping for an explanation. He further asserted that the cause of disease could not be known and that the categori- zation of disease states and attempts to manipulate physiology were insufficient because they did not address the integrity and complexity of the organization of the organism as a whole. He described this organization as dynamic, meaning “in accor- dance with the animating principle of life,” which is the underlying energetic pattern to which matter conforms. Disease is therefore addressed descriptively in the context of the whole patient, with the patient’s unique symptoms being indicative of that individual’s vital response to the condition. For any given disease there may be a long list of remedies that have been clinically effective, but it is the individualization and differentiation among medicines, based on the patient’s unique indications, that leads to a successful homeopathic prescription.

## Vitalism

Disease, in the homeopathic model, is thought to arise from inherent or developed weaknesses in the patient’s defense mechanisms, creating a susceptibility to “morbific influences” (e.g., toxic factors in the envi- ronment, bacteria, psychological stresses). This viewpoint is consid- ered “vitalistic” (see Chapter 2, Hierarchy of Healing, and Chapter 5, Philosophy of Naturopathic Medicine, for further discussion), and although it does not deny a corporeal reality, it considers pathology to be but a singular focus in a complex net of interactions.

## 309CHAPTER 39 Homeopathy

William Boyd, in A Textbook of Pathology, discussed the limitations of the causal approach to disease currently in vogue in medicine when he stated7: We must admit, however unwillingly, that we seldom or never really know the cause of anything. Many a beautiful idea has been slain by ugly fact. We merely note a constant association with one thing always following another. We say that the tubercle bacillus is the cause of tuberculosis. That is merely another way of saying that the bacillus is associated with a constant type of lesion; it is no explanation of how the lesions are produced by the bacillus. Nor does it explain why some persons and animals are susceptible to the infection while others are immune. Vitalism can be better understood in the context of Hahnemann’s time, when theories of the causation of disease and its treatment abounded, such as Galen’s doctrine that the secondary quality of a medicine (i.e., its action on the disease) could be determined from its primary qualities, such as its taste or smell; the evaluation of medi- cines by the study of their interactions when mixed with human blood in a jar; iatrochemistry, which had been reduced from the Paracelsian application of spagyric tinctures or oils of metals to dangerous toxic doses; the classification of drugs according to the Dioscoridian approach, which was based on the physiological action (e.g., diuresis, diaphoresis) and chemical composition; and the “doctrine of signa- tures,” which held that the outer form and color of a plant revealed its inner archetypal action.8,9 Although some studies of the effects of medicinal agents were done with animals, Hahnemann observed that they had different effects on humans; pigs could safely eat Nux vomica in quantities that would immediately kill humans. Dogs could eat Aconitum napellus, a deadly poison to humans, without injury. He also rejected the method of test- ing drugs by studying their effects on the sick as haphazard and unre- liable, particularly because the results being sought were often only symptomatic relief rather than eradication of the disease state. Hahnemann defined the application of medicines whose purpose was to alter physiology or act as an antagonist to disease as the prac- tice of “allopathy” (allo, meaning “contrary” in Greek). The current dominant medical system is heavily influenced by the causal and allo- pathic paradigms. This results in the diagnosis being the focal point of practice, without which appropriate therapy cannot be instituted. The pharmacological approach is usually limited to the end results of disease rather than the origins of pathogenesis. Subsequent problems are classified as unwanted side effects because only the primary action of the pharmaceutical agent is used for treating a specific disease state. By focusing on only the primary effects of a drug, a diverse remaining range of physiological, as well as psychological effects, is ignored. In the homeopathic model, the side effects are an important part of the agent’s action and the body’s response to it; by ignoring them, a drug’s range of usefulness is greatly limited, whereas its toxicity is increased. Hahnemann’s empiric investigations not only led to new applications of medicines but also provided a method for integrating the physical, mental, and emotional effects of a drug. This allowed the treatment of the totality of a patient’s symptoms as a dynamic pattern of interaction. Vitalists stress the teleological behavior of organisms (i.e., the goal directedness and design in biological phenomena). Disease is there- fore regarded as a positive expression of the organism’s self-regulatory process in response to environmental or other stresses. Disease is not accidental but is rather the effort of the organism to ward off deeper or more internal disorganization. It is the natural wisdom of the body, the vis medicatrix naturae, or, using current scientific terminology, the tendency of the body to maintain homeostasis. Medical intervention often acts in conflict with these vital intracellular and extracellular reg- ulatory functions. Karl Menninger, in 1948, commented on this medical dilemma10: I believe that clinicians have come to think more and more in terms of a disturbance in the total economics of the personality, a tem- porary overwhelming of the efforts of the organism to maintain a continuous internal and external adaptation to continuously changing relationships, threats, pressures, instinctive needs and reality demands … It is the imbalance, the organismic disequi- librium, which is the real pathology, and when that imbalance reaches a degree or duration that threatens the comfort or survival of the individual, it may correctly be denoted disease. Homeopathy is a method of specific induction of nonspecific resis- tance that stimulates the body’s inherent defense and self-regulatory mechanisms, rather than taking over a function of the body, initiating dependency on the medicine itself.

# THE CLINICAL APPLICATION OF HOMEOPATHIC

# PRINCIPLES

The homeopathic clinical and therapeutic process consists of three interrelated processes: case taking, evaluation, and prescribing. The process is comprehensive and engages the observations of the patient as well as those of the doctor. Hahnemann described the process in paragraphs 84 to 103 of the Organon and stressed the importance of distinguishing between chronic and acute, or self-limiting, disease.

## The Homeopathic Interview

The initial history of complaints is elicited from the patient with as little interruption as possible (as long as the patient does not digress unduly) so that the patient’s train of thought is not disrupted or directed along lines imposed by the physician’s biases. According to Hahnemann: The physician elicits further particulars about each of the patient’s statements without ever putting words in his mouth, or asking a question that can be answered only by yes or no, which induces the patient to affirm something untrue or half true or else deny something really there to avoid discomfort or out of desire to please, thereby giving a wrong picture of the disease, which would lead to the wrong treatment. An entire review of symptoms is recorded in descriptive detail, taking into consideration all modalities that affect a symptom. Hahnemann emphasized the general symptoms (i.e., those affecting the entire organism) as the leading indications for the remedy. These key symptoms include mental and emotional effects, the metabolism and its reactions to environmental stimuli, sleep positions, food crav- ings and aversions, thirst, body type, and all manifestations of uncon- scious and autonomic regulation. Unique characteristic symptoms, particularly those regarded as “strange, rare, and peculiar,” are important considerations in the selec- tion of the remedy. These might be the expression of a paradoxical or unusual relationship, such as pain ameliorated by pressure or the sensation of the legs being made of wood or glass. The association of the start of a disease or symptom complex with an environmental or emotional event can be key and emphasizes the importance of an accu- rate and extensive interview. Hahnemann emphasized the importance of taking a comprehen- sive case, particularly in chronic disease11: In chronic diseases in women one should pay particular attention to such things as pregnancy, infertility, sexual desire, confinement, miscarriages, nursing, vaginal discharges, and the condition of the

monthly flow, especially noting whether it recurs at intervals that are too short or too long, how many days it lasts, whether or not it is interrupted, the quantity, how dark with color, any leukorrhea before or after the flow. If there is leukorrhea, what it is like, what symptoms accompany it, what is its quantity, under what condi- tions does it appear, what brings it on? Because the patient’s symptoms are the expressions of the body’s attempts to heal itself, symptomatic treatment (i.e., many allopathic therapies) can impair the physician’s ability to obtain vital informa- tion and complicate the taking of the case. This problem has also been recognized by some medical authors, such as Boyd, who stated: “We recognize that the pattern of disease has changed out of recognition during the past 30 to 40 years owing to modern drugs, particularly the antibiotics.”7

## Follow-Up and Case Evaluation

Considering the vitalistic and holistic perspective of the homeopathic approach, a clear definition of cure is necessary to establish the treat- ment goal. Mere palliation or suppression of symptoms at the cost of the overall vitality and function of the individual is considered negli- gent by the homeopathic practitioner. For example, if a patient’s skin disease is treated and appears to resolve but is followed by asthma, fatigue, and confusion, the treatment is evaluated as having been sup- pressive. If, upon proper treatment, the more serious lung and sys- temic disruptions are alleviated and the previous skin lesions return, the patient is considered as progressing toward a cure. When further appropriate therapy results in final alleviation of the skin disease, with- out any undue stress to the patient, it is then considered a true cure. This evaluative procedure is part of Hering’s Law of Cure, an obser- vation of the principles of curative responses that can be applied to any healing process, regardless of the school of thought. In true healing, according to this set of observations, symptoms follow these patterns: • From above, down the body to the extremities • From within to without (often in the form of discharges and other eliminative processes) • From the most important organs (e.g., the central nervous system) to the least important organs (typically, the skin) • In reverse order of their appearance (i.e., the chronologically most recent being replaced by those of the earlier stages of the disease and, in some instances, earlier in the patient’s life) Homeopathy holds that the disease first affects the vital force and is manifested initially by a change in the patient’s well-being, long before any objective changes can be observed. Illness is usually first recog- nized when the patient becomes aware of the early manifestations of the disease. Disease and cure must also be considered in the context of the belief system and culture of the patient. Much of what we call disease arises from the individual’s inability to find meaning and purpose. Many forms of healing are capable of enabling the person to integrate into the fabric of daily life and of providing ways to help the person address personal needs for fulfillment. In his study of disease, Hahnemann noted that there were inherited predispositions to disease, which he related to the improper treatment, and therefore suppression, of skin eruptions and venereal disease. He called these predispositions miasmas and, in 1828, published his findings in Chronic Diseases: Their Nature and Homeopathic Cure. He observed that many people, despite apparently healthy lifestyles, develop degenerative diseases. These often become established in childhood and continue to plague the person throughout life, despite medical treatment. He described three miasmas: psora, which rep- resents a fundamental flaw in the human ability to eradicate disease related to the suppression of skin disease; syphilis; and sycosis, which is caused by the suppression of the fig wart, or what is now known as human papillomavirus. Hahnemann described the chronic effects of bacterial and viral diseases in his explanation of miasmas. In his dis- cussion of viral diseases such as smallpox and other epidemic diseases, Hahnemann’s descriptions of the nature of viruses and their treatment predate their discovery by 50 years. He was a contemporary of Edward Jenner and supported Jenner’s use of smallpox vaccination. More recently, George Vithoulkas, a contemporary homeopathic author and teacher, defined health on three levels: mental, emotional, and physical. The mind should be capable of functioning with clarity, rationality, coherence, and logical sequence. It should be capable of engaging in creative service for the good of others, as well as for the good of oneself, demonstrating freedom from selfishness and posses- siveness. On the emotional level, there should be a state of serenity free from excessive passion, a state that should not be confused with a lack of emotional response generated as protection against emotional vulnerability. Finally, on the physical level, there should be freedom from pain. The healing person should experience a subjective sense of well-being and a progressive increase in vitality.12

## Prescription

Because homeopathy is oriented toward the administration of a sin- gle medicine at a time, careful prescribing is important. It is through the application of single medicines that homeopathic physicians have been able to record clinical verification of the provings and amass an impressive body of literature. Combination homeopathic medicines have been introduced as specific remedies for diseases and therefore have not represented homeopathic methods, although many studies support their efficacy. The process of selecting the correct remedy involves both careful study of the patient’s symptomatology and medical history and match- ing these with the appropriate remedy. This requires a sound under- standing of the homeopathic materia medica (see the section “The Study of the Materia Medica”). The symptoms of the homeopathic materia medica are indexed in repertories that have evolved in both reference books and computer analysis programs.

## Homeopathic Pharmacy and Potency Selection

This leads to a discussion of what has remained the greatest mystery of homeopathic medicine (and the source of considerable ridicule and misunderstanding): the use of “potentized” substances. As Hahnemann began his research, he found that when treat- ing patients according to the Law of Similars, there was an initial aggravation of the symptoms, the “healing crisis,” when using the high dosages typical of that era. He empirically tried using progres- sive dilutions of the medicines, beginning with tinctures from plants and triturations with milk sugar for metals and salts. He made the dilutions serially by mixing 1 drop of the tincture with 100 drops of alcohol, which were then “succussed” (shaken by pounding against a resilient surface) vigorously. He found that, with increasing dilution, the severity of the aggravation lessened while the patient continued to improve, often with deeper and more enduring results. He called these diluted remedies “potentized.” As an analytic chemist, he was aware of Avogadro’s theories (they were contemporaries), but he per- sisted in evaluating dilutions beyond the point where chemical activ- ity could be detected. This challenge to the present understanding of the therapeutic mechanism has been addressed by recent workers who have suggested that the therapeutic properties of the remedy lie in the energetic impression they make on the diluting vehicle (typically alcohol and

water or lactose). Various techniques have been used to determine whether there is a physical difference between the potentized dilution and the unmodified vehicle. These studies have used ultraviolet spec- troscopy, conductivity measurements, infrared spectroscopy, surface tension measurements, Raman Laser spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and other methods. Much of this work has shown reg- ular peaks and troughs in activity with progressive dilutions, and Heintz claimed that the peaks corresponded to the maximum effects found in the biological studies he reported (see the section “Basic Research”).13

## Mechanism of Action

To date, there is no conclusive understanding of the mechanism of action of the potentizing process. However, this has not inhibited the use of potencies, which have been diluted by a factor of 100 up to 100,000 times (10100,000). At this time, most explanations for the mech- anism of homeopathic high potencies are provisional (e.g., the postu- late that the remedies act in resonance with the magnetic fields of the body, or that the physiochemical properties of water can be modified by a solute and remain so even in the absence of the solute).14 This has not affected clinical practice or the demonstration of effi- cacy in clinical trials any more than the use of aspirin did, despite the fact that the discovery of its mechanism of action through modulation of prostaglandins did not occur until the 1980s. There are many forces whose nature can only be recognized by their results (e.g., gravity). These observations of relationships, confirmations of experience, are the basis of an empiric system. Medicine remains an art in the field of science. Interestingly, a group operating in the Hematology Department of the School of Pharmacy in Bordeaux, France, tested the effect of both common aspirin and homeopathic preparations on the vascular walls of rats. Aspirin at high concentrations (100 mg/kg) induced a decrease in platelet aggregation (amplitude and speed) as well as a decrease in the area of the thrombi (arterial and venous) and the number of emboli (arterials and venous). Aspirin at ultralow doses (9, 15, 30 CH) induced an increase in platelet aggregation (amplitude and speed) as well as an increase in the area of thrombi (arterial and venous) and the number of emboli (arterial and venous). The antiaggregation and antithrombotic action of aspirin at high concentrations (100 mg/kg) was inhibited by the concomitant injection of aspirin 15 CH.15 This confirmed Hahnemann’s observations of the primary and secondary effects of medicines mentioned in the Organon.11 Bellavite described these effects as “biologically active compounds (which) may cause inverse or paradoxical effects on a complex homeostatic system when either the doses of the compound, or the methods of prepara- tion and of administering, or the sensitivity of the target system are changed.”16,17 Research into both the pharmacological effects of homeopathic preparations and the paradoxical effects of orthodox drugs that con- firm the Law of Similars’ underlying homeopathic prescribing is a growing body of literature. Certain pharmacological substances, when tested in high dilutions, act on the same biological systems.18–24 The reaction to the high dilutions can also be the opposite of that to a drug at low dilutions (e.g., proinflammatory agents can be anti-in- flammatory at high dilutions).25–28 Paradoxical effects of medicines are the basis of the Arndt–Schultz law in pharmacology and hormesis. The Arndt–Schultz law states that weak stimuli slightly accelerate vital activity, medium-strong stimuli raise it, strong ones suppress it, and strong ones arrest it.29 Southam and Erlich30 reported the stimulatory effect of an antifun- gal agent when used at low doses and proposed the term “hormesis.” Hormesis is defined as “the stimulatory effect of subinhibitory con- centrations of any toxic substance on any organism.”31 Hormesis is considered a nonspecific phenomenon that increases the resistance and growth of the treated organism. It exists in all living organisms. This “action–reaction” model shows the efficacy of the “vital activity” in fighting the poison in a nonspecific way, although specific defense molecules are also synthetized.32–37 A modern and important patho- logical model showed that a single dose of an antitumoral immunosup- pressive substance (cisplatin) induced increased lymphokine-activated killer activity.38 Wagner and colleagues demonstrated that low doses of cytostatic agents stimulated human granulocyte and lymphocyte growth.39 The goals and methods of homeopathic pharmacy have their roots in earlier Paracelsian and spagyric medical systems. The challenge remains to define homeopathic empiric science in the context of a modern science. It may be that homeopathy presents a challenge to pharmaceutical science itself that will bring forth new models for phar- macology. The more central challenge is for homeopathy to discover how it can apply its own critical methods to develop a more effective healthcare service. The assumption that we can find substances in nature that can alter disease underlies the history of medicine and pharmacology, yet heal- ing remains a mystery. Further studies are necessary to confirm and develop the understanding of the mechanisms and validity of homeo- pathic medicines.

## Determination of Potency

In terms of clinical practice, general guidelines have evolved for the determination of potency. In the sixth edition of the Organon, Hahnemann recommends ascending the scale of potencies gradually. In paragraph 248, he suggests that the medicinal solution be “suc- cussed anew with use.” In chronic cases, the patient is directed to take one teaspoonful daily or every other day, and in acute diseases, as fre- quently as needed. If the solution is used up before the problem allevi- ates, the next higher dilution is used (if still indicated by the symptom pattern).40 The higher potencies, whose use largely developed in the United States, are repeated much less frequently and are generally reserved for the experienced practitioner. The more potentized the remedy, the closer it must meet the Law of Similars (i.e., the accuracy of the pre- scription must be high for a curative effect). Lower potencies are often repeated daily, depending on the condition being treated. Several ranges of potencies include the decimal scale, which uses a 1:10 dilution; the centesimal scale, which is diluted 1:100; and the LM potencies introduced in the sixth edition of the Organon, using daily doses of 1:50,000 dilutions. It is important to note that the sixth edition was unavailable until 1924, 76 years after Hahnemann’s death. The predominant clinical application of homeopathic potencies had developed using an ascend- ing scale. A single dose was used until its action had ceased, when the same potency would be repeated. When that potency seemed to no longer demonstrate an enduring effect, a higher potency was used. There have been regular arguments between low- and high-potency prescribers as to the most effective method.

## The Study of the Materia Medica

Constantine Hering once stated: A mere acquaintance with the principal symptoms cannot be called studying the materia medica, although we make it the basis of our study. The study of materia medica must be regarded and dealt with in exactly the same manner as that of other natural sciences.

## 312SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

To give a perspective on the way in which homeopathic physicians organize the proving symptoms into clinical pictures, we draw from an essay on Sepia by E. B. Nash41: This is another of our wonderful remedies of which the dominant school knows nothing, except what they have learned from us. Its chief sphere of action seems to be in the abdomen and pelvis, espe- cially in women. No remedy produces stronger symptoms here. We quote from different but equally good observers. Sensation of bearing down in the pelvic region, with dragging pains from the sacrum; or feeling of bearing down of all pelvic organs. (Hahnemann) Labor-like pains accompanied with the feeling as though she must cross her legs and “sit close” to keep something from coming out through the vagina. (Guernsey) Pain in uterus, bearing down, comes from back to abdomen, causing oppression of breathing; crosses limbs to prevent protrusion of parts. (Hering) Prolapse of the uterus, of the vagina, with pressure as if every- thing would protrude. (Lippe) Experience has shown its value in cases of ulceration and con- gestion of the os and cervix uteri. Its use supersedes all local appli- cations. (Dunham) No higher authority than the united testimony of these five of our best observers could be brought to show the action of Sepia upon the pelvic organs. Now when we come to examine the provings in Allen’s Ency- clopedia, we find that these symptoms were mainly produced by Hahnemann and his provers, and Hahnemann advocated proving remedies in the 30th, and some of them were produced by the 200th, especially those most strongly verified by black- faced type. We confess that we cannot understand how so many ques- tion the value of potencies for proving or curing. Sepia, like Sulphur, affects the general circulation in a very marked man- ner. Flashes of heat with perspiration and faintness is almost as characteristic of this remedy as of Sulphur. But there are, with Sepia, more apt to be associated with them the pelvic symptoms already given, and they are also more apt to occur in conjunc- tion with the climacteric. Indeed, these flashes often seem with Sepia to start in the pelvic organs and from thence to spread over the body. But this irregularity of circulation extends as far as that of Sulphur. The hands and feet are hot alternately, that is, if the feet are hot, the hands are cold, and vice versa. There is not so much sensation of burning with Sepia as with Sulphur, but there is actual heat, and the venous congestion, which seems to be the real state of the organs where the pressive bearing down et cetera is felt, is also accompanied with much throbbing and beating. This local congestion to the pelvic organs is not simply sensa- tional. There are actual displacements in consequence of it, and the long continued congestion results in inflammations, ulcerations, leukorrheas and even malignancies or cancerous organizations.

is characteristic. This pelvic congestion also affects the rectum in a marked degree. The rectum prolapses, there is a sensation of fullness, or of a foreign substance as of a ball or weight, and oozing of moisture from the rectum. Indeed, the rectal and anal symptoms are almost as strong as the uterine and vaginal. It is impossible to enumerate all the symptoms connected with the circulatory disturbances of Sepia in such a work as this, only a general study of the Materia Medica can do it. The urinary organs come in for their share of symptoms. The same pressure and fullness consequent upon the portal congestion reaches here. We will now proceed to give what we have found to be particularly valuable symptoms under the various organs in this region. “Pressure on bladder and frequent micturation with ten- sion in lower abdomen.” “Sediment in the urine like clay; as if clay burnt on the bottom of the vessel; urine very offensive (Indium), can’t endure to have it in the room, it is reddish or may be bloody.” This is found mostly in women. With children there is one peculiar symptom which has often been verified. “The child always wets the bed during its first sleep.” Upon the male organs I have found it particularly useful in chronic infection. There is not much discharge, but a few drops, perhaps, which glue up the orifice of the urethra in the morning; but it is so persistent and the usual remedies will not “dry it up.” In my early practice I used to use a weak injection of Sulphate of Zinc, but it used to annoy me that I could not use it without resorting to local measures. Sepia does it in the majority of cases and Kali iodatum will do it in the rest. I have, where there was a thick discharge of long standing and the smarting and burn- ing on urination continued, several times finished the case with Capsicum. As a rule, this long continued slight, passive gleety discharge is a result of weakness of the male genitals, as is shown by a flaccidity of the organs and frequent seminal emissions. The emissions are thin and watery. Sepia covers all of this and often sets all to rights in a short time. The mind symptoms of Sepia are like Pulsatilla, in that she is sad and cries frequently without knowing the reason why. So if in a tearful mind with uterine disturbances Pulsatilla should fail you, the next remedy to be studied is Sepia. But there is another condition of mind not found under Pulsatilla or any other remedy in the same degree, and that is, that, notwithstanding there is no sign of dementia from actual brain lesion, the patient, contrary to her usual habit, becomes indifferent to her occupation, her house work, her family or their comfort, even to those whom she loves the best. This is a very peculiar symptom and a genuine keynote for the exhibition of Sepia … I once cured a very obstinate case of entero-colitis (so-called cholera infantum), after the complete failure of two eminent allopaths, with Sepia, the leading symptom being, always worse after taking milk. Oozing of moisture from the anus finds its remedy here sometimes, but oftener in Antimonium crudum. The Sepia patient is very weak. A short walk fatigues her very much. She faints easily from extremes of cold and eat, after get- ting wet, from riding in a carriage, while kneeling at church, and on other trifling occasions. This fainting, or sense of sink- ing faintness, may be found in pregnancy, child bed, or during lactation; or, again, it may come on after hard work, such as “laundry work;” so it has come to be called the “washer wom- an’s” remedy. As can be seen by this excerpt, the indications for a remedy are complex, requiring study and understanding.

# RESEARCH IN HOMEOPATHY

Homeopathy arose from empiric observations and operates from empiric clinical evidence and phenomenologically descriptive fields.

## 313CHAPTER 39 Homeopathy

Samuel Hahnemann was the first to use the methodology of provings, to gather information about the reactions of healthy subjects to the ingestion of minute amounts of substances. Both clinical trials and laboratory research, although relatively sparse and often inconclusive, do point to efficacy and activity beyond placebo. Homeopathy has faced challenges in the scientific as well as political arena because its mechanism of action is still unknown. For example, quoting from a recent review, “according to current pharmacological theory it would appear impossible that homeopathic therapy could have any effect over placebo.”42 However, as the authors go on to say, “The available hypotheses for a possible mechanism of action, however, do not claim that homeopathic remedies act through pharmacological but through biophysical pathways and all include the idea of some form of infor- mation transfer.”42 Despite adversaries who claim that research has determined that homeopathy is nothing more than placebo, home- opathy researchers, using increasingly sophisticated research designs, continue to produce intriguing evidence regarding the effects and efficacy of homeopathic substances. This evidence, which emerged from several types of research, including provings, clinical trials, and laboratory studies, may soon converge to build a promising case for homeopathy’s effect.

## Evidence From a Modern Proving Study

Although traditionally provings, also called pathogenetic trials, first involved material doses of substances, Hahnemann himself, as well as later provers, conducted proving studies using potencies beyond Avogadro’s number. One recent proving study provided convincing evidence that ultramolecular doses of homeopathic substances can produce symptoms different from placebo.43 This double-blind, place- bo-controlled experimental study randomized 25 medical doctors into three groups who received 30-CH potentized doses of either Natrum muriaticum or Arsenicum album or an identical placebo. All substances were beyond Avogadro’s number in terms of dilution. The main out- come parameter was the number of remedy-specific symptoms per group. The actual remedies themselves were chosen randomly from a list of 20 already-proven remedies that are frequently used in homeo- pathic practice; this list was not known to subjects or the study team, other than the study director and pharmacist; the two selected reme- dies were not known to anyone on the study team, including the study director. Participants were advised to ingest five remedy globules on day 1, then 2 × 5 on day 2, or until symptoms appeared, and then write their symptoms in a diary over 4 days. These symptoms were com- piled and reviewed by an independent homeopathic expert, blinded to group assignment, who analyzed each symptom via a computer program for its typicality, or not, for one of the two remedies tested. The results showed that symptoms typical for the respective remedy were significantly more likely to occur in both the Natrum muriati- cum or Arsenicum album groups, whereas nonspecific symptoms were more frequent in the placebo group (P = 0.001). Typical symptoms reported by subjects ingesting Arsenicum album included “strange rest- lessness”; “increased desire to swallow”; “lack of desire to urinate”; and “gushing diarrhea.” Typical symptoms reported by subjects ingesting Natrum muriaticum were “difficulty concentrating”; “slight vertigo when seated”; “tearing pain in scalp”; “twitching in right eye”; and “cramping like labor in abdomen.”43 This impressive finding showed that nonmaterial doses of substances produced specific and distinctive effects—characteristic of the remedy—in subjects who were blinded to which remedy they were ingesting.

## Human Clinical Trials

Although the previously described study provides evidence for an effect of ultramolecular homeopathic substances on the human organism, what is of primary interest to humans, and particularly clinicians, is whether such effects are therapeutic. In one early classic study, Gibson et al.44 published a double-blind clinical trial of homeopathic treatment in rheumatoid arthritis. The 3-month study was elegantly designed in that the prescribing was individualized to the patient’s symptoms and was controlled, on a double-blind basis, by giving half the patients the correct remedy and the rest a placebo. All patients continued to use conventional, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and the treated group showed significant improvement in subjective pain, articu- lar index, stiffness, and grip strength. Other published studies have demonstrated the efficacy of homeopathic treatment for the treat- ment of headache, bruising, cancer-related symptoms, attention defi- cit hyperactivity disorder in children, asthma, upper respiratory tract infections, otitis media, arthritis, allergies, male infertility, influenza, cardiac insufficiency, herpes, osteoarthritis, acquired immunodefi- ciency syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome.45–82

## Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews of Human

<!-- chunk -->

## Clinical Trials

Hundreds of human clinical trials, of varying quality, with both pos- itive and negative results, have now been carried out. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have been helpful in identifying promising treatments and areas where more research is needed, thus moving the field forward. In 1991 one of the first meta-analyses of homeopathic clinical trials, by Kleijnen et al.,83 was published in the British Medical Journal, with a total of 105 controlled trials. The quality of trials was described as poor for two thirds of those reviewed. Positive results for homeopathic treatment were found in 81 trials, leading the authors to state, “The evidence in this review would probably be sufficient for establishing homeopathy as a regular treatment for certain indications.” In 1997 Linde et al.84 published another meta-analysis of 119 trials that met the inclusion criteria; 89 had adequate data for meta-analysis, and two sets of trials were used to assess reproducibility. The com- bined odds ratio for the 89 studies was 2.45 in favor of homeopathy, with an odds ratio of 1.78 for the 26 good-quality studies. The authors concluded, “The results of our meta-analysis are not compatible with the hypothesis that the clinical effects of homeopathy are completely due to placebo.” In 2014 Mathie et al.85 published a rigorous, focused systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of individualized homeopathic treatment (typically involving a long interview between the practitioner and the patient) versus placebo, finding 32 eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) covering medical conditions, of which 22 had extractable data available for meta-analysis. Although the evidence was of uneven quality and the authors were cautious in their conclusions, their findings were that medicines prescribed in individualized homeopathy may have small, specific treatment effects. In 2017 Mathie et al.86 published a second rigorous systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nonindividualized homeopathic treatment and concluded that although the quality of the evidence was low, a meta-analysis of all extractable data indicated a small, statisti- cally significant effect of nonindividualized homeopathic treatment. Their major conclusion was—as in previous systematic reviews in homeopathy—that higher-quality RCT research, with a lower risk of bias, is needed to be able to determine homeopathy’s efficacy for con- ditions or symptoms decisively. In some instances, accumulating evidence has made it feasible to carry out systematic reviews to evaluate homeopathy’s use for the treatment of specific conditions. For example, in a review of homeo- pathic treatment of people with human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, five controlled clinical trials

were identified, with evidence for improved CD4 and CD8 counts and specific physical, immunological, neurological, metabolic, and quali- ty-of-life benefits. The author concluded that homeopathy might play a useful role as an adjunctive therapy in this condition.81 Pilkington et al.82 examined the use of homeopathy for anxiety and anxiety dis- orders, concluding that homeopathy might be beneficial. One partic- ularly fruitful and positive area of research, for which there are several positive trials, is in the use of homeopathy for the treatment of respi- ratory allergies.74

## Human Effectiveness Studies

Effectiveness research involves the evaluation of a treatment’s use- fulness in more natural or real-world settings. For example, during World War II, isopathic preparations were given prophylactically, and homeopathic therapies were used in mustard gas burns. A subse- quent statistical analysis found that these treatments yielded significant results compared with placebos. The remedies used were mustard gas, Rhus toxicodendron, and kali bichromium.13 More recently, Witt et al.87 evaluated health-status changes of chronically ill patients after 8 years of homeopathic treatment. This prospective, multicenter cohort study involved 103 homeopathic primary care practices in Germany and Switzerland; in total, patients were studied, with the most frequent diagnoses being allergic rhinitis, headache in adults, and atopic dermatitis and multiple recur- rent infections in children. Disease severity decreased significantly over this time, with considerable improvement in physical and mental qual- ity of life. Another prospective multicenter observational study of patients treated homeopathically by 48 physicians for low-back pain found sustained physical and quality-of-life improvements, along with decreased use of conventional healthcare services and pharmacological therapies.88 A similar prospective multicenter observational study eval- uated symptom changes in 212 adult patients with chronic migraines who were treated with individualized homeopathy by 68 physicians. Migraine severity showed marked improvement at 3 and 24 months, with improved quality of life and decreased use of conventional health services.89

## Animal Studies: Field and Laboratory Research

In a now-classic study, Caulophyllum (in the 30th centesimal potency) was given to 10 sows to test its efficacy in the control of stillbirths. The results showed a statistically significant drop in the number of still- births and led to a larger, uncontrolled study in a whole herd. After months of therapy, piglet mortality dropped from 20% to 2.6%.90 Cloudhury obtained dramatic results from injecting mice intra- peritoneally with kali phosphoricum, calcarea phosphorica, or ferrum phosphorica (in the 30th decimal potency) 12 days after implantation of fibrosarcoma. Of the 77 treated mice, 52% were cured and survived more than 1 year, whereas all of the 77 controls died within 10 to 15 days.91 Scofield, in his review article, discussed numerous experiments with humans, animals, and plants using isopathic treatment for poi- soning and experimental liver damage and various in vitro studies.13 A number of studies have been conducted to investigate the ability for homeopathic preparations to affect either the elimination or con- sequences of toxic substances. There is good evidence that homeopathy may be effective in assist- ing in the elimination and treatment of heavy metals and other tox- ins. Studies of arsenic,92,93 bismuth,18,19,94 lead,95 mercury,96,97 carbon tetrachloride,20,25 alpha-amanitine (from the mushroom Amanita phalloides),26 and carcinogens such as 2-acetylaminofluorene and phe- nobarbital98 have been published. The use of homeopathic dilutions of hormones and immuno- modulators has shown potential. Immunostimulatory effects of high dilutions of thymic hormones and interferons were demonstrated in mice by Bastide’s group.26,99–102 Other studies demonstrated that extremely small amounts of antigens were specific for immunomodu- lation.103–107 In one study, half of a group of mice were given prepara- tions of reticuloendothelial tissue from Francisella tularensis–infected mice in six different serial agitated dilutions (SADs), three of which were beyond Avogadro’s number in terms of molecular content. The other half of the group of mice were given control diluents. All mice were then challenged with lethal doses of F. tularensis and evaluated for time to death and total number of deaths per group. The SAD prepa- rations resulted in increased mean times to death (18.6 vs. 13.7 days) and decreased mortality (53% vs. 75%). The protective effect was not related to the level of dilution of the substance.107 Magnani et al. used a well-designed mouse model to examine the anxiolytic-like activity of several potencies of ultradiluted Gelsemium sempervirens, compared with the drug buspirone and placebo. Gelsemium-treated mice spent more time in a lighted compartment (a measure of reduced anxiety), similar to the effects of buspirone and significantly greater than the placebo group. The authors concluded that Gelsemium acted on the emotional reactivity of mice, with anxio- lytic-like effects even at ultrahigh dilutions.108 These and other such dramatic results have tremendous implica- tions in pharmacy, immunology, and clinical health care that demand continued research.

## Basic Research

Clinical and experimental data obtained in studies about the effect of homeopathic preparations in inflammatory conditions present a con- siderable degree of reproducibility.109–113 The inability of Ovelgonne et al.114 and Hirst et al.115 to replicate their study published in the journal Nature, using the human basophil degranulation test (HBDT) to establish the ability for high dilutions to trigger the degranulation of anti–immunoglobulin-E, caused consider- able distraction from other more credible research. Brown and Ennis116 used different methods to demonstrate the efficacy of high dilutions of histamine to inhibit the activation of baso- phils using HBDT. Instead of measuring degranulation provoked by ultramolecular dilutions of anti–immunoglobulin-E, as Ovelgonne et al. and Hirst et al. did, they examined the inhibition of activation of basophils by ultramolecular dilutions of histamine. The experiments used ultramolecular dilutions of histamine (15c to 19c), prepared with vortexing (instead of succussion). The main experiment, performed by all the laboratories, was based on inhibition of basophil activation as measured by degranulation. Flow cytome- try experiments at three laboratories showed compatible results, with inhibition of activation as high as 43%. Nearly all experiments showed statistically significant inhibition of basophil activation.117–120 Experimental study of homeopathy in allergology121 effects have been reported in vivo122–124 as well as in vitro.125–129 The physical properties of homeopathic preparations are gaining considerable understanding via research. Studies demonstrated that the physicochemical properties of extremely diluted solutions (EDSs) are different from those of pure, untreated water, notwithstanding the identical chemical composition of the two liquids.130–132 The same conclusions were inferred by Lo.133,134 Rey135 showed that the struc- ture of hydrogen bonds in pure water was different from that of an EDS obtained by an iterative procedure of successive dilutions and succussions and was not identical as expected. Recent studies on the physicochemical properties of water provided evidence that the most studied liquid by far, water, still exhibits unexpected properties.136–142 Lobyshev et al.143 showed that low concentrations and electromag- netic fields can produce large-scale realignments of its structure,

which can be either reversible or irreversible. One can deduce from these studies that water and aqueous solutions are complex systems, capable of auto-organization as a consequence of small perturbations of various kinds. The question of whether water can maintain “memory” of solutes in EDS is best understood by understanding the physical characteristics of water and its ability to form stable clusters and crystals. This aspect of physics is not widely studied but is well documented.130–133,136,141,144 Sukal et al.145 pointed out that ethanol molecules, via which poten- tized homeopathic substances are prepared and stored, are thought to promote or preserve water structures in the potentized substance. These researchers examined the Fourier transform infrared spectra of various ultradiluted homeopathic substances—Nux vomica 30c, Lycopodium 30c, Santonin, 30c, Cina 30c, Cina 206c, and Cina 1006c— as well as their diluent media, 90% ethanol and ethanol 30c. The potencies differed from each other, and from their diluent media, in the number of oxygen–hydrogen bending vibrational bands, as well as their wave number, shape, and the half-width of the bands. This study illustrated that the medicated sucrose globules used in homeopathic practice can retain specific spectral properties and can be differentiated from each other by Fourier transform infrared spectra with regard to the oxygen–hydrogen bending vibrational band.145 Such meticulously designed and executed studies are bringing us ever closer to understanding the mechanisms by which homeopathy may work.


Homeopathy plays an important role in the context of modern naturo- pathic medicine. Hahnemann emphasized the importance of lifestyle in the treatment of the patient. One of his primary dictums was to first remove the obstacles to cure, as he said: While taking a case of chronic disease one should examine and weigh the particular conditions of the patient’s day to day activ- ities, living habits, diet, domestic situation, and so on. One should ascertain whether there is anything in them which may cause or sustain the disease and remove it to help the cure. Unfortunately, homeopathy is also an extremely challenging system to master, requiring a considerable understanding of both case tak- ing and materia medica as well as extensive consultation time with the patient. It has therefore often been discarded, even by those aware of its efficacy. Although attempts have been made to reduce it to simpler sys- tems (e.g., allergy desensitizations, vaccinations, Schuessler’s cell salts, and isopathic preparations from diseased tissues and heavy metals), they are not considered strictly homeopathic unless prescribed accord- ing to their effects upon healthy people or the confirmed observations of cured symptoms. The greatest challenge to homeopathy is not how it fits into the current scientific paradigm but how it fits into health care. The same biases against homeopathy have been used against other nonpharma- cological approaches to medicine, including psychology and nutri- tional medicine. The wide acceptance in the homeopathic community of unac- credited educational programs has favored the spread of nonclinically trained homeopaths. Naturopathic medical schools in the United States have remained one of the few resources for clinical training in homeopathy. Homeopathic medical schools in other countries have maintained homeopathy in the context of medical and clinical training. There have been many individualized styles of prescribing intro- duced into homeopathy that have created breaches between different practitioners. In addition, many new medicines are being introduced without adequate clinical verification. Unfortunately, there are few forums for critical discourse within the homeopathic community. The divisions between different schools of homeopathic practice are attempts to parlay new ideas against an orthodox view that solely seeks to maintain the integrity of the principles developed by Hahnemann. One basic argument by some of these schools has been that because a homeopathic prescription should not be based on a specific disease, extensive training in current medical sciences should not be primary. However, this ignores an essential part of Hahnemann’s instructions. In the third paragraph of the Organon, he stated, “The physician should distinctly understand … what is curable in diseases in general, and in each case in particular; that is, the recognition of disease.” Correct diagnosis is primary in understanding the context and pathogenesis of a disease. Thus it would not be possible to understand the relation of much of drug proving symptoms, their clinical appli- cation, and the evaluation of efficacy or subsequent case management without understanding the nature of disease. Homeopathy is proven in the context of good health care. It is a system of therapeutics, not a replacement for common standards of diagnosis and preventive care. Homeopathy is representative of a principle found throughout nature, and its role in bringing forth concepts of resonance, constitu- tion, and holism are shared throughout fields of science and healing. Homeopathy represents an integrated, holistic system of natural ther- apeutics. Its capacity for addressing psychosomatic disease and acute pathology as a dynamic process is unique. It has remained a coherent system, with extensive clinical verification, for more than two centu- ries. Homeopathy is an economical and effective method that has been established as an integral part of the medical system in many countries. With the resurgence of interest in natural medicine, this discipline will undoubtedly be more widely used.

# FURTHER READING

The research section of this chapter is deeply indebted to the works of Peter Fisher, editor of the British Homeopathic Journal; Madeleine Bastide; Paolo Bellavite; and Andrea Signorini. The clinical training the first author received from Alan Sutherland and Marion Belle Rood has continued to be the foundation of sound practice and the inspiration to sustain study in the philosophy of nature.

baths, and by 300 ad, there were approximately 900 baths operating in the city of Rome. When the Roman Empire declined, the use of baths for hygienic, social, and medical purposes also declined. In the Middle Ages, spanning from 500 to 1500 ad, public bath- ing was condemned by Christian authorities, and eventually, bathing was discouraged and considered indulgent by the Catholic Church. Although healing methods using water were no longer used in Europe, the knowledge of hydrotherapy was kept alive through monks in mon- asteries who dedicated themselves to replicating Greek and Roman texts by hand. Islamic countries became the main storage place of clas- sic Western scientific thought. Sentos (public bathhouses) emerged and became popular in Japan, and saunas were invented in Finland. Around that same time, banyas were introduced in Russia. In 1242 ad, hot springs were discovered and developed in Switzerland.

## Modern Hydrotherapy

In the 16th century, the Renaissance brought forth a change in medicine, and bathing once again gained popularity for health purposes. Sir John Floyer, an English physician, wrote about “curing madness by cold baths” in his History of Cold Bathing published in 1702. His book influenced Johann S. Hahn, who established the principles of modern hydrotherapy in Germany. More than 200 springs were operating in Europe, and pri- vate bathrooms and showers were used. During the Scientific Revolution, methods became available to analyze minerals and their effects on the body. In 1810 the first bathroom, which included a sink, toilet, and bath- tub, was constructed in a private house in the United States. The hydrotherapy movement traces its origins to two prominent hydrotherapists: Vincent Priessnitz of Austria and Father Sebastian Kneipp of Bavaria. Priessnitz had no formal training but was inspired to heal his own broken ribs using cold compresses. When he was young, he recalled a man who healed cattle by the external applica- tion of cold water. He eventually went on to open his first sanatorium in 1829 in Graefenberg, successfully treating more than 40,000 people with little loss of life. He was also persecuted by medical authorities and convicted of witchcraft because he taught people to heal them- selves with the use of water, exercise, and diet. Priessnitz published The Cold Water Cure in 1843, and two estab- lishments later opened in New York City based on his principles. In 1851 Dr. T. L. Nichols and his wife, Mary Grove, opened the American Hydropathic Institute in New York. In 1853 the New York Hydropathic School was established by two medical doctors, Dr. Joel Shew and his associate Dr. Russell Trall. Father Sebastian Kneipp, initially rejected from the priesthood because he had diabetes mellitus, went on to cure himself with water treatments and diet. After his cure, he was admitted to the priesthood and went on to write My Water Cure, published in 1886. In 1891 Father Kneipp treated Benedict Lust, curing him of his medical problems. Lust would later bring Kneipp’s teachings to America, influencing Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, an important figure in the modern history of hydrotherapy. Lust eventually played a pivotal role in forming the foundation of naturopathic medicine. Although the popularity of water treatments began to decline in the late 19th century, Ellen G. White, health reformer and founder of Seventh-Day Adventism, was inspired to open the Western Health Reform Institute, focusing on hydrotherapy, diet, rest, and other natural remedies. One conventional doctor, Simon Baruch, studied hydrother- apy in Europe and brought his teachings to the United States. He spent his life trying to establish hydrotherapy as a science-based treatment, as opposed to the nonscientific form, and taught at Columbia University. In 1880 Dr. John Harvey Kellogg became the medical director of Battle Creek Sanitarium (formerly Western Health Reform Institute), which became the leading center for natural healing in North America and Europe. He wrote extensively on health, and his book Rational Hydrotherapy was published in 1901. In 1917 Kellogg wrote a scientific article praising the effects of colon hydrotherapy in treating the large bowel.3 Henry Lindlahr, a real estate tycoon in the United States, after being told he had diabetes mellitus and that no treatments were available, went to Europe to be treated by Father Kneipp. Once he was healed by Kneipp’s recommendations of hydrotherapy and proper diet, Lindlahr returned to the United States, received medical training, and estab- lished a sanitarium in Chicago in 1906. He wrote Nature Cure,4 the definitive guide to the philosophy and practice of nature cure medicine. Otis G. Carroll, a modern forefather of naturopathic medicine, studied with Lindlahr and Alex Ledoux, another student of Sebastian Kneipp. Dr. Carroll developed the Constitutional Hydrotherapy treat- ment in 1923 in Spokane, Washington, which combines compresses with electrical stimulation. Carroll’s work was continued by Harold Dick, another naturopath who entered into practice in 1955. In 1990 his work was then followed by his daughter Letitia Dick-Kronenberg, ND. The Windrose Clinic has now provided expert hydrotherapy for more than 50 years. In 2012 her book The Ultimate Text in Constitutional Hydrotherapy: A 100 Year Tradition of Clinical Practice5 was published. In 1956 Dr. John Bastyr established the National College of Naturopathic Medicine. Hydrotherapy is still taught in naturopathic medical institutions and practiced in their associated teaching clin- ics as a highly effective, fundamental naturopathic modality. In the late 1980s, Lectures in Naturopathic Hydrotherapy6 was written by Dr. Wade Boyle, ND, and Dr. Andre Saine, ND.

# PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF WATER

No case of chronic disease, no matter how inveterate, unless it has reached an absolutely hopeless stage, should be abandoned as incur- able without giving hydrotherapy, with the accompanying regimen of diet and exercise, active or passive, an intelligent and persevering trial.

## —Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, 1852–1943

Water is a universal substance. The gross composition of the human body is water, responding powerfully to its application both internally and externally. Water is the universal solvent in the body; all nutrients, wastes, gases, hormones, and toxins are carried throughout the body in this aqueous base. Water is distributed between the two major fluid compartments, intracellularly and extracellularly, which together con- stitute the total body water ranging from 55% to 75%, depending on age and gender. Pure water has a neutral pH of 7; it is neither acidic nor alkaline. This neutrality won’t alter the pH of the body or of any sub- stances added to the water. Water takes many shapes that can be used in a therapeutic manner to affect physiology. Examples of the various forms of water include liquid, ice, and steam vapor.7 Water affects human body systems in various ways depending on the method of administration and the circumstances of the individ- ual. The physiological effects of hydrotherapy are classified as thermal, mechanical, and chemical. Thermal effects are produced by the appli- cation of water at temperatures above or below body temperature, with the magnitude of variation from body temperature predicting therapeutic outcomes. Mechanical effects are produced by the effect of water acting on the body surface in the form of sprays, douches, frictions, immersions, whirlpools, and so forth. Chemical effects are produced when water is taken orally, by nasal/sinus irrigation, through vaginal douching, or via colon irrigation. The effects of the application of water can be generalized or local, depending on the application and administration. Water can be admin- istered internally or externally to the human system. Water has the ability

to modify the physiology of a living body system through temperature effects. With variations of temperature, human body systems need to adapt. In an attempt to accommodate itself (the body) to a change in circumstance, water can change tissues to support the vital processes. The physiological effects of water will vary depending on the individual person’s age, biological sex, and physiological condition. (Table 40.1)

## Basic Properties of Water

Water has the ability to absorb and radiate large quantities of heat; it is this high specific heat that is the standard by which other specific heats are measured.8 • It takes 1 calorie to cool 1 g of water 1°C. • It takes 80 calories to turn 1 g of water at 0°C into ice (therefore melting ice absorbs 80 times as much heat as does liquid water). • It takes 540 calories to turn 1 g of water at 100°C into steam; con- densing steam gives off 540 times as much heat as does liquid water. The fluidity of water allows for large areas of application to a sin- gle body at one time. A topical application of water will elicit an effect through the skin, which will affect the nervous system, circulation, and finally the tissues. Water is also an excellent conductor of heat by rapidly carrying heat to and away from the body—it is faster than air by 25×.9 The modification of water temperature is the most commonly used mode of therapeutic application. The rate of cold or hot temperature exchange depends on the difference in temperature between the two objects, the conducting properties of the objects, the length of time the process is allowed to continue, and the area of the body through which the temperature flows (i.e., skin, fat, or muscle tissue). Water temperature is described as varying from cold to hot. Hydrotherapy can have a profound healing effect on the body by the support of healthy blood flow, lymph, and chi. Water can be used to increase circulation and decrease congestion of the blood and lymph, thereby affecting the quantity of these fluids. Water will also affect the quality of blood through the organs of elimination. These emunctories include the skin, liver, kidneys, bowels, and lungs. The quality of blood can be altered through water to affect the organs of digestion and elimination—the stomach, pancreas, small intestine, and colon. For example, increasing blood flow through the application of water can ensure that the body digests and assimilates more nutri- ents to help build up the quality of the blood. We can manipulate the blood and body fluids through various applications of hot and cold. Definitions of the key methods affecting blood and lymph flow are as follows: 1. Direct: local effects of hot and cold applications to a tissue depth of less than 1 cm because thermal receptors are superficial. Direct effects are effective for treating cellulitis in an extremity, mastitis, or tooth infections. 2. Revulsive: alternating hot and cold applications. The hot application magnifies the effect of the cold that follows it. When done in alternat- ing sequences, the effects are additive. Revulsive treatments are very powerful to decongest tissues and produce analgesic effects. Examples include alternating sitz baths and alternating baths to the extremities. 3. Retrostasis: cold application for driving fluid from one area of the body to another. 4. Derivation: hot application for drawing fluid from one area of the body to another. In the presence of congestion in the circulation of an ill patient, a derivative treatment draws proportionally more blood and lymph from the congested parts, whereas in a healthy patient with normal circulation, a derivative treatment draws blood equally from all other parts. 5. Collateral circulation: the fluid dynamics of retrostasis and deri- vation apply to a restricted area where blood-flow modifications in a superficial artery can change the circulation of a deep artery from the same trunk. For example, a cold application to the start of a superficial branch of an artery will constrict, decreasing blood flow, while the deep branch would dilate to increase blood flow. The converse is also true; a hot application to the start of a superfi- cial branch of an artery will dilate, increasing blood flow, while the deep branch will constrict to decrease blood flow. 6. Arterial trunk reflex: cold or hot applications exerted on an arterial trunk will influence the smaller vessels fed by that trunk. For exam- ple, a hot application to an arterial trunk will dilate the trunk and its distal arteries branching off. 7. Spinal cord reflex: symmetrically paired structures of the body are reflexively connected from their vital center to the corresponding area of skin (i.e., extremities).

## Principles of Hot and Cold Temperatures

The thermal effect of water is the most commonly used principle of therapeutic hydrotherapy. In general, hot water relaxes and sedates, whereas cold water stimulates, invigorates, and tonifies. Nonetheless, very hot water can stimulate and be destructive, whereas prolonged cold water can be depressive and destructive.10 The duration of the application of water is the best predictor of the previously described effects of temperature on human body systems. Short applications will have a stimulating effect, whether it is hot or cold, and long applications will have a depressive effect, whether it is hot or cold. A long application will have an initial vasoconstrictive effect on circulation followed by a secondary vasodilation effect. The definition of a long application of water is one where the tempera- ture doesn’t change significantly over time, such as during a shower or bath. The sequence of effects of hot and cold applications include initial vasoconstriction for both temperatures followed by secondary vaso- dilation.11 The final sequence of a cold application ends with vaso- constriction, but with a hot application, we see venostasis. Short cold applications produce a substantial increase in oxygen absorption; car- bon dioxide excretion; an increase in nitrogen absorption and excre- tion; an increase in tissue tone, muscle tone, and vascular tone; and an increase in peripheral white blood cell and red blood cell counts while decreasing blood glucose. Of note, short cold applications have the greatest potential for the stimulation of tissue metabolism. Hot applications, whether short or long, will somewhat increase oxygen absorption and carbon dioxide excretion, but they will decrease tissue tone and decrease peripheral red and white blood cell counts while increasing blood glucose. Remember, the time of application and the temperature of the water determine the therapeutic and physiolog- ical effect on blood flow and can be manipulated using various time and temperature methods.

## Principles of Circulation of Blood by Hot and Cold

<!-- chunk -->

## Temperatures

Hydrotherapy is based on the premise that healing is proportional to normal blood flow. When we use alternating hot and cold applica- tions of water, it creates a pumping action in the peripheral heart. The peripheral heart includes skeletal muscle, arteriolar smooth muscle, and capillary dilation or constriction that is different from the central heart. The human body’s closed circulatory system determines that it is impossible to have an effect on one part of the circulation without having effects on another part of the system. Again, the temperature of the water affects the skin, which reflexes to the nervous system, the circulatory system, and all the way down to the level of the tissues. There are several important treatment variables when using hydro- therapy. The first is temperature; the greater the difference between the temperature of the application and the temperature of the human body, the greater the intensity of the treatment will be. In alternative or revulsive treatments, the greater the contrast in temperature between the hot and cold, the greater the intensity of the treatment. The duration and frequency of the timing of the application are other variables to manipulate. When the time of the application is extreme, the duration is inversely proportional to the overall intensity of the treatment. For example, short treatments of hot or cold are stim- ulating to the circulation, and long treatments, whether hot or cold, are depressive to the system. If the temperature is moderate or tepid, the intensity of the treat- ment is going to be directly proportional to the duration of the timing of application. The more frequent the application is made, the more intense is the overall effect. Also of note is the time of the day when the application is used and whether it is ideal for a patient’s vitality of constitution to enhance the therapeutic effect. The location of the site of application is another important variable. With derivation treatments, the greater the treatment area, the greater is the intensity of the treatment. With retrostatic treatments, the smaller the treatment area, the more intense is the effect. With alter- nating-temperature treatments, the greater the size difference between hot and cold, the greater is the intensity of their combined effect. Of note, remember that a cold application should be smaller than a hot application when using alternating treatments. Incorporating pressure and friction to the treatment area will increase the patient’s ability to tolerate an extreme temperature because they increase the intensity of the treatment due to the greater force of water against the body. For example, friction on the skin’s surface will allow a patient to tolerate cold without shivering and also draw blood to the surface, which will help increase core heat loss. In the case of compresses and fomentations, the ability of water vapor to penetrate the material used in covering the patient is inversely proportional to the heating or cooling effects of the compress. The amount of dampness and wetness in the application is also propor- tionally related to the effect of the temperature on the body.

## Fever and Antipyretic Treatments

Heat may be applied to the body in various ways, including hot packs, fomentations, steam, baths, and showers. All hot applications produce physiological responses that are attempts by the body to eliminate and dissipate excess heat to prevent a damaging rise in local and systemic temperatures. The effects produced by hot applications depend on the mode, temperature, duration, and the condition of the patient. Water at 98°F or above is generally perceived as hot, and water higher than 104°F is considered very hot. At 120°F, an immersion bath becomes unendurable, although small areas of the body, such as the hand, may be conditioned to endure a temperature of 10°F to 15° higher for short periods. The mucous membranes, unlike the skin, may endure temperatures as high as 135°F, which accounts for our ability to drink very hot liquids or benefit from steam inhalation treatment. Although exposure to the high temperatures of hot tubs and saunas has become quite popular in recent years, Kneipp, Priessnitz, and Kellogg all believed that repeated and prolonged use could weaken the individ- ual unless counteracted by frequent cold applications, such as showers or ablutions. Local hot applications result in vasodilation, with a resulting increase in capillary blood flow, oxygen delivery to the tissues, local metabolic activity, and migration of lymphocytes through vessel walls and into the local tissues. Local perspiration is increased, and mus- cle relaxation occurs through the inhibition of muscle spindles, which decreases tone. Intense moist heat applied for a long period of time (several minutes) has a depth of penetration not exceeding about 3.4 cm. The increased blood flow through the area carries away heat con- ducted into the tissues from a hot application and limits the depth of penetration. (This “radiator-like” effect can be overcome by more intense applications of heat, and deep tissue destruction can occur.) General hot applications over half of the body or greater can have dramatic effects on the cardiovascular system. The inability to dissi- pate heat from a large volume of tissues will result in an increase in body temperature, metabolism, and oxygen consumption. The heart rate increases 10 beats for every 1°F rise in body temperature, whereas blood pressure and cardiac output decrease. The respiratory rate increases 5 to 6 breaths per minute for every 1°F rise in body tem- perature, whereas the depth of respiration decreases. Hyperventilation may occur and result in respiratory alkalosis. Van’t Hoff’s law of tem- perature states that for every temperature rise of 18°F, the velocity of chemical and metabolic reactions in the body is increased 2 to 3 times. Slight increases in temperature can have a profound effect on cellu- lar metabolism and systemic physiology, cell membrane permeability, oxidation, and metabolic rate. (Table 40.2) Fever is defined as an increase in the regulated body temperature resulting from an elevation of the thermoregulatory set point for the body in the hypothalamus. This is often caused by infectious diseases. Fever is produced when an exogenous pyrogen is phagocytized by a macrophage, which results in the release of interleukin-1, which travels in the blood like a hormone to the hypothalamus. Prostaglandin E2 is produced in the hypothalamus to increase the body’s temperature set point. At this point, the normal body temperature is perceived as being too low, so the body shifts into heat-conservation mode by initiating shivering, the vasoconstriction of surface blood vessels, and the contrac- tion of arrector pili muscles in the skin. Interleukin-1 also induces fatigue and sleep to save energy while promoting the production of proteins in the liver that stimulate the immune system. In skeletal muscle tissue, we see liposomal activity that causes protein breakdown for the purpose of adding more amino acids to the blood for tissue repair and energy. This

will be experienced by the patient as myalgias. Gut motility is decreased with a fever above 99.5°F, causing anorexia to depress the appetite to free up energy for the healing process. It is important to fast the patient during fever because clinical experience shows that a fever will rarely go above 104°F in adults when they are fasting. Fasting during fever should be avoided with pregnant, nursing, or diabetic patients. The purpose of fever in the body is to increase the production of white blood cells and to move those white blood cells into the cir- culation faster. White blood cell motility and productivity rates are increased with fever. The production of interferon is enhanced, and antibody production increases up to 20 times. During fever, blood concentrations of iron and zinc are reduced to inhibit bacterial growth.

## Types of Fever

Types of fevers include the following: 1. Adaptive increases in temperature produced with exercise, by hor- mones (cortisol, norepinephrine/epinephrine), or in states of dehy- dration or heat exhaustion 2. Pyrogenic fevers (infectious) produced from bacterial toxins and foreign proteins 3. Artificially induced fever using thermo-hydrotherapy to deliber- ately elevate body temperature All fevers can cause the following symptoms in patients: • Nervous system symptoms, including insomnia, headache, or delirium • Chilliness with goose bumps • Shallow, rapid breathing • Malaise or backaches • Excessive thirst • Shallow, rapid breathing • Increased heart rate and cardiac output • Anorexia, foul breath, coated tongue • Hot, dry skin or cold, clammy skin • Constipation or diarrhea • Scanty, highly concentrated and colored urine The following are measurements of normal body temperature: oral, 98.6°F; rectal, 99.6°F to 100°F; and axillary, 97.8°F. The ideal range for fever is 102°F to 103°F; this is optimal for fighting infection and is most effective. At temperatures between 104°F and 107°F, dehydra- tion becomes a concern, and above 107°F, dangerous effects can occur, such as loss of consciousness and irreversible protein denaturation. The degree of temperature elevation in a fever is determined by the severity of the pathogen and the vitality of the patient. We see this often when children run much higher fevers than adults or in chronically ill patients and the elderly, who can sometimes run only a slight fever if at all. The best use of hydrotherapy in treating fever is to help the body maintain an optimal temperature between 102°F and 104°F. By using water, we can keep the patient well hydrated and can lower a danger- ously high fever or raise a suboptimally low fever. When a patient is in the ideal range for fever and is sweating, the patient needs to be managed by keeping him or her well hydrated, warm, and comfortable. Dehydration can cause the body temperature to stay elevated lon- ger and will add to the risks for dangerous side effects from fever, such as seizures. The application or internal use of cool water is helpful for a high fever, and warm water externally or internally through teas to help promote sweating is helpful in a low fever or chilly patient. High fevers can result in fluid loss and electrolyte imbalances. Fluid-electrolyte replacement and rehydration formulas should be added to the water (e.g., vegetable broth, salt, diluted juice, or a rehydration drink). Applications of heat during fever are contraindicated in peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, brain injuries, and stroke.

## Effects of Water Temperature on Fever

The effects of water temperature on fever are as follows: • Short cold applications of temperature result in increased heat loss and increased heat production and, therefore, no net change in body temperature. • Long cold applications of temperature result in increased heat loss and decreased heat production and, therefore, a decrease in net body temperature unless the patient is shivering. • Tepid applications increase heat loss and cause no change in produc- tion and, therefore, result in a decrease in net body temperature. • Short hot applications between 3 and 5 minutes greatly decrease heat loss and greatly increase heat production and, therefore, result in a great increase in net body temperature. • Long hot applications of temperature greatly decrease heat loss and greatly increase heat production, resulting in a substantial net increase in body temperature. • Very short hot applications of less than 3 minutes will result in a great increase in heat loss as blood is drawn to the surface to improve heat loss in the core of the body, with a slight increase in heat production, therefore resulting in a decrease in net body tem- perature. In summary, the only temperature applications that offer a net loss of body temperature are the long cold, tepid, and very short hot types. Tepid and neutral baths are very effective in their ability to carry heat away from the body by conduction without increasing the body’s production of heat either by the application of heat or by resulting in the patient shivering. Tepid baths range from 81°F to 92°F, and neutral baths are defined as 93°F to 96°F. Tepid and neutral water affusions involve the pouring of water onto the patient to increase the friction and effect of the treatment. A tepid sponge bath is a gentle and effective treatment for fever reduction, especially in children. The patient loses heat by conduction and evaporation, and the sponging provides gentle friction to bring more blood to the surface. Be aware of the coasting factor, which dictates that oral body tem- perature readings will take some time to catch up to the core body temperature. It is recommended to stop the hydrotherapy treatment before the patient reaches the desired oral temperature by 1°F to 2°F.

# GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR HYDROTHERAPY

<!-- chunk -->

## For the Health Care Provider

1. To ensure safe and effective outcomes, it is important to take a full case history for each patient and rule out contraindications to the hydrotherapy treatment. Determine the physical, mental, and emotional status of each individual. Children, the elderly, those with major health problems, those with generally low resistance, obese individuals, and those with severe physical limitations may have a weaker response to hydrotherapy treatments and should be more closely observed. 2. Thoroughly explain each treatment before beginning. Include in your discussion the length of the session, the sequence of events, and any other pertinent details, such as the rationale for the treatment and temperatures to expect. Ensure that the patient understands the specifics of each therapy and that the patient is comfortable with all aspects of the treatment. 3. Check for and record objective findings at the onset of the ther- apy session. This should include taking the patient’s temperature, pulse, and respiration rate. 4. Follow standard precautions that are designed to protect the patient and health care provider.

## 321CHAPTER 40 Hydrotherapy

5. Stay with the client throughout the session or have an emergency signal such as a bell or alert system. Check in periodically with the client. Rerecord the patient’s pulse, respiration rate, and tem- perature, and monitor other physiological markers such as blood sugar as needed. 6. Provide a clean treatment room equipped with all necessary sup- plies. Encourage hydration and provide clean drinking water. Ensure adequate temperature control in each treatment room. 7. Monitor the patient closely for side effects of the treatment. The client should not become chilled to the point of shivering. If the patient gets cold, consider initiating warming techniques such as friction rubs, offering warm drinks, or applying additional blankets or dressings while continuing with treatments. Oppositely, if the patient becomes overheated (depending on the therapy), initiate cooling techniques such as applying towels dipped in ice water and wrung out or apply- ing ice packs where indicated. If the patient becomes dizzy or light- headed, assess blood sugar, offer hydration, and encourage rest. Other side effects may include nervousness, heart palpitations, nau- sea, and aches and pains. In most cases, symptoms are self-limiting and respond to simple interventions and rest. 8. Check the temperature of both hot and cold applications before applying them to a patient’s skin. Use an appropriate thermome- ter when using water in a treatment. 9. Record final pulse, temperature, respiratory rate, and any other pertinent physical examination findings. Adequate documenta- tion of the therapy session will guide ongoing treatments, may prompt future research, and will continue to substantiate hydro- therapy as an effective therapeutic modality. 10. Inform your patient of any posttreatment precautions and rec- ommendations. Some reactions may take place several hours to several days after treatment, so ensure that patients have a way to follow up with you if needed.

## For the Patient or Individual

<!-- chunk -->

## Before Treatment

1. Plan your hydrotherapy session at a time of day when you feel vital and unhurried. 2. Avoid eating 1 to 2 hours before your treatment time. Avoid alco- hol and recreational drug use. Stay adequately hydrated. 3. Report all medications and supplements to your health care pro- vider. If performing hydrotherapy at home or in a health facility such as a gym, make sure you check with your doctor first.

<!-- chunk -->

## During Treatment

1. Report any reactions to your practitioner and stop therapy imme- diately if adverse effects occur. 2. Remain hydrated throughout the hydrotherapy session. 3. Take measures to warm up or cool down if you become too chilled or overheated, respectively. 4. Mindful breathing exercises may help balance the nervous system and optimize outcomes. 5. Follow safety rules and regulations of the health care facility (e.g., obey time restrictions for saunas and treatment pools).

<!-- chunk -->

## After Treatment

1. Avoid drafts and excessive heat or cold after hydrotherapy treat- ments. 2. Be mindful of any side effects of your treatment, and report them to your health care provider. 3. Stay hydrated and follow dietary recommendations or restrictions specific to the hydrotherapy treatment.

## General Cautions and Contraindications

Hydrotherapy is generally very safe, but, as with most medical thera- pies, there are cautions to consider and contraindications to be aware of. When caution is taken in hydrotherapy, it does not mean that the therapy should be avoided; it simply guides us to consider more closely the specific needs of the individual before, during, and after the ther- apeutic treatment. A contraindication is defined by any special symp- tom or circumstance that renders the use of a remedy or the carrying out of a procedure inadvisable, usually because of risk.12 Hydrotherapy treatments may produce unexpected or undesired effects. When this occurs, it’s important to carefully to assess the indi- vidual’s response to the treatment and ensure that the therapy has been properly administered. If an aggravation from treatment does occur, the therapist will need to review the intensity of the treatment and the length of treatment and reassess the appropriateness for the individual. Modifications can be made if additional treatments are indicated. Most side effects of hydrotherapy are self-limiting, and the individ- ual will often respond well to rest and simple interventions. Some of these effects include shivering, headache, dizziness or lightheadedness, hyperventilation, heart palpitations, skin irritation, nausea, insomnia, and minor aches and pains. Shivering will occur if the client is allowed to get too cold and therapy is not followed by appropriate warming techniques. Headaches may present secondary to dehydration; as a reaction to the water temperature, blood sugar dips, or blood pressure spikes; or as a result of a detoxification reaction. Detoxification reac- tions are possible within hours or may occur up to 1 or 2 days after treatment. Dizziness or lightheadedness experienced during a hydrotherapy treatment may occur as a result of dehydration, decreased blood sugar, and/or decreased blood pressure levels. The client should be given ade- quate hydration and may be encouraged to lie down and get back up slowly once symptoms have subsided. Keep a source of sugar on hand in the case of hypoglycemia. Hyperventilation can develop from ner- vousness. A reduction in feelings of tension, as well as increased pain thresholds to hot and cold, can be achieved by having the patient per- form deep- and slow-breathing techniques.13 Heart palpitations may accompany dizziness and result from ele- vated body temperature. Other factors affecting heart rate include emotions, body size and position, and medications that are shown to affect pulse rate. The heart rate is normally between 60 beats per min- ute (bpm) and 100 bpm, although a pulse rate as low as 40 bpm can be seen in very physically fit individuals.

## Pregnancy

When used with caution and professional guidance, hydrotherapy can be supportive for women in pregnancy and during the labor process. Although warm-water therapies can promote relaxation and offer relief of minor aches and pains, prolonged exposures to heat sources such as hot tubs, hot baths, saunas, and steam rooms are contrain- dicated. Hot applications over the abdomen should be avoided. The American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) affirms that “Warm water immersion hydrotherapy during labor provides comfort, sup- ports relaxation, and is a safe and effective nonpharmacological pain relief strategy that promotes physiological childbirth.”14 When evi- dence-based clinical guidelines are followed, research demonstrates that the use of hydrotherapy for pain relief during labor does not increase risks for healthy women or newborns.14 The Organization of Teratology Information Services (OTIS) states that in pregnancy, a body temperature over 101°F can be of concern, especially if it lasts for a long period of time.15 Hot baths would be a safer way to relax than would a hot tub. In a bath, the upper body remains

out of the water, and the water in the bath cools over time, reducing the risk of overheating. Although hot tubs are not recommended in pregnancy, there are steps to take to reduce risk. These include mon- itoring body temperature to avoid overheating, limiting time in a hot tub to 10 minutes or less, and reprogramming the hot tub to main- tain a lower temperature.16 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant women never let their core body temperature rise above 102.2°F.16 Neutral baths and Epsom salt hand and foot baths in the later stages of pregnancy have traditionally been used for symptoms of local edema. According to the UK Teratology Information Service (UKTIS), there are limited data on most pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to external heat sources such as saunas, hot tubs, and hot baths, and there are no data relating specifically to steam room exposure.17 An evi- dence-based assessment of the potential risks of these treatments in preg- nancy is difficult due to the limitations of testing on pregnant females.

## Hypertension and Cardiovascular Disease

Hydrotherapy treatments should be used with caution in individuals with cardiovascular disease, and there are several contraindications to consider. These individuals may be taking medications that mod- ify how the body will respond to heat and cold and should be closely monitored. Heat should not be applied over artificial devices such as pacemakers or implantable defibrillators. Elevated temperatures can cause increased demands on the circu- latory system, including significant changes in local blood flow and changes in the size of blood vessels, heart rate, the volume of blood pumped from the heart, and blood pressure. High-temperature treatments such as sauna therapy, hot baths, and steam baths could be potentially dangerous in those with hypertension due to a tem- porary increase in blood pressure, and thus they should be avoided. Additionally, high-temperature treatments can ultimately reduce blood pressure, leading to fainting or dizziness in a person with low blood pressure. The heart may not be strong enough for very high-temperature treatments in those with congestive heart failure (CHF), and these treatments should be avoided. In contrast, thermal vasodilation after warm-water bathing and low-temperature sauna bathing at 60°C for 15 minutes has been shown to improve cardiac function in those with CHF.18 Local hydrotherapy treatments are used with caution in those with varicose veins, and extreme hot and cold treatments should be avoided. Local hot and cold treatments should be avoided in those with phlebi- tis. When dealing with a vasoconstriction disorder, such as Raynaud’s syndrome, local cold applications are contraindicated. Local hot appli- cations are contraindicated in those with arteriosclerosis, a condition involving thickening, hardening, and loss of elasticity in the walls of the blood vessels. In patients with coronary risk factors, there may be a risk of pre- cipitating myocardial infarction (MI), or heart attack, when alternat- ing heat exposure during sauna therapy is followed by rapid cooling during a cold-water bath.19 Interestingly, animal studies have revealed that sauna therapy may serve as a noninvasive therapy for patients with MI because it attenuates cardiac remodeling after MI by improving coronary vascularity in the noninfarcted myocardium.20

## Cancer

It is known that there are more than 100 types of cancer and that can- cer can form almost anywhere in the human body. Individuals who are undergoing cancer treatment should have the approval of their physician before initiating hydrotherapy treatments. Local and whole- body hydrotherapy treatments may be useful for those diagnosed with cancer for reasons other than cancer treatment, such as for pain or relaxation purposes. However, because hydrotherapy treatments at the very least can have effects on the skin and place demands on the cir- culatory system, it is imperative to treat the whole person and assess where contraindications to treatment may arise. Daily, brief cold-water stress over many months may enhance anti- tumor immunity and improve nonlymphoid cancer survival rate.21 A hypothesis suggests that sudden ice-cold-water immersion can increase blood–brain barrier permeability, thereby increasing the mortality of neu- rovirulent infections. This could lead to immunotherapy development for some nonlymphoid cancers, including those caused by viral infections.22 Hyperthermic treatment of tumors can be traced back to the time of the ancient Greeks, and modern medicine has used hyperthermia as an adjunct cancer treatment in various settings. For example, research has demonstrated that hyperthermia, when added to chemotherapy and/or radiation, may positively affect treatment outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer.23 Research has also shown that hyperthermia can have a synergistic effect on the cell-killing effect of chemotherapy drugs and radiation.24 Because of this, hyperthermia treatments should not be indiscriminately used in those receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation. A study on preventing alopecia caused by chemotherapy revealed that the use of a cold pillow compress could reduce hair folli- cle inhibition or damage caused by chemotherapeutic agents.25 Colon hydrotherapy is an option for colonoscopy preparation for colon cancer screening. A study showed that the quality of colon cleansing, overall tolerance, comfort, and convenience were signifi- cantly better for colon hydrotherapy compared with alternative prepa- rations.26 Colon hydrotherapy is contraindicated in those with cancer of the rectum or colon.

## Diabetes

An estimated 30 million people of all ages—or 9.4% of the U.S. pop- ulation—had diabetes in 2015, reaching a high of 25% among those aged 65 years or older.27 Because of its prevalence, it’s important to understand when hydrotherapy can safely be used for those with dia- betes. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus are both associated with reduced ability to maintain core temperature during thermal stress. This has been related to impairments in the body’s ability to dissi- pate heat, mediated via increases in skin blood flow and sweating during heat stress, as well as a reduced capacity to increase metabolic heat production and to decrease skin blood flow during cold stress.28 Generally, warm- and neutral-temperature treatments are safer, and recommendations for hydrotherapy treatment should be approved by the patient’s physician. Acute complications of diabetes occur as a result of blood sugar levels that become either too high or too low. Chronic complications of the disease often include nerve damage and tissue damage from chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Cardiovascular disease can develop slowly in those with diabetes, particularly atherosclerosis, so high-temperature treatments such as hot saunas, hot baths, and local hot applications are contraindicated. When diabetes affects the smaller blood vessels of the legs and feet, these vessels may not dilate normally in response to heat. Heat applied to these areas leads to increased metabolism in the heated tissues, which would require more oxygen and other nutrients. When blood vessels cannot supply enough oxygen and other nutrients to the treated tissues, it can result in tissue death. Another factor to consider is diabetic neuropathy, a nerve con- dition that causes, among other symptoms, a limited ability to sense pressure and temperature in the extremities. In this situation, the indi- vidual may not be able to discern if a hot application is burning the skin or if a cold application is freezing the skin. Therefore hot and cold applications are contraindicated.

## 323CHAPTER 40 Hydrotherapy

Less-extreme-temperature treatments, such as alternating warm (102°F) and cold (55°F) footbaths, used under medical supervision, may help increase circulation and offer treatment for diabetic ulcers. Immersion in Dead Sea water at a temperature of only 95°F for 20 min- utes was shown to produce significant reductions in blood glucose in those with type 2 diabetes.29

# HYDROTHERAPY TECHNIQUES

The range of hydrotherapy treatments is vast, and the ways in which water is applied to the body to initiate a therapeutic response are only limited by the imagination of the therapist. Deciding on which treat- ment to use requires a thorough understanding of the principles of hydrotherapy, the health status of the patient, and the effects of hot and cold on the body.

## Compresses

A compress is essentially the application of water at any temperature through a cloth medium or other compress material, wrung out and applied to the body. In the early 20th century, J. H. Kellogg described 12 types of compresses. They were classified according to their tem- perature, as (1) very cold; (2) cool or cooling; (3) warm or neutral; (4) hot; (5) very hot; (6) alternate (alternating very hot and very cold); (7) revulsive (short cold followed by prolonged very hot); (8) hot and cold (simultaneously); (9) hot and cold pack; (10) heating or stimulat- ing (applying cold, protected by an additional material and prolonged until warmed by the body); (11) proximal compress; and (12) the irri- gating compress.30 While appreciating that each type of compress has its unique features, four basic types of compresses will be discussed: hot and cold compresses, warming compresses, and alternating hot and cold compresses. A single compress is the use of only wet material applied to the body. A double compress, in comparison, consists of an initial wet layer covered by a water-resistant—or dry—material covering, such as wool. This double layering acts to prevent cooling by evaporation or radiation. When applied to specific areas of the body, compresses can be referred to by the area being treated (e.g., a throat compress or eye compress).

## Cold Compresses and Packs

When a cloth is wrung from cold or ice water and applied to a partic- ular area of the body, it is considered a cold compress. A cold pack, on the other hand, is made from crushed ice or produced commercially as gel packs that are cooled in a freezer. A cold pack requires almost no preparation and allows for more aggressive tissue cooling compared with a compress. Cold packs remain cold for a longer duration than a cold compress; therefore cold compresses are renewed frequently to achieve the desired cold effect. Additionally, cold packs applied for long periods have the potential to cause tissue damage, so treatment time should be limited to 15 to 20 minutes, and the skin should be occasionally monitored. Refer to Table 40.3 for a list of indications and contraindications for local cold applications. The temperature and type of cold compress will depend on the area of the body being treated as well as the health status of the patient. Cold packs are often applied to larger, flat surfaces, such as the back, due to the limited ability to wrap them around irregularly shaped surfaces. Cold compresses are used more flexibly, can be applied over smaller or delicate surfaces such as the eyes or forehead, and are more suitable for clients who cannot tolerate very cold applications. To elicit a more specific effect from a cold compress, a practitioner may choose to add certain chemical solutions to the compress, such as Epsom salts, essential oils, and a plethora of herbs. When herbs are used, they are steeped in water to produce a tea, and the compress material is then dipped into it, wrung out, and applied to the body. Adding essential oils to the water is much quicker than preparing herbs and requires an understanding of the effects of the oils on the skin.

## Hot Compresses and Fomentations

A hot compress is the local application of moist heat to an area of the body to elicit a rise in local tissue temperature, improve local circula- tion, support muscle relaxation, and relieve musculoskeletal pain. A hot compress usually consists of a folded cloth dipped in hot water, wrung out, and applied to a surface of the body. Depending on the size of the area being treated, a washcloth, hand towel, or large towel may be used. A fomentation is a particular type of hot compress that delivers moist heat at a higher temperature for a longer period of time. It typically consists of many layers of folded towels, flannel, or other thick material that can absorb water and retain heat. A fomentation is often wrapped with a layer of wool felt to effectively hold heat and then by additional layers of towels to protect the patient’s skin. Similar to modifying a cold compress, a practitioner may choose to add certain substances to a hot compress to elicit a more specific effect. For example, a Thai herbal compress, consisting of Plai or Cassumunar ginger, turmeric, and camphor, may be used for osteoarthritis and muscle pain and can also be used as a treatment of choice to induce lac- tation.31 Ground mustard plasters have long been used to warm muscle tissues and treat chronic aches and pains. Because mustard plasters are generally very hot, treatment time is often limited to 15 minutes, and the underlying skin should be checked frequently to avoid irritation or blistering. Castor oil packs can be used to increase local circulation of blood and lymph, relieve muscle and joint pain, soften scar tissue, and relax smooth muscle. Castor oil packs have been shown to effectively control symptoms of constipation.32 Refer to Table 40.4 for a list of contraindications for local hot applications.

## Warming Compresses

A warming compress consists of a cold compress covered by a layer of dry material—typically flannel or wool—that is worn for prolonged

## 324SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

periods until eventually warmed by the body. The top layer of dry material acts to prevent heat loss by evaporation and allows for the accumulation of heat. Also referred to as a cold double compress, a warming compress is used to improve local circulation, relax mus- cles, and relieve musculoskeletal pain. There is also a derivative effect that occurs when blood flow is increased as a result of warming the compress. A popular example of a warming compress is the wet sock treat- ment. This treatment consists of dipping cotton socks in cold water, wringing them out completely, and applying them to previously warmed feet. Once the feet have been soaked in warm water for 5 to 10 minutes—or warmed by other means—the cold socks are applied. Cold socks can be placed in a freezer for several minutes to increase the intensity of the treatment if there are no contraindications to doing so. A pair of dry wool socks is then applied to cover the cold socks and left overnight to be warmed by the patient. The socks are often dry by morning. The wet sock treatment is commonly used for sinus con- gestion, upper respiratory infections, bronchitis, cough or sore throat, headaches, and ear infection. The temperature of the initial cold application will depend on the treatment location and the health status of the individual. The same basic guidelines for cold compresses apply for warming compresses. Because a colder application can elicit a stronger secondary reaction to the cold, caution is taken with weak or debilitated individuals who are unable to generate a strong secondary response.

## Alternating Hot and Cold Compresses

Alternating hot and cold compresses—or local contrast treatments— are one of the most efficient ways to improve blood flow through an area of the body. This procedure is a succession of compresses of hot and cold that combine the effects of both the hot and cold compress. The hot compress is applied for up to 3 to 5 minutes, alternating with a cold compress for 30 to 90 seconds. As a general rule, the duration of a hot application should be greater than that of a cold application and cover a slightly larger area. Additionally, the procedure should always begin with the hot compress and end with the cold compress. It is also repeated three or more times. The heat applied initially during an alternating compress treat- ment causes dilation of the cutaneous vasculature. A subsequent cold application will cause vasoconstriction followed by vasodilation, allowing for marked improvements in blood flow to the treated site. This can be particularly helpful to stimulate healing and reduce swell- ing in a joint after injury or surgery. By increasing blood flow, contrast compresses can help relieve pain. For example, alternating compresses were shown to improve foot functionality scores in individuals with heel pain.33

## Baths

Baths are full or partial immersions of the body into various tempera- tures of water to produce a wide range of therapeutic effects. With whole-body immersions, the body—except for the head—is immersed in water, which can be performed in a standard bathtub. In a par- tial-body immersion, only a particular part of the body is immersed in water using a variety of basic containers, such as a bowl, a bucket, or standard bathtub. Additives can be used, such as Epsom salt, sea salt, baking soda, oatmeal, mustard powder, and herbs, to elicit a more specific effect from the bath.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hot Baths

Depending on the tolerance of the individual as well as the condition being treated, hot baths will generally range in temperature from 100°F to 106°F and are administered for 20 to 60 minutes or longer. Hot baths are used for many types of musculoskeletal pain and to stimulate the immune system, induce sweating, and cleanse the body, among other purposes. They encourage muscle relaxation, enhance circulation, and are efficient at raising core temperature. Hyperthermia treatments are useful for managing infections and can be used as adjunct cancer support. When treatments are limited to a brief period of only a few minutes, peripheral vasodilation may promote heat loss and thereby reduce fever. The duration of a local hot immersion is typically 15 to 20 minutes and will depend on the condition being treated, as well as the tolerance of the individual. One type of local hot immersion, the hot foot bath, has been shown to relieve fatigue and insomnia in patients undergo- ing chemotherapy.34 It can be used as an effective intervention for the management of sleep disturbances after traumatic brain injury.35 When performed at home, whole-body hot immersions should be limited to 30 minutes and kept to a temperature of 104°F. An individ- ual should have assistance when performing hyperthermia treatments in a home setting. When performed in a clinical setting, more aggres- sive treatment can be administered under close supervision. The water temperature should be kept to 106°F, and the duration of treatment should be limited to 60 minutes. Contraindications to whole-body hot immersions include seizure disorders, pregnancy, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, loss of sensa- tion, intolerance to heat, multiple sclerosis, and drug or alcohol inges- tion. Prolonged hot immersions should be avoided in children, the elderly, weak or anemic individuals, those with severe organic disease, and those with a tendency to hemorrhage. General precautions should be followed when performing hyper- thermia treatments. Patients should wait at least an hour after eating a meal before receiving treatment to avoid symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Likewise, if a client has gone too long without food, symp- toms of hypoglycemia may arise. The individual should be adequately hydrated before, during, and after treatment. Additionally, because hot-water immersions may induce hypotension, the individual could become lightheaded and lose his or her footing. Clients should be instructed to rise slowly from the bath with assistance close by. Headaches may result from hyperthermia treatments. Applying cold compresses to the head and face early and throughout the treatment can prevent this. Hyperventilation sometimes occurs with hot-water

immersions and, although rare, may lead to early tetany from respi- ratory alkalosis. This can be prevented by monitoring the individual’s respiratory rate and offering breath coaching as needed.

<!-- chunk -->

## Neutral Baths

The neutral bath is a head-out, whole-body immersion bath given at a temperature close to that of the body and exerting as little thermal effects as possible. A minor variation in temperature by only a few degrees could result in an altered therapeutic response. Neutral baths are taken for a duration of 15 minutes to 4 hours, although warm water will need to be added after a period of about 20 minutes to maintain the appropriate temperature. Neutral baths have been shown to lower heart rate, blood pressure, and cortisol levels while preserving metabolic rate and body tempera- ture and increasing urine output.36 Neutral baths have a calming effect on the nervous system and are indicated for those with insomnia, anxiety, nervousness, and pain. They may be a useful aid in detoxi- fication treatments due to their effects on urine output, as well as an adjunct treatment for peripheral edema. Caution should be taken with those with cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, and the dura- tion of treatment should be limited or treatment avoided in those with eczema. The air in the room should be kept warm, and care should be taken so that the individual does not become chilled after treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cold and Contrast Baths

A cold, full-body immersion bath is used at a temperature below 60°F and is often limited to a duration of only a few minutes. It generally follows a hot, full-body immersion to reverse the vasodilation of skin after a heat treatment. A meta-analysis concluded that individuals with exercise-induced hyperthermia were cooled twice as fast by cold-water immersion as by passive recovery.37 Such an invigorating treatment should only be attempted by those in robust health. Cold baths are con- traindicated in the very young and the very old; weak and debilitated patients; those who are chilled or have an aversion to cold; and those with kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and hyperthyroidism. A local cold immersion bath can be used therapeutically to reduce musculoskeletal pain or swelling in a particular area of the body, such as the arm, hand, or foot. Compared with the effects of using an ice pack or ice massage, a local cold-water immersion is most indicated for inducing therapeutic effects associated with the reduction of motor nerve conduction (Fig. 40.1).38 Contrast baths combine both hot- and cold-water immersions and are effective for stimulating blood flow to the skin and decreas- ing congestion in the body. Similar to other contrast therapies, treat- ment begins with hot and ends with cold. For local immersions, 3 to 5 minutes of hot is followed by 30 to 90 seconds of cold. Full-body immersion often requires at least 10 minutes of hot, followed by 30 to 90 seconds of cold, and is most appropriate for those in robust health. Local contrast immersions require only a few small buckets and access to hot and cold water, allowing for both home and clinical use. Full contrast immersions are typically available in a spa or clinical setting because the process necessitates two large tubs to accommodate a hot and cold immersion. Contrast water therapy can also be performed easily at home in the shower. Ending a daily hot shower with a full- body cold rinse is tonifying to the circulatory and immune systems. In a long-term prospective study, the frequency and intensity of common colds were reduced after volunteers were regularly treated with con- trasting hot and cold showers over a 6-month period.39

## Sitz Bath

A sitz bath is a partial immersion bath of the pelvic region that has long been used to treat afflictions of the abdomen, pelvis, perineum, and low back. It is carried out in a specifically designed tub—older mod- els resemble a chair-shaped bathtub and are made of porcelain; newer models are designed to sit atop the toilet or are advanced enough to contain their own water heater. The sitz bath can be effectively taken in a standard bathtub or even a plastic tub large enough to immerse the pelvic region. A sitz bath may be taken hot, cold, neutral, or with contrasting hot and cold, and preparations such as Epsom salt, herbs, and essential oils can be added. Hot sitz baths are analgesic and stimulate pelvic circulation. They have been used to help relieve low back pain, dysmenorrhea, spastic constipation, cramps of the uterus or ureters, ovarian or tes- ticular pain, sciatica, and after cystoscopy or hemorrhoidectomy. After sphincterotomy for anal fissure, the sitz bath provided sig- nificant relief of anal burning and increased patient satisfaction score.40 The hot sitz bath relieves urinary retention in patients after hemorrhoidectomy, with spontaneous micturition more likely at higher water temperatures.41 Hot sitz baths can be used to raise core temperature as well as to create a fluid-shifting, or derivative, effect. Hot sitz baths significantly reduced urethral stricture after transure- thral resection of the prostate.42 The hot sitz bath has a duration of ↑ Hydrostatic pressure? ↑ Muscle function Cold Water Immersion ↓ Perception of soreness ↓ Oedema Muscle ↓ oxygenation recovery ↓ Primary & secondary muscle damage? ↓ Nerve conduction velocity ↓ T core ↓ T skin ↓ T muscle ↓ Muscle blood flow Fig. 40.1 Physiological effects of cold-water immersion.

3 to 10 minutes and is followed by a cool sponging or spray to the area. A hot footbath may be taken concomitantly, ending with cold water or spray to the feet. Cold compresses may be applied to the forehead or back of the neck during treatment. Hot applications to the pelvis are contraindicated during menses, in pregnancy, and in cases of acute inflammation. A neutral sitz bath is typically taken for a longer duration of 15 minutes to 2 hours. Warm water may be added to maintain tem- perature as needed. It has a calming feature, appropriate for acute inflammation, and may offer relief of pruritus. A hot footbath is optional with a neutral sitz bath, and a blanket placed over the patient’s upper body may be used to prevent chilling. A cold sitz bath is used primarily for its tonifying effects—increasing the tone of the smooth muscle of the bladder, uterus, and colon. It offers support for atonic constipation, incontinence, metrorrhagia, subinvo- lution of the uterus, and enuresis. Cold sitz baths significantly reduce edema43 and pain after an episiotomy,44 and aromatherapy could offer perineal wound healing in the postpartum period.45 The duration of a cold sitz bath is typically 30 seconds to 8 minutes. The patient should be adequately covered to avoid chilling. The cold sitz bath often follows the hot sitz bath. In this case the level of the hot water should be located at least 1 inch above the level of the cold water, which helps prevent chilling. Contrast sitz baths are a combination of hot and cold sitz baths. The duration of the hot sitz bath is commonly 3 minutes, followed by 30 seconds in the cold sitz bath. The procedure is repeated three times and always ends with cold. Contrast sitz baths are useful for increasing pelvic circulation and smooth muscle tone in the pelvic region. They are indicated for chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic pros- tatitis, postpartum care, atonic constipation, anal fissures, and after surgical procedures such as hemorrhoidectomy.

## Cold Friction Rubs

A cold friction rub is a whole-body friction treatment performed with a cold, wet coarse bath mitt or washcloth and applied in sequential order to the body. It may be used to enhance the effects of another cold treatment, after a heating treatment to prevent the client from becom- ing chilled, or as a stand-alone treatment to stimulate blood flow to the skin and as a general tonic. Cold friction rubs are especially supportive for immobile or bedridden clients who are not receiving circulatory stimulation through exercise.46 The client lies supine, undressed to his or her level of comfort and draped, except for the area being treated. The extent of water saturation of the mitt depends on the cooling effect desired and the health status of the client. The area of the body is treated until the skin becomes reddened. Each area of the body is treated, dried, and draped to retain the heat produced by the body. This treatment is contraindicated for those who are chilled; have a sen- sitivity to cold; or have infected, damaged, sunburned, or sensitive skin.

## Constitutional Hydrotherapy

Developed in the early 20th century by Dr. O. G. Carroll, the consti- tutional hydrotherapy method incorporates the use of alternating hot and cold compresses, along with electrical stimulation via sine-wave therapy. Also acting as a warming compress, this therapy is useful for a vast array of conditions; because of its gentle nature, it has very few contraindications when used under the care of a trained naturopathic physician or qualified hydrotherapist. The therapy begins with the application of two hot towels applied to the patient’s torso, extending from the collarbone to the hips. The hot towels are then covered by a wool blanket and left in place for minutes. If the patient is chilly, he or she may need more blankets. At the 5-minute mark, another fresh hot wet towel is applied quickly to the patient’s torso, followed immediately by a cold wet towel. The cold towel is left in place for 10 minutes while sine-wave pads are applied to the patient’s lower thoracic region and abdomen. The cold towel is checked to ensure that at least the middle portion of the towel is warmed. The patient then turns over, and the sequence is repeated again (two wet hot towels to the back, covered by wool for 5 minutes, followed by a wet cold towel, covered by wool for 10 minutes or until warmed). Dr. Letitia Dick-Kronenberg, ND, is careful to point out that a patient is not to be wrapped with a sheet before applying the wool blanket.47 She explains that the sheet chills a patient and that the wool blankets are simply applied on top of the towels. When the hot compress is initially applied, it acts to dilate the super- ficial vasculature, increasing blood flow to the surface of the body. Once the cold towel is applied, it causes vasoconstriction, shunting the blood back to vital organs. The cold compress covered by wool is warmed by the recirculation of blood back to the surface of the body. The addition of sine-wave therapy allows for a much quicker treatment than a traditional warming compress treatment. The constitutional hydrotherapy treatment takes approximately an hour and always ends with the cold compress. Constitutional hydrotherapy is used to boost the immune system and bring balance to body functions. A pilot study completed in at Bastyr University suggests that constitutional hydrotherapy can be safely administered to HIV+ adults and revealed a statistically sig- nificant increase in energy as well as increased physical functioning and quality of life.48 Research by Kate Wiggin, ND, at the National College of Naturopathic Medicine showed a posttreatment increase in leukocyte circulation that remained elevated for 2 hours.49 Research conducted by Mark Carney, ND, and Bryan McConnell, ND, demon- strated a host of changes in the body after constitutional hydrotherapy treatments. These include a decrease in body fat, increased vitality, decreased pain, and decreased cholesterol levels, to name a few.50

## Wet Sheet Pack

The wet sheet pack procedure involves wrapping the undressed pati ent in a cold wet sheet and then covering the patient with dry blankets to insulate, control body temperature, and regulate moisture evapora- tion. It is recommended to use cold water between 15°C and 20°C for soaking the sheet, and the wet sheet pack must come into close con- tact with all areas of skin when applied. Dry blankets must be snugly wrapped at the neck and shoulders down to the feet to prevent any airflow and eliminate patient chilling. The physiological effects of a wet sheet pack are determined by the duration of the treatment and the number of dry covering blankets to control evaporation. There are several stages of heat generation during the wet sheet pack. The first temperature effect is the cooling stage, lasting 5 to 15 minutes as body heat is removed by evaporation. The cooling evaporation stage is helpful for reducing fevers. In the cooling stage, the patient’s body is attempting to warm the sheet back to body temperature; it is complete when the patient no longer perceives the wet sheet as cold. The degree of wetness in the sheet can be tailored for individual patient needs; weak and frail patients will require a well- wrung-out sheet, whereas vital patients can benefit from the toning effect of added sheet wetness. The second neutral stage begins when the sheet reaches or slightly exceeds the temperature of the skin. Here, the property of derivation is acting upon cerebral blood flow by lessening the amount of blood in the brain, which induces a sedative-like stage and tends to induce sleep. The neutral stage can last from 15 minutes to an hour, depending on the vitality of the patient and how many dry covering blankets are used in the wrap. The more dry coverings, the sooner the completion of this stage.

<!-- chunk -->

## 327CHAPTER 40 Hydrotherapy

The third stage is the heating and sweating stage. Here, the sheet pack has been warmed, and the rise in skin temperature causes super- ficial blood vessels to dilate and draw blood away from congested organs. The heating stage can last from 15 minutes to an hour. Finally, as the patient’s body temperature increases, the patient begins to perspire and eliminate toxins through various detoxification processes. Toxins such as those from alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and pro- cessed and refined foods can be removed via the diaphoretic process. Febrile patients will reach the elimination phase much sooner than the weak or frail, and all patients will require plenty of fluids (water, elec- trolytes, teas, etc.) to maintain adequate hydration. The detoxification phase can last up to an hour and should be promptly discontinued if the patient gets chilled or uncomfortable. Upon completion of the wet sheet pack, the patient’s skin should be frictioned quickly with a dry towel before the patient redresses. The wet sheet wrapping sequence and dry blanket applications are illustrated in detail in Lectures in Naturopathic Hydrotherapy by Boyle and Saine.5 Indications for the wet sheet pack include the following: fevers, insomnia, mania, delirium, restlessness, nervous exhaustion, hypopep- sia, detoxification from substances, gout, bronchitis, common colds, influenza, jaundice, measles, scarlet fever, constipation, hepatic con- gestion, and splenic congestion. There are very few contraindications, but caution should be taken in patients with diabetes, poor circulation, or skin eruptions and in very weak or ill patients.

## Colon Hydrotherapy

Colonic hydrotherapy is a healing tradition that has been used by nearly every culture across the earth. The ancient healing tradition of using water to cleanse the colon has been used in India for more than years in the Ayurvedic medicine methods. Worldwide, many prescrip- tions for enemas were found on Babylonian and Assyrian tablets. The earliest record of using an appliance to administer an enema is from in the late 14th century. These early methods used tubes or cannulas made of bone, reed, or metal attached to a bladder or sleeve made from silk cloths, animal skin, or an ox bladder. Enemas are documented to have been used by Chinese, Hindu, Greek, Roman, Sumerian, and African cultures. Modern colonic equipment was introduced into the United States by Kellogg, Dierker, and Vattenborg in the early 1900s. These early machines used large amounts of water to flush the colon. Current equipment uses a disposable plastic speculum and tubing to avoid and omit any danger for cross-contamination between patients. Water pressure, flow, and temperature can be manipulated to maximize ther- apeutic goals and patient comfort.

## Effects of Colonic Hydrotherapy

The effects of colonic hydrotherapy include the following: 1. Removal of solid fecal matter from the colon. Solid fecal material can cause distension of the colon and contribute to prolapse. Hard- ened fecal material interferes with motility and results in consti- pation. Decreased physical stress by removal of such material will allow the colon to maintain optimal anatomical position, func- tion, and tone. Pathogenic bacteria and parasites can be removed, thereby relieving the imbalance of putrefactive organisms that con- tribute to dysbiosis. Also, undigested foodstuffs in the colon will result in overactive fermentation, putrefaction, and rancidification of macronutrients, which encourages the growth of pathogenic bacteria and decreases the growth of healthy bacteria.51 2. The removal and dilution of toxins during colonic hydrotherapy allows for a decrease in the overall toxic load on the body through the enterohepatic recirculation. Elimination of toxic metabolites serves to prevent colon cancer and helps increase the growth of beneficial health-promoting bacteria. The removal of toxic com- pounds produced by colonic bacteria decreases the risk of colon cancer formation due to the dilution and removal of such com- pounds. 3. Cellular detoxification is augmented with colonic irrigation. Cells will readily release their waste products in a hypotonic solution of water. Cells also become oxygenated through the colon wall by dis- solved O 2 . Several forms of oxygen can be added to the water, such as ozone or H 2 O 2 . 4. The water temperature will affect the muscular function of the colon. Warm water between 98°F and 102°F will relax the muscles and decrease spasm. Cool water between 90°F and 95°F will stim- ulate the muscles to contract to improve tone. This is very help- ful with atonic constipation. Retraining the muscles of the colon will address constipation and produce normal daily formed bowel movements.

## Indications for Colon Hydrotherapy

Many systemic diseases can be relieved by the removal of toxic material from the colon. Headaches, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), arthritis, dermatitis/eczema, and neurocirculatory disorders are all aggravated by bowel toxemia.51 The symptoms of PMS are associated with high levels of unconjugated estrogen, which are hepatotoxic. Colon irriga- tion detoxifies the liver and allows for normal liver function through lavage of toxins via the enterohepatic circulation. Detoxifying the colon takes the burden of detoxifying the entire system off the liver. A liver overburdened by diseases such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, or fatty infil- tration; chronic exposure to toxins from alcohol, drugs, solvents, and heavy metals; or chronic exposure to endotoxin is unable to handle the full load, and toxins therefore spill over into the systemic circulation. When toxins enter the bloodstream, they travel to other organ systems, causing tissue damage and destruction usually in the weakest organ system first. This theory to explain disease was coined “autotoxemia” by Dr. John Henry Tilden (1851–1940) in the book Toxemia Explained, first published in 1926. When the liver is overburdened from exogenous or endogenously produced toxins, we see the skin become burdened to eliminate the toxins, and conditions such as acne, eczema, and psoriasis result. Many autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS), have an over- growth of pathogenic bacteria in susceptible individuals. Gut bacteria cross-react with genetic markers on the cells of patients with RA, MS, or AS, which can trigger the onset of symptoms. Hashimoto’s thyroid- itis, Reiter’s syndrome, and iritis have also been linked to cross-reactiv- ity with pathogenic gut bacteria.52 Colon hydrotherapy eliminates bile from the enterohepatic circula- tion. Bile removes toxins; therefore overall detoxification is supported. Bile is also acidic in nature, and its removal promotes alkalinity in the tissues, which is health promoting. Colon hydrotherapy can also increase the rate of bile synthesis and secretion by 20%. Bowel tonification through colon hydrotherapy will address chronic constipation, atonic colon, spastic colon, irritable bowel syn- drome (IBS), and neurogenic colon from plegic traumas. Colon irrigation is effective during fasting protocols, during drug and alcohol detoxification, and in preparation for a colonoscopy procedure.

constipation from diabetes. Due to the increasing levels of fluids during colon irrigation, other contraindications include hypokalemia, conges- tive heart failure (CHF), kidney disease/renal failure, active hemorrhage in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and uncontrolled hypertension (HTN). The use of colonic irrigation is avoided in acute stroke; during pregnancy or nursing; and in patients with an aneurysm, bowel perforation, severe anemia, acute abdominal hernia, or recent colorectal surgery. It is advised to take precautions when using colon hydrotherapy in the deficient, fragile, elderly, or very young patient. Patients with diver- ticulosis, fecal impaction, long-term steroid use, symptomatic painful fissures or hemorrhoids, hepatitis, and AIDS can be directed to use enemas at home for the treatment of these conditions as a safeguard against aggravation of the condition.

## Additives for Implantation

Herbal solutions are common additives for rectal use during colon hydrotherapy. Chlorophyll or wheatgrass will provide nutritive, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and soothing effects to help heal the cells of the colon. Chlorophyll provides an alkaline environment and provides electrolytes. Solutions with sodium, potassium, and magne- sium will support electrolyte balance, healthy hydration, and smooth muscle contraction (peristalsis). Retaining coffee implants for 10 to 15 minutes during colon hydrotherapy promotes bile elimination via gallbladder emptying. Organic coffee with higher amounts of caffeine and palmitic acid are used in the Gerson and the Kelley programs to address cancer and chronic disease. In addition, theophylline and theobromine (two other chemicals in coffee) dilate blood vessels and counter inflamma- tion of the gut. Palmitates enhance the enzyme system responsible for the removal of toxic free radicals from the serum, and the fluid of the colonic then stimulates the visceral nervous system to promote peristalsis and the transit of diluted toxic bile from the duodenum and out the rectum. All the blood in the body passes through the liver every 3 minutes; therefore “colon irrigation represents a form of dialysis of blood across the gut wall.”53 It has been clinically proven that the compound berberine from goldenseal and Oregon grape provides full-spectrum antibiotic benefits in the treatment of infections of the mucous membranes and parasites while also helping decrease inflammation of the gallbladder and liver. A tinctured berberine implant will have direct action on Staphylococcus spp., Streptomyces spp., Chlamydia spp., Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, Giardia lamblia, and Candida albicans. Garlic has also been proven to provide broad-spectrum antimicro- bial effects against many bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. Garlic is also effective against roundworms and hookworms. Inflammatory conditions of the colon can benefit from demul- cent herbal implants, such as slippery elm, marshmallow root, lico- rice root, comfrey, and plantain, to help heal and soothe the mucous membranes. Astringent herbal implants will help dry, tone, and constrict mucous membranes through various phytochemicals, of note for their rich tannin content. Goldenseal, yarrow, bayberry, burdock, myrrh, and yellow dock are used to alleviate various digestive disorders. Antispasmodic herbs are useful to support normal, rhythmic colon peristalsis; chamomile, catnip, and peppermint will benefit spastic constipation. Rectal oil infusions of sesame, flax, or olive oil will aid in the removal of hard, retained stool or impacted feces, as well as support dry mucous membranes resulting from many pharmaceutical medications.

## Practical Procedural Techniques

Before colon irrigation, it is important to have the patient fully empty the bladder. Then the patient is directed to lie in the lateral decubitus position, facing away from the colon irrigation equipment for specu- lum insertion. Single-use sterile specula and flexible tubing come in various sizes (adult and small child) and shapes (one or two pieces); most adult patients will require a single-piece speculum. Patients with hemorrhoids or degrees of uterine or bladder prolapse will require a two-piece speculum for comfort of insertion and to minimize tissue prolapse interference during releases. The insertion of the speculum should not hurt if it is properly lubricated with organic coconut oil or sterile lubricating jelly. A slow, steady insertion with deep, full, open-mouth breathing will help relax the internal and external anal sphincters. Once the speculum has been inserted, most patients will benefit from assistance turning on their back for the remainder of the therapy. A supported supine position will allow the therapist to assess the placement of abdominal organs/viscera and the level of congestion, bloating, or tightness of the tissues. A pillow should be behind the head to prevent any neck strain, and a bolster should be placed under the knees to relax the abdominal muscles and hip flexors. Always assess the patient’s abdomen with palpation to establish a baseline and iden- tify any areas of tenderness, gas, hardness, or fascial restrictions before beginning the water flow. The average time for a colon hydrotherapy session is 45 minutes to 1 hour from start to finish. There are several options for water flow into the patient; gravity fills are very gentle and easily tolerable because they derive pressure from the force of gravity. Water is flowing from a height above the level of the patient to allow for 1 psi of natural water pressure. Pressurized fills have an upper limit for the colon of 2 psi; this safe- guard is built into current technology and equipment. Pressured fills can benefit patients who require a more vigorous treatment or when gas or stool clogs the speculum. Most patients release best with gravity fill cycles and pressurized release cycles. The goal is to maximize the efficacy of the water to enter the colon without overwhelming the patient. Most fills will take about 1 to 3 minutes or around 3 to 4 quarts of water to stimulate releases. The client could experience abdominal pressure or resistance as the water is pushing past gas, fecal material, or flexures of the colon; deep breathing and tension relaxation will help should that occur. When the release valve is opened, abdominal massage release techniques and ner- vous system support will optimize the expulsion of fecal and waste water. Some patients may benefit from side-lying during the entire colon hydrotherapy session. Side-lying will assist the release of trapped gas and is also helpful in obese patients with tissue requiring more sup- port to allow for the speculum to stay inserted and the tubing to be unobstructed. If a patient is experiencing water leaking during the fill and release cycles, this is usually due to poor rectal tone or a degree of sigmoid prolapse; side lying and Kegels with cooler water fills will help support the seal between the speculum and rectum.

## Treatment Analysis and Expectations

Possible patient reactions during colon hydrotherapy include nau- sea, abdominal cramping, dizziness, and hot flashes or chills. These reactions are all considered normal and can be moderated by coached breathing, frequent verbal check-ins, pelvic tilting adjustment, and diaphragm or chakra releases. Autonomic system discharges can occur and present with flushing of the skin, sweating, clamminess, muscle fasciculation, or emotional releases. The use of essential oils on the soles of the feet, over the liver, on the chest, or for inhalation will assist in mitigating nervousness and supporting emotional balancing.

## 329CHAPTER 40 Hydrotherapy

The equipment observation tube allows the physician to interpret the fecal material released. Fresh, well-formed stool is normally yellow to light brown in color. Darker brown or black stool indicates pro- longed retention or excessive bile secretion. Small, round, hard balls of stool are seen in all cases of constipation. Black, tarry stool can indicate the presence of blood from the upper bowel or ingestion of iron sup- plements or bismuth. A greenish color can be seen during gallbladder flushes when the bile is flowing and being released quickly; gallstones are often seen. Pale gray stool indicates impaired bile excretion, often found with liver or gallbladder disease. Bright red blood is observed with acute hemorrhoid or colon cancer, whereas pinkish-red waste and water is seen after the consumption of beets. Mucus-coated stool indicates inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), parasitical infections or dysbiosis, stress, or food sensitivities. Greasy stools and tubing indicate improper fat digestion, whereas foam in the tube indicates excessive fermentation, such as what is seen with bacterial imbalances or overgrowth.

## Sauna

A Finnish proverb reads: “The sauna is Finland’s medication and a poor [person’s] apothecary.”54 The word sauna often indicates a bathhouse or spa in many parts of the world. Saunas have been an integral part of Finnish tradition for 2000 years, spreading throughout all of Europe and North America. Early saunas were made from natural materials such as wood, stone, clay, skins, and cloth. The heat source of these saunas was rocks that had been placed in a fire or water that was heated by fire. With the advent of modern technology came new ways of con- structing heat therapy besides a wood-burning fire. Other types of saunas include those heated by gas-burning stoves, electric light bulbs, electric heaters, smoke, steam heat, and infrared energy. Conventional saunas can be divided into two types: dry heat or steam applied to the entire body inside a wood-paneled cabinet, room, or chamber. Dry-heat saunas and steam rooms will raise the core body temperature, induce sweating, and increase the heart rate. Their effects on the respiratory tract differ; breathing steam room air provides a 100% humidity level, which soothes the mucous membranes of the upper nasal passages, throat, and sinuses and lower respiratory tree, whereas dry-heat saunas are between 10% and 20% humidity. Saunas will increase epithelial circulation from 5% to 10%, becom- ing 50% to 70% of the cardiac output, whereas blood flow to internal organs decreases.55 The increase in skin circulation promotes the healing of wounds, minimizes scar tissue, and aids the recovery of muscle tissue from trauma or exercise. The increased circulatory effect, along with the opening of epithelial cells, will provide a way for toxins to be removed from the body system. Toxins removed by saunas include solvents, pes- ticides, insecticides, heavy metals, phenols, formaldehyde, bisphenol A (BPA), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), and volatile organic com- pounds (VOCs). Naturopathic physicians should incorporate the use of saunas into any detoxification or weight-loss program. Saunas can decrease rheumatic pains and increase joint mobility in patients with arthritis, and they can provide relief in chronic pain syn- dromes such as fibromyalgia. Saunas will also relax spastic or stiff muscles. The hemodynamic effect of sauna bathing has been documented to support the lowering of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, improved cardiac ejection in congestive heart failure, and enhanced pulmonary function to alleviate asthmatic conditions. Cardiac output increases by 60% to 70% in relation to the increase in heart rate, whereas cardiac stroke volume does not change.56 Contraindications to sauna therapy include unstable angina pectoris, recent myocardial infarction (MI), and severe aortic stenosis.57 A modern technology called infrared sauna was invented in Japan in the mid-1960s. Infrared saunas raise the body temperature directly via radiant heat rather than heating an entire room. The use of far-infrared rays invigorates cells, promoting cellular metabolism and renewal. Far- infrared radiation saunas transmit a specific bandwidth of between 5 to 15 microns to human body cells via a process called cellular resonance. This absorption supports the release of waste products and fat-soluble toxins from the body’s tissues (Fig. 40.2). ↓ TC, LDL-C, triglycerides ↑ HDL-C ↓ Blood pressure↓ Inflammation (CRP) Antioxidant ↓ ROS ↓ Arterial stiffness ↑ Arterial compliance ↑ Intima media thickness ↑ Cardiorespiratory function ↑ Immune system

## Local Steam Inhalation

When water is heated and converted to steam, the vapor consists of min- ute water droplets in the air that can be inhaled to warm and relax the respiratory tract. Steam inhalation will liquefy mucus secretions, making them easier to expectorate from the sinuses and lung passages. Spasmodic cough, bronchitis, and asthma can be relieved through the relaxation of the bronchial tree and increased circulation. Steam inhalation is contrain- dicated with CHF or any severe compromise to the cardiovascular system due to the potential for breathing difficulty with steam.


This chapter provides an overview of the history of hydrotherapy and its foundational role in naturopathic medicine today. The information provided here serves to alert and inform both the physician and patient of the benefits provided by hydrotherapy, any cautions or contraindi- cations, and the supplies and equipment needed to apply it in a safe manner. Understanding the physiological effects of water and fol- lowing the general guidelines for hydrotherapy techniques allow for the stimulation of the body’s vital force and immune system to facil- itate the natural healing process. Literature demonstrating scientific, evidence-based applications of water continues to shed light on this long-standing, versatile, and powerful healing modality.

disastrous effects of manipulating tuberculous, neoplastic, rheumatic, or fractured joints. The third held that muscles were the main cause of problems, and treatment should be complete rest or active exercise, as the case warranted.11 More recently, questions of vertebral disc herniation, precipitation of cerebral vascular accidents, controversial issues of the cost-effective- ness and efficacy of manipulative treatment, and the lack of a differen- tial diagnosis by many nonallopathic manipulators have become the cause célèbre. It is interesting to note the following: • Hippocrates railed against the abuse of manipulative therapy by physicians and others of his time. • Physicians of the late 1700s assailed one another’s methods of treat- ment (e.g., in The Lancet, December 16, 1826, the banner on page 347 appropriately read, “THE YELLOW JOURNAL”). • Surgeons held “bonesetters” in great contempt “when they conde- scend[ed] to speak at all of bonesetters and their works.”10 • Bonesetters held their secrets and passed them from father to son. • Financial competition was noted early in the literature: “It is known to most practitioners of surgery, and has been made known to many to their great cost and loss, that a large portion of the cases of impaired mobility or usefulness of limbs after injury fall into the hands of a class of men called ‘bonesetters.’”13 • Although there has been a great deal of animosity, and claims of superiority made by the various practitioners of manipulative treat- ment even to this day, “specific conclusions cannot be derived from the scientific literature for or against either the efficacy of spinal manipulative therapy or the pathophysiologic foundations from which it is derived.”14

# SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT IN MANIPULATION

## Bonesetters of England

The bonesetters of England generally held that a bone was out of place and had a “feel” for what was wrong. Hutton described the informa- tion gained from a bonesetter as “bring[ing] some spoils out of the camp of the Philistines.”13

<!-- chunk -->

## Chiropractic

D.D. Palmer, the “founder” of chiropractic, rediscovered the prin- ciple of “lost nerve tone” in a revelation from a deceased friend, Dr. Atkinson, and reestablished this method of healing. D.D. Palmer and his son B.J. Palmer, the “developer” of chiropractic, added one of the most colorful pages to the history of manipulative treatment. D.D. performed the first chiropractic manipulation on a deaf jani- tor whose hearing had been lost when he stooped over and felt some- thing give in his back. D.D. reasoned that if the deafness occurred from something slipping out, restoring the vertebra to its correct position should cure the condition: “With this new objective in view, a half- hour’s talk persuaded Mr. Lillard to allow me to replace it and his hear- ing was restored.”15 Although there are multiple schools of thought in chiroprac- tic, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, the literature sup- ports the need to combine therapeutic exercise with manipulation. Rehabilitation of the Spine, A Practitioner’s Manual, 2nd ed., edited by Craig Liebenson,4 is considered a landmark publication by many in the field and addresses this topic at length.

<!-- chunk -->

## Naturopathic

Almost all naturopathic techniques result from the blending of thoughts of the other schools of medicine. This is appropriate when one realizes there is little new in manipulation, only refining and relabeling. It is also appropriate that naturopathy does not lay claim to originating a school of thought on manipulation but uses this method of treatment when indicated, not exclusively but as part of a therapeutic regimen. Several naturopathic schools in the past were associated with the chiropractic and eclectic schools of medicine. The genesis of the natu- ropathic profession is well documented in Chapters 3 and 4, History of Naturopathic Medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Osteopathic

Andrew Still left the practice of allopathic medicine and started a school of osteopathy in Kirksville, Missouri. It is highly probable that the first chiropractor, D.D. Palmer, went to this school and learned some of the techniques, but it is not well documented. The famed “equal but separate” movement of the osteopaths led to a 1921 resolu- tion, submitted at the American Osteopathic Association convention, that allowed the entrance of chiropractors with advanced standing into their schools. Andrew Still, before his death, saw the defection of his osteopathic profession into the ranks of medical orthodoxy.16–18 Interestingly, manipulation is now only an elective segment in some American osteopathic schools, whereas in England, where osteopa- thy is not part of the medical establishment, manipulation is still the mainstay of osteopathic practice. The resurgence of interest in manual medicine has been brought to the forefront by the Osteopathic College at Michigan State University. This school teaches manual medicine to physical therapists, doctors of medicine, and doctors of osteopathy. Greenman’s1 Principles of Manual Medicine adds a useful text to the field of manual medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Allopathic

James Cyriax, James Mennell, and John Mennell were brilliant physi- cians who worked to reintegrate manipulation into medical practice. They wrote valuable texts on manipulative therapy, although they did not totally agree on the effects they achieved with manipulation. Both James and John Mennell held to the correction of lost joint play and denied the effect on the intervertebral disc,19 whereas Cyriax claimed reduction of a protruding disc.8 “Controversy and contention” best describe the higher levels of the respective schools of medical thought. The impression one gets in reading through the literature is intolerance of others’ ideas expressed in ad hominem attacks. The mistake “lay” manipulators and “non- physicians” make is not ineffectiveness but their willingness to seek training outside the fraternal order of the “medical” brotherhood; to address the public directly rather than communicating exclusively within the order; and, worst of all, to openly compete, economically and politically, against the fraternal order.11,13 Donald B. Tower, in the chairman’s summary at the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke conference in 1975,20 noted a physician who received little credit for his early contribution to the field: J. Evans Riadore, a London physician who wrote a treatise on the irritation of spinal nerves in 1843. He attributed many diseases to this condition, stating: “If any organ is deficiently supplied with nervous energy of blood, its functions immediately, and sooner or later its structure, become deranged.” This was a viewpoint subsequently echoed by osteopaths and chiropractors.20 The fifth edition of Spinal Manipulation by Bourdillion et al.,21 the first authors of which were medical manipulators, has been largely reworked from previous editions and heavily influenced by osteo- pathic methods. Awareness of manual medicine has been fostered by Calliet, McNabb, Maigne, Maitland, Kaltenborn, Williams, Jirout, Lewit, Janda, Bogduk, McKenzie, and many others.

## Physical Therapy

James Cryiax influenced Robin McKenzie, a New Zealand physical therapist who subsequently developed a systematic approach called mechanical diagnosis and treatment (MDT) of musculoskeletal con- ditions. It is a process of evaluation and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders based on a mechanical history and the patient’s symptom- atic and mechanical response to movement, positions, and loading.4 McKenzie’s approach is often prejudicially dismissed as “extension exercises for the low back.” He proposed a new tack in the approach to back pain that was found to be highly effective in populations with acute and chronic back pain, as well as low in cost.22 MDT includes McKenzie’s observations that most conditions are self-resolving and that focus should be on prevention and recovery of function by teaching patients proper posture and self-management. After years of studying, performing, and researching manipulation, he felt that only 20% of patients needed manipulative therapy, and 80% could self-treat using ER loading strategies learned from books or practitioners.23

# IS MANUAL MEDICINE THE RIGHT TREATMENT?

Patients with somatic pain caused by psychosocial factors often seek a physical cause and treatment for their pain. If the presenting complaints do not seem to follow a mechanical pattern and the pain diagram is nonanatomic, consider the possibility of psycho- social factors. Psychosocial workplace factors associated with risk of spinal injury include job dissatisfaction, stressful working con- ditions as perceived by the employee, employer practices reported as being unfair, poor coping skills, lack of recognition at work, low supervisor support, a high frequency of job problems, and negative beliefs of or attitudes toward the consequences of having “low back trouble.”24,25 A major factor in identifying the incidence of future pain is the patient’s perception of being disabled.26 If the patient’s history and records include previous evaluations by multiple pro- viders with conflicting and confusing reports from the patient, cau- tion is advised in approaching the management of the patient. If in doubt, seek a consultation with an astute colleague, physiatrist, or appropriate specialist.

## Is It Safe to Move?

A clinician must answer the question, “Is it safe to ‘move the patient’ using conservative therapies, exercise, mobilizations, and manip- ulations?” Red flags have been shown to have many false positives, resulting in unnecessary additional diagnostic testing. Recent studies showed less than 1% of patients presenting to general practitioners with conditions that warranted further diagnostic evaluation. Red flags are a source of unnecessary medical interventions. When the medi- cal history and examination indicate a serious disease, neurological compromise, or progressive neurological deficit, further evaluation or consultation is warranted. Although the question of safety is usually answered by the provider’s clinical training, a general outline of triage is presented as a starting point to help determine whether further eval- uation is indicated before initiating or continuing care.27

<!-- chunk -->

## Signs of Neoplasm

The combination of age over 50 years, a history of cancer, unexplained weight loss of more than 10 kg (22 pounds) within 6 months, failure to improve after 1 month of conservative care, and an elevated erythro- cyte sedimentation rate (ESR) have a sensitivity of 100% in identifying patients with a neoplasm. Night pain, especially pain that prevents the patient from getting sleep or “drives them from the bed” also generates a high degree of suspicion.28,29

<!-- chunk -->

## Signs of Infection/Inflammation/Illness

Heat, swelling, pain, redness, and loss of function are the cardinal signs of inflammation. Acute inflammation lasts from 1 to 3 days, and chronic inflammation usually is considered from 7 days to 7 weeks but may last up to 12 months. The stages between acute and chronic inflammation overlap, and a continuum exists.30 The clinical picture may be confused by chronic pain. Laboratory tests may show signs such as an elevated C-reactive pro- tein, ESR, or other tests for inflammatory arthritides. Signs of infection may be as simple as a low-grade fever, chills, a shift to the left in the white blood cell count, signs of a worsening chronic illness, or frank presentation of an acute illness.31 Clinical signs are pain that is con- stant 24 hours a day, described as aching, throbbing, or burning and aggravated by movement, with no position that gives relief. Manipulation is contraindicated over an area of acute inflamma- tion, but acute pain may be the result of mechanical pain. This con- fusion can usually be resolved during the palpatory process. During palpation, an acutely inflamed joint will exhibit deep pain upon pres- sure and movement. This deep pain will persist long after palpation is concluded. Palpation of a manipulable joint restriction will also cause pain, but only as long as the palpation pressure is applied. Treatment of the tissues should be guided by the level of inflammation and the response of the tissue to mechanical testing, according to MDT meth- odology, to determine whether the patient should rest or pursue spe- cific therapeutic movements. Observe the posttreatment results to see if signs of inflammation worsen, indicating incorrect application or inappropriate therapy.

## Signs of Neurological Disorder or Progressive Neurological

<!-- chunk -->

## Deficit

A loss of sensation, decreased or absent deep tendon reflex, loss of muscle strength, and positive nerve root tension are signs of nerve root involvement. If only these neurological findings are present and do not become progressively worse, appropriate conservative care may be effective.32 Dizziness, drop attacks, diplopia, dysarthria, dyspha- gia, numbness, nystagmus, and nausea are more concerning signs of central nervous system involvement. Loss of bladder or bowel control or saddle anesthesia requires urgent evaluation with magnetic reso- nance imaging of the lumbar spine. If progressive neurological deficit of weakness, loss of sensation, and loss of function, or the previously mentioned signs and symptoms, are present, a consultation with a competent colleague, physiatrist, or neurosurgeon is indicated.

<!-- chunk -->

## Signs of Fracture

A fracture typically has an obvious traumatic cause when the patient is young or middle-aged. It should be noted that even in the young and middle-aged, something as simple as chronic bronchitis with severe cough can result in rib fracture; therefore diagnostic caution is always warranted. In older patients, pathological fractures are a concern, espe- cially if there is a history of prolonged or repeated steroid use. Be wary of occult fracture after motor vehicle accidents or athletic injuries and nontraumatic fractures in the elderly. The red flags suggesting verte- bral fracture are age more than 50 years, female sex, major trauma, pain and tenderness, and a distracting painful injury. In particular, look above and below the site of injury, because the force of trauma may be transmitted and cause a fracture some distance from the site of impact.33 In a pelvic fracture, there is always a fracture in two places in the ring.34

## Is the Best Treatment Movement or Rest?

Pain can be confusing and lead one to conclude that inflammation is present. If pain is constant aching, throbbing, or burning, it suggests

<!-- chunk -->

## 334SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

that the pain has a chemical cause, and it is inflammation. When the pain goes away, even for 30 minutes in a day, it suggests that the pain is due to mechanical pressure on tissue. To illustrate this point, bend your finger backward until you feel strain and hold it. At first you may only feel discomfort, but after an extended period of time, it will become painful. Next, try bending the finger backward beyond strain until it hurts. The pain you feel is due to abnormal stresses on a nor- mal tissue; there is nothing wrong with your finger! You do not need drugs, modalities, or manual therapy. Simply stop overstraining the soft tissues. Robin McKenzie used this seemingly simple example to teach the consequences of sustained ER loading as a common cause of pain—mechanical pain rather than pain from inflammation.23 If the pain is caused by inflammation, it is best to rest until the inflammation has been reduced. If the pain is mechanical, it is often best to move, but how far should one move, and in which direction?

<!-- chunk -->

## Which Direction to Move?

Common approaches to determine which direction to move the patient are orthopedic tests, selective tissue tension tests, and McKenzie’s MDT. Each can inform the practitioner of which tissues are involved and help formulate an appropriate treatment program.

<!-- chunk -->

## Orthopedic Tests

Orthopedic tests are designed to stress the damaged tissue and repro- duce the pain of the primary complaint. The examiner is not looking merely for pain to be reported as a result of the maneuver but, rather, pain that is specific for the test and reproduces the pain of the primary complaint. Therefore the following should be remembered: • The examiner can make the patient worse by forcing tests or per- forming them incorrectly. • The least stressful tests should be done first. If the first test causes severe pain, most of the other motions will be painful afterward and confuse the findings. • The test by definition has a positive response, which correlates to a specific condition that must be produced when the test is per- formed for the test to be positive (e.g., Lindner’s test and Soto Hall’s test are performed in the same way, but the findings to report a positive test are different). • The test must reproduce the pain of the primary complaint and be positive by the test’s definition. • Tests are centered in allopathic medicine to diagnose pathol- ogy, fracture, moderate to severe sprain/strain, and dislocation. Although the patient feels pain from the movements of these tests, these are not true positive tests just because the patient reports that the movement hurts. When multiple orthopedic tests are indiscriminately performed on one visit, without an understanding of the mechanism of action of the stress these maneuvers put on the tissues, the unwitting exam- iner merely subjects the patient to the trauma of a series of painful maneuvers that only serve to confuse the practitioner and aggravate the patient’s condition. Detailed texts that cover this area include those by Magee35 or Evans36; such texts are helpful and should be referred to for additional information. It is even more helpful to attend programs in which experienced practitioners teach skills and knowledge to inex- perienced practitioners.

## Selective Tissue Tension Tests

This section provides an introduction to the differential diagnosis of soft tissue injuries by means of active and passive movements using the selective tissue tension tests of James Cryiax8; this topic is covered in depth by Kessler12 and Magee.35

<!-- chunk -->

## Active movements. First, active ROMs are performed to

determine voluntary ROM and patient status. Measuring active ROMs cannot differentiate whether the loss of function is due to pain, weakness, stiffness, and/or lesion, but it is helpful to determine patient tolerance to motion and how guarded the patient is when moving.

<!-- chunk -->

## Resisted isometric tests. Next, isometric muscle tests are

performed to test the contractile tissue (muscle and tendons) with the joint in neutral to avoid involving the noncontractile tissues. The following results may be noted: • Normal—painless and full strength • Minor tear—pain with full strength • Moderate tear—pain with little strength • Neurological deficit—no pain and little strength

<!-- chunk -->

## Passive movements. When the joint is put through passive

motion, it reaches an end point, which has an “end-feel” that helps determine the status of the soft tissue around the joint. The end-feel of a joint may be one of the following: • Normal—the amount of motion and feel of the tissues are appro- priate for age. • Abnormal—normal end-feels that are not normal for the joints and ROMs that are being tested (e.g., the feeling of bone on bone is the normal end-feel at the elbow when extended but is abnormal when it occurs at the ER of knee extension). • Pathological—these end-feels are present only in joints that have undergone pathological changes.

<!-- chunk -->

## Normal end-feels

<!-- chunk -->

## Capsular end-feel. This is a firm, “leathery” feeling, felt, for

example, when the normal shoulder is at full external rotation. When felt in conjunction with a capsular pattern of restriction, and in the absence of significant inflammation or effusion, it indicates capsular fibrosis.

<!-- chunk -->

## Bony end-feel. This feels abrupt, as when moving the normal

elbow into full extension. When accompanying a restriction of movement, it may suggest hypertrophic bony changes, such as those that occur with degenerative joint disease, or possible malunion of bony segments after healing of a fracture.

<!-- chunk -->

## Soft tissue approximation end-feel. This is a soft end-feel, as

when fully flexing the normal elbow or knee. It may accompany joint restriction in the presence of significant muscular hypertrophy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Muscular end-feel. This more rubbery feel resembles what is

felt at the extremes of straight-leg raising (SLR) from tension on the hamstrings. It is less abrupt than a capsular end-feel.

<!-- chunk -->

## Abnormal end-feels. The tissue involved is determined by the

response to the passive ROMs and by moving the joint to ER and into closed pack position.

<!-- chunk -->

## Muscle or tendon. Active and passive movements are limited

or painful, or both. Pain is caused by active contraction or passive stretching of the inflamed or torn muscle–tendon unit.

<!-- chunk -->

## Ligaments. Both active and passive movements are limited or

painful, or both, in the same direction due to stretching of the inflamed or torn ligament.

<!-- chunk -->

## Capsular pattern. Only joints that are controlled by muscles

have a capsular pattern. Pain is caused by both active and passive motions, and the limitation of motion is in a specific proportion that is listed in tables in Kessler’s text.12

<!-- chunk -->

## Pathological joint end-feels. Pathological joint end-feels indicate

a disease process; they are limited and are never normal: • Empty—bursitis, space-occupying lesion, neoplasm • Boggy—joint effusion • Spasm—guarding from inflammation • Internal derangement—loose body/torn meniscus

## McKenzie’s Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy

MDT is an invaluable system for practitioners who perform manual therapy. Rather than a technique, it is a method of diagnosis deter- mined by response to repeated movement and pressure to joints and soft tissue that, once mastered, allows rapid assessment and selection of patients for treatment. It also identifies those not likely to respond to manual therapy so that the provider’s treatment program can be altered, or the patient can quickly receive an appropriate referral. Resources available are classes from the McKenzie Institute on MDT, McKenzie’s textbooks,37,38 and a chapter in Liebenson’s text.4 Only a few of the many helpful concepts from the McKenzie method are cov- ered in the following discussion. Keep in mind that McKenzie asserted that only 20% of patients needed manipulative therapy, and preven- tion is key to success in his model.

<!-- chunk -->

## Centralization and Peripheralization

A cervical spine problem can refer pain to the shoulder blade, arm, forearm, and hand. A low back problem can refer pain to the sacroiliac joint (SIJ), buttock, thigh, leg, and foot. When the referred pain from the spine is brought closer to the midline in response to movements, position, or load, and remains reduced, it is called “centralization.”22 When the pain moves out from the spine in response to movements, position, or load, it is called “peripheralization.” When a movement produces centralization, it is a motion to pursue for treatment. When a movement causes peripheralization, it is a motion to avoid because it will likely worsen the condition. If no movement or position central- izes the pain, it is a poorer prognosis for the response to the treatment method being used. Although this phenomenon is typically associated with vertebral disc problems, it can be observed in many musculoskel- etal problems.

<!-- chunk -->

## End-Range Pain and Pain During Motion

End-range pain (ERP) is felt only when the joint is moved to ER. It is a sign of deranged or adaptively shortened soft tissues around the joint complex. The importance is that this is an indication that stretching and mobilizing techniques should be used before manipulation. If the joint is not mobilized to ER repeatedly, the manipulation may cause aggravation of the complaint. When the joint is fully stretched, after a progression of forces described in the “Performing Manipulation” section, the practitioner can determine whether and in which direction the mobilization or manipulation is indicated. Pain during motion (PDM) is pain that is felt during joint move- ment, as well as at the ER. The joint ROM may be restricted as well. PDM is a sign of soft tissue derangement, often thought of as a ver- tebral disc problem. Movements or positions that increase the PDM and cause increased restriction of movement after the movement is performed should be avoided. When a mobilization or manipulation increases PDM or restriction, it is important to find a motion or posi- tion that will reduce the PDM and restore the motion as soon as possi- ble to reduce the irritation of the tissues. Application of ice, analgesic, and/or anti-inflammatory medications may be indicated as well.

# PRETREATMENT ASSESSMENT

<!-- chunk -->

## Functional Assessment

Often the focus is on injury, pathology, and disease, but the major- ity of musculoskeletal pain is from pathomechanics due to postural and repetitive strain, disuse, deconditioning, fatigue, and nutritional factors that must be addressed if treatment is to be successful. Once the portion of the patient’s condition that is a musculoskeletal prob- lem has been established, the mechanical fault should be determined. Manipulative treatment without correction of the mechanical fault results in prolonged treatment and recurrence. Detecting this is some- times easy, whereas at other times it is a mystery that takes careful investigation, as discussed by McKenzie,39 Greenman,1 Lewit,5 and Liebenson.4 Observe the posture of the patient. If he or she is tilted and antalgic to the side and/or forward, due to an episode of neck or back pain, it indicates a large space-occupying mass, which is most often the disc, but it could be other soft tissue or pathology. Proceed slowly and care- fully, avoiding any movements that cause peripheralization, increase PDM, or increase the obstruction of motion. Establish the baseline of the location of the complaint and its response to motion, and then repeat motions to ER. In the cervical spine, test flexion, extension, rotation, and lateral bending. In the lum- bar spine, test flexion, extension, and lateral translation. The testing procedures are described in detail, with photos, in Liebenson’s text.4 Note the ROM. If there are complaints at or below the shoulder blade or buttock, it is important to test reflexes, muscle strength, sensa- tion, and nerve root tension signs to assess if the nerve root is affected. Additional tests can be added as indicated.

## Cervical Spine

The cervical spine presents a diagnostic challenge (Fig. 41.1). Although the mechanism of the tests in the lumbar spine is similar, the area is much more delicate and thus requires more careful application. There is considerable discussion of the topic of vertebrobasilar stroke (VBS) after manipulation of the cervical spine. Tests done in the office have not proved effective, but the history should alert the practitioner to the possibility of VBS insult, and manipulation is

## 336SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

contraindicated. The presence of the signs listed in the section on Signs of Neurological Disorder is an important indicator that mobilization or manipulation should not be used. The most important risk factors identified by Terrett40 are dizziness, unsteadiness, giddiness, vertigo, and sudden severe pain in the side of the head or neck, which is differ- ent from any pain the patient has had before. If the practitioner elects to follow the pattern of the progression of force, the occurrence of these symptoms in the early mobilizations contraindicates progress- ing the force and manipulation. However, VBS has occurred during an examination simply by having the patient turning his or her head. The incidence is small, but missing this clinical presentation is devas- tating, although not clearly caused by the evaluation or manipulative treatment.41 If there is compression of the nerve root or cervical instability, the patient may present holding the head, lifting it cephalically to decom- press the spine and root, which is a clear indication to stabilize and transport immediately. Any such presentation is best handled by emer- gency department staff because even passive ROM assessment may cause permanent injury. If there is irritation of the brachial plexus or a nerve root, the patient may support the arm in abduction and flexion, often resting the hand on the top of his or her head. This is a sign to proceed cautiously. Any movements that cause peripheralization must be avoided, and move- ments that produce centralization should be pursued. In cases where there are no deficits and all signs and symptoms are relieved by eleva- tion of the arm, this may be the only treatment needed. If overt signs of nerve root compression are present, mobilization and manipulation must be performed with caution.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cervical Distraction

If distraction of the head from the shoulders causes aggravation of the patient’s complaints at 12 lb of traction (the average weight of the head), stabilization and relaxation techniques are indicated. If distrac- tion of the head from the shoulders causes relief of the radiating pain at 12 lb of traction, slowly increase the traction to 25 lb. If this relieves the complaint of neck pain, it is an indication that mobilization and traction are indicated therapies. If it aggravates the complaint, it is an indication of inflammation or instability and suggests caution in using mobilization or traction. Cervical compression that causes radiating pain to the arms is a sign that indicates nerve root irritation from the disc and is treated by symptom response that centralizes the arm complaint.

<!-- chunk -->

## Maximum Cervical Rotation, Lateral Bending, and

<!-- chunk -->

## Compression

If maximum cervical rotation, lateral bending, and compression cause radiating arm pain, it is a sign of nerve root compression, and only a skilled practitioner should attempt manipulation in that direction.

<!-- chunk -->

## Spurling’s Maneuver

When combined cervical rotation, lateral bending, and extension with overpressure (Spurling’s maneuver) aggravates or reproduces the complaint or causes radiating pain to the midback or arm, this indi- cates nerve root irritation, and manipulation in that direction places the patient at risk for aggravation of this condition. If the pain is local, it is a sign of facet irritation that often responds well to manipulation. The practitioner can test the response with repeat mobilization to the ER; if only ERP is produced, then increased force can judiciously be used. After determining that the lesion is not a “hard” orthopedic or neu- rological lesion, differential tissue tension tests are used to determine the involved tissue. Appropriate repeated movements to ER and skilled mobilization and/or manipulations are identified by centralization of the symptoms and improved function.

## Signs of Upper Limb Tension

Butler42 described, in detail, the identification of signs of cervical root tension using upper limb tension tests developed by Elvy in 1979. The tests are useful to help guide treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lumbar Spine and Sacroiliac Joint

During supine SLR, the lumbar nerve roots begin to develop tension at about 35 degrees. If SLR causes leg pain below 30 degrees, it is likely due to stretching of the lumbar nerve root in the presence of a space-occu- pying lesion or significant hip pathology. SLR above 35 degrees causes increasing ipsilateral nerve root tension and ipsilateral hamstring tight- ness, and it may expose lumbar dysfunction or derangement as the straight leg moves toward ER. Once the painful ER is found, one lowers the limb to the pain-free range and then performs internal rotation and dorsiflexion of the foot and great toe (Fig. 41.2). If this maneuver causes a return of the leg pain, there is likely tension on the lumbar nerve roots. Because the SLR maneuver stresses multiple tissues, the test can be mis- leading, and it can be somewhat difficult to determine what a positive finding is until the practitioner’s skills develop, but the positive result should be described to help clarify the findings.

<!-- chunk -->

## Assessing Radiating Leg Symptoms

Following the principle of “Do no harm,” one should test reflexes and sensation first, then proceed to active tests such as the Valsalva maneuver to test for increased intrathecal pressure. If radiating pain results from the Valsalva maneuver, it is a sign of a space-occupy- ing lesion. Next, the practitioner should do SLR, adding dorsiflexion of the foot with extension of the great toe to determine whether the root tension reproduces or aggravates the radiating leg symptoms. Assessment with MDT protocols is recommended and is superior to standard orthopedic protocols for functional assessment. Commonly used tests are compression tests (Milgram’s bilateral leg raising and Lindner’s test [forcefully flexing the trunk while the patient is supine]); these force the disc posteriorly (if herniated) and cause increased intraabdominal pressure, resulting in increased intrathecal pressure (Valsalva effect). Some additional ideas for finding the area of a lesion in the lumbar spine are as follows: • Support Adams (the belt test)—With the patient standing, the doctor has him or her bend forward and notes the level of pain. The doctor then secures the patient’s pelvis by hugging the anterior

## 337CHAPTER 41 Manipulation

superior iliac spines with the arms, pressing the patient’s sacrum into the doctor’s hip. If the patient’s pain is decreased, it indicates the lesion is in the pelvis (probably the SIJ or hip); if pain increases, it is in the lumbar spine. • Patrick’s test—Flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the hip are blocked; this causes pain over the inguinal fossa and into the thigh when a hip lesion is present. This is only an introduction to one common problem that may present with many variations. A careful study of the mechanism of action of the tests used can confirm, rather than confuse, a diagnostic impression.

<!-- chunk -->

## Assessing the Sacroiliac Joint

The SIJ is the “dumping ground” for pain from the lumbar spine, just as the shoulder blade is the “dumping ground” for pain from the cer- vical spine. The key to determining whether the problem is in the SIJ is to rule out all lumbar problems first. Second, Laslett43 determined that when two or more of the following SIJ tests produce concordant pain, it is highly likely that the SIJ is the pain generator: 1. Gapping test—The patient is supine. The examiner crosses his or her arms, placing the heels of the hands on the anterior superior iliac spine, forcefully pressing laterally and down into the table to “gap” the SIJ, attempting to stretch the anterior SIJ ligaments. 2. Compression test—The patient is lying on his or her side with the painful SIJ up. The pressure is directed to the opposite iliac crest, attempting to compress the anterior SIJ and stretch the posterior SIJ ligaments. 3. Posterior shear or “thigh thrust”—The patient is supine. The practitioner’s hand, a small block, or sandbag is placed under the patient’s sacrum. The hip is flexed to 90 degrees (perpendicular to the floor), the knee is maximally flexed, and a thrust is applied down the shaft of the femur. One should avoid adduction of the hip, as this will cause pain in normal patients. 4. Pelvic torsion (Gaenslen’s test)—The patient is supine at the edge of the table with one thigh extended over the edge of the table. On the other side, the hip and knee are flexed to the chest. Overpres- sure is applied to the extended thigh to accentuate the posterior rotation of the opposite side. This should be performed on both sides. 5. Sacral thrust—With the patient lying prone, the examiner thrusts down on the sacrum. 6. Cranial shear—With the patient prone, cranial pressure is applied to the apex of the sacrum with the examiner’s hands, whereas the painful side ankle is placed between the examiner’s knees and is tractioned caudally. Techniques for correction of these fixations are described by Maigne,44 Bourdillion,21 and Maitland.2

## Notes on the Art of Manipulation

Manipulation is an art. Assuming a proper differential diagnosis, one acquires a “feel” that allows recognition of the differences among the types of joint fixations and knowledge of when to manipulate. When a movement causes pain, it should not be performed unless the diagnosis of the patient’s condition is sure and the motion will cause no harm.44

## Joint Motion

Joint motion descriptions can become elaborate, or one may simply say that there are six degrees of freedom of motion (plus long-axis extension): flexion, extension, left and right rotation, and left and right lateral bending. Not all joints have all six degrees of motion. The nor- mal degrees and ROMs of joints are listed in anatomy and kinesiology texts (Fig. 41.3). If a degree of motion is lost or blocked, the type of fixation and which form of manual medicine is indicated should be determined.

## Barrier Concepts

Joint motion is described from neutral to an ER that is ultimately limited by the anatomical barrier, which, if exceeded, causes tissue trauma. The extent of the active ROM can be increased by passive motion to a point at which all of the tissues around the joint have been brought to tension, called the elastic barrier.1 Beyond the elastic barrier is a small ROM referred to as the paraphysiological space.45 It is within the paraphysiological space that joint cavita- tion, the “popping” sound, occurs. When joints and soft tissues are dysfunctional, alterations of ROM may occur both within the ROM and at the end of it. If one focuses only on working in the paraphys- iological space, one severely limits the effects that can be made on dysfunction. Before using manipulation, think about the joint end-feel (the way the joint feels at the end of its ROM) and determine which pattern is present: • Edematous and boggy end-feel—indicates joint effusion and possibly inflammation. Muscle spasms should not be treated as a primary condition because they are almost always the body’s response to a noxious stimulus or pathophysiological fault. The best treatment for muscle spasm generally is to find the origin of the noxious stimulus or pathophysiological fault, which can be joint dysfunction at a distal site, nutritional deficiency of magne- sium orP-5-P, and so forth (see Chapter 47, Soft Tissue Manipu- lation). • Springy and taut end-feel—ligamentous fixations (as felt in the normal knee in lateral bending stress tests and drawer tests). Manipulation works well on these types of fixations. Surging

sinusoidal and interferential current, ultrasound, and moist hot packs facilitate the treatment. One can follow with cryotherapy in the subacute stages. • Bone-on-bone end-feel—usually indicative of degenerative joint disease (as felt in the normal elbow in extension). If there is fine crepitus, mild degenerative joint disease (DJD) may be present; coarse crepitus indicates moderate DJD, and joint creaking may be advanced DJD. Diathermy, contrast baths, and other naturopathic therapies indicated in osteoarthritis are helpful.

## Preparation for the Manipulation

The room should be at a comfortable ambient temperature, and the physician should wear no watches or jewelry that might catch the patient’s hair or skin.

## Performing Manipulation

Manipulation of a joint is performed to correct joint fixation. Once the area to be manipulated has been appropriately assessed: 1. Test the direction of manipulative thrust with repeat mobilization to ER to ascertain that the pain does not peripheralize, the move- ment does not increase PDM, and the movement does not result in increased obstruction to motion from mobilization, using a pro- gression of force to determine the effect of the direction and force applied. This is a logical stepwise progression of the force generated first by the patient, then by the practitioner. The advantages are increased patient comfort, ability to “test the waters,” and decreased risk of harm from the procedure. The steps are as follows: Patient-generated force—the patient does all the motion actively. Patient-generated overpressure—the patient uses a strap, fulcrum, or other device to increase the movement to ER. Practitioner-generated force—the practitioner mobilizes the joint to ER repeatedly. Practitioner uses manipulative thrust if positive responses occur that include centralization, reduction of antalgic postures, increased ROM, and decreased PDM. It is a relative contrain- dication to continuing to step 4 if there is no positive response in steps 1 to 3. 2. Stabilize the area to be manipulated: A point of stabilization is created by one hand and the physician’s body weight while the other hand performs the manipulation. Minor corrections of the position of the stabilized part or hand, or both, are frequently interpreted by an observer as twisting or wrenching motions. Twisting and wrenching are difficult to control and may injure the patient. 3. Bring the joint to tension, removing the periarticular tissue slack. Mobilization with tissue slack not taken up is safe, but manipula- tion when tissue slack is present invites injury. 4. Thrust only when the patient is relaxed and the fixation is felt. The manipulative thrust can be described according to the following: • Direction of line of thrust—through the joint space, parallel to joint surfaces, or tangential to the point of fixation. • Velocity—slow for mobilizations. High velocity can correct joint fixations, and the speed must be faster than the patient’s reaction time, or a strain injury will result if the patient’s mus- cular resistance occurs at the time of the manipulative thrust. • Amplitude—governed by the quality of the health of the tissue, the quality of the fixation, and the location of the condition on the spectrum of the inflammation response. After the elastic barrier has been stretched, repeated manipulation in the same direction is complicated because the end-feel tension nor- mally felt before a manipulation is reduced or absent for at least minutes. The same phenomenon occurs when one “pops” knuckles. The risk of injury is much greater, and changing to mobilization or active muscular relaxation techniques is recommended rather than repeated manipulation.

## Reassess

The condition of the joint fixation should be reassessed after each treatment to determine whether the therapy has been successful. A single manipulation rarely corrects a problem completely. The use of a joint-scanning technique shows where the problems are that need further evaluation. The goal is to alleviate acute con- ditions or, if unsuccessful, to turn them into subacute conditions and resolve subacute and chronic conditions before they cause a chronic fatigue response, joint fixation, degeneration, or chronic myositis.

<!-- chunk -->

## Troubleshooting Technique

Common problems blocking successful manipulation can be over- come by the following: • Learning joint play analysis on the peripheral joints and practicing manipulations of those joints before attempting to manipulate the spinal joints. • Practicing the manipulative procedure with repeated light oscilla- tory movements while modifying the direction to feel the changes in joint tension, thus gaining experience, confidence, and knowl- edge without inflicting injury. • Being confident of the procedure; otherwise, the patient may sense the physician’s hesitation and guard, preventing the manipulation and increasing the risk of a poor outcome. • Feeling the fixation of the joint as it is brought to tension; other- wise, the manipulation traumatizes the tissues unnecessarily or does not gain the desired result. • Learning the arthrology of the joint to be manipulated so as not to put the joint in a “locked” or jammed position that will cause the force of the manipulation to be dispersed to the surrounding tissues and joints. Personal instruction is invaluable, but unless the rationales of joint mechanics, pathomechanics, and pathophysiology are the basis of the teacher’s approach, it can be confusing and lead to erroneous conclusions.

reported disability, and endorsement of “psychological” concepts about the nature and treatment of pain was not associated with dis- ability.3 Several studies indicate that “catastrophizing” predicts pain or is associated with lower pain tolerance.4,5 This conceptualization of painful stress suggests that intervention could be successful at sev- eral levels: cognitive patterning, physiological arousal associated with emotional stress, and control of environmental stimuli. Examples of appropriate strategies are cognitive coping skills such as restructur- ing and utilization of preparatory information and attention shifts; muscular relaxation, physical or electrical stimulation, and biofeed- back techniques; and structuring of the environment in a way con- ducive to effective coping (such as by making it nonthreatening and comfortable).6

## Neuropsychological Mechanisms of Pain

According to research on the mechanisms of pain, pain can be treated not only by anesthetic blocks, surgical intervention, and the like but also by influencing the motivational-affective and cogni- tive factors.7 The traditional specificity theory of pain, first enun- ciated by Descartes in the 17th century, holds that pain messages are conducted from specific pain receptors at the periphery through discrete pathways to pain centers in the brain. However, there are individual differences in pain responses, pain is not consistently stopped by cutting or blocking of the “pain pathway,” and it is now known that nonpainful types of stimulation activate the A-delta and C fibers (see next paragraph) that are associated with pain. Therefore later modifications of pain theory took into account the patterning of nerve impulses over time to reflect differences in the degree and intensity of stimuli and the summation of signals from an extended area.8 One model of pain is the gate-control theory, which Melzack and Wall9 formulated in 1965. Based on neurological data and a categorization of the words used to describe pain, this theory con- ceptualizes the pain experience as having sensory-discriminative, motivational-affective, and cognitive-evaluative components or modalities, corresponding to different patterns of nerve impulses. Neurologically, a specialized cluster of nerve cells in the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal column is thought to operate like a valve or gate, controlling nerve signals before they evoke the perception of, and response to, pain. Besides this monitoring of sensory data in the central nervous system, gating is also influenced by the relative amount of activity in large-diameter (A-beta) and small-diameter (A-delta and C) nerve fibers. The large fibers tend to inhibit trans- mission, or close the gate, preventing pain, and the small fibers tend to facilitate transmission, or open the gate, resulting in pain. The fact that large fibers are activated by pressure, touch, massage, and vibration suggests a mechanism for such pain control techniques as acupressure, acupuncture, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Such stimulation apparently closes the spi- nal gate via the large-fiber system. Melzack and Casey7 expanded this theory by proposing the possibility of a higher-level gate, in the reticular or limbic structures of the brain, that probably medi- ates the drive to escape from unpleasant stimuli. At central nervous system (CNS) levels, the biochemical mechanisms of gate control may involve the endorphins, natural morphinelike substances that have been implicated in the pain-controlling effects produced by acupuncture.10 Although the pain circuit generally is considered to include the thal- amus, the somatosensory cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortex, recent imaging studies have focused on supraspinal CNS areas associated with the experience of pain: the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, sensory cortex, and insula. The prefrontal cortex (often considered the “executive brain”) is thought to encode cognitive aspects of acute and chronic pain, including coping ability and a general inhibitory effect on the severity of pain. The anterior cingulate cortex, part of the limbic system, relates to the affective/emotional or fear and suffering com- ponent of pain. The insula can be considered the sensory component of the limbic system. Imaging studies have recently found that differ- ent chronic pain conditions appear to involve pain condition–specific patterns of cortical activity. For example, postherpetic neuralgia and osteoarthritis of the knee appear to be represented primarily in the insula, whereas back pain appears to be associated with activity in the prefrontal cortex. Peripheral structures of the nervous system play a role mostly in long-term effects or in chronic pain. Nociceptive input from the periphery can sensitize cortical areas involved in processing, for example, in conditions such as fibromyalgia or chronic low back pain. In such chronic conditions, decreased gray matter in the pre- frontal cortex may be associated with a decreased ability to inhibit the experience of pain.11 Neuroimaging studies have also shown the right ACC to be acti- vated with unilateral pain. Pain memory, a learned pattern of brain activity, is involved in the central sensitization model of chronic pain, known as “kindling”: repeated exposure to painful stimuli leads to increased sensitivity to later noxious stimuli.12 The implication of these observations of the brain areas and pro- cesses involved in the perception and processing of pain is that a “top- down” psychological process of cognition operated by the neocortex can inhibit lower brain functions (such as emotions) of the subcortical limbic system, as in cognitive learning strategies and techniques such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).12

## Toxins that Increase Pain Sensitivity

Contemporary Western diets contain acid precursors more than base precursors, yielding a daily systemic net acid load of varying amounts. For example, when salt (NaCl) is added to the diet, it becomes a con- diment, not a requirement, and when consumed acutely in large quan- tities, NaCl can be noxious. High protein intake and phosphate-rich soft drinks also contribute to an increased load of dietary acid. A blood pH constantly at the lower end of the normal range has been termed latent acidosis. It has been suggested that latent chronic acidosis might contribute to an increase in pain symptoms resulting from swelling of connective tissue because eof changed acid–base homeostasis.13 Inorganic arsenic exposure exacerbates the degree of inflammatory pain (i.e., enhances pain perception) and could worsen the patho- logical state of painful inflammatory diseases.14 Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), also known as endotoxins, from the cell walls of gram- negative bacteria have been shown to increase sensitivity to visceral and somatic pain and increase musculoskeletal pain sensitivity correlating with both changes in IL-6 and negative mood.15

## Pain in Childbirth

A psychological/social learning approach to pain emphasizes control of motivation, expectation, focus of attention, and stress and feelings of anxiety, depression, and helplessness. Factors specifically opera- tive in labor pain involve these in addition to social support and the physiological factors of hunger, rest, and muscular tension.16 All of these factors can contribute to the interpretation of pain being placed on the nociceptive message provided by uterine contractions. The influence of motivation on labor pain was effectively demonstrated in a prospective study of maternal attitudes toward pregnancy in American women. One of the factors found to be strongly related to maternal attitude toward having a baby was the need for analgesics in labor.17

## 341CHAPTER 42 Nonpharmacological Control of Pain

Cultural conditioning may also be fundamental to the labeling of childbirth as painful. Throughout most of the world, analgesics are not required for labor; in fact, a Japanese anesthesiologist suggests that the idea of “painless delivery” is a strange one to his culture.18 American women, on the other hand, “live through a largely self-fulfilling proph- ecy of birth as a painful, terrifying ordeal, and/or as a medical, drugged process over which they have no control.”16 This idea relates to body fantasies of injury, brought about in a hospital environment where dis- tress is an expected response to the expulsive reflex.2

## Psychological Strategies

The psychological strategies recommended for control of labor pain, many of them part of prepared childbirth programs, generally aim to provide control, communication, relaxation, attention focus, and sup- port in addition to physical counterstimuli. Considerable psychologi- cal research supports the use of these strategies in the development of pain tolerance. The significance of various characteristics of an individual’s psy- chological profile has been studied by evaluating the effects on pain perception of such parameters as the following: • Introversion–extroversion19–21 • Augmenters–reducers22 • Field dependence23,24 • Repression–sensitization25–27 For example, on the repression–sensitization axis, repressors may be characterized as people who avoid having to cope with pain. Sensitizers, however, have an obsessive need to cope; they like to be informed in advance about the situation and to have control over it. The superior initial tolerance exhibited by repressors in response to heat and pressure stimuli disappears in repeated trials, showing that the sensitizers’ predilection for challenge enables them to endure long- term pain better. The importance of individual difference variables is also illustrated by the observation that one third of patients undergoing surgical oper- ations do not request pain-killing medication.28 This common ability to suppress pain indicates that not all surgical patients consider them- selves passive victims. In fact, during the postoperative period, pain persists longer for those who accept medication.

## Cognitive Strategies

The impetus for devising cognitive strategies to promote tolerance of pain has been particularly supported by investigations showing that pain tolerance increases with greater predictability and perception of control.29–33 Similarly, preparatory communications and informa- tion received before the onset of experimental or surgical pain con- sistently decrease the subjects’ perception of pain.34–36 Animal studies have demonstrated higher rates of instrumental responses when pain- ful shocks are signaled than when they are unsignaled.37 Kanfer and Seidner38 found that subjects who could advance slides of travel pic- tures at their own rate tolerated iced-water immersion of the hand lon- ger than yoked subjects whose slides were changed by the experimenter. When surgical patients were given a sense of control by being provided with preparatory information about postoperative discom- forts and operative care, in combination with training in rehearsal of realistic, positive aspects of the surgical experience, they showed a significant reduction in postoperative anxiety (as indicated by nurses’ observations), requests for sedatives, and length of hospital stay.39 Furthermore, preparation for second periodontal procedures by auditory and visual messages classified as “control enhancement” was associated with a reduction of pain after a second operation.40 Subjects who could cognitively redefine a threat of electric shocks as interest- ing new physiological sensations also reduced stress to a greater extent than subjects not provided with this coping strategy.41 A typical cognitive behavioral procedure utilizes “stress inocu- lation,” beginning with an educational phase (in which the client is given a conceptual framework for understanding the nature of his or her stressful reactions), followed by rehearsal of behavioral and cog- nitive coping skills, based on a set of coping self-statements generated by the client in collaboration with the therapist. Such cognitive- behavioral techniques, sometimes in combination with electromyog- raphy (EMG) biofeedback control, have been found successful in the treatment of chronic low back pain.42–44 Also, cognitive- behavioral strategies have been effective in alleviating the pain of irritable bowel syndrome,45 temporomandibular joint syndrome,46,47 cancer,48 migraine headaches,49 rheumatic conditions,50–52 fibromyalgia,53 and complex regional pain syndrome.54 Low back pain has been effectively controlled utilizing cognitive-behavioral or social learning strategies addressing fear-avoidance beliefs55 or catastrophizing,56b whereas voxel-based morphometry (VBM) has revealed structural changes in regions of the brain with higher levels of pain intensity and negative cognitions in cases of low back pain.57 Older adults given pain-coping skills training (PCST) were able to control the pain of osteoarthritis of the knee.58 This emphasis on conceptualization, preparatory information, and cognitive transformation seems to have been incorporated into the Read method of natural childbirth, which replaces fear with knowledge about birth.17 Sheila Kitzinger,2 in her method of prepared childbirth, similarly emphasizes the necessity of “acquiring knowledge and under- standing of what labor involves, the terminology used by obstetricians and midwives, and information about what happens in hospitals.” A study by Stevens and Heide59 conducted at the University of Wisconsin used iced water to test perception and endurance of pain in subjects who had been taught methods used in childbirth educa- tion classes. The control subjects for this training and an additional control group were offered only distraction during the tests. Those who had been taught the techniques reported only about half the pain of that reported by control subjects and endured it 2.5 times longer. The prepared childbirth strategies improved with practice, were effec- tive for pain lasting longer than most contractions in labor, and were more effective than distraction techniques.59 However, this last finding introduces some confusion because some prepared childbirth methods include either distraction techniques or some other deliberate disposi- tion of one’s attention.

## Attention Focusing

Distraction or focused attention, mostly utilizing the rhythms of the breath, is essential to the Lamaze method, the most popular prepared childbirth program in America, and is important in the Bradley and other methods. Sheila Kitzinger2 describes the controlled attention focusing as: concentration on what is happening, one’s response to it as a task, and visualization of what is being achieved by the work of the uterus during contractions. The focus may be on the fantasy of the contractions as a shape provided by actual objects (furniture, architectural details, flowers, a painting) in the room, or a combi- nation of these factors. Stevens and Heide59 found that attention focusing functions effec- tively as analgesia for labor pain. Such strategies are strongly supported by much psychological research.

illnesses who were taught distraction techniques were able to reduce measures of distress before and during medical procedures such as intramuscular and intravenous injections.60 In a study of patients with burn pain, sensory focusing techniques were more successful than dis- traction techniques in controlling pain, and both were more success- ful than standard care.61 The focus may be on a competing response, as in a study by Kanfer and Goldfoot62 showing that when attention was directed to self-presented external slides, individuals were able to increase their tolerance of the pain of cold water. Focus on a com- peting response is also shown in the use of hypnosis as an analgesic and in the meditative states of Raj yogis, who pinpoint attention on the tip of the nose or a point on the back of the skull and then do not react physiologically to cold water, bright lights, or sudden sounds.63,64 Other adepts in unusual feats of pain tolerance, such as having spikes stuck through the skin, either maintain an unfocused attitude, without evaluation, or pinpoint attention totally on the pain but without eval- uation.65 In such cases the attitude of detachment from the pain can be reflected by an undisturbed electroencephalography (EEG) pattern of alpha or beta waves throughout the performance of the feat.

## Internet-Based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy

Numerous recent studies have supported the effective use of the Internet and smartphones to implement cognitive learning strategies for pain management. Based on a meta-analytic review of 23 random- ized controlled trials of guided Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT), improvement was shown in general psychological outcomes, disease-related physical outcomes, and disease-related effect on daily life.66 Specifically, chronic pain has been reduced through smartphone and Internet applications employing online journals that facilitate improved communication between patient and clinician. Feedback and coaching were provided to patients via Twitter post- ings and blogs, and online resources and blogs provided patient edu- cation.67 In a randomized controlled trial, an 8-week Internet-based exercise program significantly improved pain and global health status for 81 breast cancer survivors.68 A guided Internet-delivered self-help cognitive-behavioral therapy program was successful in treating adolescents with chronic pain.69 A smartphone-based intervention with diaries and personalized therapist feedback based on CBT prin- ciples, in addition to access to a website for self-management, reduced pain scores for 140 women with widespread chronic pain.70 Internet- based telemonitoring of fibromyalgia patients in a 24-week multicom- ponent intervention influenced key health outcomes.71

## Virtual Reality for Pain Management

A review of six studies showed that the distraction provided by the virtual reality (VR) technique reduced acute and chronic pain in adults and children in conditions such as headaches or fibromyalgia, sometimes combining VR with modalities such as biofeedback and cognitive-behavioral therapy. At the same time, VR actually seemed to produce neurophysiological changes.72 Pain was reduced signifi- cantly for 50 medical inpatients viewing a three-dimensional (3D) VR experience using the Samsung Gear Oculus VR headset.73 Thirty patients with various chronic pain conditions utilized a 5-minute head-mounted VR display to reduce their pain rating on a visual ana- log scale by 33%.74 Twelve patients with chronic intractable phantom limb pain using machine learning, augmented reality, and VR showed statistically and clinically significant improvement in all metrics of their phantom limb pain.75

## Relaxation Training

Relaxation training, another essential method of pain control, is found in all childbirth training programs. A considerable body of literature supports its importance in pain control because a state of lowered autonomic arousal is incompatible with anxiety. Although progres- sive muscular relaxation, systematic desensitization, and autogenic training are all well-established physiological approaches to muscular relaxation, meditation traditions provide quicker methods to achieve what Benson76 has called the “relaxation response.” One of the sim- plest meditation practices—maintaining a focal awareness of the flow of breath—is taught by Rahima Baldwin11 in Special Delivery and is identical to the ancient practice of vipassana, or insight meditation.

## Hypnosis

Hypnosis or autohypnosis is another method used to induce deep relaxation for pain control. It incorporates many of the therapeutic elements already referred to—focused attention, positive expectation, and a supportive or permissive attitude—in making suggestions that alleviate anxiety. Thus its success in pain management may be viewed from a cognitive-behavioral perspective.77 In one technique, “glove anesthesia” is induced in one hand, and the “numb, heavy wooden feeling” so produced is transferred to the other hand, the face, and eventually to the abdomen to “relieve the discomfort” of uterine con- tractions (the word pain is never used because its use would be coun- tersuggestive).78 Pain modulation in “highly hypnotizable” subjects has been confirmed through brain measurement of somatosensory event–related potentials (SERPs) to noxious stimuli, with the highest amplitudes for these subjects recorded at frontal and temporal scalp sites.79

## Control of Environmental Stress

Kitzinger2 cites animal research to show how environmental stress can interfere with the physiological processes of labor and delivery. Education for childbirth therefore promotes verbal and nonverbal support from the husband, obstetrician, midwife, or anyone else who is part of the birthing environment. Touch relaxation and coaching techniques combine the essential elements of relaxation, massage counterstimulus, and the direct supportive communication of a part- ner.11 Several studies agree that comfort in labor is also enhanced by a more vertical position, such as the squatting posture that is adopted in many other cultures.80–82

The hand reflexology method of grasping combs during labor to acti- vate points on the fingertips and balls of the hand that relate to uterine functioning is one example of counterstimulus strategy.11 Foot reflex- ology, acupressure, acupuncture, and TENS might also share a com- mon autonomic nervous mode of operation.

## Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation

The use of TENS to control pain during delivery has been evaluated by several studies. The method used in a Swedish study,83 which was sub- sequently replicated in Germany and Britain, was originally developed in the United States by Shealy and Maurer84 for the control of acute and chronic pain. In a controlled study of experimentally induced cold-pressor pain, the effect of electrical stimulation with TENS elec- trodes at two traditional acupoints in 20 subjects had an analgesic effect with statistical significance comparable to that of morphine, and the combined effect of TENS with morphine was stronger than TENS alone.85 A series of controlled randomized double-blind studies on carpal tunnel syndrome pain found that the combination of low- level laser and microcurrent TENS on distant and local points signifi- cantly decreased McGill Pain Questionnaire score, sensory and motor latencies, and Phalen and Tinel signs compared with sham treatment.86

## 343CHAPTER 42 Nonpharmacological Control of Pain

A British study investigating the relative hypoalgesic effects of differ- ent TENS parameters upon experimentally induced mechanical pain found that low-frequency, high-intensity, extrasegmental stimula- tion (i.e., over an acupuncture point rather than over a nerve distri- bution) produced a rapid-onset hypoalgesic effect, which increased during the stimulation period and was sustained for 30 minutes after stimulation.87 In TENS, the electrodes are generally placed over the painful area to stimulate the cutaneous nerves in that area. For use in labor, four elec- trodes are placed on either side of the midline of the spine to stimulate the posterior primary rami of the spinal segments (T11–L1 and S2–S4) receiving the painful stimuli during labor. It is interesting to note that these are the loci of acupuncture points (BL-20, BL-27, and BL-28) that are traditionally thought to reflect female reproductive function. The selection of this area for stimulation is based on Bonica’s account of the neurological mechanism of delivery pain.88 During the first stage, pain receptors are assumed to be activated by contractions of the uterus and dilation of the cervix. The evoked impulses are medi- ated in afferents that run in the hypogastric nerves and reach the spinal cord via the dorsal roots T10 to L1. The pain is referred to large areas of the abdomen and back. During the second stage, pain is also caused by distention and stretching of the delivery canal, the pelvic floor, the vulva, and the perineum. The pain is localized, and the impulses reach the spinal cord mainly via the pudendal nerves and the dorsal roots S2 to S4. The pain during the first stage is characterized as an ache, con- sidered to be mediated in small-diameter C fibers. During the second stage, the pain has the more localized intensive nature usually identi- fied with the delta afferent fibers.88,89 In the typical application of this technique for control of pain during labor, low-intensity stimulation is given continuously, and a high-intensity stimulation can be initiated by the parturient herself whenever pain increases. Stimulation via the thoracic electrodes is maintained throughout the delivery at an amplitude that is maximal for a pleasant sensation, whereas sacral stimulation is added from the later part of the first stage. Table 42.1 summarizes the uniformly good results that have been reported. Those patients who complained of backache have especially appre- ciated it. An Austrian study compared the analgesic effects of TENS, pethidine, and placebos on labor pain in 30 parturient women during the first stage of labor. No significant difference was found between the placebo, unspecific TENS, and control groups in the increase in pain during the test period. Patients who had received pethidine and those who had been given TENS experienced considerable relief of pain.90 It is curious that apart from a passing reference by Shealy and Maurer84 to its use in labor, no research on the obstetrical application of TENS appeared for many years in any of the U.S. literature. A 1996 review of 30 studies on TENS stimulation of acupuncture points in labor sub- stantiated the conclusions of earlier research.91 In view of the relatively good results and lack of complications, the consensus of all the preceding studies is that the TENS method is recommended as a primary pain-relieving measure, to which con- ventional methods can be added as needed. Robson92 comments that TENS is noninvasive and is believed to be safe for both mother and baby. It is easy to apply and can be operated throughout labor by the doctor, midwife, father, or mother. Augustinsson et al.83 were most impressed by the lack of complications because the conventional methods, including analgesic and sedative drugs, nitrous oxide inhala- tion, epidural anesthesia, and local blockades, all possess a varying level of potential risk.83 Another advantage is that TENS, because it does not give complete analgesia, does not eliminate pain as a diagnostic tool; it can be interrupted whenever needed for clinical evaluation. More important, perhaps, from the point of view of the woman in labor is the fact that her consciousness is not altered to the point of excluding her own active participation in, and experience of, the delivery. Both Stewart93 and Augustinsson et al.83 reported TENS alone to be inadequate for analgesia in the second stage of labor. The second group of researchers regards this difference as possible support for the assumption that C fiber–mediated pain is more amenable to block- ing by electrical stimulation than A fiber–mediated pain. Stewart93 mentions simply that many women did not wish to use the stimulator at that stage because it proved a distraction from their efforts to bear down. In this connection, it is interesting to note that “those who were well prepared and keen on natural childbirth were not always the most enthusiastic and, in fact, two of the early failures were patients who had been to relaxation classes.”93 Robson92 explains that TENS could distract some patients from their breathing or other focus of attention learned in childbirth preparation classes. A related issue in the TENS literature is introduced by the comment of Andersson et al.94 that there was a correlation between the level of hypnotizability and that of pain relief in their subjects. Such a correla- tion may, of course, imply only susceptibility to any type of therapeutic effect. Neumark et al.90 tested this effect by including a placebo group that was given no current through the electrodes; these researchers found that the result for the placebo group was not different from that of TENS applied nonspecifically (i.e., incorrectly) but was significantly different from the effect of TENS placed over the relevant nerve dis- tribution and from that of pethidine. Robson,92 although making no attempt to assess a patient’s level of susceptibility to hypnosis, switched off the TENS machine for at least two contractions. All patients asked for it to be switched on again, indicating that the technique was pro- viding pain relief. Augustinsson et al.83 consider the suggestive effect, if it occurs, to be of minor significance because several investigators have found the pain-reducing effect of TENS to be achieved through demonstrable neurophysiologic mechanisms. Stewart93 points out that the greater personal contact between patient and attendant essential to the use of this method may introduce an element of suggestibility or distraction that affects the pain experience.

## Acupuncture

Thousands of studies have investigated the efficacy and mechanisms of acupuncture analgesia for acute and chronic pain, in surgical oper- ations, and in childbirth. In a review article of 24 studies, Lewith and Machin95 found that the typical clinical trial showed a 70% efficacy of acupuncture compared with placebo treatment. Reichmanis and Becker96 found similar results in a review of 17 studies of acupunc- ture analgesia in experimentally induced pain. A systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that acupuncture relieved pain within 30 minutes of treatment, compared with sham acupuncture and

analgesic injection.97 In a randomized controlled trial, electroacu- puncture administered together with general anesthesia for 64 patients receiving surgical operations in a Malaysian hospital significantly reduced pain ratings and total morphine requirements.98 On the basis of a thorough review of the clinical and experimental research on acu- puncture pain control, Stux and Pomerantz99 concluded that acupunc- ture analgesia helps from 55% to 85% of patients with chronic pain, comparing favorably with the effects of potent pain medication (such as morphine, which is 70% effective), and clearly distinct from the pla- cebo effect, which helps 30% to 35%.99 At the same time, somatosen- sory EEG–evoked potential studies have provided objective evidence of the analgesic effect of acupuncture.100–102 Recent randomized and double-blinded controlled studies have demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture in treating chronic lateral epcondylitis103 and chronic neck pain.104 In the neck pain study, stimulation at distant points of the neck-related meridians were more effective than sham acupuncture points and “dry-needle” injections of local myofascial trigger points, reducing motion-related pain by one third after a single treatment. A single-blind random- ized controlled trial showed that electroacupuncture (EA) is supe- rior to manual acupuncture in treating patients with tennis elbow.105 A review article on the treatment of fibromyalgia pain for patients at a hospital in Brazil showed improvement with traditional acupunc- ture, measured on subjective scales and number of tender points.106 Preoperative EA has led to a reduction in the intraoperative and post- operative requirement for analgesic medications (alfentanil and mor- phine) in patients receiving gynecological lower abdomen surgery.107 In fact, surgery that requires general anesthesia in Western countries is routinely performed in Chinese hospitals with the combination of acupuncture and local anesthesia for pain control, providing a con- siderable decrease in risk for surgical patients. When acupuncture was combined with Western (pharmacological) medicine in the treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), the combined treatment approach was more effective on measures of pain and other symptoms than either acupuncture or Western medicine alone.108 A randomized trial treating 50 cases of osteoarthritis of the knee, using warm-needling moxibustion, another traditional method of stimulating acupuncture points, was found to significantly relieve pain, improve function and muscle balance, and strengthen extensor and flexor muscle power.109 Hyodo and Gega18 of the Osaka Medical College have reviewed the literature (summarized in Table 42.2) on acupuncture anesthesia and analgesia in normal delivery and found mixed results. For example, Wallis et al.110 reported that although 19 of their 21 volunteer partu- rients considered acupuncture unsuccessful in providing analgesia for labor, one third indicated that they would choose acupuncture anal- gesia in labor again. Some researchers criticize the technique as being inconsistent, unpredictable, incomplete, and time-consuming and interfering with movement and electronic monitoring. In their own study, Hyodo and Gega18 tested 32 patients, equally divided between primiparas and multiparas. Low-frequency electrical current was introduced through needles at LI-4, ST-36, and SP-6, a standard therapeutic repertory for sedation of the reproductive organs. The results were assessed in terms of relief noted by the patient (sub- jective scale) and through the obstetrician’s observation (objective scale); among the primiparas, 62.5% found good or excellent effect on the subjective scale, and 62.6% found good or excellent effect on the objective scale; among the multiparas, 93.8% had subjective relief, and 93.7% had objective relief. Overall, 90% of the patients experienced relief of pain within 20 minutes of initiation of acupuncture anesthe- sia. These researchers noted the considerable disparity in reports of the effectiveness of acupuncture from Japan and the United States, explaining it as a novelty effect. It is natural that in Japan, where no analgesic methods are normally used, the scoring in favor of acupunc- ture would be high compared with that in the United States. Hyodo and Gega18 concluded that acupuncture analgesia is useful for delivery, especially because of its safety, even though its results are more erratic and less potent than those of conventional anesthetic techniques. More recently, a randomized controlled trial investigating acupuncture treatment as a complement or an alternative to conventional analgesia for labor in a Swedish hospital found that acupuncture significantly reduced the need for epidural analgesia, and parturients receiving acu- puncture achieved a better extent of relaxation than the control group.111 A considerable amount of research has focused on determining a mechanism for acupuncture analgesia. A 1995 review of studies on acupuncture effects in pain and disease pointed out that, like exer- cise, acupuncture produces rhythmic discharges in nerve fibers and causes the release of endogenous opioids and oxytocin. Furthermore, “experimental and clinical evidence suggests that acupuncture may affect the sympathetic system via mechanisms of the hypothalamic and brain-stem levels.”112 Animal studies continue to demonstrate that acu- puncture analgesia is mediated in the central and peripheral nervous systems by opioid peptides.113–115 The cortex and hippocampus appear to participate in the modulation of chronic pain, and the analgesic action of EA seems to operate along this pathway.114 A study carried out on dogs seems to verify the traditional theory of points of tonifi- cation and sedation, through differential production of sympathomi- metic and parasympathomimetic effects on the cardiovascular system upon stimulation of different points. Carlsson,116 a Swedish researcher, concludes that a mechanism for therapeutic acupuncture must include peripheral events that release neuropeptides; spinal mechanisms such as gate control; and supraspinal mechanisms through the descending pain inhibitory system, the sympathetic nervous system, and the hypotha- lamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. He cautions that much of animal and human experimental acupuncture research shows only short-term hypoalgesia, that almost all such experimental research has been per- formed with EA rather than the more gentle manual style of therapeutic acupuncture, and that pain threshold elevation in human experimental research does not necessarily predict the clinical outcome. In a study of labor induction and inhibition by EA, Tsuei et al.117 utilized SP-6 and SP-4 points, which are located in the territory of the L4 dermatome. The spleen meridian, to which these loci belong, runs across the dermatomes of L4, L5, L2, and L1, then upward from T12 to T5. Because the sympathetic nerve controlling the uterus through the pelvic plexus receives preganglionic fibers from T5 to L4, Tsuei et al.117 concluded that it is highly possible that stimulation of the elec- tropermeable loci within this area may alter the physiological function of the uterus. The LI-4 points of the upper extremities, often added to the spleen meridian points in the acupunctural control of labor pain,

perhaps represent the central approach to the autonomic nervous system because these loci control pain to the head and neck. It should be noted, however, that Motoyama,118 who has attempted to verify the traditional subtle anatomy of meridian pathways through tests of electrocutaneous resistance at meridian points, claims that these effects cannot be ade- quately explained in terms of the conventional sympathetic dermatomes but instead imply an alternative bioelectric transmission system. The discovery of the Head McKenzie sensory zones has shown the possible mediation of the invisible meridians and points of traditional Eastern medicine between internal organs and corresponding skin areas. Nakatani119 was able to detect the electropermeable line as an apparent viscerocutaneous autonomic nerve reflex when organic diseases were involved. Hyodo120 has explained acupuncture stimulation as the trans- mission of impulses centrally from the reactive electropermeable loci, via a sympathetic afferent fiber, and noted that the autonomic nerve in the viscera is stimulated to response by the reverse of the McKenzie theory. An exciting recent development in acupuncture research has been the finding by functional neuroimagery of neuronal correlates of acupuncture stimulation in the human brain. In a controlled study of EA stimulation of GB-34 on the left leg, real EA elicited significantly higher activation over the hypothalamus and primary somatosensory motor cortex than mock and minimal EA, showing that the hypotha- lamic–limbic system was significantly modulated by EA at acupoints.121

## Other Methods

The scope of this chapter does not permit a detailed discussion of other promising methods of pain control, but mention can be made of mas- sage, biofeedback, and nutritional and botanical agents for the treat- ment of pain. A literature search led to the conclusion that massage, particularly acupressure, is effective for low back pain, especially when it is combined with exercises and education, with beneficial effects last- ing at least 1 year after the end of treatment.122 A vast literature is avail- able on biofeedback training for pain. A meta-analysis of 21 controlled studies of biofeedback for chronic low back pain found improvements in pain intensity and other associated measures, both short term and long term.123 BrightHearts is a biofeedback-assisted relaxation device for children, an iPad app paired with a wireless heart monitor. The application displays a digital geometrical design that responds to changes in heart rate. By slowing the heart rate, children could be taught to achieve relaxation and manage procedural pain and anxi- ety.124 Another article suggesting a future direction in pain medicine describes the use of “off-the-shelf,” low-cost, and low-bandwidth tele- medicine equipment to deliver clinical biofeedback treatment when the patient and provider are in two different locations.125 In a randomized double-blind trial of 30 patients with chronic maxillofacial pain, a sig- nificant reduction in pain scores and an improvement in the tolerance of experimentally induced dental pain were achieved with administra- tion of 3 g daily of the amino acid tryptophan and a high-carbohy- drate, low-fat, low-protein diet in comparison with placebo.126 Among botanical agents for pain, corydalis rhizome or tuber (yanhusuo) is well known in the Chinese materia medica for its analgesic effect, con- taining combined alkaloids found to be 40% as effective as morphine. Acting probably through inhibition of the reticular activating system, corydaline was shown in one clinical study to decrease or relieve pain in 32 of 44 patients with dysmenorrhea.127 Casperome, an extract of Boswellia serrata, was found effective in pain reduction in several ran- domized clinical studies of common inflammatory conditions, and the plasma levels of inflammatory markers were also reduced.128 Based on an extensive literature review, specific traditional medicinal plants and isolated compounds originating from India have been reported as effective for the management of neuropathic pain.129 Statistically significant improvement in pain resistance and suppression of edema were found in animals treated with UP 1306, a standardized blend of extracts from Acacia catechu and Morus alba, which was determined through assays to operate as a COX-2 inhibitor, comparable to a 200- mg/kg dose of ibuprofen.130 A current controversy revolves around the issue of whether there is objective evidence to support the widespread anecdotal testimonials for the success of cannabis products in controlling pain. An overview of systematic reviews on the efficacy of cannabis-based medicines in neuropathic pain and painful spasms in multiple sclerosis, in addition to the pain of rheumatic diseases and cancer, concluded inconsistent findings.131 At the same time, another report found inhaled (smoked or vaporized) cannabis consistently effective in reducing noncancer pain, whereas oral cannabinoids seemed to improve the chronic pain of cancer but not acute postoperative pain, chronic abdominal pain, or rheumatoid pain.132 Yet another study found limited evidence for the benefit of THC/CBD spray in the treatment of neuropathic pain and inadequate evidence for any benefit in the treatment of cancer or rheumatoid pain.133


This chapter has presented many of the current nonpharmacological strategies for the control of pain. Because the mechanism of pain per- ception has been shown to involve both physiological and psycholog- ical components, the optimal treatment might combine psychological factors, such as preparatory information, attention focus, relaxation, and supportive communication, with the physical stimuli of TENS or acupuncture. In fact, such a multidisciplinary approach to patients with chronic back pain was evaluated after a 4-week program that included back schooling, psychological intervention, and treatment by acupuncture, chiropractic, the Alexander technique, and a pain specialist. Significant improvement was maintained for a period of months.134 Dental researchers of the Pediatric Pain Program of the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine searched several data- bases for reports of randomized controlled clinical trials of comple- mentary and alternative medical modalities used to treat chronic facial pain. Three acupuncture trials, eight biofeedback trials, and three relaxation trials met the researchers’ inclusion criteria, suggesting that these modalities were comparable to conventional treatment such as an intraoral appliance.135 Increasingly, the multidisciplinary pain management team, incor- porating a variety of nonpharmacological treatment modalities, is being considered “the optimal method for delivery of comprehensive treatment to patients in pain.”136 The incorporation of “alternative” forms of pain management, including acupuncture, relaxation tech- niques, hypnosis, biofeedback, and guided imagery, is acknowledged by the Children’s Hospital of the Medical College of Wisconsin to complement pharmacological management of children’s pain.137 The selection, balance, and application of these treatment components should be based on consideration of an individual’s coping styles. Such a treatment program could be developed to provide more con- sistently effective analgesia than the individual components can pro- vide separately. Relieving the pain of childbirth, for example, without diminishing or distorting the full consciousness of the experience for the mother, would be consistent with the goals of the contemporary physician of natural medicine.

## 347CHAPTER 43 Nontransfusion Significance of ABO and ABO-Associated Polymorphisms

Adding the glycoprotein N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to the end of the chain results in blood group A antigenicity. The terminal car- bohydrate and the B group antigen is the monosaccharide galactose. There is no true O antigen: the terminal carbohydrate of O (H) antigen is the monosaccharide fucose. We identify the blood types as “ABO” but typically refer to the actual antigen system as “ABH.” ABH substances manifest quite early in life processes.1 They are detected in the cell membranes and secretions of human embryos at about 5 weeks’ gestational age in the epithelium and virtually all vas- cular endothelium. In fetal organs’ endothelial cells, the expression of ABH antigen is ubiquitously upregulated. This is suggestive evidence that blood group antigens serve as early immunomorphological mark- ers of the endothelial differentiation of mesenchymal cells, specifying the location of future blood vessels.2 All embryonic epithelia contain the ABH antigen, except those of the nervous system, adrenal glands, and liver. The antigens subse- quently disappear from epithelia in an orderly and predictable man- ner as evidence of morphological differentiation appears. By about the end of the third intrauterine month, the adult pattern of distribution is achieved. The embryonic expression of ABH antigens may be an important aspect in the pathogenesis of certain diseases: a scrutiny of 2557 medi- cal records for children with type 1 diabetes and controls showed ABO blood group incompatibility in close to 90% of children with diabetes,3 indicating that maternal–fetal ABO incompatibility may have acted to inhibit normal pancreatic islet formation in the fetus. The expression of ABH antigens in the adult is tightly regulated, and their reappearance in adult tissue—normally devoid of them— is virtually always a sign of disease. Inappropriate ABH expression is one of the prime manifestations of the aberrant glycosylation state that is a hallmark of malignancy. Instances have been observed indicating that aberrant ABH expression may be paralleled in entirely different organ systems. A link has been demonstrated between ABH antigen expression in normal and neoplastic colonic epithelia and consequent alterations of ABH expression in the thyroid.4

## ABH Secretors and Nonsecretors

By 1930 it had been shown that some people do and others do not secrete antigens corresponding to their ABO blood group into their saliva. Persons with these substances in saliva (secretors) have more ABH substances in their tissues than those lacking the substance in their saliva (nonsecretors). The ability to secrete behaved as a simple Mendelian function dominant to nonsecretion. Persons with blood groups A, B, and AB who are secretors secrete the antigens correspond- ing to their blood groups. Group H persons secrete the H substance, as do all other secretors, to a somewhat lesser extent. ABH substances are secreted by mucous glands in many organs, including the upper respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus through the colon, and the uterine cervix. ABH secretor status is a major conditioner of the gut mucosa. ABH secretors have greater quantities of free ABH antigens in the makeup of their intes- tinal secretions, which has significant effects on bacterial and lectin adherence to the gut microvilli. The secretor gene regulates the syn- thesis of blood group substances in superficial glands of the gastric and small intestine mucosa. Large amounts of ABH material are found in all secretors,5–8 characterized by a uniform distribution of blood type antigens in the gastric pits. ABH expression is independent of secretor status: glands situated deep in the mucosa of the pylorus and small intestine (Brunner glands) and gastric parietal glands both produce A and B substances without regard to secretor status.9 For a more detailed discussion of the metabolic consequences of ABH secretor status, the reader should refer to the author’s article spe- cifically on the subject.10

## Brush-Border Hydrolases

ABO blood group determines much of the enzyme activity in the tis- sue (brush border) of the intestine. At least six intestinal hydrolases have ABO blood group antigenic determinants directly related to ABO blood group. The expression of ABH antigens secreted by intestinal glycoproteins is under the control of the secretor gene; therefore these antigens are not detected in the hydrolases of nonsecretor subjects.11

## Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase Activity

Intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) is involved with both the break- down of dietary cholesterol and the absorption of calcium. The activity of IAP and serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) is strongly correlated with ABH secretor phenotypes. It has been estimated that the SAP activity of nonsecretors is only about 20% of the activity in the secretor groups.11–15 ABO polymorphism is linked to the levels and persistence of IAP.16 Numerous studies have associated group O individuals with the high- est alkaline phosphatase activity and group A with the lowest.17 In addition, one study implied that the group A antigen itself might inac- tivate IAP.18

## Bacterial Flora

The role of the ABO blood group in determining the bacteria making up a healthy gastrointestinal ecosystem is particularly strong in ABH secre- tors. Because ABH secretor status and ABO blood group dictate the presence and specificity of A, B, and H blood group antigens in human gut mucin glycoproteins, their status can influence the populations of bacteria capable of taking up local residence. This occurs because some of the bacteria in the digestive tract are actually capable of producing enzymes that allow them to degrade the terminal sugar of the ABH blood type antigens for a constant food supply.19 Bacteria capable of degrading blood group B antigen can detach the terminal α -d-galactose. Group A–degrading bacteria can detach the GalNAc. These bacteria GalGal NAcTYPE XIV Lewis A Lewis B A B H GalGal NAc GalGal NAc GalGal NAc GalGal NAcGal NAc Gal Fuc Fuc Fuc Fuc Fuc Fuc GalGal NAc ß(1-3[4]) a(1-2) a(1-4) a(1-3) ß(1-3)

have a competitive advantage and can thrive in the environment cre- ated by the preconditioning of ABH secretions. Although comparatively small populations of bacteria produce blood group–degrading enzymes (estimated populations are 108 bacteria per gram), the quantity of these bacteria are several orders of magnitude greater in different blood types, and they are much more stable residents. For example, B-degrading bacteria have a population density that is about 50,000-fold greater in blood group B secretors than in other subjects. Similar bacterial speci- ficity and enzyme activity are found in other blood types.20 Evidence suggests that ABH nonsecretors have lower levels of immunoglobulin-G (Ig-G)21,22 and secretory IgA concentrations than secretors.23,24 ABH nonsecretors appear to have a higher prevalence of a variety of autoimmune diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthropathy, Sjögren’s syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and Graves’ disease.22,25–27 Studies to determine the patterns associated with the gut micro- biome as assessed via fecal sample are still being conducted to deter- mine ABO and ABH secretor status influence. To date, studies have shown that being an ABH secretor is associated with lower diversity index, whereas specific ABO blood groups are associated with allow- ing strain-specific bacterial expansion based on the bacteria’s ability to degrade sugars.28 For example, the bacteria Lachnospiraceae possess beta-galactosidase activity and are therefore higher in blood group B and O secretors due to the presence of D galactose residues on their antigen’s terminal chain.28 Following this thought, as we identify microbial metabolic processes, we can expect to uncover that those strains with preferential utilization of N-acetylgalactosamine will have better chances of colonizing the gut of a blood group A secretor.

## Molecules

In the larger world of glycoproteins, ABH antigens are characterized as O-linked glycans (glycosylation at serine or threonine residues by GalNAc). Many proteins in nature carry these dense and complex arrays of covalently attached sugar chains. Their biological roles are particularly important in the construction of complex multicellular organisms and organs. Glycans are typically on the cellular outer surfaces and outside of secreted macromolecules; therefore they can mediate interactions between organisms. They are also involved in cell-to-cell and cell-to- matrix interactions that are crucial to the development and function of complex multicellular organisms. Glycans can have a significant effect on fungal, viral, and bacterial pathogenicity.29 ABH antigens are ubiquitous in nature, found abun- dantly in foodstuffs (where they are thought to play a role in the induc- tion of opposing blood group antibodies early in life) and in a host of microorganisms. A 1995 study showed that of 833 fungi harvested from 1977 to 1994, extracts (47.8%) produced agglutination of human red blood cells (RBCs), equally distributed against type O, A, and B cells. The fungal agglutinins, in this case, are desirous of attaching and infecting seeds or other microbes that possess some “ABO blood type” activity of their own.30 ABH antigens appear in secretions by 8 to 9 weeks of age, first in the salivary glands and stomach, then throughout the gastrointestinal and vaginal tracts. The ABH variation of blood group antigen expression on vaginal epithelial cells and mucus has a significant role in suscepti- bility to urinary tract infections in women.31

## Infertility and Spontaneous Abortion

ABO blood type incompatibility may be a critical factor in infertility. ABO-incompatible mating couples (a type A male fertilizing a type O female) are a common occurrence in miscarriages, especially very early in the gestational term. One study of 288 miscarriages showed that there was an excess of blood type A and type B in otherwise nor- mal fetuses. The researchers concluded that the ABO incompatibility between mother and fetus was likely a cause of early miscarriages, but almost exclusively in chromosomally normal fetuses.32–35 In a study of 102 infertile couples, Solish36 found that 87% were blood type incompatible. This researcher suggested that the infertility was due to the presence of antibodies in the secretions of the moth- er’s genital tract or incompatible sperm from the father. In another study, a total of 589 compatible mating couples were compared with 432 incompatible mating couples. The mean number of living children presented a significant difference. There was a 21% deficiency of type A children in the two groups. Similarly, there was a 16% deficiency of type B children in the two groups. It appears that a 31.9% rate of miscarriage is associated with incompatible matings, compared with 17.15% in compatible matings. This finding has led some research- ers to theorize that ABO incompatibility results in “cervical hostility” between the man’s blood type antigens, which are present in his sperm, and the woman’s opposing antibodies, present in her cervical mucus.37 Besides infertility, habitual abortion is also related to ABH secretor status as shown in 2010. The secretor status of 66 couples with recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) was obtained and compared with that of couples with successful term pregnancies. It was found that a secre- tor phenotype of couples with RSA, especially of the husband, could facilitate “reproductive success” and that couples in which both par- ents were secretors, the RSA probability was extremely diminished.38 A previous study showed the interaction between ABO blood groups and adenosine deaminase genetic polymorphism during intrauterine life, providing results that could not be explained by strictly conventional immunologic mechanisms. The authors concluded that cell-to-cell interactions involving ABO antigens might have an important role at implantation and that adenosine deaminase, through control of local adenosine concentration, could modulate these interactions, influ- encing the probability of successful implantation.39 A third and most recent study comparing secretor status compatibility between mother and child suggested an intrauterine selection against Se– (nonsecretor) of the embryo carried by an Se+ (secretor) mother. The selection was dependent on factors influencing the maternal environment.40 To measure women’s fertility below age 45, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels are measured. Women with an FSH level greater than 10 are considered to have diminished ovarian reserve. In an ongoing study at Yale University and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, it was observed that women with type A or AB blood were significantly less likely to have an FSH greater than than were women with type O or B blood. They concluded that type O blood might affect fertility.41

## Other Immune Correlates

In 1991 D’Adamo reported that individuals of group O blood report- ing previous urticaria or anaphylaxis showed high residual titers of anti-A isoagglutinins. A score value was assigned to each agglutination reaction. Individuals with these disorders showed remarkably high titration scores compared with controls of the same blood group, up to three times higher. A mild increase was noted for group O subjects with severe eczema or asthma, but total scores in these subjects were only marginally greater than those of controls. A striking association was shown for group O women experiencing endometriosis.42

## ABO and Secretor Blood Group Genetics

<!-- chunk -->

## ABO System

In 1910 Epstein and Ottenberg suggested that the ABO blood group system could be inherited.43 The determination of ABO status is the result of two codominant alleles and one recessive allele found on chromosome 9q band 34.

<!-- chunk -->

## 349CHAPTER 43 Nontransfusion Significance of ABO and ABO-Associated Polymorphisms

A and B blood group genes are dominant over the O blood group, and the A and B group genes are themselves codominant. The ABH antigens are not primary and direct gene products; they are the reac- tion products catalyzed by glycosyltransferases type of enzymes. ABO genes consist of at least seven exons, and the coding sequence in the seven coding exons spans more than 18 kb of the genomic DNA. The single-nucleotide deletion found in most (but not all) of the O alleles that is responsible for the loss of the activity of the enzyme is located in exon 6.44

<!-- chunk -->

## ABH Secretor System

The secretor gene (FUT2 at 19q13.3) codes for the activity of glycos- yltransferases needed to assemble (secrete) free ABH antigen in body fluids like saliva, semen, vaginal fluid goblet cells, and mucous gland cells. This is accomplished in concert with the gene for group O or H (FUT1). Secretor status is determined by two alleles on FUT2, Se (dominant) and se (recessive), with approximately 80% of the popula- tion typing as secretors (SeSe or Sese).

## Lewis Blood Groups and Their Association With the ABH

<!-- chunk -->

## Secretor System

The ABH secretor system is a major determinant of the Lewis (Le) blood grouping system (Fig. 43.2). This is due to the fact that, in addi- tion to ABH, FUT1 and FUT2 provide the glycans necessary for con- version of Le antigens as well. Two broad categories of Le blood type exist. These are the “Lewis positive” (either Lea+b– or Lea–b+) and “Lewis negative” (Lea–b–) phe- notypes. Depending on race, between 1% and 8% of the population is Lewis negative. In Lewis-positive phenotypes, Lea is formed initially, and in the case of nonsecretors (lacking the Se gene, FUT2), Lea glycan is attached to the RBCs, and they type as Lea. In the case of secretors, the Se gene activates the H gene, which causes an additional sugar to be added to Lea, converting it to Leb (see Fig. 43.1). Among Le-positive individuals, ABH secretors are always Lea–b+ because they convert all their Lea antigen into Leb. Conversely, among Lewis-positive people, ABH nonsecretors are always Lea+b– because they lack the FUT2-dependent glycosyltransferase to accomplish this conversion. Thus it is often possible (and quite handy) to use the Lewis groups to infer ABH secretor status because Lewis typing is fairly quick to per- form and easy to master compared with the traditionally used salivary inhibition test. However, the use of Lewis typing to infer ABH secretor status works only in those individuals who are Lewis-positive (about of every 10 patients). Lewis-negative individuals can either be secretors or nonsecretors. Lewis-negative patients carry important metabolic consequences of their own, worthy of much attention.10 Table 43.2 shows Lewis blood types and their relationship to ABH secretor and/ or nonsecretor status. Sialylated forms of several Lewis variations (sialyl Lewis A, sialyl Lewis X) are oligosaccharide ligands now considered crucial to the initial adhesion of white blood cells to a site of injury mediated by E-selectins. Large quantities of sialyl Lewis X have also been found on the surfaces of certain tumor and cancer cells, and one of its variants (sialyl 6-sulfo Lewis X) appears to be involved in routine homing pro- cesses involving a variety of chemokines. Individuals of blood group O phenotype run an approximate 1.5- to 2-fold higher risk for development of peptic ulcer disease,45 Fig. 43.2 Fucosylated and sialylated blood group (bg) antigens and associated secretor phenotypes. (A) The α1.2-fucosylated (in red) H and Le b antigens define bg O. Bg A and B antigens present additional GalNAc or Gal residues (blue), respectively. Ley and Leb are both difucosylated. sLea and sLex are sialylated Lewis antigens (in pink). (B) Synthesis pathways for bg antigens with corresponding Se phenotypes: Lea is found in Se0 indi- viduals, whereas Sew individuals carry a mix of mucosal Lea and Leb. Lea is formed when the Se-transferase is inactive or weak because Lea is a “dead end” and is not extended further. During inflammation and infec- tion, sialyl-transferases are expressed, and carbohydrate core chains become sialylated in competition with Se-fucosyltransferase. (C) The presence of ABH and Lea antigens in salivary, milk, and gastrointestinal tract secretions identifies individuals of Se, Se0, or Sew phenotype. (D) In Sew subjects, α1.2 fucosylation is ham- pered by an enzymatically weak Se-transferase, whereas Se0 individuals lack Se-transferase activity.

although there is no direct correlation between ABO blood group phe- notypes and the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection. However, in addition to H type 1, the Leb antigen is also a binding receptor for H. pylori, and in this capacity, it can best be described as a “virulence-pro- moting factor.” For virulent strains, Leb antigen binding activity targets the microbes to the epithelial cell surfaces and potentiates the effect of secretion of virulence factors, such as the vacuolating cytotoxin and/or neutrophil activating–recruiting factors.46

## Linkage and Pleiotropism

Linked genes occur on the same chromosome and are inherited as a single unit. Gene linkage analysis shows several genes linked to the ABO locus. For example, there are strong indications that a gene reg- ulating dopamine β -hydroxylase activity is linked to the ABO blood group locus.47 Dopamine β -hydroxylase is a key enzyme in the conver- sion of dopamine to norepinephrine. This linkage may help explain the continued significance of ABO group as a discreet and significant genetic marker for a variety of affec- tive disorders, including type A behavior in men subsequent to myo- cardial infarction48 and bipolar depression,49,50 each of which has been associated with blood group O. The ABO locus shows putative linkage with platelet monoamine oxidase activity,51 reduced levels of which have been noted in group O healthy men.52 Additional evidence implies that there is a linkage between the ABO gene and the gene that regulates the activity of the enzyme arginino- succinate synthetase, which recycles arginine from citrulline in the production of nitric oxide.53 A letter to the editor in the journal Lancet reported differences between ABO groups in their responsiveness to inhaled nitric oxide therapy: types with a B antigen (B and AB) had less success with this therapy.54 Elevated factor VIII (FVIII) levels contribute to venous throm- botic risk. FVIII levels are determined to a large extent by levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a protein that protects FVIII against proteolysis.55 ABO polymorphism is one of the best-characterized genetic modifiers of plasma FVIII; it accounts for approximately 30% of the total genetic effect.56 Subjects with blood group non-O have higher vWF and FVIII levels than individuals with blood group O.57 Digit ratio, a marker of assessing the levels of prenatal expo- sure to androgens, has yielded mixed results58,59 as a predictor of androgen stimulation in individuals with polycystic ovarian syndrome. However, preliminary evidence suggests that genes contributing to the expression of 2D:4D reside in the vicinity of the gene loci (chromosomal locations: 9q34.2 and 1p36.11) of the blood groups or that there may be pleiotropic effects on digit ratio as a result of the blood group genes. Associations using digit ratios may require incorporation of the ABO blood group in their interpretation.60

## Additional Physiological Correlations

In addition to the previously described variations in IAP and brush- border hydrolase activity, several additional circumstances where ABO polymorphism exerts a significant influence on physiology have been reported.

## Gastric Acidity

Because the prevalence of both pernicious anemia and gastric cancer is higher in individuals of blood group A and that of duodenal ulcer is higher in those of group O, a hypothesis relating blood group effects on acid secretion was inevitable.61 Early work confirmed that acid output tended to be greater in group O than in group A subjects.62,63

## Gastrin and Pepsinogen

In one study, serum pepsinogen A (pepsinogen I) levels were stud- ied in relation to ABO blood group, age, and gender in 700 healthy blood donors. Serum pepsinogen A levels were higher in males than in females and rose with increasing age. Blood group O individuals showed higher serum pepsinogen A levels than blood group A indi- viduals.64 There is also evidence that the type A antigen in gastric juice binds to pepsin and possibly inactivates it.65 A study using serum pep- sinogen levels as a marker for gastric atrophy showed a high associ- ation with blood groups A and B.66 However, possibly owing to the polygenic nature of pepsinogen activity, one study failed to find any significant difference in pepsinogen levels between ABO groups.67 Another study looking at ABO polymorphism and serum gastrin concentration after stimulation by a glycine drink could find no cor- relation with ABO blood group.68 However, the study had a simple preprandial and postprandial methodology. In a different study, the concentrations of gastrin were measured in the blood of 121 fasting healthy Greek volunteers of both sexes and different ABO blood types, between ages 20 and 70 years. The testing took place immediately after a test meal was eaten by subjects who had fasted for 8 hours; the mea- surement was repeated at 10 and 40 minutes post-meal. The research- ers found that gastrin levels took 40 minutes to increase after the meal in the blood type A and B subjects but that a significant increase appeared 10 minutes after the meal in the blood type O subjects.69

## Cholesterol

Although several studies on highly select populations have yielded conflicting results,70,71 the general consensus is that blood group A individuals have a significantly higher basal cholesterol level than those in other blood groups. The relationship between ABO blood phenotype and total serum cholesterol level was examined in a spe- cific Japanese population. The results showed that cholesterol levels were very significantly elevated in the blood type A group compared with non-A.72 ABO blood group and coronary risk factor levels were measured in a nationwide sample of more than 6000 black and white adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Blood group A was associated with significantly higher serum total cholesterol levels in white females independent of all other risk factors, in white males independent of age and weight, and in Southern black females independent of age and weight.73 A sep- arate study (the Bogalusa Heart Study) looked at 656 white and black adolescents and found the same results with regard to total cho- lesterol; even higher levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were found in type A adolescents than in other blood types.74

## Stress

Several studies have identified differences between ABO group and possible chemical responses to stress. Interestingly, individuals of blood group A appeared to have a lower incidence of “type A personality.”75

One study evaluated the influence of blood type A versus O cou- pled with a mirror-drawing stressor on very-low-density lipoprotein toxicity-preventing activity (TxPA). Plasma cortisol levels showed sig- nificant ABO variation. Exposure to the stressor significantly decreased TxPA and increased cortisol for the total group of 25 older men. The stress response patterns of the 15 blood type A men were different from those of the 10 type O subjects. The blood type A group had higher initial levels of TxPA and cortisol as well as quicker stress recovery rates than the type O group.76 Another study showed that blood group A individuals responded to a stressful situation (venipuncture) with higher levels of cortisol and, possibly, of adrenaline.77

## Rheology

For purposes of this discussion, rheology is used to describe the dynam- ics between blood clotting (moving toward a solid state) and blood thinning (moving toward a liquid state). It might be tempting to sub- stitute the word viscosity for rheology when talking about blood types and clotting. Viscosity, however, does not cover the “dynamics” of how, when, and why blood can change texture; it only distinguishes one texture state from another. There is evidence that the rheology of blood may play a role in a variety of chronic anxiety states. Compared with normal subjects, chronic depressive and schizoid patients had very significant dif- ferences in their blood rheology and in the ability of their RBCs to aggregate. When patients with schizoid anxiety were compared with those with depressive anxiety, their ratio of albumin to globulin was increased. When patients were divided according to their ABO blood groups, significant differences were found in their albumin:fibrinogen ratio and their blood viscosity. This was particularly true for women who had blood type A and who had depressive anxiety; their blood tended to be substantially “thicker” and to have higher amounts of serum proteins in it than women with similar depression who had blood type O.78 Associations between the ABO phenotype and variations in blood rheology have also been reported in high blood pressure79; stress80; dia- betes81; heart attack, cancer, and thyroid disease82; kidney failure83; and malignant melanoma.84

## Soluble Endothelial Cell Markers

Selectins are cell–cell adhesion molecules that are involved in leu- kocyte–endothelial cell adhesive interaction, which is required for extravasation at target tissue sites. Three types of selectins have been discovered: L-selectins are generally expressed on almost all leukocytes, E-selectins are inducible on vascular endothelium upon stimulation with cytokines, and P-selectins are found on activated platelets. The role of thrombomodulin as a C-type lectin is less known. It has a domain that interferes with neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells. Elevated levels of E-selectin (P < 0.001) and thrombomodulin (P < 0.001) are linked with blood type A individuals.85

## Mental Disease

There are several reports exploring the relationship of ABO groups, ABH and Lewis secretor type, and mental disease such as obsessional illness,86 bipolar disorder,87,88 depression,89 and schizophrenia.88 A significant part of that research was done in the 1970s and 1980s and does not seem to have been updated or explored much further. Most of the articles reviewed and not discussed here were not conclusive about blood group associations.

## Cardiovascular Disease

## Stroke

A European study compared 50 patients with stroke. The standard expected frequency of ABO blood types in the surrounding population showed that the frequency of the blood group A in the patients with stroke was 120% greater than would normally be expected. The percentage of blood type B was even higher (159% of expected rate of occurrence). Patients with blood type O were only 85% as likely to experience stroke.90 A 1979 study of 220 patients with stroke looked at the viscosity of their blood a few hours after the stroke event. About 80% of the patients had blood cells that easily aggregated. What was especially interesting was the discovery by the researchers that the clotting of blood in patients with A and B blood types was mostly due to fibrinogen, whereas in blood types O and AB, it was caused by other clotting factors.91 Individuals with blood types A and AB have a generalized tendency toward problems associated with blood clotting, whereas problems in those with blood types B and O appear to be linked to excessive bleed- ing and poor clotting. This observation was verified in several studies, the largest being performed in 1460 patients with “stroke” and reported in the Lancet. In 329 cases, the cause of death was certified as cerebral thrombosis (brain clot). In the thrombosis cases, there was an excess of patients of blood types A and AB and a deficiency of those with blood types O and B. In the 482 “strokes” that were due to cranial bleeding, the reverse was true: there was a significantly higher proportion of patients with blood types O and B than of those with blood types A and AB.92 A 2009 United Kingdom systematic review tried to assess whether the effects of non-O status on thrombosis risk were of the magnitude predicted by its effect on vWF/FVIII levels (Fig. 43.3). They confirmed the historical impression of linkage between some vascular disorders and non-O blood group status. They concluded that the odds ratios were similar to those predicted by the effect of ABO(H) on vWF levels on thrombosis. They proposed further work to understand and refine the effect of reducing O(H) antigen expression and therefore a more widespread adoption of ABO(H) typing.93

## Peripheral Artery Disease and Venous Thromboembolism

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) occurs in approximately 12% of the adult population. The prevalence of PAD increases with age: almost 20% of people older than 70 years have the disease. E-selectin and thrombomodulin levels are always elevated in intermittent claudica- tion, a disorder almost always found with PAD and carrying a distinct association with blood type A.94 In 125 patients experiencing venous thrombosis in a Brazilian pop- ulation, a higher-than-expected proportion of blood group A and a lower-than-expected proportion of blood group O were observed among the patients.95 This is consistent with the previously discussed influence of ABO on a third soluble endothelial product, vWF, and its role in thromboembolism. Another study in 2007 confirmed that non-O blood type was independently associated with risk of venous thromboembolism and added to the risk associated with FV Leiden (hypercoagulability).96 Even in pregnancy, a nested case-control study within a cohort of 71,729 women who gave birth to 126,783 children in Denmark showed that blood groups A and AB might be associated with increased risk estimates for venous thromboembolism in preg- nancy and the puerperium.97

## Heart Disease

There is a clear-cut association with having A and AB phenotypes and an increased risk for heart disease. This association has been reported continuously in the scientific literature over the past 50 years. Individuals who have blood type A have higher rates of heart attack in all age groups, both genders, and all ethnic and national groups.

## 352SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

In 1962 the Framingham Heart Study typed the blood of the sur- viving 4125 members of the original study group of 5209 people first examined from 1948 to 1951. The most striking observance was the lower rates of nonfatal heart disease in men aged 39 to 72 years with blood type O than in those with blood type A.98 A 1994 Polish study on patients who underwent coronary bypass surgery with highly advanced arteriosclerosis of the coronary arteries found a significantly higher number of cases with group AB and a lower number of those with group O.99 A 1981 German study of 13,175 patients showed a preva- lence of blood type A in all types of heart disease examined.100 In a study of 191 coronary artery bypass candidates, investigators paradoxically found an excess of type O over type A subjects. After exam- ining the data more closely, they concluded that the tendency of type A subjects for more ready development of blood clots (“thrombotic prone- ness”) led to a poorer prognosis. In essence, the blood type A subjects were missing from the study because they had already died in greater numbers, leaving a disproportionate number of type O subjects among the long-term survivors.101 In a study of male survivors of heart disease, researchers found that there were fewer patients who were type A and younger than 55 years than would have been otherwise expected.102 A 1975 Italian study of 746 patients with high blood pressure, with congenital heart disease, and 4503 with a history of heart attack found a significant lack of patients with type O blood and a significant excess of blood type A patients in the group with myocardial infarction. The study also showed an excess of blood type A patients with high blood pressure and a lack of patients who were blood type B.103 A study of 255 women originally investigating the effects of smoking on the rates of heart attack also found several other factors significantly associated with heart attacks in this group, including hypertension, angina pectoris, family history, diabetes mellitus, and blood type A.104 Platt et al.105 examined blood type and heart attacks in two differ- ent age groups. The patients were divided into two groups: 65 years or older and younger than 65 years. The predominance of blood type A in patients with cardiac infarction was “highly significant” in both age groups (P < 0.005). This study was unique in that it excluded other risk factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and high choles- terol levels. When the researchers looked specifically at the older group, the predominance of blood group A in those with cardiac infarction was even higher (P < 0.001). The researchers concluded, “Our investi- gation strongly suggests the existence of a genetic factor associated with blood group A and independent of the other risk factors, which is also responsible for a greater incidence of cardiac infarction.”105 An 8-year study of 7662 British men found that blood type A was linked to the incidence of ischemic heart disease as well as higher total serum cholesterol concentrations.106 A 2015 study confirmed this asso- ciation and additionally linked any blood group that is not type O with increased mortality due to cardiovascular disease.107

## Cancer

“Some cancers contain an A-like substance even when they occur in persons who are not A or AB. These observations suggest that in the tissues, both normal and neoplastic, of all persons, there are blood group A-like antigens present at a biochemical level, which are usually inaccessible to the immune system.” Mourant (Blood Groups and Disease, 1977)

## 353CHAPTER 43 Nontransfusion Significance of ABO and ABO-Associated Polymorphisms

Tumor development is usually associated with changes in cell-sur- face carbohydrates. Cell glycosylation depends on the expression and function of various glycosyltransferases and glycosidases. These enzymes modify the carbohydrate core structure or the terminal car- bohydrate structures, resulting in the incomplete synthesis or modifi- cation of existing carbohydrates. Considerable research demonstrates that malignant transformation is associated with various and complex alterations in the glycosylation process. These and other changes provide a selective advantage for tumor cells during their progression to more invasive and metastatic forms. Some of the more studied glycoprotein modifications include the following108: • Increase in N-glycation and O-glycation and fucosylation processes • Increase in mucins • Alteration in galectin levels and specificities • Increase in cell-surface sialylation • Increase in chitinase-like proteins and proteoglycans • Increase in glycosphingolipids The blood group–related carbohydrate structures Le(x), sialyl- Le(x), ABH, and Le(y) are examples of terminal carbohydrate struc- tures that are related to tumor prognosis. These structures are of increasing interest because they may function as adhesion molecules or motility factors.109

## Thomsen-Friedenreich Antigen (Pancarcinoma-Associated

<!-- chunk -->

## Antigen)

Many malignant cells develop a tumor marker called the Thomsen- Friedenreich (T) antigen (TFA). Tn and sialyl Tn (STn) appear to result from somatic mutations in the Cosmc (C1GALT1C1). Diverse neoplas- tic lesions, including colon cancer and melanoma-derived cell lines, express both Tn and STn antigen due to loss-of-function mutations in Cosmc.110 This antigen is encrypted in normal healthy cells, much like a rock is covered over by water at high tide. T antigen becomes “unsuppressed” only as a cell moves toward malignancy, much like the example of the covered rock, which is uncovered as the tide moves out. It has been estimated that T antigen (or its precursor, Tn antigen) is expressed in about 90% of all cancers, earning it the appellation “pancarcinoma-associated antigen.”111 As a general rule, an orderly expression of T antigens on a cancer cell usually indicates a relatively favorable outlook. However, a prevalence of Tn antigens on a cancer cell usually denotes a highly aggressive, metastatic cancer, irrespective of the form of cancer or organ involved.112 Tn antigen is rarely found in healthy tissue; most people produce TFA agglutinins antibodies to it, probably in response to cross-in- duction by the gut flora. ABO blood group appears to influence the amount and activity of these antibodies against T and Tn antigens. Although derived from the MN blood type antigen, Tn antigen shows structural homology to the A antigen because they share terminal GalNAc. Because antibodies against Tn antigen cross-react with A gly- colipids, Tn antigen was concluded to be an A-like antigen in a broad sense. Blood group A patients with gastric cancer have the greatest and most uniform suppression of TFA agglutinins levels, irrespective of age, cancer stage, or tumor morphology.

## Inadvertent Elaboration of Blood Group Antigens

Deletion, reduction, or inappropriate expression of blood group A or B antigen in tumors of blood type A or B individuals is clearly correlated with the level of malignancy and metastatic potential.113 The most sig- nificant variations are summarized in Table 43.3. A and B blood group antigens are present on carcinoma cells at the early stages of carcinogenesis and tend to disappear at later stages. The blood group A antigen may render malignant cells resistant to apoptosis.114 Lewis blood groups can modulate the expression of several tumor-associated antigens, including DU-PAN9 and CA19-9. Some researchers have suggested that taking into account Lewis secretor sta- tus to establish reference ranges for the tumor antigen measurements might actually be a way to improve their clinical utility. This relation- ship is shown in Table 43.4. The association of blood groups with cancer was first demonstrated by Aird et al.115 in 1953, pointing to group A with gastric carcinoma. One hypothetical mechanism is that the carcinoma cells produce an antigen immunologically related to blood group A, which may have a protective effect, particularly in blood group O individuals, by prevention of the growth and spread of the tumor.116 It appears that the progression of stomach cells to stomach cancer involves a necessary mutation at the ABO gene, the result of which is the production of A antigen, even if this is not the person’s blood type. This “A-like” antigen may not be the true A antigen but, rather, what one researcher called “tumor-asso- ciated, A cross-reacting antigens occurring in a wide variety of human adenocarcinomas of hosts belonging to all ABO blood groups.”117 There is also a B-like antigen noted in colon or rectal carcinoma and other malignant processes.112 More data need to be collected about different malignant processes. A 2009 study in Italy that retrieved tumor data on 15,359 patients was able to show that exocrine pancreatic malignancy

## Epidermal Growth Factor

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) bears an antigenic determinant that is closely related to the human blood group A car- bohydrate structure. A higher number of high-affinity EGF binding sites was observed in donors with blood group A1 erythrocytes than in donors with blood groups O and B.119 That the blood group A antigen can also bind to EGF-Rs is now well documented, so it is not unlikely that free A antigen in individuals with blood groups A and AB (especially if they are secretors) can find their way onto these excess EGF-Rs and act to stimulate cell growth. As with vWF and FVIII, excessive activation of the EGF-R results in cancer cells that become more mobile and better able to develop new and additional blood supplies (angiogenesis).120 One reason that low stomach acid is linked to type A blood may have to do with the role of EGF discussed in the previous section on saliva, “ABH Secretors and Nonsecretors.” As described, the EGF-R has a high affinity for the type A antigen, and although the major action of EGF is to stimulate repair of the digestive lining, it has also been shown to decrease acid production in the stomach.

## Pancreatic Cancer

The state of the art in the field of pancreatic cancer research continues to prove the relationship of malignancy to ABO blood group. A clinical trial for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma that involved 3000 people from the Han population showed that higher risk, higher state of malig- nancy, and less survival after surgery was associated with non-O blood groups.121 Analyzing ABO genotype alleles with a genome-wide asso- ciation study (PanScan) identified significant associations at the ABO gene locus with risk of pancreatic cancer. An increase in risk was noted with the addition of each non-O allele. Compared with OO genotype, AA presented a higher risk than AO in the 3000 patients analyzed.122 To help identify what aspect of the O allele is involved in lowering the pancreatic cancer risk in 2009, 558,542 single-nucleotide polymor- phisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 1900 cancer patients and an equal number of control patients. A link was found between a locus on 9q34 and pancreatic cancer marked by the SNP rs505922. This SNP maps to the first intron of the ABO blood group gene, corroborating the epide- miological fact that people with blood group O may have a lower risk of pancreatic cancer than those with groups A or B.123 The enzyme glycosyltransferase is associated with increased pan- creatic cancer risk impact rather than actions of other nearby genes on chromosome 9q34. Glycosyltransferase activity is greater for the A1 versus A2 variant. In a 2010 cancer cohort study, an increased risk in participants with A1, but not A2, alleles was observed. The same study showed that the protective effect of the O allele would be equivalent for O01 and O02 variants. Secretor status was not an effect modifier.124 Having a non-O ABO blood group and colonization by H. pylori are risk factors for pancreatic cancer. In a study at the Yale School of Medicine in 2010, an association between pancreatic cancer risk and CagA-negative H. pylori seropositivity was found among individuals with non-O blood type but not among those with O blood type, prov- ing that there is an association between pancreatic cancer and H. pylori colonization, particularly for individuals with non-O blood types.125

## Breast and Other Gynecologic Cancers

The following articles represent a sampler of the advances in under- standing relationships between ABH antigens, secretor status, and the incidence and prognosis of different gynecologic-related can- cers. In 2009 a correlation between breast cancer in Greek women and ABO blood group was published. One hundred sixty-six female patients with breast cancer were examined. They revealed that blood group A is more often associated with ductal breast cancer (49.6%), in contrast to the other blood groups, and particularly to blood group AB (3.6%). The relative risk of metastasis in Rh (−) patients was 4.2 times higher than that in Rh (+) patients. Consequentially, blood group A, and particularly A (−), has the worst prognosis of all.126 Breast cancer researchers have given the aberrant glycosylation moiety T/Tn antigen the moniker “ligand-like complex” (LLC). By virtue of altered antigenicity, LLC allows for both metastatic egress from the regional lymph nodes and detachment from the extracel- lular matrix and thus is associated with cancers of poor progno- sis.127 We believe that LLC may well be the “A-like,” pancarcinoma cross-reacting antigen. Observation of the GalNac-binding lectin from the Roman snail, Helix pomatia agglutinin, appears to iden- tify this oligosaccharide128; there have been separate reports that “Springer’s vaccine” (human group O RBC membrane–derived T/Tn antigen containing traces of phosphoglycolipid A hyperantigen) has had significant effect as an immune modulator in breast carcinoma of even advanced stage.129 A study of epithelial ovarian cancer incidence and its association to ABO blood groups and risk was performed in 2010 at Harvard and analyzed data from 49,153 women in the Nurses’ Health Study. Compared with women with blood group O, women with blood group AB or B had a nonsignificant 38% increase in ovarian cancer incidence, whereas blood group A was not associated with risk. Combining blood groups AB and B, they observed a statistically significant pos- itive association with presence versus absence of the B antigen for the serous invasive subtype and overall. In this large, prospective cohort of women, the presence of the B antigen was positively associated with ovarian cancer incidence, whereas blood group A was not associated with the same risk.130 Another interesting, yet not definitive, association is presented between invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the vulva and ABO blood groups. The distribution of ABO blood group for women diagnosed with invasive SCC of the vulva was determined. ABO blood group was also recorded for 100 female patients (controls) who underwent a gynecologic procedure for a nonneoplastic process during the same period. A trend was identified for women with inva- sive SCC of the vulva to have blood group type A, but this did not determine a definitive association between blood group type A, or any other blood group, and vulvar SCC.131

## Other Cancers

In two large independent populations, non-O blood group was associ- ated with a decreased risk of skin cancer. The association was statisti- cally significant for nonmelanoma skin cancer. Additional studies are needed to confirm these associations and to define the mechanisms by which ABO blood type or closely linked genetic variants may influence skin cancer risk.132 In addition to original studies on gastric carcinoma, a 2016 study associated blood group A with an increased risk of cancer of the phar- ynx and esophageal adenocarcinoma.133 The ABO blood group is not only associated with incidence but also prognosis. Research showed that blood group A was a negative prognostic factor in gastric carci- noma.134 Another 2017 study showed that of gastric cancer patients with a positive postoperative CEA cancer marker, those with blood group AB were more likely to have a better survival rate.135

In colorectal cancer, there is no specific association with blood group type, but there is a significant difference between the Rh(+) and Rh(−) groups. Further studies on blood group antigens are needed to elucidate the relationship between these antigens and colorectal cancer.136

## Infection

To a great extent, infectious diseases, especially the worldwide epi- demic diseases, have selective effects. This is demonstrated, inter alia, in the different “selection values” in the ABO blood group system. During the eons before antimicrobial intervention, selection variability via ABO polymorphism was a preeminent natural survival mechanism. The previous section appears to imply a selection disadvantage for group A individuals, and it has been argued that under present-day civilized living conditions, blood type O carriers have a preservation advantage over blood group A carriers.137 This may be the result of the deletion of the selection factor “infectious disease,” which may never- theless regain importance if environmental changes occur.138 Historically, some of the most catastrophic epidemic and endemic diseases are ABO selective and, in many instances, demonstrate ABO variation in morbidity, mortality, or microcharacteristics such as sub- strain preferentiality and level of inflammatory response. They include cholera (O), smallpox (A), malaria (A), and influenza (variable subsets depending on strain). The influence of ABO polymorphism on infectious disease appears to stem from a multitude of unique factors. These are encapsulated in Table 43.5. A morbidity and mortality variation among the ABO and secretor groups is presented in Table 43.6. A special examination of polymorphic differences in uropathic infectious disease is presented in Table 43.7. An interesting study done in Sudan about placental malaria showed that women of eastern Sudan are at risk for placental malaria infection irrespective of their age or parity but that women with blood group O were at higher risk of past placental malaria infection.139 A higher sero- prevalence of IgG H. pylori–specific antibodies was observed in gastric ulcer patients (90%) compared with the control group (60%). A sig- nificant increase of phenotypes O, A2, and Leb in H. pylori–infected patients was observed. The expression of these antigens had progres- sive alterations in areas of ulcerous lesions and intestinal metaplasia; therefore ABH and Lewis blood group antigens appear to be a good indicator for cellular alterations in the gastric epithelium.140 For a more detailed examination of particular infectious scenarios, the reader is referred to the author’s comprehensive survey.141

## Periodontal Disease and Oral Malignancy

A recent study segregated populations (1220 subjects aged between and 55) into three groups according to Ramfjord’s periodontal dis- ease index: healthy, gingivitis, and periodontitis. Blood types were confirmed for each of the participants. Effectively, blood group A showed a significantly higher percentage in the gingivitis group, and blood group O showed a higher percentage in the periodontitis group. The blood group AB showed the least percentage of periodontal dis- ease. The distribution of Rh factor in all groups showed a significantly higher distribution of Rh-positive.142 In most human carcinomas, including oral carcinoma, a significant event is decreased expression of histo–blood-group antigens A and B. A relative down-regulation of the glycosyltransferase that is involved in the biosynthesis of A and B antigens is seen in oral carcinomas in association with tumor development. As reviewed previously, the events leading to loss of A transferase activity are related, in some instances, to the loss of heterozygosity involving chromosome 9q34, which is the locus for the ABO gene, and in other cases, to hypermethylation of the ABO gene pro- moter. Altered blood group antigens in malignant oral tissues may indi- cate increased cell migration. Some studies showed that normal migrating oral epithelial cells, like malignant cells, show lack of expression of A/B antigens and, therefore, lack of ABH antigens to key receptors controlling adhesion and motility, such as integrins, cadherins, and CD-44.143

# BLOOD GROUPS AND DIETARY LECTINS

ABO polymorphism is one of the prime determinants of the glycosyla- tion variability of gut mucin. As such, it affords insight into the actions of a class of carbohydrate-binding dietary proteins called lectins, which are increasingly a subject of interest for nutritional researchers.

<!-- chunk -->

## Historical Perspective

Stillmark at the University of Dorpat in Estonia first identified lectins in 1888. While investigating the toxic effects on the blood of castor bean extract (Ricinus communis), he noticed that the RBCs were being agglutinated. He isolated the material responsible for the agglutination and called it ricin. In 1945 William Boyd of the Boston University School of Medicine discovered that lectins can be blood group specific, being able to agglu- tinate the RBCs of one type but not those of another. He discovered that lima bean lectin would agglutinate RBCs of human blood type A but not those of O or B. The seeds of Lotus tetragonolobus can agglu- tinate group O specifically, and Bandeiraea simplicifolia is specific to group B. The specificity of lectins is so sharply defined that they can differentiate among blood subgroups. Dolichos biflorens lectin reacts more vigorously with blood group A1 than with A2. The word lectin was proposed by William Boyd in 1954 to describe a class of blood type–specific agglutinins found in certain plants. The word is allegorical, to a degree, because it derives from a Latin word meaning “to choose.”

factor receptors, transport proteins, and brush-border enzymes, are glycosylated before being embedded in the brush-border mem- brane. Membrane lipids and gangliosides are also glycosylated, and all secreted mucins are carbohydrate-rich glycoproteins. Thus the scope of potential lectin–carbohydrate interactions is quite wide. However, not all lectins react with the epithelium, and even those that do react vary in their ability to recognize and bind to specific types of carbohy- drate receptors. Because lectin reactions are quite specific, it is imper- ative that the correct carbohydrate structures be present on the surface of the gut mucosa. Factors that are known to influence lectin activity are summarized in Box 43.1. Lectins can have a variety of biological effects, including induction of mitosis in lymphocytes, cellular agglutination via cross-linking of membrane sugars, preferential agglutination of malignant cells, pre- cipitation of polysaccharides and glycoproteins, and activation of com- plement pathways. The variety of reported effects resulting from the ingestion of dietary lectins is summarized in Table 43.8. Most lectins in the U.S. diet are resistant to breakdown during gut passage, so they are bound and endocytosed by epithelial cells. Endocytosed lectins act as powerful exogenous growth factors for the

As a general rule, blood group B is most plagued by chronic or recur- rent urinary tract infections. Type AB is next on the susceptibility list, followed by type A. Type Os are the most protected.

small intestine, and they can induce dramatic shifts in its bacterial flora and interfere with its hormone secretion. In addition, lectins that are transported across the gut wall into the systemic circulation can mod- ulate the body’s hormone balance, metabolism, and health. In contrast to dietary proteins, lectins resist degradation in the small intestine and are also resistant to breakdown by most gut bacteria. Thus most lectins survive, at least in part, the passage through the digestive tract in an immunologically and functionally intact form.145 Although lectin binding is most commonly studied in the small intestine, similar binding can occur throughout the entire digestive tract, from the stomach to the distal colon. However, surface glycosyla- tion varies in the different functional parts of the gut, so lectin binding is not uniform in the digestive tract. Binding of lectins and their endo- cytosis by enterocytes is more extensive in the colon, where bacterial counts are high. Endocytosis in the small intestine becomes apprecia- ble only in the presence of large numbers of commensal bacteria.146 How prevalent are lectins in the diet? A superficial survey done in the early 1980s implied that they are quite extensively distributed in our food supply.147 In this study, the edible parts of 29 of 88 foods tested, including common salad ingredients, fresh fruits, roasted nuts, and processed cereals, were found to possess significant lectin-like activity as assessed with blood agglutination and bacterial agglutina- tion assays. Lectin content is a prime area of manipulation for the production of transgenic foods,148 so they will probably continue to occupy the attention of nutritionally oriented physicians well into the future.

## Role of ABO Blood Groups

Because ABO blood group is a prime determinant of glycosylation, it is not surprising that a substantial number of food lectins show ABO specificity. However, equally important but not typically recognized is the author’s observation that ABO status appears to influence vari- ability in secondary glycosides, which are not integral to the ABO type of the hosts. These secondary glycosides appear to provide additional conditioning of the mucin manufactured by the particular ABO type, which can explain the apparent effects of panhemagglutinins and other non-ABO specific lectins on one particular ABO type over another. These effects are listed in Table 43.9. The benefit of using the ABO groups as a predictive device in nar- rowing down potential food reactions in sensitive subjects lies in its low cost to the patient and the clinician’s ability to discern interactions that are not easily testable via standard food allergy isolation methods. A useful resource for clinicians seeking more information on lectins is Lectser, the world’s most complete lectin characterization database, available at the principal website.149

# CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF ABO POLYMORPHISM

## The “Blood Type Diet”

The advantage of a low-lectin diet can be exemplified by the best- known application of the ABO polymorphisms, the Blood Type Diet (BTD), popularized by publication in 1997 of the author’s New York Times bestseller Eat Right 4 Your Type. Eat Right 4 Your Type was the first “diet book” that looked at foods as medicine tailored to the individual rather than simply as part of a generic single-purpose mechanism (i.e., weight loss, cholesterol con- trol). Like the very antigens that it uses for its determination, BTD is “nonreducing,” meaning that the food value system is essentially state- less: a food that might cause difficulties in one ABO phenotype may well possess therapeutic value in another, a concept that harkens back to the observation of the Roman philosopher Lucretius: “What is food to one man may be fierce poison to others.”

<!-- chunk -->

## TABLE 43.8 Reported Effects of Dietary Lectins

<!-- chunk -->

## 359CHAPTER 43 Nontransfusion Significance of ABO and ABO-Associated Polymorphisms

The BTD inventories a variety of parameters, including the phys- iological and pathological distinctions between the blood groups as reported in the literature, lectin and agglutinin characterizations (both from the author and from others), and variations in isoagglutinin titer and reactivity with regard to food challenge (both in vitro and in vivo). It also provides specific recommendations regarding foods that should be considered beneficial and should be emphasized and others that may be problematic and might better be avoided. One advantage conferred by the theory is the notion that certain individuals may be better suited to Paleolithic or vegetarian diets. Despite certain locutions and circumlocutions offered by proponents of one system or the other, most clinicians have ample experience with the simple fact that certain patients make better vegetarians or carnivores than others. Conversely, the ability to identify particu- lar individuals at risk of an adverse reaction to high-protein and/or low-carbohydrate diets can lead to actions aimed at the prevention of such consequences. For example, high-protein diets are known to upregulate soluble endothelial adhesion factors,150 whereas a soy-based, lipid-lowering diet is known to decrease endothelial adhesion factors, including vWF, E-selectin, and the intercellular adhesion molecule.151–153 Because indi- viduals with blood group A have been reported to have increased levels of all three endothelial adhesion factors and, perhaps consequently, a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease, a modified Asian and/or Mediterranean plant-based diet would appear ideal for this phenotype. Conversely, in 1998, we examined serum cholesterol levels in a small number of group O subjects after a minimum of 1 month of the BTD recommended for that phenotype.154 Group O individuals following the “Type O Diet” (higher protein, lower carbohydrate) showed a consistent drop in serum cholesterol (n = 14; average 237.3 mg/dL before diet, 200.2 mg/dL with diet); in subjects with elevated serum triglyceride values, the results were more pronounced (n = 6; average 387.1 mg/dL before diet, 168.8 mg/dL with diet). In 2009 D’Adamo reported that sequential breath hydrogen levels (BHL) after lactulose administration varied significantly by ABO blood group and secretor status. Breath hydrogen excretion was significantly higher in group A subjects (n = 35) versus group O (n = 31). Secretor status appeared to influence location and temporality of bacterial over- growth and BHL, with secretors having significantly higher levels on earlier blows (B1: P = 0.027) and nonsecretors having significantly ele- vated BHLs on later blows (B3: P = 0.014, B4: P = 0.013). Adoption of blood group–specific dietary recommendations significantly reduced mean BHLs (n = 40; P = 0.007).155 The BTD has produced an extensive library of works, at various levels of information density. Eat Right 4 Your Type has been trans- lated into more than 60 languages, and well over 6 million individuals follow the system.156 Self-reported outcomes collected via the Internet appear to indicate wide consumer satisfaction with the system: in more than 7000 reports, the basic ABO-based system generated an 85% level of satisfaction. Most interestingly, this percentage was essen- tially unchanged across the individual blood groups. In other words, 85% of the blood type A respondents reported satisfaction with a pre- dominantly plant-based diet, whereas the same percentage of type O individuals reported satisfaction with a high-protein, Paleo-type diet. What this portends for the future of reductionist, one-size-fits-all diet systems remains to be seen.157

## Materia Medica

ABO polymorphism and its clinical expression have led to new or rediscovered applications and contraindications for several traditional naturopathic treatment modalities. The most significant are summa- rized in Table 43.10.


It is our hope that this abbreviated survey provides sufficient infor- mation to persuade the reader that ABO and ABO-related poly- morphisms, in both genotypic and phenotypic expression, exert biological significance far beyond the surface of an erythrocyte and that this expression is worth factoring into the everyday algorithms of a nutritional practice. Perhaps the advent and acceptance of the newly emerging science of “nutrigenomics” might provide the conceptual framework needed to allow the nontransfusion significance of ABO and secretor polymorphism to parse into meaningful scientific dia- logue. At that point, natural medicine could be considered to have the rational beginnings to delivering its long-awaited promise, “Treating the patient, not the disease.”

## 362SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

Wild primates fill up not only on fruit but also on other highly nutritious plant foods. As a result, wild primates weighing one tenth as much as a typical human ingest nearly 10 times the level of vita- min C and much higher amounts of many other vitamins and min- erals. Other differences in the wild primate diet are also important to point out, such as a higher ratio of α -linolenic acid, the essential omega-3 fatty acid, to linoleic acid, the essential omega-6 fatty acid2 (Table 44.1).

<!-- chunk -->

## Humans Versus Primates

Determining what foods are best suited for humans may not be as simple as looking at the diet of wild primates. There are some struc- tural and physiological differences between humans and apes. A larger, more metabolically active brain is one of the key differences. It has been theorized by some evolutionists that a shift in dietary intake of fats was the likely stimulus for the brain growth in ancient humans. The shift itself was likely the result of limited food availability forcing early humans to collect shellfish and hunt grazing mammals such as antelope and gazelle in addition to gathering plant foods. Archeological data support this association—the brains of humans started to grow and become more developed at about the same time as evidence shows an increase of shellfish consumption and the presence of animal bones being butchered with stone tools at early villages. Data also show that the early humans who lived near water sources and ate seafood expe- rienced the biggest brain change. An increased intake of the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) found primarily in fish and seafood, but also in wild game, was perhaps the largest dietary contrib- utor to brain growth. The thought is that a higher DHA intake led to bigger brains in humans. And, with a bigger brain, early humans were able to engage in more complex social behavior, which led to improved foraging and hunting tactics, which in turn led to even higher-quality food intake, fostering additional brain evolution. In contrast, inland prehistoric humans did not have sufficient access to DHA, and the Neanderthals chose to focus on low-DHA-content meat from larger animals. As a result, both got stuck with limited brain capacity and died off. The importance of DHA to brain function relates to its role in the composition of brain-cell membranes, and as a result, it influences the following: • The fluidity of brain cell membranes • Neurotransmitter synthesis • Neurotransmitter binding • Signal transmission • The activity of key enzymes that break down neurotransmitters like serotonin, epinephrine, dopamine, and norepinephrine Although improved dietary quality alone cannot fully explain why human brains grew, it appears to have played a critical role. A large part of the brain is made up of omega-3 fatty acids. In fact, 60% of the fats in the brain are omega-3 fatty acids, with DHA being the main type. A higher intake of DHA during pregnancy and early childhood was especially important to human evolution. DHA is critical for healthy brain development both in the womb and in early childhood. About 75% of brain cells are in place before birth, and the other 25% are in place by the age of 1 year—making DHA an essential nutrient for both pregnant mothers and young children. DHA is so important for early brain development that it is now automatically added to baby milk formula, and pregnant women should also strive to get sufficient levels by regularly eating fish or taking fish oil supplements. The proper function of the brain and nerves also requires the monounsaturated fat oleic acid, the main component of olive oil as well as the chief oil in almonds, pecans, macadamias, peanuts, and avo- cados. Myelin, the protective sheath that covers communicating neu- rons, is composed of 30% protein and 70% fat, with the key fat being oleic acid. Again, the key point is that the right fat has critical effects in the human brain.

## Hunter–Gatherer Diets

Data from anthropologists looking at hunter–gatherer cultures pro- vide much insight as to what humans evolved to eat; however, it is very important to point out that these groups were not entirely free to determine their diets. Instead, their diets were molded by what was available to them. For example, the diet of the Inuit Eskimos is far dif- ferent from that of the Australian aborigines. It may not be appro- priate to answer the question, “What should humans eat?” simply by looking at these studies. Nonetheless, it is important to point out that regardless of whether hunter–gatherer communities relied on animal or plant foods, the rate of diseases of civilization, such as heart disease and cancer, is extremely low in such communities.3 It should also be pointed out that the meat that our ancestors con- sumed was much different from the meat found in supermarkets today. Domesticated animals have always had higher fat levels than their wild counterparts, but the desire for tender meat has led to the breeding of cattle that produce meat with a fat content of 25% to 30% or more, compared with less than 4% for free-living animals and wild game. In addition, the type of fat is considerably different. Domestic beef contains primarily saturated fats and virtually undetectable amounts of omega-3 fatty acids. In contrast, the fat of wild animals contains more than five times more polyunsaturated fat per gram and has a good amount of beneficial omega-3 fatty acids (approximately 4%).4 Considerable evidence indicates that a high intake of red or pro- cessed meat increases the risk of mortality. For example, in a cohort study of half a million people aged 50 to 71 years at baseline, men and women in the highest versus lowest quintile of red and processed meat intake had elevated risks for overall mortality.5 In another prospective cohort study, subjects were followed from 1980 (women) or 1986 (men) until 2006. Low-carbohydrate diets, either animal-based (emphasizing animal sources of fat and protein) or vegetable-based (emphasizing vegetable sources of fat and protein), were computed from several validated food-frequency questionnaires assessed during follow-up.6 A low-carbohydrate diet based on animal sources was associated with higher all-cause mortality in both men and women, whereas a vegetable-based, low-carbohydrate diet was asso- ciated with lower all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality rates.

## The Importance of a Plant-Based Diet

## 363CHAPTER 44 Nutritional Medicine

diet–disease connection: (1) a diet rich in plant foods (i.e., whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables) is protective against many dis- eases that are extremely common in so-called Western society, and (2) a diet providing a low intake of plant foods is a causative factor in the development of these diseases and provides conditions under which other causative factors are more active. Early naturopathic pioneers were strong proponents of plant-based diets—one of the health move- ments that helped define the profession was the vegetarian Grahamists. The founding leaders of the profession, Henry Lindlahr, MD, and Benedict Lust, ND, both advocated whole-foods vegetarian diets.

## The Pioneering Work of Burkitt and Trowell

Much of the link between diet and chronic disease originated from the work of two medical pioneers, Denis Burkitt, MD, and Hugh Trowell, MD, authors of Western Diseases: Their Emergence and Prevention, first published in 1981.7 Although now extremely well recognized, their work is actually a continuation of the landmark work of Weston A. Price, a dentist and author of Nutrition and Physical Degeneration. In the early 1900s, Dr. Price traveled the world, observing changes in teeth and palate (orthodontic) structure as various cultures discarded tra- ditional dietary practices in favor of a more “civilized” diet. Price was able to follow individuals as well as cultures over 20 to 40 years and carefully documented the onset of degenerative diseases as their diets changed. On the basis of extensive studies examining the rate of dis- eases in various populations (epidemiological data) and his own obser- vations of primitive cultures, Price formulated the following sequence of events: First stage. In cultures consuming a traditional diet consisting of whole, unprocessed foods, the rate of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer is quite low. Second stage. Commencing with eating a more “Western” diet, there is a sharp rise in the number of individuals with obesity and diabetes. Third stage. As more and more people abandon their traditional diet, conditions that were once quite rare become extremely common. Examples are constipation, hemorrhoids, varicose veins, and appendicitis. Fourth stage. Finally, with full westernization of the diet, other chronic degenerative or potentially lethal diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout, become extremely common. Since Burkitt and Trowell’s pioneering research, a virtual land- slide of data has continually verified the role of the Western diet as the key factor in nearly every chronic disease, especially obesity and diabetes. Box 44.1 lists diseases with convincing links to a diet low in plant foods. Many of these now-common diseases were extremely rare before the 20th century.

# TRENDS IN U.S. FOOD CONSUMPTION

During the 20th century, food consumption patterns changed dramat- ically (Table 44.2). Total dietary fat intake rose from 32% of the cal- ories in 1909 to 43% by the end of the century. Overall carbohydrate intake dropped from 57% to 46%, and protein intake remained stable at about 11%. Compounding these detrimental changes are the individual food choices accounting for the changes. The biggest changes include sig- nificant rises in the consumption of meat, fats and oils, and sugars and sweeteners in conjunction with the decreased consumption of noncit- rus fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain products. The greatest change in the past 100 years of human nutrition is the switch from a diet with a high level of complex carbohydrates, as found naturally occurring in grains and vegetables, to a tremendous and dramatic increase in the

number of calories consumed from simple sugars. Currently, more than half of the carbohydrates being consumed are in the form of sugars (sucrose, corn syrup, etc.) being added to foods as sweetening agents. High consumption of refined sugars is linked to many chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.

# THE GOVERNMENT AND NUTRITION EDUCATION

Throughout the years, various governmental organizations have published dietary guidelines, but the recommendations of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have become the most widely known. In 1956 the USDA published Food for Fitness—A Daily Food Guide. This became popularly known as the Basic Four Food Groups. The Basic Four comprised the following: 1. The Milk Group: milk, cheese, ice cream, and other milk-based foods 2. The Meat Group: meat, fish, poultry, eggs, with dried legumes and nuts as alternatives 3. The Fruit and Vegetable Group 4. The Breads and Cereals Group One of the major problems with the Basic Four Food Groups model was that it graphically suggested that the food groups were equal in health value. The result was overconsumption of animal products, dietary fat, and refined carbohydrates and insufficient consumption of fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and legumes. This in turn resulted in diets being responsible for many premature deaths, chronic diseases, and increased healthcare costs. As the Basic Four Food Groups became outdated, various other governmental and medical organizations developed guidelines of their own, designed to reduce the risk of either a specific chronic degenera- tive disease, such as cancer or heart disease, or of all chronic diseases. To create a new model in nutrition education, the USDA first pub- lished the “Eating Right Pyramid” in 1992. It received harsh criticisms from numerous experts and other organizations. One big question that should be asked is, “Is it appropriate to have the USDA making these recommendations?” After all, the USDA serves two somewhat conflicting roles: (1) it represents the food industry, and (2) it over- sees educating consumers about nutrition. Many people believe that the pyramid was weighted more toward dairy products, red meat, and grains because of influence from the dairy, beef, and grain farming and processing industries. In other words, the pyramid was designed not to improve the health of Americans but, rather, to promote the USDA agenda of supporting multinational agrifoods giants (Fig. 44.1). One of the main criticisms of the Eating Right Pyramid is that it does not stress strongly enough the importance of quality food choices. For example, the bottom of the pyramid represents the foods that the USDA thinks should make up the bulk of a healthy diet: the Bread, Cereal, Rice, and Pasta Group. Eating 6 to 11 servings a day from this group is supposedly the path to a healthier life. In this way, the pyra- mid sets a person up for insulin resistance, obesity, and adult-onset diabetes if he or she consistently chooses refined rather than whole- grain products in this important category. This is one example of how the Eating Right Pyramid does not take into consideration how quickly blood glucose levels rise after eating a certain type of food—an effect referred to as the food’s glycemic index (GI). The GI is a numerical scale used to indicate how fast and how high a particular food raises blood glucose (blood sugar) levels. There are two versions of the GI, one based on a standard of comparison with glucose as 100, and the other based on white bread. Foods are tested against the results of the selected standard. Foods with a lower GI create a slower rise in blood sugar, whereas foods with a higher GI create a faster rise in blood sugar. One of the major problems with the Eating Right Pyramid is that the GIs of some of the foods that the pyramid is directing Americans to eat more of, such as breads, cereals, rice, and pasta, can greatly stress blood sugar control, especially if derived from refined grains, and are now being linked to an increased risk for obesity, diabetes, and cancer. As a result, the goal of the Eating Right Pyramid was to improve the health of Americans and, hopefully, slow down the growing trend toward obe- sity and diet-related disease, but because of poor individual food choices within the categories, the pyramid has only worsened the problem. On June 2, 2011 the USDA unveiled a new food icon, MyPlate, to replace the food pyramid (see Fig. 44.2). This simplified illustration is designed to help Americans make healthier food choices. MyPlate is the first step in a multiyear effort to raise awareness and educate consumers about eating more healthfully. The initial launch came with some simple recommendations: • Balance calories. • Enjoy your food, but eat less. • Avoid oversized portions. Milk, Yogurt, & Cheese Group Fats, Oils, & Sweets (Use sparingly) Meat, Poultry, Fish, Dry Beans, Eggs, & Nuts Group 2-3 Servings2-3 Servings Vegetable Group 3-5 Servings Fruit Group 3-5 Servings Bread, Cereal, Rice, & Pasta Group 6-11 Servings

Foods to Increase • Make half your plate fruits and vegetables. • Make at least half your grains whole grains. • Switch to fat-free or low-fat (1%) milk. Foods to Reduce • Compare sodium in foods like soup, bread, and frozen meals and choose the foods with lower numbers. • Drink water instead of sugary drinks. However, this new campaign does not appear to be any more suc- cessful than prior efforts.

# THE OPTIMAL HEALTH FOOD PYRAMID

Based on existing evidence, we have created the Optimal Health Food Pyramid (Fig. 44.3). The major difference from the USDA pyramid is that the Optimal Health Food Pyramid incorporates the best of two of the most healthful diets ever studied—the traditional Mediterranean diet (see later discussion) and the traditional Asian diet. In addition, the Optimal Health Food Pyramid more clearly defines what the healthy components within the categories are and stresses the impor- tance of vegetable oils and regular fish consumption as part of a health- ful diet. Appendix 9 provides a patient handout that clearly defines the components of the Optimal Health Food Pyramid. The Optimal Health Food Diet is based on the following nine principles: 1. Eat a “rainbow” assortment of fruits and vegetables. 2. Reduce exposure to foods contaminated with pesticides and metals. 3. Eat to support blood sugar control. 4. Do not overconsume animal foods. 5. Eat the right types of fats. 6. Keep salt intake low and potassium intake high. 7. Avoid food additives. 8. Take measures to reduce foodborne illness. 9. Drink sufficient amounts of water each day.

## 1. Eat a “Rainbow” Assortment of Fruits and Vegetables

A diet rich in fruits and vegetables is the best bet for preventing vir- tually every chronic disease. That fact has been established time and again in scientific studies on large numbers of people. The evidence in support of this recommendation is so strong that it has been endorsed by U.S. government health agencies and by virtually every major med- ical organization, including the American Cancer Society. “Rainbow” simply means that selecting colorful foods—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple—provides the body the full spectrum of pigments with powerful antioxidant effects as well as the nutrients it needs for optimal function and protection against disease (Box 44.2). Fruits and vegetables are so important in the battle against can- cer that some experts have said, and we believe, that cancer is a result of a “maladaptation” over time to a reduced level of intake of fruits and vegetables. As a study published in the medical journal Cancer Causes and Control put it in 1991, “Vegetables and fruit contain the anticarcinogenic cocktail to which we are adapted. We abandon it at our peril.”8 A vast number of substances found in fruits and vegetables are known to protect against cancer. Some experts refer to these as “chemopreventers,” but they are better known to many as phytochem- icals (Table 44.3). Phytochemicals include pigments such as carotenes, chlorophyll, and flavonoids; dietary fiber; enzymes; vitamin-like com- pounds; and other minor dietary constituents. Although they work in harmony with antioxidants like vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium, phytochemicals exert considerably greater protection against can- cer than these simple nutrients. Among the most important groups of phytochemicals are pigments such as chlorophyll, carotenes, and flavonoids.

## Additives

In the United States more than 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides and herbicides are sprayed on or added to food crops each year. That is roughly 5 lb of pesticides for each man, woman, and child. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the correlation between exposure to pesticides and the development of a wide spectrum of pathologies, ranging from obesity to type 2 diabetes, low sperm counts, neurodegenerative diseases, and, of course, cancer. One of the closest links is the plight of the American farmer. The lifestyle of farmers is generally healthy: compared with city dwellers, farmers have access to

lots of fresh food; they breathe clean air, work hard, and have a lower rate of cigarette smoking and alcohol use. Yet studies show that farm- ers have a higher risk of lymphomas; leukemias; and cancers of the stomach, prostate, brain, and skin.9 Exposure to pesticides is the pri- mary reason for this occurrence. Perhaps the most problematic pesticides are the family of halo- genated hydrocarbons, such as 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDE), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), pentachlorophenol (PCP), dieldrin, and chlordane. These chemicals persist almost indef- initely in the environment. A similar pesticide, dichlorodiphenyltri- chloroethane (DDT), has been banned for nearly 30 years, yet it can still be found in soil and root vegetables such as carrots and potatoes. The human body also has a tough time detoxifying and eliminating these compounds. Instead, they end up being stored in fat cells. Moreover, inside the body, these chemicals can act like the hormone estrogen. They are thus suspected as a major cause of the growing epidemic of estrogen-related health problems, including breast cancer.10 Some evi- dence also suggests that these chemicals raise the risk of lymphomas, leukemia, and pancreatic cancer as well as play a role in low sperm counts and reduced fertility in men.11 Avoiding pesticides is especially important in children of preschool age. Children are at greater risk for two reasons: they eat more food relative to body mass, and they consume more foods higher in pes- ticide residues—such as juices, fresh fruits, and vegetables. A recent University of Washington study12 that analyzed levels of breakdown products of organophosphorus pesticides (a class of insecticides that disrupt the nervous system) in the urine of 39 urban and suburban children aged 2 to 4 years found that concentrations of pesticide metabolites were six times lower in the children who ate organic fruits and vegetables than in those who ate conventional produce. After conducting an analysis of USDA pesticide residue data for all pesticides for 1999 and 2000, the Consumers Union13 warned parents of small children to limit or avoid conventionally grown foods known to have high pesticide residues, such as cantaloupes, green beans (canned or frozen), pears, strawberries, tomatoes (Mexican grown), and winter squash. The University of Washington study added apples to this list.

## Recommendations for Patients to Avoid Pesticides and Metals

<!-- chunk -->

## in the Diet

Patients can avoid consuming pesticides in their foods by following these recommended practices: 1. Do not overconsume foods that have a tendency to concentrate pesticides, such as animal fat, meat, eggs, cheese, and milk. 2. Buy organic produce, which is grown without the aid of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. Although less than 3% of the total pro- duce in the United States is grown without pesticides, organic pro- duce is widely available. 3. Develop a good relationship with your local grocery store produce manager. Explain your desire to reduce your exposure to pesti- cides and waxes. Ask what measures the store takes to ensure that pesticide residues are within approved limits. Ask where the store obtains its produce; make sure the store is aware that foreign pro- duce is much more likely to contain excessive levels of pesticides as well as pesticides that have been banned in the United States. 4. Decrease exposure to arsenic. If eating chickens, ensure they were not treated with arsenic compounds. If eating rice, be sure it was not grown with water contaminated with arsenic. 5. Try to buy local produce in season. 6. Peeling off the skin or removing the outer layer of leaves of some produce may be all you need to do to reduce pesticide levels. The downside is that many of the nutritional benefits of fruits and veg- etables are concentrated in the skin and outer layers. An alternative measure is to remove surface pesticide residues, waxes, fungicides, and fertilizers by soaking the item in a mild solution of additive-free soap such as Ivory or pure castile soap. All-natural, biodegradable cleansers are also available at most health food stores. To use, spray the food with the cleanser, gently scrub, and rinse.

## 3. Eat to Support Blood Sugar Control

Refined sugars, white flour products, and other sources of simple sug- ars are quickly absorbed into the bloodstream, causing a rapid rise in blood sugar. In response, the body boosts secretion of insulin by the pancreas. High-sugar, “junk-food” diets definitely lead to poor blood sugar regulation, obesity, and ultimately, type 2 diabetes and heart dis- ease.14–16 The stress on the body that they cause, however, including secretion of too much insulin, can promote the growth of cancer and increase the risk of heart disease as well. As already discussed, the GI of a food refers to how quickly blood sugar levels will rise after it is eaten. However, the GI does not tell how much of that carbohydrate is in a typical serving of a particular food,

<!-- chunk -->

## 367CHAPTER 44 Nutritional Medicine

so another tool is needed. The glycemic load (GL) is a relatively new way to assess the effect of carbohydrate consumption that takes the GI into account but gives a fuller picture of the effect that a food has on blood sugar levels than GI alone. A GL of 20 or more is high, a GL of 11 to 19 inclusive is medium, and a GL of 10 or less is low. For exam- ple, beets have a high GI but a low GL. Although the carbohydrate in beet root has a high GI, the amount of carbohydrate is low, so a typical serving of cooked beet root has a relatively low GI (about 5). Thus, as long as one eats a reasonable portion of a low-GL food, the effect on blood sugar is acceptable, even if the food has a high GI. For example, an individual with diabetes can enjoy some watermelon (GI 72) as long as he or she keeps the serving size reasonable; the GL for 120 g watermelon is only 4. In essence, foods that are mostly water (e.g., apple, water- melon), fiber (e.g., beet root, carrot), or air (e.g., popcorn) will not cause a steep rise in blood sugar even if their GIs are high as long as portion sizes are moderate. To help design a healthy diet, we provide a list of the GI, fiber content, and GL of common foods in Appendix 7.

## 4. Reduce Intake of Meat and Other Animal Foods

Study after study seems to indicate that the higher the intake of meat and other animal products, the higher is the risk of heart disease and cancer, especially the major cancers like those of the colon, breast, prostate, and lung, whereas a diet focusing on plant foods exerts the opposite effect.17,18 There are many reasons for this association. Meat lacks the anti- oxidants and phytochemicals that protect from cancer. At the same time, it contains lots of saturated fat and other potentially carcinogenic compounds—including pesticide residues, heterocyclic amines, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which form when meat is grilled, fried, or broiled. The more well done the meat, the higher is the level of amines. Some proponents of a diet high in meats claim that people should eat the way their “caveman” ancestors did. That argument does not really hold up. As already discussed, the meat of the wild animals that early humans consumed had a fat content of less than 4%. The demand for tender meat has led to the breeding of cattle whose meat contains 25% to 30% or more fat. Domestic beef contains primarily saturated fats and virtually no beneficial omega-3 fatty acids (discussed later), whereas the fat of wild animals contains more than five times the poly- unsaturated fat per gram and has substantial amounts (about 4%) of omega-3 fatty acids. Range-fed animals also contain 10 times as much conjugated lin- oleic acid (CLA) as grain-fed animals. CLA is a slightly altered form of the essential fatty acid linoleic acid. It occurs naturally in meat and dairy products. CLA was discovered in 1978, when researchers at the University of Wisconsin were looking for cancer-causing compounds that result from cooking. Instead, they found CLA, which appears to be an anticancer compound. Preliminary studies show that CLA might reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer.19 Particularly harmful to human health are cured or smoked meats, such as ham, hot dogs, bacon, and jerky, that contain sodium nitrate and/or sodium nitrites—compounds that keep the food from spoiling but that dramatically raise the risk of cancer. These chemicals react with amino acids in foods in the stomach to form highly carcinogenic compounds known as nitrosamines. Research in adults makes a convincing argument to avoid these foods. Even more compelling is the evidence linking consumption of nitrates to a significantly increased risk of the major childhood cancers (leukemias, lymphomas, and brain cancers), as follows: • Children who eat 12 hot dogs per month have nearly 10 times the risk of leukemia compared with children who do not eat hot dogs.20 • Children who eat hot dogs once a week double their chances of brain tumors; eating hot dogs twice a week triples the risk.20

• Pregnant women who eat two servings per day of any cured meat have more than double the risk of bearing children who have brain cancer.21 • Children who eat the most ham, bacon, and sausage have three times the risk of lymphoma.20 • Children who eat ground meat once a week have twice the risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia compared with those who eat none; eating two or more hamburgers weekly triples the risk.20 Fortunately, vegetarian alternatives to these standard components of the American diet are now widely available, and many of them taste quite good. Consumers can find soy hot dogs, soy sausage, soy bacon, and even soy pastrami at their local health food stores as well as in many mainstream grocery stores.

## 5. Eat the Right Type of Fats

There is no room for debate: a diet high in fat, particularly saturated fat and cholesterol, has been linked to numerous health issues, including cancer. However, just as important as the amount of fat is the type of fat consumed. The goal is to decrease total fat intake (especially intake of saturated fats, trans fatty acids, and omega-6 fats) while increasing the intake of omega-3 fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids. What makes a fat “bad” or “good” has a lot to do with the function of fats in the body’s cellular membranes. Membranes are made mostly of fatty acids. What determines the type of fatty acid present in the cell membrane is the type of fat consumed. A diet composed mostly of saturated fat, animal fatty acids, and trans fatty acids (from margarine, shortening, and other sources of hydrogenated vegetable oils) and high in cholesterol results in membranes that are much less fluid in nature than a diet with optimal levels of unsaturated fatty acids. Modern pathology clearly indicates that an alteration in cell membrane func- tion is the central factor in the development of virtually every disease. As it relates to diabetes, abnormal cell membrane structure due to eat- ing the wrong types of fats leads to impaired action of insulin. Without a healthy membrane, cells lose their ability to hold water, vital nutrients, and electrolytes. They also lose their ability to commu- nicate with other cells and to be controlled by regulating hormones, including insulin. Without the right type of fats in cell membranes, cells simply do not function properly. Considerable evidence indicates that cell membrane dysfunction is a critical factor in the development of many diseases. The type of dietary fat profile that is linked to many diseases is an abundance of saturated fat and trans fatty acids (hydrogenated vege- table oils) along with a relative insufficiency of monounsaturated and omega-3 fatty acids. One of the key reasons appears to be that because dietary fat determines cell membrane composition, such a dietary pat- tern leads to reduced membrane fluidity, which in turn causes reduced insulin binding to receptors on cellular membranes and/or reduced insulin action. Particularly harmful to cell membrane function are margarine, vegetable oil shortening, and other foods containing trans fatty acids and partially hydrogenated oils. These “unnatural” forms of fatty acids interfere with the body’s ability to use important essential fatty acids and are now linked to an increased risk for heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Just the opposite effect has been shown for diets high in monounsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids. One diet that appears to be representative of a way of eating that provides an optimal intake of the right types of fat is the traditional Mediterranean diet—a term with a specific meaning. It reflects food patterns typical of some Mediterranean regions in the early 1960s, such as Crete, parts of Greece, and southern Italy. The traditional Mediterranean diet has shown tremendous benefit in fighting heart disease and cancer as well as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.22 It has the following characteristics: • Olive oil is the principal source of fat. • It centers on an abundance of plant food (fruit, vegetables, breads, pasta, potatoes, beans, nuts, and seeds). • Foods are minimally processed, and there is a focus on seasonally fresh and locally grown foods. • Fresh fruit is the typical daily dessert; sweets containing concen- trated sugars or honey are consumed a few times per week at the most. • Dairy products (principally cheese and yogurt) are consumed daily in low to moderate amounts. • Fish is consumed on a regular basis. • Poultry and eggs are consumed in moderate amounts (1–4 times weekly) or not at all. • Red meat is consumed in low amounts. • Wine is consumed in low to moderate amounts, normally with meals. Olive oil consists not only of the monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid; it also contains several antioxidant agents that may also account for some of its health benefits. Olive oil is particularly valued for its protection against heart disease. It lowers harmful low-density lipopro- tein (LDL) cholesterol and increases the level of protective high-den- sity lipoprotein cholesterol. It also helps circulating LDL cholesterol from becoming damaged by free radicals23,24 and has been proven to contribute to better control of the elevated blood triglycerides that are so common in diabetes. However, it is not only olive oil that produces these benefits—frequent nut consumption is also quite beneficial to health. The Prevention With the Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) study is recognized worldwide as a landmark study that marked a turning point in the dietary prevention of chronic diseases because it was not an epidemiological study but a randomized trial. This study showed that when the Mediterranean diet was supplemented with the free provision of either extra virgin olive oil or mixed tree nuts, this intervention reduced the risk of having a cardiovascular event by 30% after 5 years of intervention.25

## 6. Keep Salt Intake Low and Potassium Intake High

The electrolytes—potassium, sodium, chloride, and magnesium—are mineral salts that can conduct electricity when dissolved in water. For optimal health, it is important to consume these nutrients in the proper balance. Too much sodium in the diet from salt (sodium chlo- ride) can disrupt this balance. Many people know that a high-sodium, low-potassium diet can cause high blood pressure and that doing the opposite can lower blood pressure,26,27 but not as many are aware that the former diet also raises the risk of cancer.28 In modern Western society, only 5% of sodium intake comes from the natural ingredients in food. Prepared foods contribute 45% of our sodium intake; 45% is added in cooking, and another 5% is added as a condiment. Patients can reduce their salt intake by following these tips: 1. Take the salt shaker off the table. 2. Omit added salt from recipes and food preparation. 3. If you absolutely must have the taste of salt, try the salt substitutes such as NoSalt and Nu-Salt. These products are made with potas- sium chloride and taste very similar to sodium chloride. 4. Learn to enjoy the flavors of unsalted foods. 5. Try flavoring foods with herbs, spices, and lemon juice. 6. Read food labels carefully to determine the amounts of sodium. Learn to recognize ingredients that contain sodium: salt, soy sauce, salt brine, and any ingredient with “sodium” in its name (such as monosodium glutamate) or “baking soda” (sodium bicarbonate). 7. In reading labels and menus, look for words that signal high sodium content, such as smoked, barbecued, pickled, broth, soy sauce,

teriyaki, Creole sauce, marinated, cocktail sauce, tomato base, Par- mesan, and mustard sauce. 8. Do not eat canned vegetables or soups, which are often extremely high in sodium. 9. Choose low-salt (reduced-sodium) products when available. Most Americans have a potassium:sodium (K:Na) ratio of less than 1:2. In other words, they ingest twice as much sodium as potassium. However, experts believe that the optimal dietary potassium:sodium ratio is greater than 5:1—10 times higher than the average intake. However, even this may not be optimal. A natural diet rich in fruits and vegetables can easily produce much higher K:Na ratios because most fruits and vegetables have a K:Na ratio of at least 50:1. The aver- age K:Na ratios for several common fresh fruits and vegetables are as follows: • Carrots: 75:1 • Potatoes: 110:1 • Apples: 90:1 • Bananas: 440:1 • Oranges: 260:1

## 7. Avoid Food Additives

Food additives are used to prevent spoiling or to enhance flavor; they include such substances as preservatives, artificial colors, artificial fla- vorings, and acidifiers. Although the government has banned many synthetic food additives, it should not be assumed that all the additives currently used in the U.S. food supply are safe. Many synthetic food additives that are being linked to such diseases as depression, asthma or other allergy, hyperactivity or learning disabilities in children, and migraine headaches remain in use.29–32 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of more than 2800 different food additives. It is estimated that the per-capita daily consumption of these food additives is approximately 13 to 15 g. This amount is astounding and leads to many questions. Which food additives are safe? Which should be avoided? An extremist might argue that no food additive is safe. However, many food addi- tives fulfill important functions in the modern food supply. Many compounds approved as additives are natural in origin and possess health-promoting properties, whereas others are synthetic compounds with known cancer-causing effects. Obviously, the most sensible approach is to focus on whole, natural foods and avoid foods that are highly processed. An illustration of the problem with food additives is one of the most widely used synthetic food colors: Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act yel- low dye no. 5, or tartrazine. Tartrazine is added to almost every pack- aged food as well as to many drugs, including some antihistamines, antibiotics, steroids, and sedatives. In the United States, the average daily per-capita consumption of certified dyes is 15 mg, of which 85% is tartrazine; among children, consumption is usually much higher. Although the overall rate of allergic reactions to tartrazine is quite low in the general population, allergic reactions to tartrazine are extremely common (20%–50%) in individuals sensitive to aspirin as well as other allergic individuals. Like aspirin, tartrazine is a known inducer of asthma, hives, and other allergic conditions, particularly in children. In addition, tartrazine, as well as benzoate and aspirin, increases the production of a compound that raises the number of mast cells in the body. Mast cells are involved in producing histamine and other allergic compounds. A person with more mast cells in the body is typically more prone to allergies. For example, an examination of patients with hives shows that more than 95% have a higher-than-normal number of mast cells. In studies using provocation tests to determine sensitivity to tartra- zine and other food additives in patients with hives, results have ranged from 5% to 46%. Diets eliminating tartrazine as well as other food additives in sensitive individuals have, in many cases, been shown to be of great benefit in patients with hives and other allergic conditions, such as asthma and eczema.

## 8. Take Measures to Reduce Foodborne Illness

Foodborne illness is caused by the consumption of contaminated foods or beverages. Although the food supply in the United States is one of the safest in the world, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 76 million people get sick, more than 300,000 are hos- pitalized, and 5000 Americans die each year from foodborne illness.33 The microbe or toxin enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract and often causes the first symptoms there, so nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea are common symptoms in many foodborne diseases. Most cases of foodborne illness are mild, but seri- ous diarrheal disease or other complications may occur. More than 250 different organisms have been documented as being capable of causing foodborne illness.34 Most of these cases are infec- tions by a variety of bacteria, viruses, and parasites, but poisonings can also occur as a result of ingestion of harmful toxins or chemicals from organisms that have contaminated the food; for example, botulism occurs when the bacterium Clostridium botulinum grows and produces a powerful paralytic toxin in foods. The botulism toxin can produce illness even if the bacteria are no longer present. Most of the common causes of foodborne infections are microor- ganisms frequently present in the intestinal tracts of healthy animals. Meat and poultry can become contaminated during slaughter by con- tact with small amounts of intestinal contents, and fresh fruits and veg- etables can be contaminated if they are washed or irrigated with water that is contaminated with animal manure or human sewage. The most common causes of foodborne infections are the bacteria Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 and a group of viruses called caliciviruses, also known as the Norwalk and Norwalk- like viruses. Undercooked meat and poultry, raw eggs, unpasteur- ized milk, and raw shellfish are the most common sources of these organisms. The foremost measure to reduce the risk of foodborne illness is to cook meat, poultry, and eggs thoroughly. Using a thermometer to measure the internal temperature of meat is a good way to be sure that it is cooked sufficiently to kill bacteria. For example, ground beef should be cooked to an internal temperature of 160°F, poultry should reach a temperature of 185°F, and an egg should be cooked until the yolk is firm. One must also take care to avoid contaminating foods by making sure to wash hands, utensils, and cutting boards after they have been in contact with raw meat or poultry and before they touch another food. Cooked meat should be served on a clean platter, rather than back on one that held the raw meat. To prepare produce, one should wash fresh fruits and vegetables in running tap water. A soft-bristle brush with a little mild soap can be used. Greens can be soaked in cold water as many times as needed to get them clean. If further urging is needed, remind the patient that most of the increase in human longevity is due to public health’s dramatic success in reducing foodborne infections.

## 9. Drink Sufficient Amounts of Water Each Day

Water is essential for life. The average amount of water in the human body is about 10 gallons. The recommendation to drink at least 48 oz of water per day to replace the water that is lost through urination, sweat, and breathing is valid. Even mild dehydration impairs physiological and performance responses.35 Many nutrients dissolve in water so that they can be absorbed more easily in the digestive tract. Similarly, many metabolic processes need to occur in water. Water is a component of

blood and thus is important for transporting chemicals and nutrients to cells and tissues. Each cell is constantly bathed in a watery fluid. Water also carries waste materials from cells to the kidneys for filtering and elimination. Water absorbs and transports heat. For example, the heat produced by muscle cells during exercise is carried by water in the blood to the surface, helping maintain the right temperature balance. The skin cells also release water as perspiration, which helps maintain body temperature. Several factors are thought to increase the likelihood of chronic mild dehydration: a faulty thirst “alarm” in the brain; dissatisfaction with the taste of water; regular exercise that increases the amount of water lost through sweat; living in a hot, dry climate; and consumption of the natural diuretics caffeine and alcohol. There is currently a great concern over the U.S. water supply. It is becoming increasingly difficult to find pure water. Most of the water supply is full of chemicals, including not only chlorine and fluoride, which are routinely added, but also a wide range of toxic organic com- pounds and chemicals, such as PCBs, pesticide residues, and nitrates, and heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and cadmium. It is estimated that lead alone may contaminate the water of more than 40 million Americans. Patients should be encouraged to determine the safety of their tap or well water by contacting their local water companies; most cities have quality assurance programs that perform routine analyses. Patients can simply ask for the most recent analysis.


The dietary guidelines and principles that are detailed in this chap- ter represent our answer to the hotly debated question, “What is the best diet?” After a review of several popular diet in detail as well as thousands of scientific articles on the role of diet in human health, our offering here is based on the evolutionary understanding of what con- stitutes the optimal diet. The bottom line for a health-promoting diet is to reduce the intake of potentially harmful substances—foods laden with empty calories, additives, and artificial sweeteners—and replace them with natural foods, preferably organically grown.

techniques, it fell out of favor as conventional medicine produced its modern successes. Since then, the large corpus of empirical wisdom has been expanded on, and much scientific evidence has contributed to the advancement of balneology as a science. Many institutions are teaching hydrotherapy and balneological techniques, and many spas have wonderful programs for people to use. It is not hard to imagine that the reason this art survived and improved is because it can better people’s health. Balneotherapy’s modern-day roots lie predominantly in European spas, which have some of the longest continuously running histories of all medical institutions. Millions of patients flock to clinics throughout Europe and the world each year for treatment in hydrology depart- ments under the supervision of physicians and their staffs. Such clin- ics provide a variety of balneotherapeutic techniques. Spa therapy is a term used for the combination of balneotherapy and other techniques usually delivered at a resort setting. The effects of spa therapy are influ- enced positively by the pleasure of being in a beautiful setting with the stresses of home and work removed. Medical spas are often in an area where the earth’s elements are present. The pristine air, the ambient temperature, the humidity or amount of light, nourishing food, and exercise can effect a change in the spirit, mind, and body.19

## Balneotherapy in Combination With Other Therapies

Many therapies work well together, such as phototherapy and mud therapy in the treatment of psoriasis. Mud pack therapy, peloidother- apy, massage, soft and osseous tissue manipulation, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, and exercise work together.20 The combination of buoyancy and heat in the water makes sense, for example, in under- water traction bath and massage, which have been shown to reduce the levels of analgesic consumption in patients.18 In my own experiences with patients, hydrotherapy, with and without mud in combination with other treatments, such as naturopathic manipulation, can work like nothing else to help people heal and stay healthy. A multitude of conditions can be treated with balneotherapeutic methods—pain, injury, and dermatologic and rheumatic conditions rank high.2,19,21,22 Under the right conditions and with the right application, balneother- apy stimulates healing and speeds recovery.23

## Physiological Effects

Balneotherapeutics induce direct and indirect actions on the body. The direct actions of balneotherapy take into consideration the physical actions of water on the body, such as hydrostatic pressure, buoyancy, viscosity, and frictional resistance, as well as thermal effects and the chemical and pharmacological effects of the percutaneous absorption of the substance being used.24 Such substances are found in hot spring waters of various types, such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, chlo- ride, sulfate, iron, acid, and radon. Mineral waters contain cations, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, and anions, such as SO 4 –, Cl–, and HCO 3 –. The concentrations of these ions are usually sig- nificantly high (1 g/L). In spring water, levels of nitrogen compounds, such as nitrate, nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen oxide, are very low, and the water is free of or low in bacteria.17 Peat muds, plant preparations, and mineral-containing muds are also used. In Europe, peat baths and peloids are traditional. These applications are used in combination with exercise, aquatics, steam bath, sauna therapy, climatotherapy, physical therapy, and pharmacotherapy, among others, with import- ant consideration being given during treatment to the chronobiologi- cal and circadian-rhythm phases of the body.1,14,20,21,25–27 The indirect actions of balneotherapy arise from the repeated application of therapeutic stimulation, such as climatic exposure to the elements, training effects of exercises, and social and psycholog- ical effects arising from changes in the environment. These elements act as a complex stimulation in a nonspecific manner of the physio- logical function of the organism’s central nervous system, autonomic nervous system, endocrine system, immune system, and so on. The result of these stimulations is a reactive response by the body, leading to activation and improvement of capacity, adaptation, and self-heal- ing potential. In other words, balneotherapy has a normalizing effect on the body’s systems and rhythms.

## Circadian Rhythms

Biorhythms are important in the expression of many conditions.28,29 Sunlight, mealtimes, and seasonal changes are external cues that, together with internal cues such as blood pressure and respiration, affect the hypothalamus or master clock. This part of the brain then signals hormones, enzymes, and other substances to facilitate healing, produce cells, or cause pain and symptoms. It has been shown that different times of day affect the amount of muscle torque potential, body temperature, and clock-gene messenger RNA (mRNA) expres- sion.30 A cold or hot foot bath can induce a rise in the temperature of the oral mucosa of up to 1°C, but the extent of the increase in the oral temperature depends on the body’s reaction to this stimulus, which is influenced by the body’s own internal clock.1 Conditions such as arthritis have pain with varying cycles.31 It is thought that some of these cycles are in synchrony with the moon and the sun. Heart attacks, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis joint pain are early-morning diseases, so medication and treatment can be tailored for different times of day when it is significantly more help- ful and less wasteful when not needed. Serum adrenocorticotropic hormone, prolactin, luteinizing hormones, and immune parameters such as plasma levels of soluble p75 tumor necrosis factor and tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF- α ) vary in 24-hour rhythms in the body.23 These may be affected through balneotherapy, as may melatonin production and expression.24 Melatonin affects the organization and expression of biorhythms and is easily susceptible to oxidative stress. Symptom remission in some conditions coincides with a normal- ization of circadian rhythms promoted by balneotherapeutic treat- ment.32–33 In a European study, the combination of carbon dioxide bath and mud bath was shown to downregulate the systolic pressure in hypertension while having a balancing effect on biological clocks.34 A study on fibromyalgia patients, in whom altered reactivity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis was observed, supported the theory that mud pack therapy works in synergy with antidepressant treatment to decrease pain and improve depression. Balneotherapy can promote the body’s response systems, such as the stress response system, to achieve homeostasis.35

# PEAT THERAPEUTICS

## History

The ancients used peat extract baths, and the antiseptic properties of peat mud were recognized in World War I when it was applied directly to wounds to prevent infection.36 Natives used mud externally and internally. Peat has been used as a medicinal preparation in baths and peloid packs extensively in Europe for the past 200 years. This unique substance contains many chemical constituents that can interact with organic and inorganic compounds.37 The scientific basis for the phys- ical, chemical, and pharmacological effects of peat baths has long been known, and such baths have been used extensively in balneotherapeutic applications in Europe and other parts of the world to treat rheumatic diseases, gynecological disorders, osteoarthritis, lumbago, sciatica, skin diseases, trauma and its sequelae, and many other ailments and afflic- tions. The many substances in peat offer a vast possibility of medicinal cure applications.38–48

## 373CHAPTER 45 Peat Therapeutics and Balneotherapy

It is important to consider the region and origin of the peat being used for medicinal purposes. Low moor peat has been shown to con- tain higher concentrations of nitrous substances, which are thought to contain a higher content of biologically active substances than the high moor peats or peats taken from a shallower depth. It is not just high nitrous content that makes a certain peat more medically useful but also the quality, type, and amount of the biologically active substances it contains that are the determining factors in its medicinal effect. In Germany, these types of peats are now a national resource.

## Skin Response

The skin is a reflex, metabolic, immune, and excretory organ. It affects the autonomic, immune, and circulatory systems and participates in the biosynthesis of not only vitamin D but also acetylcholine, histamine, and serotonin.2,4,10,15 Significantly higher concentrations of minerals and medicaments can be attained in the epidermis with baths than with systemic flooding via the vascular system. There is percutaneous uptake of many substances by the skin but not in large amounts for most nat- ural substances. Permeation into the dermis does occur especially for humic acids, and uptake beyond the stratum corneum is exemplified by measurable urinary excretion rates.49,50 The primary effects of bath components take place within the skin. For instance, hydrogen sulfide acts as a trap for oxygen radicals, func- tioning to reduce inflammation. It is thought that the action comes from the effect of sulfur on the Langerhans cells, which play a role in immune presentation and inflammation modulation. In this way, skin responses can act as transmitter-activating helper functions. Sulfur-containing peat baths demonstrate a pain-reducing and healing effect on rheumatic and degenerative diseases. One reason may be the reduction in the activity of Langerhans cells in producing cytokines that results from the combination of the components within peat and thermal radiation.2,7,15,19,22,50,64

## Physiological Effects

Peat has a structure containing micropores, which accounts for its sponge-like water-carrying capacity and its ability to maintain either hot or cold temperatures. When applied, peat produces a gradient rise or fall in temperature, which is especially desirable in a therapeutic bath. A peat bath formulation influences neuromuscular, endocrine, and pulmonary functions, as well as kidney hemodynamics, depend- ing on the consistency and volume of the partial or full bath.4,10 Peat has well-documented effects, such as tissue dilatation and increases in stroke volume, metabolism, and immunologic stimulation. A peat bath may be preferable to a water bath if one considers the gradient rise and fall of temperature, increased buoyancy, and prevention of heat loss during a bath and the possible positive chemical and pharmaco- logical effects of the constituents of peat.47,49–52 Those who have experienced a therapeutic bath can appreciate the feelings of exhilaration and deep relaxation induced by a bath that con- tains an additive such as peat. The response is affected by the constitu- ents in the water, the temperature of the bath, and the time of day the stimulus is given.52 The patient’s genetics and physical capacity are also important. A peat bath enhances circulation significantly longer than a water bath.53 Microcirculatory vasodilation in the skin has been shown to increase even without hyperthermia. The peripheral and deeper arteries, such as the intrauterine vessels, have shown prolonged increased flow after a peat bath. The effects of peat constituents can occur without heat, but heat increases the effect on the body. The antirheumatic activity of thermal muds has a precise pharma- cological character. Therapy can be prescribed according to the char- acteristics of the mud for specific conditions.47,49 For example, specific muds work better with phototherapy for psoriasis and atopic derma- titis. The length of time that the peat mud has undergone humifica- tion and maturation lends unique characteristics. Maturation of peat muds increases their thermoinsulating, hydration, and, importantly, biochemical characteristics. The sulfoglycolipid content of mature mud differentiates a natural remedy from a specific application with a precise pharmacological character. These sulfoglycolipids are absorbed through the skin and stimulate an antirheumatic effect.54 Several peat substances are able to permeate the skin.50 Their absorption and action have been documented by the comparisons of placebo, water baths, and peat baths using Doppler ultrasound measurement. One study that measured circulation in the uterine artery after bath ther- apy showed that only the peat bath achieved the physiological effect of prolonged vasodilatation and circulation. This effect lasted for sev- eral hours after the treatment. It is thought that absorption of peat substances takes place through the hair follicles and apocrine glands via diffusion and partial pinocytosis.53,55 The fractions of peat compo- nents that penetrate the skin include the humic acid fractions: fulvic, ulmic, and volvic. The excitatory effect of humic acid fractions such as fulvic acid affect the reactivity of the α 2 and D2 receptors of smooth muscle cells.51 The functions of peat in medicinal applications are antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antineoplastic, to name a few.52 Many biochemical effects have been demonstrated in humans and ani- mals. The anti-inflammatory effect of peat mud has been attributed to a sulfoglycolipid associated with a decrease in serum interleukin-1 (IL- 1) in patients with arthritis.56 The effects of mud applications include elevation of protein synthesis, reduction of arachidonic acid, and inhi- bition of inflammatory mediators such as leukotrienes (LTB4), prosta- glandins (PGE-2), and thromboxane. Biological activity is ascribed to peat ingredients, such as sulfur compounds, magnesium, manganese, iron, and humic acids.6,7,10,11,16,19,24 Mud pack therapy decreases the proinflammation factors IL-1 and TNF- α and the radical-mediated peroxidations nitric oxide and myeloperoxidase.57 It also increases serum levels of insulin-like growth factor 1, which is cartilage pro- tective. Humic substances spread widely in nature, and when found mainly in highly degraded peat, they have been shown to have a pro- liferative effect on certain leukocytes. Water-soluble oxihumate, given orally or dermally, increases the proliferative response in mononuclear leukocytes as well as the production and expression of IL-2.2,36,58

## Hyperthermia

The thermal properties of peat mud applications have been shown to be much greater than those of water baths because of the former’s dynamic viscosity, decreased convective cooling, and protective effect on the skin with hot applications.2 Whole-body, extracorporeal, and local infrared applications of hyperthermia have uses in cancer ther- apy. Hyperthermic effects include changes in heat shock proteins (HSPs) and upregulation of heart antioxidant defense proteins such as manganese superoxide dismutase.54 Plasma B-endorphins also rise in response to hot water bathing and may be responsible for the euphoric feeling the bath may bring.24,59 In a study of patients with cancer, hyperthermia was shown to create the same endorphin rise both after sauna bath and in whole-body infrared hyperthermia. Whole-body hyperthermia (WBH) stimulates an increase in T cells, such as monocytes, and absolute numbers of white blood cells.59 Heat increases granulocyte mobility, phagocytic and bactericidal properties, and enzymatic activity.1 There is an increase in homing response to different tissues of lymphocytes, which contributes to antitumor activ- ity. Hyperthermia may increase lymphocyte migration into inflamed tissue or lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes and Peyer patches; this effect may help generate the cellular immune response. TNF- α and IL-6

are regulated by the stimulus of hyperthermia.60–62 HSPs produced by hyperthermia can provide protection against the muscle damage that occurs through a pathological increase in intracellular calcium or uncoupling of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Hyperthermia provides protection against typical damage from reperfusion after ischemia or with excessive exercise damage. Calcium homeostasis, energy loss, increased free radical–mediated reactions, and activation of apoptosis pathways are affected. I use a thermal application of the partial or full peat-additive bath for the treatment of back pain, mus- culoskeletal disorders, skin problems, viral illnesses, and more. The use of heat in the right amount is crucial to treatment efficacy.54,62,63


Care must be exercised in the selection of patients for any type of ther- mal therapy. It is important to allow each patient time to adapt by starting with lower-temperature and shorter-duration treatments first. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) and conditions such as diabetes are not good candidates for WBH. In MS, the excitatory effect on nerves from heat leads to muscle cramp- ing, and in diabetes, heat may lead to an ultimate drop in blood sugar and lightheadedness or loss of consciousness. Peat has many beneficial applications, however, as described here.

## Discopathy

A series of treatments using a peat bath first, followed by manual traction and then a peat pack over the affected area of the spine, has worked marvelously for many of my patients with discopathy. The first thing that is helped is the pain; then there is an improvement in structural integrity and function over time. It is necessary to perform these com- bination treatments three times a week for 3 to 12 weeks if there is significant discopathy.

## Myopathy

Muscle pain is easily treated with a thermal peat bath or peat pack. The increase in circulation is very helpful to muscles and can be valu- able in assisting with osseous manipulation once the muscles are more relaxed.

<!-- chunk -->

## Scoliosis

A peat bath followed by traction of the spine can be very helpful in patients with scoliosis who have back pain. Applying a peat pack over the area of spinal pain can also be useful.

## Arthritis

Peat treatments have shown efficacy for both osteoarthritis and rheu- matoid arthritis. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 or stromelysin-1) are significantly reduced in mud bath patients with osteoarthritis.64 One needs to be careful with acute rheumatoid arthritis because treat- ment may initially aggravate symptoms. Generally, in osteoarthritis, these treatments have been shown in both the literature and my expe- rience to be very beneficial. I have observed significant decreases in swelling and pain with one treatment multiple times in osteoarthritis of the knee and other areas. Generally, a series of either combination bath and pack or single bath or packs is given. Treatments are done every day or two. Emerging research is documenting subjective and objective improvement: serum concentrations of IL-1 β , TNF- α , IL-8, IL-6, and TGF- β , as well as eHsp72, were markedly decreased in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.65 A 2018 study of 33 patients with hand osteoarthritis found a sta- tistically significant benefit of peloid therapy compared with a control group that used only hand exercises.66 Another recent study, this one of 75 patients suffering chronic lat- eral epicondylitis, compared peloid with lateral epicondylitis band and found a statistically significant improvement in subjective measures.67 A particularly interesting study followed more than 100 patients suffering bilateral knee osteoarthritis for a year after completion of a single cycle of treatment. They found statistically significant benefit for all time periods measured.68

## Headache

Chronic headaches can respond to peat bath or to peat packs, espe- cially on the neck or over the cervical spine. One must be careful not to overheat the medulla with the cervical pack treatment; thus mud applications are usually applied below the second cervical vertebra.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hamstring Strain

One of the best applications of bath followed by mud pack is in a ham- string muscle strain. In my experience, athletes even of professional stature have been able to “get back into the game” faster and with more function than they would have with any other type of treatment.

## Ankle Sprain

Partial peat bath immersion of the foot and leg for ankle sprain is very effective. One can see in older sprains the immediate reduction of ecchymosis after the treatment. Patients can perform home treatments in a plastic wastepaper basket on a daily basis for three to six treat- ments. This approach is inexpensive and wonderfully effective.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hypertension

Ambulatory blood pressure has been shown to be affected positively by balneotherapy. After a series of treatments, blood pressure at rest and during standardized levels of ergonomic exercise tends to decrease, as does nocturnal blood pressure. The effect is sustained sometimes per- manently.34 I do not necessarily recommend this treatment for people with hypertension because people with hypertension have more car- diovascular problems that must be considered before they undergo thermal therapy. Generally, people with mild hypertension tolerate the bath better than people with mild hypotension.

## Dermatologic Problems

Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are the dermatologic conditions more commonly treated with peat bath. I, however, have had very good suc- cess in eczema and dermatitis with both peat bath and cream applica- tion. There are multiple possibilities with dermal applications.

<!-- chunk -->

## Scleroderma

A peat bath weekly for 6 to 12 treatments is often a good method of treating scleroderma. Treatment should start with a tolerable tempera- ture and increase slowly over the series of baths so that the patient can adapt.

## Human Papillomavirus

The antiviral effects of topical peat application have been demonstrated on several viruses, including the human papillomavirus. Remission and prevention of implantation of the virus have been described. This is a measure that prevents cancer. The antiviral and antineoplastic effects are thought to be associated with the ability of peat constituents, such as humate, to bind on lectin-binding junctions, thereby blocking viral entry into cells.39,53

## Herpes Virus

Topical treatment of herpes virus skin disease with humic and fulvic fractions of peat has been effective. I have had significant success with

zoster outbreaks. Most important, the topical application of specific peat formulation creams that include humic acids has been very help- ful to some of my patients.

## Infertility

A study on infertility due to immature follicle maturation syndrome demonstrated good results with peat therapy in comparison with phar- macotherapy. In the peat therapy group, the rate of pregnancy was very good, along with a practically nonexistent spontaneous abortion rate, whereas in the pharmacotherapy group, the rate of spontaneous abor- tions was very high.32

# ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS

In the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and spondylitis associated with inflammatory bowel disease, mud therapy showed a decrease in the level of C-reactive protein and an elevation of hemoglobin with a series of treatments. This coincided with a significant reduction in pain and an improvement in function.35,69,70 Peat bath and pack and just the bath are options. If a patient is not a candidate for thermal bath, the packs over the spine can be very useful.

## Hematoma

Organic peat, with its intense vasodilating, anti-inflammatory effects and interactions of ions and mineral properties, enhances the reduction of hematomas. Hematomas treated with thermal peat application have been reported to resolve 50% faster, with no hemosiderin residue, than those treated with only heat applications, which often leaves residues.71 One can see bruising decrease with pack application immediately after the treatment and an enhance- ment in the absorption of the hematoma in significantly less time with bath and pack.

<!-- chunk -->

## Immune Stimulation

Peat baths in combination with hyperthermia demonstrate leukocyte elevation. The immune-stimulating effects of peat baths seen clini- cally correspond to hematologic changes after baths.59 Some effects on immune function are due to heat, and others are due to the constitu- ents in peat. A favorable effect is seen on peripheral blood lymphocytes in atherosclerotic disease after hydrogen/sulfide bath, independent of heat.63 Oxihumate has shown antiviral activity plus immunostimula- tory effect on mononuclear lymphocytes while also having very low or no toxicity, showing promise for the treatment of immunocom- promised patients.36 Immune stimulation or regulation may also be due to increases or changes in immunocyte numbers and function and the balancing of chronobiological rhythms.45,50,71,73,74,78-82 Oral oxi- humate, a potassium salt of oxihumic acid, may show some activity in blocking human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection of MT-2 cells and may be helpful in the topical treatment of herpes virus– induced skin diseases.36 There are also internal uses for constituents of peat. Interestingly, electrophoresis of peat mud showed benefits in patients with duode- nal ulcer, secondary to hormone shifts and normalization of colla- gen metabolism in the duodenal mucosa.15 The internal use of peat fractions, such as humic acid, also increased the proliferation of some T cells.36

## Fibromyalgia

A recent uncontrolled study evaluated 30 days of daily mud bathing at 40°C for 10 min. In addition to subjective reports of clinical improve- ment, objective measures showed a reduced C-reactive protein level and increased telomere length in leukocytes.72

# CLINICAL PROCEDURES

The following procedures should be applied with care and forethought as to diagnosis and the skillful administration of the treatment. These procedures are stimulations to the body, and the thermal effects should not be taken lightly. Patients must be thoroughly screened for con- traindications to treatment before undergoing full-body immersion hyperthermia. The very young and very old should, in general, have very gentle hot or cold stimulation, if any at all. Generally, up to three thermal baths are given per week if they are hot. Thermal therapy can be depleting for some patients, so consideration of the patient’s vitality is primary.

## Hyperthermic Medicinal Peat Bath

The indications for and contraindications to hyperthermic medicinal peat bath are given in Box 45.1.

## Materials

• Peat bath material—I use a commercially available peat bath for- mula containing peat extract, sulfur, wintergreen, and pine oil. • Tub with water thermometer and safety features like handrails and nonslip floor mats • Room with table for perspiration time • Gown or loose-fitting bathing suit • Two sheets • Two wool blankets • Two large towels (one for patient to dry off after treatment and one for head wrap) • Basin with iced water and a hand towel for cooling patient’s face • Digital thermometer or otothermometer for patient monitor- ing (no glass mercury thermometers). A microcomputer-based data-acquisition device that records electrocardiogram (ECG) data and body and ambient temperatures during bathing can be used; this is preferred over individual readings of pulse and oral tempera- ture during the bath because the ECG shows heart function and the clinician is freed from the task of doing the monitoring. This device can be a real-time recorder for the bath.73 • Exhaust fan or room air filter • Footstool for entering and leaving tub The design of the bath area should take into consideration getting patients in and out of the tub and then as directly as possible to a treat- ment table.


1. Before a patient begins treatment, cardiovascular risk and any other conditions that do not respond to or are aggravated by ther- mal therapy should be ruled out. Once the patient has been clas- sified as to risk factors for thermal therapy, the clinician should ask about previous experience with heat in sauna, steam baths, or other types of infrared heating of the tissues. Much depends on the patient’s positive health perspective of the self and of the pain or disease process and the patient’s expectations of the therapeutic bath or application. 2. Make sure the tub is clean and without a ring. Check log book on last treatment and cleaning. If any evidence of an unclean tank is seen, it must be cleaned and disinfected before use: wearing rubber gloves, use a soft scouring sponge to scrub the tank with disinfectant soap, followed by a rinse of hot water. Then spray the surface with 10% bleach solution, and wait 10 minutes before rinsing with very hot water. Alternatively, a nonbleach product that is antimicrobial can be used; there are many choices for prac- titioners to choose from on the market.

3. Fill the tub to 10 inches from the top with water at a temperature of 104°F to 113°F (40°C–45°C). 4. The starting temperature and possible duration of treatment are determined by the condition. 5. The straight water bath should not exceed 110°F. With peat addi- tive, the temperature should not exceed 113°F. 6. Add peat to the bath. 7. Close monitoring during treatment, by means of periodic record- ing of the patient’s pulse, oral temperature, duration of treatment, and tank temperature, is necessary. A quick spike in pulse above the initial pulse within the first minute or minutes is a contrain- dication to treatment. Any adverse reaction, such as tingling of the fingers and toes, nausea, headache, lightheadedness, or ver- tigo, should be evaluated closely and treatment terminated. Some patients may be able to tolerate only a low temperature and short duration for the first treatment. For a patient having a series of treatments, the first treatment is of shorter duration and lower temperature to see how the patient responds. The ability to toler- ate treatments should improve as patients acclimate through their series of treatments. 8. The patient should enter extremely still water slowly. It will not feel as hot if the water is still. 9. Have the patient remain still as he or she becomes fully immersed, to help decrease the sensation of intense heat. 10. To treat the pelvis, use a sitz bath rather than a full bath to concen- trate the effects of the treatment. A full bath after the sitz bath may be useful. 11. The water will cool as time passes, although the peat material will help maintain the temperature. If the starting temperature was 105°F, hot water may have to be added. 12. Bath duration is 8 to 20 minutes and should not exceed 20 min- utes because of the additive pharmacological effects and the ten- dency for hyperthermia to produce increased metabolism and mobilization of chemicals within the body. 13. If the patient becomes fatigued or distressed, the patient should exit the bath to be wrapped in the waiting sheet and wool blankets; do not wait longer to have the patient leave the bath. 14. The patient must have help exiting the tub, from two people who provide lifting support from under the arms on either side. This is a time to be very careful. The clinician should assist the patient by placing an arm under the patient’s arm but having the patient use his or her own ability to walk and get out of the tub. If the clinician tries to lift the patient rather than provide necessary support, the patient’s tendency is to put all his or her weight on the clinician, which is not the goal. After thermal therapy, patients are usually fine to walk, but there is a chance of lightheadedness and, in rare cases, vertigo. Patients may need assistance. 15. Encourage the patient to concentrate on walking on his or her own. 16. Have the patient lie down on a fresh sheet and wrap the patient in both sheets and two or three wool blankets. Cover the head with a towel. 17. Continue to monitor pulse and oral temperature for the duration of the 20-minute perspiration time. 18. Rinse a facecloth in cold water and apply for 10 seconds or longer to the patient’s face every 1 or 2 minutes during both bath and perspiration times. This is extremely important during the bath. 19. Encourage the patient to relax and help the patient focus on pleas- ant matters during the bath. The psychological component of the bath is huge. Having patients think and talk about whatever excites and pleases them about their lives or their future during the difficult part of the bath and the treatment will help them tol- erate the heat and reframe their disease processes. 20. After the patient has been wrapped from head to foot in sheet and wool blankets (it is not necessary to have blankets under the patient because the table is a good insulator that prevents the blankets from getting wet), allow the patient to go through the hydrother- apy reaction of rise and fall in temperature, pulse, and diaphoresis three times. Then remove the patient from the sheets and allow

him or her to return to normal activities. This cyclic reaction is seen with peat baths. With water baths, the patient may or may not sweat after the bath. With peat baths, perspiration is helpful because there is increased absorption or skin effect if perspiration is allowed to continue after the bath. 21. Have the patient rest and replace electrolytes after treatment. The patient should not do a lot of exercise for 12 to 24 hours after a full bath, especially patients with back problems. The patient should promote good posture in the treated area during this time. 22. During the perspiration time, manual traction can be applied to the spine. This is done by grasping the ankles of the supine patient and pulling for 30 to 45 seconds with enough traction that the patient almost slides on the table. Indications for manual traction are disc problems, scoliosis, and impingement; it is a nice addition to any peat bath for any condition because it feels good to the patient. 23. Advise the patient not to shower with soap for up to 12 hours after the peat bath because absorption rates continue after the bath if peat additives have been used. 24. Patients should dry thoroughly and remain covered, warm, and out of drafts for 3 hours after treatment. This precaution can easily be overlooked and cause aggravation if cold stimulation is allowed to happen. More than one reminder to the patient is necessary because people naturally are ready to cool down after a thermal bath. 25. Clean the tank and room thoroughly after use. Log out times of bath and tank cleaning.

## Medicinal Peat Peloid

The indications for and contraindications to this procedure are given in Box 45.2. Care should be taken to avoid burns when performing this application. It is important for the patient to have a strong feeling of warmth without a hot, burning sensation. For a typical application, this heat sensation should last for 20 to 30 minutes and may take a few minutes to start once the mud has been applied. Start timing from the point that the patient first feels warmth. The practitioner should use his or her own touch and sense of heat during the application.

<!-- chunk -->

## Materials

• Peat poultice material—I use Healing Botanical’s professional-use poultice formula containing peat pulp, peat extract, sulfur, winter- green, and pine oil. Hot water should be added to this dry material 3 minutes before application, and the solution should be mixed so it becomes very slightly supersaturated. The point at which it just becomes shiny and has the consistency of mixed cake batter is per- fect. In 1 to 3 minutes, it will be time to apply it to the area being treated. It will still be warm for application because hot water was used. • Three large towels • Small towel • Facecloth • Small blanket to cover hydrocollator • Two small stainless-steel basins • One small paper cup • Hydrocollator (alternatively, hot water bottle can be used)


This is a thermal peat pack meant to be applied for 30 minutes. The procedure is as follows: 1. Make a square layer of peat material about 0.25 inches thick, inches bilaterally over the spine, and 6 to 8 inches long over the spine. If the spinal area is not being treated, the area to be treated is covered. The area of application should be as flat and level as possible. 2. Cover the peat directly with a single-layer warm, wet facecloth. So as to remember the borders of the peloid exactly, ridge the face- cloth around the margins of the peat. 3. Border the wet facecloth–covered peloid with a rolled bath towel, making a quarter turn at the corners while folding the towel to match the margin of the peat. 4. Apply one layer of towel over the facecloth and peat material. Depending on the size and mass of the hydrocollator and its tem- perature, this layer may not be necessary. 5. Put a fresh hydrocollator pack directly over the towel. The hydro- collator should be heated at a gentle boil for 1 hour before use. Do not allow any exposed skin to come in contact with the hydrocol- lator. 6. Cover the hydrocollator pack with a towel or small blanket to insulate it and prevent heat loss. 7. Have a cup of cold water ready to pour on the wet facecloth–cov- ered peloid if it gets too hot. In a good treatment, the peloid pack should get hot enough to require two to three dousings of water or more.

## 378SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

8. As soon as the patient says that the pack is getting too hot, lift up the hydrocollator pack and towel and pour the water directly over the facecloth–covered peloid until cool. Then replace the hydro- collator and coverings. 9. Never leave the patient unattended with the hydrocollator on the mud! 10. Treatment time is approximately 25 to 30 minutes. 11. To remove the peat from the skin after treatment, slide a small basin along the skin under the peat, scraping the peat into the bowl. Wipe the area with a full facecloth wetted with warm water in a gentle twist- ing motion back and forth to remove peat residue from the skin. 12. Cover the treated area after treatment to maintain warmth for hours. The patient’s clothing is fine, but a wool blanket would do a better job.

## Partial-Immersion Medicinal Peat Bath

The indications for and contraindications to this procedure are given in Box 45.3.

<!-- chunk -->

## Materials

• Deep-well basin; a tall plastic wastebasket size works well for the leg. • Medicinal peat bath • Water thermometer • Small towel


1. Fill basin to three-quarters full with 108°F to 114°F water. 2. Add peat to the bath. 3. Have the patient immerse the wrist, ankle, or elbow slowly into the water. Try to immerse the forearm and leg if treating the hand or foot. 4. Keep the body part immersed for 25 minutes. 5. After the treatment, cover the area with a wool sock or clothing and keep covered for 3 hours after treatment. 6. Peat material is often sent home with the patient to do home treat- ments. 7. Clean up the basin by washing with antimicrobial soap. Then disin- fect with 10% bleach solution, and rinse after 10 minutes.

## Combination Full Bath and Peat Pack

<!-- chunk -->

## Materials

The same materials are needed as described for the two preceding applications.


This treatment is used for many conditions. I particularly like it for treatment of vertebral disc injury or degenerative joint conditions. This procedure is also very good for injuries such as hamstring strain. It focuses the balneological effects in the area to which the peloid pack is applied. Performing the peat bath first and then applying the peat pack is the ultimate treatment for those who can tolerate the bath. After the patient steps out of the bath, he or she walks to the table and lies face-up for the regular traction sequence. After three tractions, it is appropriate to turn the patient face-down and apply the peat pack over the spine or area being treated.

# ADVERSE REACTIONS

A study out of Russia evaluated peloid therapy in 128 women pre- senting with bacterial vaginosis and normal prolactin level and women with bacterial vaginosis and concomitant hyperprolactinemia. Although peloid therapy was significantly effective in women suffering vaginosis and normal prolactin levels, the women with elevated prolac- tin levels clearly suffered worse clinical outcomes and an aggravation of their hormone dysfunction.74


As a physician using balneotherapy for 15 years, I have achieved excel- lent results in a large percentage of patients who undergo peat therapy. This therapy often helps other therapies work better. Balneotherapy can be primary or adjunctive. The potential effect on the body should not be taken lightly. I have observed excellent results for the following conditions: • Arthritis • Tenosynovitis • Strains and sprains • Discopathy • Plantar fascitis • Low back pain, including sciatica • Scoliosis • Fractures • Gout • Muscle pain • Dermatologic conditions such as eczema The combination of medical sophistication in diagnosis and appli- cation of various balneological methods provides an excellent tool for physicians to treat in a natural way to the great benefit of their patients.
