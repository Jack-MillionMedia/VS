# Introduction

# Herbs are the most extraordinary plants. Their

# incredible ability to heal on all levels of our being

# never ceases to amaze and inspire me. Through

# my years in practice as a herbalist I have been

# asked many times how I came to be in this

# profession. The story actually begins in my

# childhood.

# Herbal Roots

<!-- chunk -->

## I have loved herbs ever since I was a child. I was intrigued by

<!-- chunk -->

## their delicious scents, all so unique, and their beautiful shapes

<!-- chunk -->

## and forms. Brought up in the country, I loved being surrounded

<!-- chunk -->

## by natural beauty, to the point that I have never been able to live

<!-- chunk -->

## in a town or city. My mother gave me a piece of her garden when

<!-- chunk -->

## I was little so I could grow my own herbs and flowers. This was

<!-- chunk -->

## my favourite occupation.

# Studies in Herbalism

<!-- chunk -->

## In my early twenties, while living in a cottage on a small island

<!-- chunk -->

## off the east coast of England, growing my own food and

<!-- chunk -->

## harvesting as much from the wild as I could, I began to learn

<!-- chunk -->

## about the wild herbs that were growing around me. I realised that

<!-- chunk -->

## the earth provides all the raw ingredients for our health and well

<!-- chunk -->

## being and that herbs have the ability to keep us balanced in body,

<!-- chunk -->

## mind, emotions and spirit, if we can only understand the

<!-- chunk -->

## potential of their gifts to us to its fullest extent. After travelling in

<!-- chunk -->

## many parts of the world, looking for meaning in existence that

<!-- chunk -->

## would guide me to finding the right direction in my life, I

<!-- chunk -->

## resolved to find a place to study herbal medicine. After four

<!-- chunk -->

## years of study I became a member of the National Institute of

<!-- chunk -->

## Medical Herbalists, a professional body of herbalists that has

<!-- chunk -->

## existed since 1864.

<!-- chunk -->

### At work in my herb garden.

<!-- chunk -->

## Once in practice I continued to study, constantly searching for

<!-- chunk -->

## more pointers towards understanding the human organism and

<!-- chunk -->

## the keys to health and harmony, so that I could better serve my

<!-- chunk -->

## patients as well as my family and myself. Over the next few

<!-- chunk -->

## years I studied homoeopathy, aromatherapy, therapeutic massage

<!-- chunk -->

## and counselling. Finally I found Ayurveda, the system that

<!-- chunk -->

## resonated with me more that any other to date. Ayurveda is a

<!-- chunk -->

## body of knowledge and wisdom from India that incorporates a

<!-- chunk -->

## complex system of medicine, as well as guidelines for a way of

<!-- chunk -->

## living that aims, not only for freedom from suffering in mind

<!-- chunk -->

## and body, but for enlightenment itself. Today, I continue to study

<!-- chunk -->

## both herbal medicine and Ayurveda, and to incorporate the

<!-- chunk -->

## wisdom of all I learn into my practice and my writing.

# A Holistic Approach

<!-- chunk -->

## The writing of The Complete Herbal Tutor is motivated by the

<!-- chunk -->

## growing interest in using herbal medicine, in a practical and

<!-- chunk -->

## informed way, amongst healthcare practitioners and lay people

<!-- chunk -->

## alike. There is a great need for contemporary information

<!-- chunk -->

## encompassing a holistic view that acknowledges the intimate

<!-- chunk -->

## connection of mind and body, and promoting health and health

<!-- chunk -->

## education, rather than solely addressing illnesses and how to treat

<!-- chunk -->

## symptoms arising from them. This book provides a practical,

<!-- chunk -->

## easy reference guide to the 150 most commonly used herbs in

<!-- chunk -->

## the modern practice of Western herbal medicine and their uses,

<!-- chunk -->

## and, by this measure, it highlights the great contribution herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## can make to modern medical care.

<!-- chunk -->

## Throughout, I have endeavoured to emphasise how herbs are

<!-- chunk -->

## used most effectively when they are prescribed after the taking of

<!-- chunk -->

## a full case history, with the intention of aiding innate homeostatic

<!-- chunk -->

## mechanisms, while addressing the underlying problems that give

<!-- chunk -->

## rise to health problems including diet and lifestyle.

# Treatment Advice

<!-- chunk -->

## While describing the herbal treatment of over 100 common

<!-- chunk -->

## ailments, The Complete Herbal Tutor is not intended to replace

<!-- chunk -->

## medical care which may require the greater knowledge and

<!-- chunk -->

## expertise of the professional medical herbalist or mainstream

<!-- chunk -->

## healthcare practitioner. The format of the Ailments section in the

<!-- chunk -->

## book follows a system approach, including the main systems

<!-- chunk -->

## affected by common illness, and the health problems covered in

<!-- chunk -->

## the text are those that I have commonly encountered in my

<!-- chunk -->

## practice of nearly forty years as a professional herbalist, and that

<!-- chunk -->

## I consider to be most applicable to treatment using herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

### My dispensary.

# Our Herbal Heritage

<!-- chunk -->

## A conventional medical view might take some exception to

<!-- chunk -->

## aspects of Western herbal philosophy and approach to treatment

<!-- chunk -->

## which may follow some rather unorthodox lines. There may not

<!-- chunk -->

## be much scientific justification for the use of “alterative” or

<!-- chunk -->

## cleansing herbs to clear the body of toxins, or cooling herbs to

<!-- chunk -->

## clear “accumulated heat”. The use of these, however, is integral

<!-- chunk -->

## to the philosophies of ancient and respected systems of medicine,

<!-- chunk -->

## such as the Chinese, Tibetan and Ayurvedic, that have survived

<!-- chunk -->

## almost intact for at least 5000 years, and still provide frameworks

<!-- chunk -->

## for the healthcare of millions of people today. I think we can

<!-- chunk -->

## greatly benefit from the great wisdom and insight of these

<!-- chunk -->

## systems, which provide a background and context for

<!-- chunk -->

## understanding how herbs are used, and for this reason I have

<!-- chunk -->

## included a chapter on Global Herbal Traditions.

# Practical Guidance

<!-- chunk -->

## The hedgerows, our gardens and the shelves of health food

<!-- chunk -->

## shops and pharmacies alike are lined with dazzling arrays of

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs which can be overwhelming to many who feel they lack

<!-- chunk -->

## the necessary knowledge to choose those appropriate to their

<!-- chunk -->

## needs with confidence. The media presentation of herbs has

<!-- chunk -->

## shifted from extolling the virtue of herbs and their “miraculous

<!-- chunk -->

## cures”, declaring that everything natural had to be safe and free

<!-- chunk -->

## from the side effects of modern drugs, to the opposite view,

<!-- chunk -->

## which perhaps makes more exciting reading, alarming the public

<!-- chunk -->

## that herbs have potential side effects and may even be dangerous.

<!-- chunk -->

## Without sufficient real evidence it is easy for lay persons and

<!-- chunk -->

## professionals alike to be susceptible to such hype, but with more

<!-- chunk -->

## information it is possible to have a more realistic understanding.

<!-- chunk -->

## I hope that this book will serve those using herbs for themselves,

<!-- chunk -->

## their friends and family, or their patients, and who wish to learn

<!-- chunk -->

## more about the safe and effective use of herbal medicines in

<!-- chunk -->

## order to navigate themselves through questions regarding

<!-- chunk -->

## dosage, interactions and contraindications, so that they can use

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs with the confidence they deserve.

# Global Herbal Traditions

# Today's herbalists draw on a variety of healing

# traditions, from shamanic ritual to remedies

# proven by scientific trials. Many of the world's

# traditional systems of healing share a common

# thesis: that everything in the universe, including

# plants and human beings, is composed of energy

# and matter and manifested as five elements, and

# that keeping them in balance is the key to

# ensuring health and wellbeing. This is the basis of

# the humoral system of the ancient Greek

# physicians, as well as Indian Ayurveda, traditional

# Chinese medicine, Tibetan medicine and Islamic

# Unani Tibb. Herbs play a central role in all these

# systems, preventing and treating a wide range of

# health problems in mind and body.

# The use of herbs as medicines on physical, as

# well as subtler, levels is common to all cultures,

# and has been for as far back as we know. We can

# trace the link between human life and healing

# herbs to the Neanderthal era. In 1963,

# archeologists opened the grave of a man in a cave

# in Iraq, who had been placed there 60,000 years

# ago. He had been buried with many herbs,

# including horsetail, hollyhock, St Barnaby's

# thistle, yarrow, grape hyacinth and ephedra. The

# herbs appeared to have been chosen for their

# symbolic and healing virtues, for amongst them

# were diuretics, emetics, astringents, stimulants,

# and pain relievers.

# Ancient and Modern Medicine

# With the vast network of communication that has

# developed in recent decades has come a wealth of

# information and wisdom concerning healing. This

# has engendered a considerable amount of

# integration of herbal traditions so that herbalists

# today can draw on the knowledge of a number of

# medicinal systems and philosophies, both ancient

# and modern, and can access herbs from most

# corners of the world.

<!-- chunk -->

## Some therapeutic traditions, such as Chinese, Ayurvedic, Unani

<!-- chunk -->

## and Tibetan medicine, are based on systems of healing that have

<!-- chunk -->

## remained almost intact through thousands of years and still form

<!-- chunk -->

## the primary healthcare system for a significant proportion of the

<!-- chunk -->

## population in those countries today. Many students and

<!-- chunk -->

## practitioners of Western herbal medicine study these traditions,

<!-- chunk -->

## and incorporate their ancient wisdom and practices into their own

<!-- chunk -->

## diagnostic methods and treatments.

<!-- chunk -->

## Other age-old systems of herbal healing, particularly in the

<!-- chunk -->

## Western world, have largely been broken and replaced by

<!-- chunk -->

## modern drugs and allopathy (conventional medicine). The

<!-- chunk -->

## current popularity of herbal medicine has inspired a re-evaluation

<!-- chunk -->

## of our global medical roots, with their rich source of effective

<!-- chunk -->

## medicines that certainly have their place in modern medical

<!-- chunk -->

## practice. Herbs such as garlic, ginkgo, ginseng, echinacea and St

<!-- chunk -->

## John's wort have proved themselves to the world, becoming

<!-- chunk -->

## household names in the process, and many are recommended by

<!-- chunk -->

## some doctors.

<!-- chunk -->

## In recent decades, the scientific world has identified specific

<!-- chunk -->

## constituents of herbs, as well as their properties and interactions.

<!-- chunk -->

## Modern studies into their efficacy using double-blind, clinically

<!-- chunk -->

## controlled trials have proven that herbs can be effective

<!-- chunk -->

## medicines, vindicating the ancient use of such plants that goes

<!-- chunk -->

## back thousands of years.

# Shamanic Healing

# The earliest known herbalists of every culture

# were shamans – important men or women whose

# instincts were raised to a highly intuitive level

# through years of training to develop their inner

# eye. This deeper perception enabled them to

# communicate directly with the plant and spirit

# world, and to visit other realities through their

# own spirit allies.

# Origins

<!-- chunk -->

## Shamanistic practices are said to predate all organised religions,

<!-- chunk -->

## dating back to the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods. Many

<!-- chunk -->

## shamanic traditions, including European, Tibetan, Mongolian,

<!-- chunk -->

## Korean, Japanese, and Native American from both North and

<!-- chunk -->

## South America, originally came from Siberia and

<!-- chunk -->

## metamorphosed as they traveled to other parts of the world.

<!-- chunk -->

## African slaves took their shamanic traditions to America, where

<!-- chunk -->

## they merged divination and other rituals with Christian practices

<!-- chunk -->

## to produce, for example, Haitian voodoo (vodou), Cuban

<!-- chunk -->

## santería, and Brazilian candomblé. Elsewhere, shamanism

<!-- chunk -->

## became absorbed into religion, clearly shown in, for example,

<!-- chunk -->

## Tibetan Buddhism. In some cultures, the early shamans were

<!-- chunk -->

## known as priest physicians. They were also sorcerers, magicians,

<!-- chunk -->

## diviners; intermediaries between the mortal and the spirit worlds.

# Contemporary Shamanism

<!-- chunk -->

## Today, shamanism is still alive and well especially in Siberia. It

<!-- chunk -->

## exists in a variety of different forms, mainly among indigenous

<!-- chunk -->

## peoples in rural areas, often as the main form of treatment

<!-- chunk -->

## available. It is also found in cities and shantytowns, particularly

<!-- chunk -->

## in Africa, Central America and South America, where it is an

<!-- chunk -->

## important part of the culture and used alongside, or as an

<!-- chunk -->

## alternative to, any available modern medicine. Belief in

<!-- chunk -->

## witchcraft and sorcery, known as brujeria in South America, is

<!-- chunk -->

## still prevalent in many shamanic societies. Some cultures,

<!-- chunk -->

## including several from Africa, distinguish shamans who cure

<!-- chunk -->

## from sorcerers who harm, while others believe that all shamans

<!-- chunk -->

## have the power to both cure and kill. Shamanism is also still

<!-- chunk -->

## practiced in South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Inuit and Eskimo

<!-- chunk -->

## cultures, Papua New Guinea, Australia and Tibet.

# The Shaman's Journey

<!-- chunk -->

## In some cultures the shaman's powers are believed to be

<!-- chunk -->

## inherited, while in others a shaman follows a “calling”,

<!-- chunk -->

## sometimes from their dreams, and endures rigorous training.

<!-- chunk -->

## Initiation occurs often through a transformational experience,

<!-- chunk -->

## which could be a serious illness, or being struck by lightning. In

<!-- chunk -->

## North America, Native Americans may seek communion with

<!-- chunk -->

## the spirit world through a “vision quest”, while an aspiring

<!-- chunk -->

## shaman in South America might apprentice themselves to a

<!-- chunk -->

## respected shaman.

<!-- chunk -->

## Shamans enter altered states of consciousness, often ecstatic

<!-- chunk -->

## trance states, journeying to the beat of a drum or rattle, or using

<!-- chunk -->

## singing, music, sweat lodges, vision quests, or fasting to

<!-- chunk -->

## communicate with other realms of reality and the entities that

<!-- chunk -->

## guide them (a teacher, a spirit guide from the animal or plant

<!-- chunk -->

## world or a totem), asking for wisdom and guidance. In this way

<!-- chunk -->

## they gain their knowledge and power. The shaman's journey is

<!-- chunk -->

## intended to help the patient or community to rediscover their

<!-- chunk -->

## connection to nature and spirit. In the Ecuadorian and Peruvian

<!-- chunk -->

## rainforests, shamans are known as curanderos. Some base their

<!-- chunk -->

## healing work on the use of ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic plant that

<!-- chunk -->

## can induce divine revelation and healing, mental and emotional

<!-- chunk -->

## as well as physical. Visiting an Ayahuasquero has become

<!-- chunk -->

## popular among Western spiritual seekers who can now go on

<!-- chunk -->

## tours into the jungle for just this purpose.

<!-- chunk -->

## Other Native American shamans alter their consciousness

<!-- chunk -->

## through the use of mind altering plants such as psychedelic

<!-- chunk -->

## mushrooms, cannabis, San Pedro cactus, peyote, datura, fly

<!-- chunk -->

## agaric and salvia divinorum. In so doing, shamans can put

<!-- chunk -->

## themselves at risk. They therefore use rituals to protect

<!-- chunk -->

## themselves from enemies and rivals in the spirit and human

<!-- chunk -->

## world. Many of the plants they use are poisonous in large doses,

<!-- chunk -->

## and not being able to return from out of body experiences can be

<!-- chunk -->

## fatal. These plants are best used under the guidance of an

<!-- chunk -->

## authentic shaman.

<!-- chunk -->

## Illness in shamanism is generally attributed to spiritual causes.

<!-- chunk -->

## It could be the bad will of another towards the patient, the work

<!-- chunk -->

## of evil spirits, witchcraft or divine intervention, and both spiritual

<!-- chunk -->

## and physical methods are used to heal, depending on what is

<!-- chunk -->

## recommended in the spirit world. In the healing rituals the

<!-- chunk -->

## shaman will “enter the body” of the patient to confront and

<!-- chunk -->

## banish the spirit responsible. Incense and aromatic plants are

<!-- chunk -->

## often burnt as tools of transformation to help transport the minds

<!-- chunk -->

## of the participants to another dimension – the origins of modern

<!-- chunk -->

## aromatherapy. Spells, incantations, amulets and ritual dances are

<!-- chunk -->

## used to dispel or placate the spirits thought to be responsible for

<!-- chunk -->

## the patient's ill health.

# Shamanism Today

<!-- chunk -->

## There has been a surge of interest in shamanic culture in the past

<!-- chunk -->

## few years, and many contemporary therapists are incorporating

<!-- chunk -->

## some of the traditional practices into their work. Some are

<!-- chunk -->

## attracted to healing practices from the East or Native American

<!-- chunk -->

## traditions, while others access the roots of European shamanism,

<!-- chunk -->

## with its mystical beliefs and practices that were suppressed by the

<!-- chunk -->

## Christian church.

<!-- chunk -->

## In their healing work, a shaman can bring about

<!-- chunk -->

## transformation of the energy and experience of the patient. Loss

<!-- chunk -->

## of vital energy from stress, trauma, illness, or accidents can cause

<!-- chunk -->

## what is known as “soul loss” and this is remedied by “soul

<!-- chunk -->

## retrieval” where the energy and part of the patient's life that has

<!-- chunk -->

## been traumatised is returned and healed. Loss of power, caused

<!-- chunk -->

## by stress, pressure, abusive relationships, lack of love and

<!-- chunk -->

## support for example, leading to feelings of low self esteem, can

<!-- chunk -->

## be remedied through the shaman's connection to their patient's

<!-- chunk -->

## power animal; they can re-empower the patient through

<!-- chunk -->

## enhancing their own relationship to their power animal and

<!-- chunk -->

## enable them to make changes in their lives. Plant spirit medicine,

<!-- chunk -->

## in which the shaman calls on the healing spirit of a plant to help

<!-- chunk -->

## the patient, often forms part of the healing. Plant spirits can be

<!-- chunk -->

## summoned by songs. Totem items like rocks with special powers

<!-- chunk -->

## are also used.

# Humoral Medicine

# Around the time of the development of the

# Ancient Greek empire, the transition from hunter-

# gatherer to nomadic tribes, and then into farming

# communities, meant the development of trade and

# agriculture. At this time huge advances in the

# development of medicine were taking place.

<!-- chunk -->

## As densely populated centres of trade developed, they incubated

<!-- chunk -->

## epidemics of diseases including malaria, tuberculosis, measles,

<!-- chunk -->

## digestive and chest infections, caused by the insanitary living

<!-- chunk -->

## conditions. These presented challenges to shamans with their

<!-- chunk -->

## ritualistic approaches to healing. Shamanic practice and control

<!-- chunk -->

## gave way to complex philosophical systems of medical theory

<!-- chunk -->

## and practice arising from the increase in trade and travel, and the

<!-- chunk -->

## exchange of ideas between cultures of Egypt, Syria, Persia,

<!-- chunk -->

## China and India.

# The Father of Medicine

<!-- chunk -->

## The increasingly sophisticated and educated clientele of the

<!-- chunk -->

## physicians expected good results and a rationale behind their

<!-- chunk -->

## prescriptions. This was the beginning of rational medicine, and

<!-- chunk -->

## theories were developed to explain patterns of illness. Physicians

<!-- chunk -->

## studied studied anatomy, physiology and surgery at the great

<!-- chunk -->

## medical school of Alexandria in Egypt. One of the greatest

<!-- chunk -->

## legacies of this period of learning was the development of

<!-- chunk -->

## holistic medicine, largely inspired by the great 5th century BC

<!-- chunk -->

## philosopher and physician Hippocrates, who observed that the

<!-- chunk -->

## body was subject to natural laws and that susceptibility to illness

<!-- chunk -->

## depended on a person's constitution, hereditary tendencies, and

<!-- chunk -->

## the influence of environmental factors, including diet, water,

<!-- chunk -->

## hygiene, climate and society.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hippocrates has been called “the father of medicine” as he laid

<!-- chunk -->

## down many of the principles of medicine and his work formed

<!-- chunk -->

## the basis for medical theory and practice that has been developed

<!-- chunk -->

## until the present day. He emphasised the value of ethical

<!-- chunk -->

## medicine, working for the benefit of the sick and not the

<!-- chunk -->

## physician's pocket alone and this is incorporated in the

<!-- chunk -->

## Hippocratic oath still used in modern medical schools today. He

<!-- chunk -->

## taught close observation of patients through the senses, touch,

<!-- chunk -->

## smell, taste and sound and encouraged keeping written case

<!-- chunk -->

## histories and basing treatment on results. He promoted

<!-- chunk -->

## addressing the whole person, not suppression of the symptoms,

<!-- chunk -->

## and enhancing the ability of the body to heal itself through herbs,

<!-- chunk -->

## fresh air, exercise, bathing and diet. He is recorded as using

<!-- chunk -->

## around 400 herbs.

# The Five Elements

<!-- chunk -->

## Hippocrates' humoral system of medicine paralleled other great

<!-- chunk -->

## traditional systems with five element theory that existed at the

<!-- chunk -->

## time in India and China. He saw that all matter could be

<!-- chunk -->

## explained by the five basic elements, ether, air, fire, water and

<!-- chunk -->

## earth, and the individuality of people explained by the four

<!-- chunk -->

## humours arising from these elements, blood, phlegm, choler

<!-- chunk -->

## (yellow bile) and melancholy. The proportions of these humours

<!-- chunk -->

## in each person would determine their personality and body type,

<!-- chunk -->

## and their susceptibility to particular kinds of imbalance and

<!-- chunk -->

## illness. Hippocrates thus perceived that illness was not a

<!-- chunk -->

## punishment of the Gods, as believed by his forefathers, but arose

<!-- chunk -->

## from imbalances of the elements that composed everything in

<!-- chunk -->

## nature.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hippocrates, the ancient Greek

<!-- chunk -->

### physician and philosopher, is widely

<!-- chunk -->

### regarded as the father of medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

## The element earth corresponded to the melancholic humour or

<!-- chunk -->

## temperament, black bile and the season of autumn. It had a cold

<!-- chunk -->

## and dry nature, giving rise to symptoms such as constipation,

<!-- chunk -->

## arthritis, depression or anxiety. Warming herbs such as ginger

<!-- chunk -->

## and senna would be used to clear black bile and restore balance.

<!-- chunk -->

## Water corresponded to phlegm and a phlegmatic temperament.

<!-- chunk -->

## Phlegm had a cold and damp nature, epitomised by the season of

<!-- chunk -->

## winter, and gave rise to illnesses such as catarrh, respiratory

<!-- chunk -->

## infections, weight gain and fluid retention. Warming and drying

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs such as thyme, hyssop and ginger were used to clear cold

<!-- chunk -->

## and damp symptoms, and thereby restore the balance of the

<!-- chunk -->

## humours. Fire corresponded to choler, or yellow bile, related to

<!-- chunk -->

## summer. A choleric type would be hot tempered and prone to

<!-- chunk -->

## liver and digestive problems. Cooling and moistening herbs such

<!-- chunk -->

## as dandelion, violets and lettuce would help to balance the excess

<!-- chunk -->

## heat and dryness of the choleric temperament. Air corresponded

<!-- chunk -->

## to blood and the sanguine temperament, epitomised by spring. A

<!-- chunk -->

## sanguine type would be easy going and good humoured, but

<!-- chunk -->

## prone to excesses and over-indulgence, giving rise to problems

<!-- chunk -->

## such as gout and diarrhoea. Cool dry herbs such as burdock or

<!-- chunk -->

## figwort were used to balance the humours.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thyme is a warming herb and was

<!-- chunk -->

### therefore used to clear cold and damp

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms and restore the balance of

<!-- chunk -->

### the humours in the body.

# Great Greek Herbals

<!-- chunk -->

## Another famous Greek physician was Theophrastus (372-286

<!-- chunk -->

## BC), a friend and pupil of Aristotle, who inherited Aristotle's

<!-- chunk -->

## garden and library and wrote the first important herbal, Enquiry

<!-- chunk -->

## into Plants, which has survived until today. He listed 500 healing

<!-- chunk -->

## plants, and the properties of oils and spices, basing much of his

<!-- chunk -->

## work on Aristotle's botanical writings that expanded much of

<!-- chunk -->

## Hippocrates' work. Another great source of herbal knowledge

<!-- chunk -->

## derives from the Alexandrian school, which enabled Greek

<!-- chunk -->

## medicine to flourish – it drew on Greek herbal knowledge as

<!-- chunk -->

## well as Egyptian, Sumerian and Assyrian healing traditions, and

<!-- chunk -->

## included knowledge brought back from campaigns in Asia. The

<!-- chunk -->

## strong traditions developed here survived into medieval Europe

<!-- chunk -->

## through the writers and scholars of the Arab world.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taraxacum officinale, or dandelion,

<!-- chunk -->

### was believed to balance the excess

<!-- chunk -->

### heat and dryness of the choleric

<!-- chunk -->

### temperament.

<!-- chunk -->

## Galen (131-200 AD), another notable Greek physician, studied

<!-- chunk -->

## at the Alexandrian school and later became renowned as surgeon

<!-- chunk -->

## to the gladiators in Rome, and personal physician to the Emperor

<!-- chunk -->

## Marcus Aurelius (121-180 AD). In his herbal De Simplicibus he

<!-- chunk -->

## expanded on Hippocrates' philosophy and classification of herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## into the four humours. His works became the standard medical

<!-- chunk -->

## text of Rome and later of the Arab physicians and medieval

<!-- chunk -->

## monks. His theories are still clearly to be found in Unani Tibb

<!-- chunk -->

## medicine today (pages 20-23).

<!-- chunk -->

## Pedanius Dioscorides was a Greek physician serving with the

<!-- chunk -->

## Roman army during the reign of Emperor Nero, which allowed

<!-- chunk -->

## him to travel extensively in Asia Minor. Around 60 AD he set

<!-- chunk -->

## himself the enormous task of collating all the current knowledge

<!-- chunk -->

## on medicinal plants and healing substances in one work, De

<!-- chunk -->

## Materia Medica. It included discussion of the components of

<!-- chunk -->

## perfumes and their medicinal properties, and the aromatic herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## used for these included balm, basil, coriander, fennel, garlic,

<!-- chunk -->

## hyssop, marjoram, mint, myrtle, rosemary and violet. His famous

<!-- chunk -->

## herbal provided the major source of herbal knowledge for all the

<!-- chunk -->

## herbals that followed for the next 1500 years and has been

<!-- chunk -->

## copied and quoted to the present day.

# Continuing Legacy

<!-- chunk -->

## Under the Romans the Catholic papacy grew more powerful, and

<!-- chunk -->

## the early Christians, feeling that the church, rather than

<!-- chunk -->

## physicians, should be responsible for health of mind and soul,

<!-- chunk -->

## started to repress the use of many “pagan” herbs. In 529 AD

<!-- chunk -->

## Pope Gregory the Great ruled that learning that was not in

<!-- chunk -->

## accordance with the political ambitions of the papacy should be

<!-- chunk -->

## forbidden. Thus, during the Dark Ages (around 200-800 AD)

<!-- chunk -->

## knowledge of herbs and the use of the great herbals was pushed

<!-- chunk -->

## underground and scientific research and writing in Europe came

<!-- chunk -->

# Unani Tibb

# Between the 9th and 13th centuries, Graeco-

# Roman medicine from Hippocrates and Galen

# was assimilated by the Arabs, and an Arabic

# tradition of medicine, known as Unani Tibb,

# developed. The word Unani (meaning “Ionian”)

# reflects the strong Greek influence to this

# tradition, while Tibb means the knowledge of the

# states of the human body in health and disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## A succession of renowned Arab physicians including Albucasis,

<!-- chunk -->

## Razis and Ibn Sina (also known as Avicenna) were particularly

<!-- chunk -->

## responsible for the development of medicine at this time, adding

<!-- chunk -->

## their own inventions and discoveries to the sum of herbal and

<!-- chunk -->

## botanical knowledge. Avicenna (980-1037 AD) brought together

<!-- chunk -->

## all that was available on the nature of disease, plant medicines,

<!-- chunk -->

## aromatics and medical theories, including the teachings of

<!-- chunk -->

## Sushruta and Charaka from the Ayurvedic tradition, in his Canon

<!-- chunk -->

## Medicinae. It was Avicenna who developed the process of

<!-- chunk -->

## distillation originated in the Alexandrian school around the 3rd

<!-- chunk -->

## century. He invented the apparatus and method of alembic

<!-- chunk -->

## distillation to extract essential oils from aromatic plants – a great

<!-- chunk -->

## landmark in the history of aromatherapy. Fragrant oils were

<!-- chunk -->

## particularly used for their purifying and restorative properties at

<!-- chunk -->

## this time and were thought to reduce the impact of destructive

<!-- chunk -->

## emotions such as grief and fear on the health of the body.

# Practice in India and Beyond

<!-- chunk -->

## When the Mongols invaded Persia and Central Asia, many

<!-- chunk -->

## scholars and physicians of Unani fled to India. Once established

<!-- chunk -->

## in India, Unani Tibb then suffered setbacks under British rule,

<!-- chunk -->

## although it still flourished unofficially. In the ensuing struggle

<!-- chunk -->

## against British colonialism a friend of Mahatma Gandhi,

<!-- chunk -->

## Muhammad Ajmal Khan, founded the Unani Tibb and

<!-- chunk -->

## Ayurvedic College in Delhi in 1916, a landmark in its survival.

<!-- chunk -->

## Today Unani is practiced in Iran, Pakistan, China, India,

<!-- chunk -->

## Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, and other parts of the

<!-- chunk -->

## Middle East. In India there are now many Unani medical colleges

<!-- chunk -->

## where, after a five and half year course, graduates are awarded a

<!-- chunk -->

## BUMS (Bachelor of Unani Medicine and Surgery) degree and

<!-- chunk -->

## can practice as government approved doctors. There are about

<!-- chunk -->

## Unani medical colleges awarding postgraduate degrees. There

<!-- chunk -->

## are also schools of Unani in Australia and the US. The American

<!-- chunk -->

## Institute of Unani Medicine was founded in 1986.

# The Seven Components

<!-- chunk -->

## According to Unani, the human body is composed of seven

<!-- chunk -->

## components called Umoor e Tabaiyah, which are responsible for

<!-- chunk -->

## maintenance of health. Changes to any of these can predispose to

<!-- chunk -->

## imbalance and disease, and each need to be taken in to

<!-- chunk -->

## consideration in diagnosis and assessment of the correct

<!-- chunk -->

## treatment. These are:

<!-- chunk -->

## • Arkan (Elements)

<!-- chunk -->

## • Mizaj (Temperament)

<!-- chunk -->

## • Akhlaat (Humours)

<!-- chunk -->

## • Aaza (Organs)

<!-- chunk -->

## • Arwah (Vital forces or Neuro)

<!-- chunk -->

## • Quwa (Faculties)

<!-- chunk -->

## • Afaal (Functions)

<!-- chunk -->

## The balance of one's constitution can be disrupted by

<!-- chunk -->

## emotional, psychological, social, environmental or spiritual

<!-- chunk -->

## factors, or by diet. Environmental and lifestyle factors that are

<!-- chunk -->

## vital to good health are divided into five categories, and any

<!-- chunk -->

## imbalance of these can predispose to disturbance of the humours

<!-- chunk -->

## and lead to ill health. They are:

<!-- chunk -->

## • Fresh air

<!-- chunk -->

## • Food and drink

<!-- chunk -->

## • Movement and rest

<!-- chunk -->

## • Sleep

<!-- chunk -->

## • Emotions

# The Four Humours

<!-- chunk -->

## The four elements, known as Anasir-e-Arba (hava, pani, mitti,

<!-- chunk -->

## and dhup), are earth, water, fire and air. In varying combinations

<!-- chunk -->

## these four elements constitute four bodily humours (akhlaat):

<!-- chunk -->

## • Blood (dam)

<!-- chunk -->

## • Phlegm (kafa)

<!-- chunk -->

## • Bile (safra)

<!-- chunk -->

## • Black bile (souda)

<!-- chunk -->

## According to Unani theory, the humours develop in the liver

<!-- chunk -->

## from digested nutrients, and are carried around the body in the

<!-- chunk -->

## blood. Each person's unique balance of these substances

<!-- chunk -->

## determines his temperament, mizaj or individual metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

## constitution; a predominance of blood gives a sanguine

<!-- chunk -->

## temperament; a predominance of phlegm makes one phlegmatic;

<!-- chunk -->

## yellow bile, bilious or choleric; and black bile, melancholic. As

<!-- chunk -->

## long as these humours are in balance, the human system is

<!-- chunk -->

## healthy; it is imbalance which leads to ill health and disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alembic distillation was perfected by

<!-- chunk -->

### Arab physicians to extract oil from

<!-- chunk -->

### plants.

<!-- chunk -->

## Each individual has their own innate healing mechanisms, akin

<!-- chunk -->

## to ojas in Ayurveda and known in Unani as the tabiyat-e-

<!-- chunk -->

## muddabare badan, which is considered the best physician, and it

<!-- chunk -->

## is this that maintains the equilibrium of the four humours or

<!-- chunk -->

## akhlat so that we can be in good health and the happy state of

<!-- chunk -->

## mind that is our birthright.

# Disciplines and Diagnoses

<!-- chunk -->

## There are eight branches of Unani medicine resembling those in

<!-- chunk -->

## the Ayurvedic system:

<!-- chunk -->

## • Internal medicine (moalijat)

<!-- chunk -->

## • Gynaecology including obstetrics and paediatrics

<!-- chunk -->

## • Diseases of the head and neck

<!-- chunk -->

## • Toxicology

<!-- chunk -->

## • Psychiatry

<!-- chunk -->

## • Rejuvenation therapy including geriatrics

<!-- chunk -->

## • Sexology

<!-- chunk -->

## • Regimental therapy

<!-- chunk -->

## • Dietotherapy

<!-- chunk -->

## • Hydrotherapy

<!-- chunk -->

## The diagnostic skills of practitioners of Unani, known as

<!-- chunk -->

## hakims, include observation, pulse taking, questioning, palpation

<!-- chunk -->

## and urine analysis. Pulse diagnosis requires the hakim to be in a

<!-- chunk -->

## clear state of spiritual awareness to enable him to analyse the

<!-- chunk -->

## subtle qualities of the pulse. Practices including breathing and

<!-- chunk -->

## voice exercises and visualisations to help to calm and clear the

<!-- chunk -->

## mind. In the initial consultation, the Tibb practitioner will take a

<!-- chunk -->

## detailed case history from the patient and make observations of

<!-- chunk -->

## their skin, tongue, eyes, hands and nails. They will also take their

<!-- chunk -->

## pulse, as a considerable amount of information about the patient's

<!-- chunk -->

## state of health can be gleaned from this in just minutes.

<!-- chunk -->

## Unani classifies health in three different stages: health, disease

<!-- chunk -->

## and neutral. Neutral exists between health and disease when

<!-- chunk -->

## symptoms have not yet manifested. Disease occurs when the

<!-- chunk -->

## functions associated with the vital, natural and psychic forces of

<!-- chunk -->

## the body are obstructed or unbalanced due to some form of

<!-- chunk -->

## deviation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Symptoms of illness are seen in a positive light, as an

<!-- chunk -->

## opportunity to cleanse and balance us on physical, emotional,

<!-- chunk -->

## mental, as well as spiritual levels. Pain, for example, is a message

<!-- chunk -->

## that something is wrong, the underlying causes of which need to

<!-- chunk -->

## be addressed so that our health can be better in the future. A

<!-- chunk -->

## “healing crisis” is simply tabiyat, or the homoeostatic

<!-- chunk -->

## mechanisms of the body attempting to eliminate toxins through

<!-- chunk -->

## vomiting, diarrhoea, fevers, sweating, and increased urination in

<!-- chunk -->

## order to re-establish equilibrium of the humours, health and well

<!-- chunk -->

## being.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Tibb practitioner will always take

<!-- chunk -->

### the pulse of their patient.

# Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

## Unani healers follow strict ethical codes of conduct and practice,

<!-- chunk -->

## which are based on Islam. These include earning the respect of

<!-- chunk -->

## their patients, proper cleansing routines, moderation in food and

<!-- chunk -->

## drink, and spiritual purification techniques. As in Ayurvedic and

<!-- chunk -->

## Tibetan medicine, both prevention and treatment of health

<!-- chunk -->

## problems are based on each person's body type, personality and

<!-- chunk -->

## mizaj, or individual metabolic constitution.

<!-- chunk -->

## Treatment is aimed at rebalancing the patient physically,

<!-- chunk -->

## emotionally, mentally and spiritually. It is based largely on

<!-- chunk -->

## lifestyle advice, including advocating bathing, fresh air, fresh

<!-- chunk -->

## food and codes of conduct to promote and maintain health.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hakims also prescribe herbs, precious metals and stones (gold,

<!-- chunk -->

## silver, gems and pearls), detoxification and dietary regimes,

<!-- chunk -->

## minerals, and aromatherapy. Oils or attars are extracted from

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs and given singly or in combinations, according to the

<!-- chunk -->

## needs of the patient, to affect body, mind and emotions. Some of

<!-- chunk -->

## the herbs, such as saffron, fennel, caraway, haritaki (Terminalia

<!-- chunk -->

## chebula), bibhitaki (Terminalia bellerica), and amalaki (Emblica

<!-- chunk -->

## officinalis) are also used in Ayurvedic and Tibetan traditions.

<!-- chunk -->

## Other herbs used in the Unani tradition include guggulu

<!-- chunk -->

## (Commiphora mukul), ashwagandha (Withania somnifera),

<!-- chunk -->

## coriander, bacopa (Bacopa monnieri), violet, liquorice, long

<!-- chunk -->

## pepper, and guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia). Massage or

<!-- chunk -->

## cold/heat suction cups might be used, as well as puncturing

<!-- chunk -->

## certain reflex points to release a few drops of blood in acute

<!-- chunk -->

## disease.

# Food and Taste

<!-- chunk -->

## Foods and herbs are categorised according to their own miza, or

<!-- chunk -->

## balance of the humours and elements, and appropriate treatments

<!-- chunk -->

## are prescribed to suit the imbalances of an individual's

<!-- chunk -->

## constitution, which obviously vary from one person to another.

<!-- chunk -->

## Substances in foods and herbs are also classified according to

<!-- chunk -->

## whether their therapeutic effects are mild (which can be used by

<!-- chunk -->

## anyone), moderate, or powerful (includes potential poisons for

<!-- chunk -->

## use only by hakims). Qualities of hot, cold, wet and dry are also

<!-- chunk -->

## attributed to physical conditions, foods and herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

## In common with Chinese, Tibetan and Ayurvedic systems,

<!-- chunk -->

## Unani Tibb emphasises the importance of tastes as well as the

<!-- chunk -->

## manner in which food is prepared to adjust the imbalances which

<!-- chunk -->

## contribute to ill health. There are five tastes: salty, sweet, bitter,

<!-- chunk -->

## pungent, and sour, each of which affects the humours in its own

<!-- chunk -->

## way. In addition appropriate warming and cooling spices and

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs are added to cooking to help address underlying

<!-- chunk -->

## imbalances of the humours. Even the aromas from preparing,

<!-- chunk -->

## cooking, eating and digesting food contribute to the healing

<!-- chunk -->

## benefit and are taken into consideration in planning meals.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cooking and eating are seen as rituals which, if containing the

<!-- chunk -->

## right foods and herbs and practiced with a pure heart, good

<!-- chunk -->

## intent and clear focus, can help transform the energy of the meal

<!-- chunk -->

## and contribute to the healing process.

# Tibetan Medicine

# Tibetan Medicine is a highly evolved system of

# medicine that developed as a synthesis of medical

# knowledge and wisdom from Indian Ayurveda,

# Chinese medicine, Greek medicine and Unani

# Tibb. Its origins can be traced back to at least the

# 7th century. It also incorporated Buddhist

# philosophy that was introduced to Tibet over two

# thousand years ago. Being deeply rooted in

# Buddhist philosophy, its perspective is that

# physical illness is inextricably bound with

# mental, social and spiritual illness.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tibetan medicine has developed into a sophisticated and complex

<!-- chunk -->

## medical science with intricate theories about causes of disease,

<!-- chunk -->

## diagnosis and therapeutics, and has existed in its present form for

<!-- chunk -->

## over one thousand years. Sangye Menla, the “medicine Buddha”,

<!-- chunk -->

## is respected as the source of medical teachings and the inspiration

<!-- chunk -->

## for correct practice as a physician. The essential aspects of this

<!-- chunk -->

## teaching are summarised in the rGyud-Bzhi (pronunciation giu

<!-- chunk -->

## shi) or the Four Medical Tantras, the twelfth century text in four

<!-- chunk -->

## volumes, which is still taught today. The Tibetan system of

<!-- chunk -->

## healing, known as sowa rigpa, or the knowledge of healing, is

<!-- chunk -->

## still practiced in Tibet, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim, Ladakh,

<!-- chunk -->

## Siberia, China, Russia and Mongolia, as well as in parts of

<!-- chunk -->

## Europe and North America.

# The Three Humours

<!-- chunk -->

## Like other Asian systems of medicine, Tibetan medicine is based

<!-- chunk -->

## on the principle that everything in the cosmos, including human

<!-- chunk -->

## life, is composed of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind and

<!-- chunk -->

## space. These are symbols for matter, cohesion, energy,

<!-- chunk -->

## movement and space that affect the mind as well as the body. The

<!-- chunk -->

## universe and the body are a result of the interplay of these five

<!-- chunk -->

## elements, which manifest themselves in the form of energy into

<!-- chunk -->

## three humours or energies:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Wind (rLung, pronunciation loong) is vital for movement,

<!-- chunk -->

## responsible for breathing, circulation of bodily fluids including

<!-- chunk -->

## blood and lymph, mental activity like thinking, speech, energy,

<!-- chunk -->

## and transmission of nerve impulses. There are five

<!-- chunk -->

## subcategories of rLung each with different locations and

<!-- chunk -->

## functions: Srog-'Dzin rLung, Gyen-rGyu rLung, Khyab-Byed

<!-- chunk -->

## rLung, Me-mNyam rLung, Thur-Sel rLung.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Bile (mKhrispa, pronunciation Tripa) is heating energy, which

<!-- chunk -->

## regulates digestion and metabolism, liver function and

<!-- chunk -->

## maintains body temperature and the discriminating mind. The

<!-- chunk -->

## five subcategories of mKhris-pa are Ju-Byed mKhris-pa,

<!-- chunk -->

## sGrub-Byed mKhris-pa, mDangs-sGyur mKhris-pa, mThong-

<!-- chunk -->

## Byed, mKhris-pa, mDog-Sel mKhris-pa.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Phlegm (Badkan, pronunciation Beken) governs the structure

<!-- chunk -->

## of the physical body such as bone and muscle as well as

<!-- chunk -->

## mucous membranes. It is responsible for some aspects of

<!-- chunk -->

## digestion, the maintenance of our physical structure, joint

<!-- chunk -->

## health and mental stability. The five subcategories of Bad-kan

<!-- chunk -->

## are: rTen-Byed Bad-kan, Myag-byed Bad-kan, Myong-Byed

<!-- chunk -->

## Bad-kan, Tsim-Byed Bad-kan, Byor-Byed Bad-kan.

<!-- chunk -->

## Health depends on the equilibrium of the humours, so disease

<!-- chunk -->

## is caused when they are out of balance. The three energies are

<!-- chunk -->

## present in different proportions in each person and determine

<!-- chunk -->

## their constitution including their body shape, temperament, and

<!-- chunk -->

## susceptibility to specific health problems.

<!-- chunk -->

# Balancing the Humours

<!-- chunk -->

## Another important concept in Tibetan medicine is the dichotomy

<!-- chunk -->

## between warm and cold. Diseases, as well as remedies and food,

<!-- chunk -->

## are distinguished as warm and cold or as warming and cooling

<!-- chunk -->

## respectively. mKhrispa is warm and badkan is cool. rLung is a

<!-- chunk -->

## special case and is basically neutral, it can aggravate “warm” and

<!-- chunk -->

## “cold”, much like wind is able to boost a fire as well as cool

<!-- chunk -->

## down the body. A rLung imbalance is at the root of most

<!-- chunk -->

## diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

## The understanding of physiology is governed by the dynamic

<!-- chunk -->

## interaction of three humours (rLung, mKhrispa and badkan).

<!-- chunk -->

## Health is a dynamic equilibrium and is therefore relative because

<!-- chunk -->

## all three humours must be in a corresponding balance for each

<!-- chunk -->

## individual. The aim of Tibetan therapy is thus to restore this

<!-- chunk -->

## equilibrium in the patient.

# Diagnosis and Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

## As in Ayurveda and Unani medicine, the balance of the humours

<!-- chunk -->

## determines the constitution of each individual. This balance is

<!-- chunk -->

## influenced by our external and internal environment, including

<!-- chunk -->

## diet, lifestyle, relationships and emotional, mental and spiritual

<!-- chunk -->

## influences. The dynamic equilibrium of the humours also

<!-- chunk -->

## changes with the climate, the seasons and the ageing process. In

<!-- chunk -->

## Buddhist thought, all physical and mental suffering, and hence

<!-- chunk -->

## all illness, is caused by the three mental poisons: attachment,

<!-- chunk -->

## anger and ignorance, as well as the effect of past karma. Tibetan

<!-- chunk -->

## medicine stresses the importance of compassion in healing.

<!-- chunk -->

## Diagnosis of imbalance and disease involves observation and

<!-- chunk -->

## an in-depth interview of the patient, taking the pulse, and

<!-- chunk -->

## examining urine and faeces as well as the tongue. Once the

<!-- chunk -->

## imbalance of the humours has been ascertained, treatment

<!-- chunk -->

## specific to the individual is recommended, designed to re-

<!-- chunk -->

## establish mental harmony and equilibrium of the three humours.

<!-- chunk -->

## This can include advice on lifestyle, exercise, conduct and

<!-- chunk -->

## behaviour, healing of the mind through mantras and meditation,

<!-- chunk -->

## yoga, moxibustion (burning of the herb mugwort), the use of

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs, vegetable and mineral supplements, massage and

<!-- chunk -->

## inhalations with specially formulated herbal oils, bathing,

<!-- chunk -->

## cupping and occasionally acupuncture. Foods and herbs all

<!-- chunk -->

## consist of their own individual balance of the five elements and

<!-- chunk -->

## three humours. Foods and diets appropriate to each patient and

<!-- chunk -->

## the balance of the humours are recommended, and this includes

<!-- chunk -->

## quantities of food, and when they are eaten.

# Herbal Medicines

<!-- chunk -->

## If dietary and behavioural changes are not sufficient to remedy

<!-- chunk -->

## the condition, herbs are prescribed. The Tibetan Materia Medica

<!-- chunk -->

## consists largely of medicinal herbs, as well as minerals and, to a

<!-- chunk -->

## lesser extent, animal substances. As in Ayurveda, medicinal

<!-- chunk -->

## substances are grouped according to their properties, their taste

<!-- chunk -->

## (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent and astringent), their potency

<!-- chunk -->

## (heavy/light, oily/rough, hot/cold and blunt/sharp) and the effect

<!-- chunk -->

## of these on the humours. Tibetan medicines are frequently

<!-- chunk -->

## composed of 20 or more different ingredients, and include one

<!-- chunk -->

## major group of ingredients and two minor ones aimed at

<!-- chunk -->

## supporting the major group and preventing unwanted side

<!-- chunk -->

## effects. Herbs that are used in the Tibetan tradition include

<!-- chunk -->

## amalaki, roses, calendula, nettles, coriander, cinnamon,

<!-- chunk -->

## cardamom, ginger, garlic, rhodiola, gentian and liquorice.

<!-- chunk -->

## Medicines are considered to be offerings to the Medicine Buddha

<!-- chunk -->

## and other medicine deities and are prepared with spiritual rituals

<!-- chunk -->

## by traditional methods of drying, grinding, mixing and pressing

<!-- chunk -->

## the plants to make pills, powders or decoctions.

<!-- chunk -->

## The annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China

<!-- chunk -->

## (PRC) in the 1950s had a great impact on Tibetan medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

## During the Cultural Revolution in particular, practitioners

<!-- chunk -->

## suffered great persecution, and clinical practice, study and

<!-- chunk -->

## research largely censored by the repressive Chinese.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nevertheless, Tibetan medicine has survived almost intact. His

<!-- chunk -->

## Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama lives in exile in Dharamasala and

<!-- chunk -->

## has been a powerful influence in Tibetan medicine. In 1961 he

<!-- chunk -->

## founded the Men-Tsee-Khang (the Tibetan Medical and

<!-- chunk -->

## Astrological Institute – TMAI) which has a college of Tibetan

<!-- chunk -->

## medicine, a clinic, a pharmacy that produces and dispenses

<!-- chunk -->

## medicines, and carries out research and publication of medical

<!-- chunk -->

## and astrological texts. There are other schools and clinics in

<!-- chunk -->

## Tibet, India and Nepal and recently huge pharmaceutical

<!-- chunk -->

## factories have started making traditional Tibetan formulas in

<!-- chunk -->

## China.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many herbs used in Tibetan medicine,

<!-- chunk -->

### for example garlic and ginger, are

<!-- chunk -->

### already part of our daily lives.

# Ayurvedic Medicine

# The name Ayurveda derives from two Sanskrit

# words: ayur meaning life, and veda meaning

# knowledge or science. Ayurveda is the knowledge

# or science of life. More than just a system of

# medicine, Ayurveda is a way of life encompassing

# science, religion and philosophy that enhances

# well being, increases longevity and ultimately

# enables self realisation. It aims to bring about a

# union of physical, emotional and spiritual health

# or swasthya, which is a prerequisite for attaining

# moksha or liberation.

<!-- chunk -->

### The lotus flower, with its far reaching

<!-- chunk -->

### roots, symbolises the Ayurvedic

<!-- chunk -->

### approach to deep individual healing.

<!-- chunk -->

## Ayurveda is a unique holistic system of healing based on the

<!-- chunk -->

## interaction of body, mind and spirit. It is thought to be the oldest

<!-- chunk -->

## health care system in the world with its roots going back over

<!-- chunk -->

## 5000 years into the Vedic Age. It evolved on the far reaches of

<!-- chunk -->

## the Himalayas from the deep wisdom of spiritually enlightened

<!-- chunk -->

## prophets or rishis. Their wisdom was transmitted orally from

<!-- chunk -->

## teacher to disciple and eventually set down in Sanskrit poetry

<!-- chunk -->

## known as the Vedas. These writings, dating approximately

<!-- chunk -->

## BC, distilled the prevailing historical, religious, philosophical and

<!-- chunk -->

## medical knowledge and form the basis of Indian culture. The

<!-- chunk -->

## most important of these texts are the Rig Veda and the Atharva

<!-- chunk -->

## Veda. Ayurveda has survived largely as an oral tradition until the

<!-- chunk -->

## present day, one of its greatest values being its timelessness and

<!-- chunk -->

## its application to every facet of daily living, now, as it was all

<!-- chunk -->

## those centuries ago.

<!-- chunk -->

## Ayurveda has had a strong influence on many systems of

<!-- chunk -->

## medicine, from ancient Greek medicine in the West, to traditional

<!-- chunk -->

## Chinese medicine in the East. The Chinese, Tibetan, and Islamic

<!-- chunk -->

## (Unani Tibb) systems of medicines are thought to have their

<!-- chunk -->

## roots in Ayurveda. The Buddha, who was born around 550 BC,

<!-- chunk -->

## was a follower of Ayurveda and the spread of Buddhism into

<!-- chunk -->

## Tibet during the following centuries was accompanied by

<!-- chunk -->

## increased practice of Ayurveda. The ancient civilisations were

<!-- chunk -->

## linked to one another by trade routes, campaigns and wars. Arab

<!-- chunk -->

## traders spread knowledge of Indian plants in their Materia

<!-- chunk -->

## Medicas and this knowledge was passed on to the ancient Greeks

<!-- chunk -->

## and Romans, whose practices were eventually to form the basis

<!-- chunk -->

## of European medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

## The first Ayurvedic medical school was founded around

<!-- chunk -->

## BCE by Punarvasu Atreya. He and his pupils recorded medical

<!-- chunk -->

## knowledge in treatises that would in turn influence Charaka, a

<!-- chunk -->

## scholar who lived and taught around 700 BC. His writings, the

<!-- chunk -->

## Charaka Samhita, describe 1500 plants, identifying 350 as

<!-- chunk -->

## valuable medicines. This major text is still considered the main

<!-- chunk -->

## authority today of Ayurveda and referred to constantly in both

<!-- chunk -->

## teaching and practice of Ayurveda. The second major work was

<!-- chunk -->

## the Susruta Samhita, written a century later, which forms the

<!-- chunk -->

<!-- chunk -->

## the medicinal properties of 700 healing plants.

# The Five Elements

<!-- chunk -->

## According to Ayurveda, the origin of all aspects of existence is

<!-- chunk -->

## the field of pure intellect or consciousness, known as purusha,

<!-- chunk -->

## and this appeals to those influenced by the theories of modern

<!-- chunk -->

## quantum physics that locate the basis of the physical universe in

<!-- chunk -->

## a single unified field that directs and orchestrates the continuous

<!-- chunk -->

## flow of matter. Energy and matter are one. Ayurveda does not

<!-- chunk -->

## separate the external from the inner world. Everything that exists

<!-- chunk -->

## in the macrocosm has its counterpart in the microcosm of the

<!-- chunk -->

## inner universe of a human being.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ayurvedic doctors use pulse diagnosis

<!-- chunk -->

### to assess a patient's constitution and

<!-- chunk -->

### their present state of health.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cosmic energy manifests in the five elements that are the basis

<!-- chunk -->

## of all matter – ether, air, fire, water and earth. In the body ether is

<!-- chunk -->

## present in the spaces such as the mouth, the abdomen, the thorax,

<!-- chunk -->

## the capillaries and cells; movement of space is air, manifest in

<!-- chunk -->

## movements of, for example, muscles, the pulsations of the heart,

<!-- chunk -->

## peristalsis of the digestive tract and nervous impulses. Fire is

<!-- chunk -->

## present in the digestive system, governing enzyme systems and

<!-- chunk -->

## metabolism, as well as body temperature, vision and the light of

<!-- chunk -->

## the mind, intelligence. Water is present in secretions like the

<!-- chunk -->

## digestive juices, saliva, mucous membranes, plasma and

<!-- chunk -->

## cytoplasm. Earth is responsible for the solid structures holding

<!-- chunk -->

## the body together, bones, cartilage, muscles and tendons as well

<!-- chunk -->

## as skin, hair and nails.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gathering herbs to be used in

<!-- chunk -->

### Ayurveda.

<!-- chunk -->

## The five elements manifest in the functioning of the five

<!-- chunk -->

## senses, and these in turn enable us to perceive and interact with

<!-- chunk -->

## the environment in which we live. Ether, air, fire, water and earth

# The Three Doshas

<!-- chunk -->

## From the five elements derive three basic forces, or humours, the

<!-- chunk -->

## tridoshas, which exist in everything and influence all mental and

<!-- chunk -->

## physical processes.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. From ether and air, vata, the air principle is created.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. From fire and water comes pitta, the fire principle.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. From earth and water derives the water principle, kapha.

<!-- chunk -->

## The balance of the doshas in each person will promote health

<!-- chunk -->

## and well-being, while imbalance leads to ill-health and disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## We are all born with a certain balance of doshas brought about

<!-- chunk -->

## mainly by the dosha balance in our parents at the time of our

<!-- chunk -->

## conception. This is our basic constitution (prakruti) that remains

<!-- chunk -->

## unchanged throughout our lives. The dominant dosha

<!-- chunk -->

## determines our body type, temperament and illness we may be

<!-- chunk -->

## susceptible to. Our vikruti, our present dosha balance, reflects the

<!-- chunk -->

## effect that lifestyle has on our prakruti to cause further

<!-- chunk -->

## imbalances that predispose to imbalance and ill health.

# Diagnosis and Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

## The first requirement for health in Ayurveda is proper balance of

<!-- chunk -->

## the doshas according to our prakruti. If the balance is disturbed

<!-- chunk -->

## by our diet, lifestyle or state of mind for example, illness

<!-- chunk -->

## (vyadhi) of one kind or another eventually results. The

<!-- chunk -->

## disruption may be felt in physical discomfort and pain, or in

<!-- chunk -->

## mental and emotional suffering such as fear and anxiety, anger or

<!-- chunk -->

## jealousy. Our current state of imbalance causing such symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

## to manifest is known as our vikruti.

<!-- chunk -->

## Both prakruti and vikruti can be ascertained by careful

<!-- chunk -->

## diagnosis which involves taking a detailed case history and

<!-- chunk -->

## examining the body, paying attention to build, skin and hair type,

<!-- chunk -->

## temperature of the body, digestion and bowel function, all of

<!-- chunk -->

## which point to more profound aspects of the patient's condition.

<!-- chunk -->

## Pulse and tongue diagnosis are exceptionally valuable tools for

<!-- chunk -->

## confirming analysis of health and constitution. In these respects

<!-- chunk -->

## Ayurveda has much in common with Chinese and Tibetan

<!-- chunk -->

## medicine, in which these two indicators of the state of health are

<!-- chunk -->

## also of the greatest importance. A highly complex technique for

<!-- chunk -->

## taking the patient's pulse has been developed by Ayurvedic

<!-- chunk -->

## practitioners, which requires many years of practice to perfect.

<!-- chunk -->

## Once the dosha balance has been diagnosed and the causes of

<!-- chunk -->

## imbalance have been established, treatment and lifestyle advice is

<!-- chunk -->

## given. The first step back to health is the elimination of toxins

<!-- chunk -->

## and enhancing digestion or raising digestive fire, known as agni.

<!-- chunk -->

## Treatments fall into three main categories:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Natural medicines

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Dietary regimes

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Lifestyle changes

<!-- chunk -->

### Dhanwantari was known in the Vedas

<!-- chunk -->

### as the physician of the gods and the

<!-- chunk -->

### patron saint of Ayurveda.

<!-- chunk -->

### An Ayurvedic massage with herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

## These are all classified according to their effect on the three

<!-- chunk -->

## doshas. To illustrate, a health problem associated with excess

<!-- chunk -->

## kapha could be characterised by catarrh, lethargy, weight gain

<!-- chunk -->

## and fluid retention. A diet consisting of warm, dry, light food

<!-- chunk -->

## would be advised since kapha is cool and damp. Avoidance of

<!-- chunk -->

## foods with a cold, damp quality such as wheat and milk products

<!-- chunk -->

## and sugar, which would serve to increase kapha, would also be

<!-- chunk -->

## recommended. Herbal remedies would include warming spices

<!-- chunk -->

## like ginger, cinnamon, cloves and pepper to raise the digestive

<!-- chunk -->

## fire and cleanse toxins from the body. Bitters such as turmeric

<!-- chunk -->

## and aloe vera may also be prescribed.

<!-- chunk -->

## The specific choice of herbal remedy depends on its “quality”

<!-- chunk -->

## or “energy” which Ayurveda determines according to

<!-- chunk -->

## attributes (vimshati guna) such as hot, cold, wet, dry, heavy or

<!-- chunk -->

## light.

<!-- chunk -->

## Ayurveda also classifies remedies according to six tastes:

<!-- chunk -->

## sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter and astringent.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Sweet, sour and salty substances increase kapha and decrease

<!-- chunk -->

## vata.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Pungent, bitter and astringent tastes decrease kapha and

<!-- chunk -->

## increase vata.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Sweet, bitter and astringent taste decrease pitta and pungent,

<!-- chunk -->

## salty and sour increase pitta.

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbs from the Ayurvedic tradition include amalaki (Emblica

<!-- chunk -->

## officinalis), shatavari (Asparagus racemosus), ashwagandha

<!-- chunk -->

## (Withania somnifera), bacopa (Bacopa monnieri), guduchi

<!-- chunk -->

## (Tinospora cordifolia), gotu kola (Centella asiatica), long

<!-- chunk -->

## pepper, holy basil (Ocimum sanctum), guggulu (Commiphora

<!-- chunk -->

## mukul), cinnamon, coriander, andrographis (Andrographis

<!-- chunk -->

## paniculata), aloe vera, neem, frankincense (Boswellia serrulata)

<!-- chunk -->

## and turmeric.

<!-- chunk -->

## Detoxification is an important part of Ayurvedic treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

## This can be done gently with the help and guidance of an

<!-- chunk -->

## Ayurvedic practitioner, in which case it is known as shamana.

<!-- chunk -->

## Shodana is a more intense detoxification process known as

<!-- chunk -->

## panchakarma which is done in-house over a period of a month

<!-- chunk -->

## ideally. Panchakarma involves a thorough cleansing and

<!-- chunk -->

## rejuvenation programme, and is available mainly in treatment

<!-- chunk -->

## centres in South India and Sri Lanka, but centres do exist also in

<!-- chunk -->

## Europe and North America. Panchakarma includes the use of oil

<!-- chunk -->

## massage, sweating, therapeutic vomiting, purging, enemas, nasal

<!-- chunk -->

## administration of medicine, and purification of blood.

# Preparations

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbal remedies are prepared in varying mediums, according to

<!-- chunk -->

## the predominant dosha being treated. Often herbs given to

<!-- chunk -->

## balance vata are given in warm milk, those for reducing pitta in

<!-- chunk -->

## ghee and those to reduce kapha are prepared in honey.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sometimes minute doses of minerals such as salt are also mixed

<!-- chunk -->

## with the herbs. Remedies take the form of pills, powders,

<!-- chunk -->

## decoctions and alcohol extracts and most contain several

<!-- chunk -->

## ingredients all carefully tailored to individual needs.

# Ayurveda Today

<!-- chunk -->

## The value of Ayurveda is proved partly by its timelessness, since

<!-- chunk -->

## it has existed as an unbroken tradition for thousands of years,

<!-- chunk -->

## despite a number of setbacks. Following the rise of the Mogul

<!-- chunk -->

## Empire in the 16th century, the dominance of Unani Tibb

<!-- chunk -->

## medicine led to the partial repression of Ayurveda in India. In the

<!-- chunk -->

## 19th century, the British dismissed it as nothing more than native

<!-- chunk -->

## superstition and in 1833, they closed all Ayurvedic schools and

<!-- chunk -->

## banned the practice of Ayurveda. Great centres of Indian

<!-- chunk -->

## learning thus fell apart and Ayurvedic knowledge retreated into

<!-- chunk -->

## the villages and temples. At the turn of the century, however,

<!-- chunk -->

## some Indian physicians and enlightened Englishmen began to re-

<!-- chunk -->

## evaluate Ayurveda, and by the time India had become

<!-- chunk -->

## independent in 1947, it had regained its reputation as a valid

<!-- chunk -->

## healing system. Today in India Ayurveda flourishes alongside

<!-- chunk -->

## Unani Tibb and Western allopathic medicine and is actively

<!-- chunk -->

## encouraged by the Indian government as an inexpensive

<!-- chunk -->

## alternative to Western drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bacopa monnieri, also known as

<!-- chunk -->

### brahmi, is used in Ayurvedic

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

## In recent years Ayurveda has increasingly attracted attention

<!-- chunk -->

## from medical scientists in Japan and the West and the World

<!-- chunk -->

## Health organisation has resolved to promote its practice in

<!-- chunk -->

## developing countries. Here in the West, the popularity of

<!-- chunk -->

## Ayurveda is growing daily as more and more people recognise

<!-- chunk -->

## its immense value, not only in the prevention and treatment of

<!-- chunk -->

## disease, but also for its comprehensive recipe for a better,

<!-- chunk -->

## healthier way of life that addresses all facets of our existence:

<!-- chunk -->

## mind, body and spirit.

# Chinese Herbal Medicine

# Traditional Chinese medicine is a system of

# healing as ancient as Ayurveda with an unbroken

# tradition that can be traced back to around

# BC and includes oriental traditions from

# Southeast Asia that originally came from China.

# The first, maybe mythical herbalist was

# Shennong, who imparted his knowledge of

# hundreds of medicinal and poisonous plants to

# farmers.

### medicinal substances.

<!-- chunk -->

## The first major text, the Shen Nong Bencao Jing (The Yellow

<!-- chunk -->

## Emperor's Classic of Materia Medica), dated around 1000 BC in

<!-- chunk -->

## the Han dynasty, describes 365 medicines, over 250 of which are

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs, their physical actions and applications. Later additions to

<!-- chunk -->

## herbal knowledge followed the style and format of the Classic,

<!-- chunk -->

## placing emphasis on taste, the herb's heating or cooling nature,

<!-- chunk -->

## which organs and meridians it primarily affects, dosage ranges,

<!-- chunk -->

## degree of toxicity, and overall effects of the herb on specific

<!-- chunk -->

## patterns of symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Shen Nong divided medicines into 3 categories:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Superior herbs which are the main remedies for returning the

<!-- chunk -->

## body and mind to health;

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Middle level tonic herbs which boost energy and immunity;

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Low level, more powerful herbs that should only be taken in

<!-- chunk -->

## small doses for specific symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Compendium of Materia Medica (Bencao Gangmu) was

<!-- chunk -->

## compiled in the 16th century during the Ming dynasty, by Li

<!-- chunk -->

## Shizhen, and lists all the plants, animals, and minerals used in

<!-- chunk -->

## Chinese medicine at the time. It includes herbs that are still used

# Traditional Chinese Medicine Today

<!-- chunk -->

## As in Ayurvedic medicine, these early texts are still studied and

<!-- chunk -->

## their precepts adhered to by modern practitioners of Chinese

<!-- chunk -->

## medicine. At the same time, Chinese medicine has continually

<!-- chunk -->

## been developed and refined in response to cultural and clinical

<!-- chunk -->

## advances and ongoing research. It survived through the rise and

<!-- chunk -->

## fall of several dynasties, and still exists happily in China

<!-- chunk -->

## alongside Western allopathic medicine, providing healthcare for

<!-- chunk -->

## the majority of the Chinese population. It continues to grow in

<!-- chunk -->

## popularity in the West despite occasional bad press concerning

<!-- chunk -->

## the adverse effects of certain Chinese herbs.

# The Life Force

<!-- chunk -->

## The Chinese, like the Indians, regard the human body and all its

<!-- chunk -->

## functions as a microcosm of the macrocosm. All forms of life are

<!-- chunk -->

## seen to be animated by the same essential life force called qi. By

<!-- chunk -->

## breathing we take in qi from the air and pass it into the lungs,

<!-- chunk -->

## and by digesting we extract qi from food and drink and pass it

<!-- chunk -->

## into the body. When these qis meet in the bloodstream they

<!-- chunk -->

## become known as human qi, which circulates around the body as

<!-- chunk -->

## vital energy. The quality, quantity and balance of qi in each

<!-- chunk -->

## person influences their state of health and lifespan, and this in

<!-- chunk -->

## turn is affected by factors such as the season, climate, lifestyle,

<!-- chunk -->

## diet and air. Wind, dampness, dryness, heat, and cold can

<!-- chunk -->

## derange the internal balance of the body, obstructing the

<!-- chunk -->

## movement of qi in the organs. Disturbance of internal wind

<!-- chunk -->

## causes vertigo, unsteady movement, and trembling; dampness

<!-- chunk -->

## causes increases phlegm and oedema, dryness causes drying of

<!-- chunk -->

## mucus membranes, cold decreases circulation and slows

<!-- chunk -->

## metabolism, while excess heat leads to inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Qi flows through a network of channels, or meridians,

<!-- chunk -->

## throughout the body, and can be stimulated and balanced using

<!-- chunk -->

## acupuncture, acupressure, diet and herbal medicine. The body is

<!-- chunk -->

## also composed of moisture, which is the fluid in the body that

<!-- chunk -->

## protects, nurtures and lubricates the tissues and blood, which is

<!-- chunk -->

## the basic material from which bone, muscle, nerves, organs and

<!-- chunk -->

## skin are made. For the body to be adequately healthy qi, moisture

<!-- chunk -->

## and blood need to circulate within a network of channels that

<!-- chunk -->

## connect all parts of the body. All illness is seen as a result of

<!-- chunk -->

## either depletion or congestion of qi, moisture and blood caused

<!-- chunk -->

## by unhealthy diets and lifestyle, stress, tension, overwork, lack

<!-- chunk -->

## of exercise or any other thing that impairs the ability of the organ

<!-- chunk -->

## networks to function properly.

<!-- chunk -->

### A Chinese herbalist's vase.

# Yin and Yang

<!-- chunk -->

## The principles of Chinese medicine originate in traditional Taoist

<!-- chunk -->

## philosophy, China's most ancient school of thought. Central to

<!-- chunk -->

## this philosophy is the idea of fluctuation and mutability,

<!-- chunk -->

## explaining natural phenomena in terms of the constant ebb and

<!-- chunk -->

## flow of cosmic forces. Yin and yang, the two primordial cosmic

<!-- chunk -->

## forces, are concepts that are familiar to many. Yin symbolises

<!-- chunk -->

## passive, yielding force that is cold, dark, negative, contractive

<!-- chunk -->

## and female, represented by water. Yang is active, positive, hot,

<!-- chunk -->

## light, expansive and male, symbolised by fire. The constant

<!-- chunk -->

## interplay between these opposite and mutually dependent forces,

<!-- chunk -->

## produces all the change and movement in the universe. Different

<!-- chunk -->

## parts of the body are described as predominantly yin or yang. Yin

<!-- chunk -->

## is found in the internal, lower and front part of the body, in the

<!-- chunk -->

## body fluids and blood, and it governs innate instincts, while

<!-- chunk -->

## yang governs qi, vital energy and learned skills, and presides in

<!-- chunk -->

## the upper, external and back parts of the body. To maintain

<!-- chunk -->

## health, yin and yang need to be in balance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chinese herbs are often used

<!-- chunk -->

### combined in formulae; synergy

<!-- chunk -->

### increases their therapeutic benefits.

# The Five Elements

<!-- chunk -->

## As in Ayurveda, the theory of five elements is vital to the

<!-- chunk -->

## Chinese understanding of life in all its variety. Wood, fire, earth,

<!-- chunk -->

## metal and water are the elements that compose and relate to all

<!-- chunk -->

## aspects of life, including parts of the body, vital organs,

<!-- chunk -->

## emotions, seasons, colours and tastes. To illustrate, wood relates

<!-- chunk -->

## to spring, the colour green, the liver and gall bladder, anger and

<!-- chunk -->

## the sour taste. Fire corresponds to summer, the heart and small

<!-- chunk -->

## intestine, joy and bitter taste.

<!-- chunk -->

## The constant interplay of the five elements along with that of

<!-- chunk -->

## yin and yang spark off all change and activity in nature. The

<!-- chunk -->

## fundamental relationships among the five elements are the key to

<!-- chunk -->

## understanding how our bodies and the environment interact and

<!-- chunk -->

## influence each other. To maintain good health, the elements need

<!-- chunk -->

## to be in harmony and if one element becomes over-dominant,

<!-- chunk -->

## imbalance and illness can result. Although the emphasis is on the

<!-- chunk -->

## internal causation of a disease, traditional Chinese medicine

<!-- chunk -->

## recognises that outside factors play a role. A 2nd century CE

<!-- chunk -->

## physician called Zhang Zhongjing wrote the Treatise of Cold-

<!-- chunk -->

## Damage Disorders, which described the diagnosis and treatment

<!-- chunk -->

## of diseases caused by external cold factors; in effect, this referred

<!-- chunk -->

## to infectious diseases.

# The Organ Networks

<!-- chunk -->

## The body is also divided into five functional systems called

<!-- chunk -->

## organ networks. These govern certain tissues, as well as mental

<!-- chunk -->

## and physical activities by regulating and preserving qi, moisture,

<!-- chunk -->

## blood, spirit (shen), and essence (jing). The kidney network is

<!-- chunk -->

## responsible for fluid balance in the body and also stores the

<!-- chunk -->

## essence or jing, which is responsible for fertility, growth, and

<!-- chunk -->

## regeneration. Its province is the teeth, bones, marrow, brain,

<!-- chunk -->

## inner ear, pupil of the eye, and the lower back, as well as the

<!-- chunk -->

## emotion of fear, the will, and the ability to think and see things

<!-- chunk -->

## clearly. The heart network circulates blood and is the home of the

<!-- chunk -->

## spirit (shen) and governs the mind. The spleen network governs

<!-- chunk -->

## digestion and assimilation of food and fluids, as well as digestion

<!-- chunk -->

## of information and ideas, while the liver network controls the

<!-- chunk -->

## storage of blood, flow of qi, and stability of mood and

<!-- chunk -->

## temperament. The lung network governs breathing, circulation

<!-- chunk -->

## and the distribution of moisture.

# Diagnosis and Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

## This involves taking a case history which includes the patient's

<!-- chunk -->

## present and past complaints, lifestyle, physical environment,

<!-- chunk -->

## family health history, work, home and emotional life. It also

<!-- chunk -->

## includes reading of the basic indicators of health and disease

<!-- chunk -->

## such as the complexion, lustre of the eyes and hair, colour and

<!-- chunk -->

## texture of the tongue and its coating. Pulse and tongue diagnosis

<!-- chunk -->

## are the principal diagnostic tools of the practitioner of Chinese

<!-- chunk -->

## medicine and enable the practitioner to detect imbalances and ill

<!-- chunk -->

## health before they show up on other modern diagnostic

<!-- chunk -->

## apparatus such as blood tests and x-rays.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chinese treatment works to balance

<!-- chunk -->

### the four natures that relates to the

<!-- chunk -->

### degree of yin and yang within each

<!-- chunk -->

### individual.

## Scutellaria baicalensis (see page 236)

<!-- chunk -->

## Treatment is aimed at harmonizing yin and yang, wet and dry,

<!-- chunk -->

## cold and heat, inner and outer, body and mind by regulating the

<!-- chunk -->

## qi, moisture and blood in the organ networks. Treatment may

<!-- chunk -->

## combine herbs, diet, exercise, and massage. Chinese herbs have

<!-- chunk -->

## been classified according to the four natures, the five tastes and

<!-- chunk -->

## the meridians. The four natures relates to the degrees of yin and

<!-- chunk -->

## yang which are: cold (extreme yin), cool, warm and hot (extreme

<!-- chunk -->

## yang).

<!-- chunk -->

## As in Tibetan and Unani medicine, herbs and foods are all

<!-- chunk -->

## composed of five tastes: pungent, sweet, sour, bitter and salty,

<!-- chunk -->

## each of which has different qualities and actions in the body.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Pungent herbs increase production of sweat and direct and

<!-- chunk -->

## increase qi and blood.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Sweet herbs are nourishing and toning, and some act as

<!-- chunk -->

## diuretics to drain dampness.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Sour herbs are astringent, bitter herbs clear heat and

<!-- chunk -->

## dampness.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Salty herbs are used to stimulate the bowels and reduce hard

<!-- chunk -->

## masses.

<!-- chunk -->

## 5. Herbs that nourish the qi have an energising effect, herbs to

<!-- chunk -->

## enrich the blood help sleep, vision and mood, while herbs to

<!-- chunk -->

## replenish moisture soften the skin and relieve thirst. The

<!-- chunk -->

## meridians relate to the organ networks that can be helped by

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs to do their work.

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbs are usually combined in formulae to enhance their

<!-- chunk -->

## action either in the form of dried herbs for decoctions, ground

<!-- chunk -->

## and produced as pills and powders or used in liquid extracts.

<!-- chunk -->

## Some practitioners use patent formulae in the form of pills which

<!-- chunk -->

## are certainly more easy and convenient for the patient than

<!-- chunk -->

## boiling up herbs in decoctions, but do not allow for the

<!-- chunk -->

## individualised prescriptions that practitioners can formulate

<!-- chunk -->

## themselves in response to the specific needs of each patient.

<!-- chunk -->

## Research into the medicinal properties of Chinese herbal

<!-- chunk -->

## remedies has led to some being adopted by Western medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

## For example, the drug artemisinin, used to treat drug-resistant

# The Healing Tradition in North

# America

# Native North American herbalism was a shamanic

# tradition – ritualistic dances, playing drums and

# rattles and taking mind-altering plants such as

# peyote and datura were intended to enable the

# shaman or medicine man or woman to enter a

# trance-like visionary state to enable him or her to

# communicate with the spirit world, including the

# Great Spirit (Wakan Tanka, in the language of the

# Lakota Sioux, like a notion of God that permeates

# everything), and the soul of the ill person in order

# to bring about healing. Help was sought in this

# way for healing physical ills and troubles of the

# psyche, and to engender harmony within

# communities or between individuals.

<!-- chunk -->

## Plants were revered not only for their ability to cure diseases of

<!-- chunk -->

## the body but also imbalances in the mind, emotions and spirit.

<!-- chunk -->

## They were an inextricable part of the Native American religion

<!-- chunk -->

## and mythology, used in ceremonies and rituals. Disease was seen

<!-- chunk -->

## to be caused by human, supernatural or natural causes and the

<!-- chunk -->

## medicine man or woman was called upon to administer herbs for

<!-- chunk -->

## anything from wounds and broken bones to unfulfilled dreams,

<!-- chunk -->

## spiritual intrusion and soul loss.

<!-- chunk -->

## Everything was performed traditionally in a circle, and

<!-- chunk -->

## according to Black Elk of the Teton Dakato, the “Power of the

<!-- chunk -->

## World” always worked in circles. “All our power came to us

<!-- chunk -->

## from the sacred loop of the nation”, he said, and his people

<!-- chunk -->

## flourished as long as the circle was unbroken. “The flowering

<!-- chunk -->

## circle of the four quarters nourished it. The east gave peace and

<!-- chunk -->

## light, the south gave warmth, the west gave rain and the north

<!-- chunk -->

## with its cold and mighty wind gave strength and endurance.”

<!-- chunk -->

## A group of herbalists in 19th century North America, known

<!-- chunk -->

## as Physiomedicalists, blended together the traditions of European

<!-- chunk -->

## herbalism brought to America by the Pilgrim fathers, with the

<!-- chunk -->

## herbal wisdom of the North American Indians. These herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## included pleurisy root (Asclepias tuberosa), barberry (Berberis

<!-- chunk -->

## vulgaris), black cohosh (Actaea racemosus), gravel root

<!-- chunk -->

## (Eupatorium purpureum), boneset (Eupatorium perfoliatum),

<!-- chunk -->

## golden seal (Hydrastis Canadensis), witch hazel (Hamamelis

<!-- chunk -->

## virginaurea), poke root (Phytolacca decandra), cramp bark

<!-- chunk -->

## (Viburnum opulus) and black haw (Viburnum prunifolium). The

<!-- chunk -->

## renowned founder of Physiomedicalism was Dr Samuel

<!-- chunk -->

## Thomson (1769-1843) who was the first to bring the Native

<!-- chunk -->

## American remedy Lobelia to the attention of the medical world.

<!-- chunk -->

## He kept alive traditional ideas of allowing the body to heal itself

<!-- chunk -->

## and helping to create the ideal conditions for this with the use of

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs, and mixed it with knowledge he had gained by

<!-- chunk -->

## observation of the Native American medicine men, such as the

<!-- chunk -->

## value of sweating for clearing toxins from the body.

<!-- chunk -->

## Baptisia tinctoria (see page 128)

<!-- chunk -->

## Berberis (see page 133)

<!-- chunk -->

## Like ancient and modern herbalists, Thomson recognised the

<!-- chunk -->

## presence of the vital force that flows throughout nature and

<!-- chunk -->

## animates all in existence. Described as the spirits by the ancient

<!-- chunk -->

## Greeks and American cultures, the qi of China's medicine and

<!-- chunk -->

## philosophy, and prana of Ayurveda, the vital force is our innate

<!-- chunk -->

## healing energy that manifests itself daily in the amazing feats of

<!-- chunk -->

## the body including coughing to clear the airways of phlegm,

<!-- chunk -->

## sneezing to shift irritants from the nose, vomiting to clear the

<!-- chunk -->

## stomach of infection, and diarrhoea to remove toxins from the

<!-- chunk -->

## Thomson also held that all bodies were composed of the four

<!-- chunk -->

## elements, earth, air, fire and water, and health derived from their

<!-- chunk -->

## harmonious interplay. Herbs were used primarily to maintain or

<!-- chunk -->

## correct this balance, and prescriptions were designed to do one

<!-- chunk -->

## of four things: astringe (tone) or relax, stimulate or sedate.

<!-- chunk -->

## Toning herbs included shepherd's purse, agrimony and beth root;

<!-- chunk -->

## relaxing herbs included crampbark and lemon balm. Ginger and

<!-- chunk -->

## cayenne were seen as stimulating while chamomile and yellow

<!-- chunk -->

## jasmine were sedating. Thomson's model of physiomedicalism

<!-- chunk -->

## was followed in America by other botanic schools, notably the

<!-- chunk -->

## Ecletics founded by Dr Wooster Beech in the 1830s, who also

<!-- chunk -->

## used native Indian traditions mixed with European knowledge

<!-- chunk -->

## and orthodox medical practices. Physiomedicalism was brought

<!-- chunk -->

## to England in 1838 by Dr Albert Coffin, and Wooster Beech

<!-- chunk -->

## arrived in the 1850s to bring Eclectic medicine to Europe.

<!-- chunk -->

## Although Thomson's ideas met with enormous opposition from

<!-- chunk -->

## allopathic doctors in America, as the same ideas have survived in

<!-- chunk -->

## Europe until more recently. They are the same ideas that formed

<!-- chunk -->

## the basis of Hippocrates' humoral medicine, and the vast systems

<!-- chunk -->

## of Chinese, Indian and Tibetan medicine.

# Aromatherapy

# The use of essential oils distilled from highly

# scented plants is hugely popular, a natural enough

# fact given that people have enjoyed the perfumes

# of plants as far back as we can remember. Most

# ancient civilisations have used fragrant oils and

# plants; herbs, flowers and aromatic woods were

# burned in temples to purify the atmosphere and to

# please the gods. Their perfumes were believed to

# rise higher than the temple ceilings to the heavens

# where they scented the realms of Paradise. In

# Biblical times, aromatic oils were used for

# anointing and as temple incense; we read of

# spikenard, myrrh and frankincense, camphor and

# cinnamon that perfumed the rooms of temples

# and palaces. Myrrh and frankincense were

# obviously so highly valued that they were

# considered by the Magi to be worthy gifts for the

# infant Jesus.

<!-- chunk -->

## The ancient Egyptians used aromatic oils skillfully in their

<!-- chunk -->

## healing ointments and in the mummification process, and used

<!-- chunk -->

## perfumes in courtship just as we do today; Queen Cleopatra's

<!-- chunk -->

## royal barge apparently emitted the most exotic perfumes as it

<!-- chunk -->

## sailed down the Nile to meet Mark Anthony. Cleopatra is said to

<!-- chunk -->

## have bathed several times daily with essence of rose and orange

<!-- chunk -->

## blossom. The Romans loved aromatic oils, favouring rose above

<!-- chunk -->

## all for wine making, perfumes and their famous baths. When the

<!-- chunk -->

## fashion for bathing died out or when water was short, aromatic

<!-- chunk -->

## oils would be applied to skin and clothes to mask more

<!-- chunk -->

## unpleasant smells – they were particularly popular in Tudor and

<!-- chunk -->

## Elizabethan times. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, perfumed

<!-- chunk -->

## gloves were the height of fashion, and in fact Queen Elizabeth

<!-- chunk -->

## herself possessed her own still room for distilling oils for making

<!-- chunk -->

## the royal floral perfumes. So powerful was the effect of scent

<!-- chunk -->

## with its sensual, often mind-altering properties, that when the

<!-- chunk -->

## Crusaders returned from the Holy Land laden with perfumes of

<!-- chunk -->

## the Orient, the medieval clergy were greatly alarmed and

<!-- chunk -->

## associated it with the forces of evil. Later in the eighteenth

<!-- chunk -->

## century the House of Commons considered applying the laws of

<!-- chunk -->

## witchcraft against women who tried to seduce any of the crown's

<!-- chunk -->

## subjects into marriage with the aid of scent! Certainly the exotic

<!-- chunk -->

## fragrances of plants have traditionally been associated with the

<!-- chunk -->

## supernatural, and used in love potions as well as magical and

<!-- chunk -->

## religious ceremonies to heighten perception, and for divination.

# Healing Heritage

<!-- chunk -->

## Fragrant oils have also long been used in healing. From

<!-- chunk -->

## Hippocrates onwards we know that aromatic baths, massages and

<!-- chunk -->

## inhalations have been employed to remedy all kinds of health

<!-- chunk -->

## problems. Herbs such as rosemary, pine and juniper were burnt

<!-- chunk -->

## and pomanders were worn to keep contagion away and for

<!-- chunk -->

## protection during epidemics. With the development of scientific

<!-- chunk -->

## analysis of plants and their constituents, more has become

<!-- chunk -->

## known about the amazing range of biochemical constituents that

<!-- chunk -->

## make up the volatile oils. In the 1920s a French chemist, Rene

<!-- chunk -->

## Gattefosse, brought the healing benefits of oils to the attention of

<!-- chunk -->

## the orthodox scientific world, which by now was disregarding

<!-- chunk -->

## much of the benefit to be derived from the plant world,

<!-- chunk -->

## preferring to develop the synthesis of more powerful drugs in

<!-- chunk -->

## the laboratory. Gattefosse had a family perfume business and

<!-- chunk -->

## while experimenting in his laboratory, he burnt his arm badly

<!-- chunk -->

## and plunged it into the nearby vat of lavender oil. To his great

<!-- chunk -->

## delight his arm healed quickly with no scarring. Gattefosse was

<!-- chunk -->

## then inspired to devote much time to researching essential oils

<!-- chunk -->

## and their medical application, particularly in relation to their

<!-- chunk -->

## benefit on the skin. In 1937 he published his book

<!-- chunk -->

## Aromatherapy, the name he coined for describing the healing

<!-- chunk -->

## benefits of essential oils that is still used to this day. Gattefosse's

<!-- chunk -->

## research papers were read by a French army doctor, Jean Valnet,

<!-- chunk -->

## who was so interested in the subject he began his own clinical

<!-- chunk -->

## research using oils on soldiers as antiseptics and wound healers,

<!-- chunk -->

## and was greatly impressed by their efficacy. He then began to

<!-- chunk -->

## experiment with treating the emotional or psychological

<!-- chunk -->

## problems of war veterans, and to write extensively about

<!-- chunk -->

## aromatherapy. His Practice of Aromatherapy, published in 1964,

<!-- chunk -->

## is a standard text now for all professional aromatherapists.

<!-- chunk -->

### Essential oils are stored in dark glass

<!-- chunk -->

### bottles to preserve active ingredients

<!-- chunk -->

### that are destroyed by light and heat.

# Modern Aromatherapy

<!-- chunk -->

## The practice of aromatherapy as it exists today, using essential

<!-- chunk -->

## oils with massage for health and well-being, was actually

<!-- chunk -->

## popularised by an Austrian biochemist, Marguerite Maury. She

<!-- chunk -->

## was particularly interested in the healing and rejuvenating

<!-- chunk -->

## properties of essential oils and carried out an extensive research

<!-- chunk -->

## programme on the effectiveness of oils when absorbed through

<!-- chunk -->

## the skin. She went on to write about essential oils and publicised

<!-- chunk -->

## La Capital Jeuness in 1961, which has been reprinted and

<!-- chunk -->

## translated into English as The Secret of Life and Youth. Dr Maury

<!-- chunk -->

## opened several clinics for aromatherapy, offering massage using

<!-- chunk -->

## essential oils to treat a wide range of physical problems and to

<!-- chunk -->

## address underlying emotional and mental problems. Many

<!-- chunk -->

## practitioners have since followed her example. As well as the

<!-- chunk -->

## great versatility of the effects of essential oils, massage gives the

<!-- chunk -->

## opportunity of benefiting from the comfort of touch, and the

<!-- chunk -->

## great therapeutic value that brings.

<!-- chunk -->

## Volatile oils can be taken into the body in a variety of different

<!-- chunk -->

## ways. They can be taken in aromatic herbs in foods and drinks;

<!-- chunk -->

## diluted in a carrier oil and rubbed on to the skin, or inhaled

<!-- chunk -->

## through the nose stimulating olfactory receptor cells to carry

<!-- chunk -->

## nerve impulses to the brain, especially the limbic system, where

<!-- chunk -->

## they have the potential to affect our instinctual responses,

<!-- chunk -->

## emotions and memory. As oils are inhaled, molecules are also

<!-- chunk -->

## taken via the lungs into the bloodstream and the systemic

<!-- chunk -->

## circulation. Their actions are felt throughout the digestive tract,

<!-- chunk -->

## the urinary tract and the respiratory system, and affect sweat,

<!-- chunk -->

## salivary, vaginal and lacrimal secretions. It is probable that the

<!-- chunk -->

## oils are passed in some amount through the breast milk; fennel,

<!-- chunk -->

## dill and chamomile tea for example have been drunk for

<!-- chunk -->

## centuries by lactating women to soothe babies' colic and help

<!-- chunk -->

## induce sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lavendula, or lavender, when

<!-- chunk -->

### distilled as an essential oil, was

<!-- chunk -->

### discovered by the French chemist

<!-- chunk -->

### Rene Gattefosse to be a powerful

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment for burns.

<!-- chunk -->

## When oils are absorbed through the skin during massage or

<!-- chunk -->

## baths, they stimulate nerve endings in the skin and messages are

<!-- chunk -->

## relayed to underlying tissues, muscles, blood and lymphatic

<!-- chunk -->

## vessels, and also via the nervous system to the pituitary gland,

<!-- chunk -->

## thereby having the ability to regulate the action of other

<!-- chunk -->

## endocrine glands, including the adrenals. This can be helpful in

<!-- chunk -->

## the treatment of hormonal problems and stress-related symptoms.

# Flower Remedies

# The story of flower remedies begins really with

# Dr Bach. Dr Edward Bach (1886-1936) was a

# man of deep compassion for those suffering pain

# or distress. This led him to train in medicine and

# become a respected immunologist, pathologist

# and bacteriologist. Dissatisfied, however, with

# medicine's palliative rather than curative effect on

# illness, he was driven to continue studying,

# knowing that true health and well-being comes

# from within and depends on harmony of body,

# mind, emotion and spirit. His research as a

# bacteriologist led to his discovery of the

# relationship between the bacterial population of

# the gut and chronic illness and the use of vaccines

# from these bacteria. In 1919, working in the

# London Homoeopathic Hospital, he realised the

# work and philosophy of Dr Samuel Hahnemann

# echoed much of his own approach to medicine –

# the treatment of the person, not the disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## He began to prepare his vaccines homeopathically and used them

<!-- chunk -->

## with great success. However, he still felt that he was working in

<!-- chunk -->

## the area of physical disease and not addressing the underlying

<!-- chunk -->

## causes. His understanding was that disease resulted from inner

<!-- chunk -->

## disharmony, negative thoughts and feelings, which were

<!-- chunk -->

## frequently manifested on a physical level. He saw that the strain

<!-- chunk -->

## of stress causing fear, anxiety, panic, anger, intolerance and

<!-- chunk -->

## impatience, depleted general vitality and resistance to disease.

# Dr Bach's Discoveries

<!-- chunk -->

## Dr Bach had a great love of nature and intuitively understood

<!-- chunk -->

## that remedies to emotional pain and suffering could be found

<!-- chunk -->

## among flowers, herbs and trees. So, at the height of his medical

<!-- chunk -->

## career, he left to spend the rest of his life travelling in Wales and

<!-- chunk -->

## Southern England in search of remedies to restore peace of mind

<!-- chunk -->

## and happiness which he believed to be the essential nature of our

<!-- chunk -->

## being. During this time he discovered 38 flower remedies, which

<!-- chunk -->

## provided answers to our many sufferings, derived (with the

<!-- chunk -->

## exception of one) from flowering trees and plants. He realised

<!-- chunk -->

## that the early morning dew on plants exposed to sunlight

<!-- chunk -->

## absorbed the properties of that plant better than on those growing

<!-- chunk -->

## in the shade. So he devised the “sun method” of extracting the

<!-- chunk -->

## properties of the plants. This involves floating picked flower

<!-- chunk -->

## heads in a glass bowl on top of spring water that fills it. The

<!-- chunk -->

## bowl is placed on the ground near the parent plants and exposed

<!-- chunk -->

## to sunlight for a few hours, after which time the flowers are

<!-- chunk -->

## removed carefully with a twig or a leaf. The essence is then

<!-- chunk -->

## poured into bottles half full of brandy to preserve it. The “boiling

<!-- chunk -->

## method” involves placing the plant in an enamel pan of spring

<!-- chunk -->

## water and simmering it for half an hour. Once cool, the essence

<!-- chunk -->

## is filtered and preserved in equal parts of brandy. He published

<!-- chunk -->

## his discoveries in main homoeopathic journals and produced

<!-- chunk -->

## several booklets for lay people, so that his remedies would be

<!-- chunk -->

## accessible to everyone. These included Heal Thyself, Free Thyself

<!-- chunk -->

## and The 12 Healers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rose (above), distilled as a flower

<!-- chunk -->

### essence (above right), lifts the spirits

<!-- chunk -->

### unknown.

# The Flower Essence Society

<!-- chunk -->

## Although flower remedies are associated with Dr Bach, they

<!-- chunk -->

## were actually described in the 1500s by Paracelsus, who

<!-- chunk -->

## prepared remedies from dew he had collected from flowers to

<!-- chunk -->

## treat his patients' emotional problems. In the early seventies

<!-- chunk -->

## “flower power” were the words on many people's lips,

<!-- chunk -->

## particularly in California, and people would refer to “good

<!-- chunk -->

## vibrations”, and they were interested in the wisdom of the East,

<!-- chunk -->

## the power of love and meditation. Flowers were in vogue, and

<!-- chunk -->

## not surprisingly a variety of people in the healing and psychic

<!-- chunk -->

## world began to discover intuitively a whole host of new flower

<!-- chunk -->

## essences. Within the context of mind altering substances and

<!-- chunk -->

## popular New Age concepts, the profusion of flower remedies

<!-- chunk -->

## was causing some confusion, with some doubt as to whether

<!-- chunk -->

## allegations for their remarkable healing abilities was actually

<!-- chunk -->

## sound or not. Richard Katz and Patricia Kaminski were among

<!-- chunk -->

## those who were developing flower essences, having worked with

<!-- chunk -->

## the Bach flower remedies for many years, but were concerned

<!-- chunk -->

## that charlatans in the area would bring flower healing into

<!-- chunk -->

## disrepute. In 1979 they set up the Flower Essence Society (FES)

<!-- chunk -->

## to separate the wheat from the chaff, to gather case studies from

<!-- chunk -->

## practitioners worldwide to confirm the genuine effects of flower

<!-- chunk -->

## essences, and to run training courses for students and seminars

<!-- chunk -->

## for practitioners. After extensive testing of their remedies on

<!-- chunk -->

## health practitioners, the FES produced a range of flower essences

<!-- chunk -->

## called Quintessentials made from organically grown flowers

<!-- chunk -->

## cultivated around the Californian Sierra Nevada. While Dr Bach's

<!-- chunk -->

## remedies reflected the spirit of his era during the Depression,

<!-- chunk -->

## with flowers for negative emotions such as fear, anger,

<!-- chunk -->

## resentment, depression and discouragement, the Californian

<!-- chunk -->

## Flower Essences were affected by California in the 1970s. Their

<!-- chunk -->

## remedies include flowers for enhancing spiritual development,

<!-- chunk -->

## releasing sexual inhibitions and blocks to creativity and for

<!-- chunk -->

## resolving problems in relationships. From the 1970s onwards the

<!-- chunk -->

## world of flower essences has continued to blossom with ranges

<!-- chunk -->

## of flower essences originating from all corners of the world,

<!-- chunk -->

## including New Zealand, Hawaii, Alaska, Scotland, the

<!-- chunk -->

## Himalayas, Africa, the Amazon and Australia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Kangaroo paw is a bush flower

<!-- chunk -->

<!-- chunk -->

### Australian plant; it helps to

# Australian Bush Flower Essences

<!-- chunk -->

## The Australian bush flower essences were evolved by a

<!-- chunk -->

## naturopath, Ian White, who had used the Bach remedies and

<!-- chunk -->

## wanted to explore the healing potential of flowers closer to

<!-- chunk -->

## home. As a boy he had grown up in the Australian bush, and

<!-- chunk -->

## there his appreciation and respect for nature developed as he

<!-- chunk -->

## accompanied his herbalist grandmother on walks, searching for

<!-- chunk -->

## medicinal herbs. As an adult, information about bush essences, a

<!-- chunk -->

## picture of the flower, where it could be found, and often even its

<!-- chunk -->

## name was channelled to Ian White during meditation. Working

<!-- chunk -->

## with other practitioners who were excited by this new discovery,

<!-- chunk -->

## he set about verifying the effects of the Bush remedies, not only

<!-- chunk -->

## by working with patients but also testing them with Kirlian

<!-- chunk -->

## photography, kinesiology and vega machines, and with other

<!-- chunk -->

## mediums. His book Bush Flower Essences describes 50 of the

<!-- chunk -->

## Australian essences and their applications. Since then, twelve

<!-- chunk -->

## more remedies have been discovered and researched.

# Healing Nature

<!-- chunk -->

## Flower remedies are highly diluted from a physical or chemical

<!-- chunk -->

## perspective, effective not because of their chemical constituents

<!-- chunk -->

## but the life force derived from the flower contained within the

<!-- chunk -->

## water-based fluid they come in. Like homoeopathic remedies,

<!-- chunk -->

## their presence is more subtle than physical, and they address

<!-- chunk -->

## profound issues of spiritual well being, emotional and mental

<!-- chunk -->

## harmony, and the healing of emotional and mental difficulties

<!-- chunk -->

## that create blocks to spiritual development and the realisation of

<!-- chunk -->

## our full potential. They can provide catalysts for helping people

<!-- chunk -->

## to heal themselves, to understand their purpose and direction in

<!-- chunk -->

## life, and free themselves from the mental or emotional suffering

<!-- chunk -->

## that may be hindering them on their path. Dr Bach said that

<!-- chunk -->

## flower essences “raise our vibrations and open up our channels

<!-- chunk -->

## for the reception of our spiritual self. They are able, like beautiful

<!-- chunk -->

## music or any gloriously uplifting thing which gives us

<!-- chunk -->

## inspiration, to raise our very natures and bring us nearer to

<!-- chunk -->

## ourselves and by that very act to bring us peace and relieve our

<!-- chunk -->

## suffering”.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr Edward Bach (above) wrote that

<!-- chunk -->

### flower essences could “bring us peace

<!-- chunk -->

### and relieve our suffering”.

# The Chemistry of Herbs

# How do herbs work on the human organism?

# Much of their medicinal action can be classified

# according to a plant's therapeutic constituents,

# measured using the tools of biochemistry and

# pharmacology. However, plants also work

# synergistically – the whole being more than the

# sum of its parts – and this has been less well

# studied. As a result, many herbalists are happy to

# evaluate the healing potential of plants according

# to both modern scientific findings and more

# holistic philosophies of energy medicine.

# Re-evaluating Herbal Medicines

# Modern evaluation of herbal medicines is divided

# between “rationalistic/scientific” and “energetic”

# viewpoints. With the emergence of modern

# Western scientific medicine, herbs have been seen

# either as old fashioned and obsolete or as sources

# of pharmacological constituents to be used as

# building blocks for making drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

## For thousands of years, until the last 200 years or so, plants

<!-- chunk -->

## provided the sole source of medicines and many familiar and

<!-- chunk -->

## potent medicines of the 21st century have been derived directly

<!-- chunk -->

## or indirectly from herbs. Despite this, there are still those who

<!-- chunk -->

## persist in the view that the value of herbs is unproven

<!-- chunk -->

## scientifically. Cinchona bark, for example, is the source of

<!-- chunk -->

## quinine, the anti malaria drug, periwinkle is the source of

<!-- chunk -->

## vincristine, the anti-tumour drug, the opium poppy is the source

<!-- chunk -->

## of morphine and codeine. Atropine, aspirin, digoxin and

<!-- chunk -->

## ephedrine are all plant derived drugs found in modern

<!-- chunk -->

## pharmacological textbooks and dispensaries. At the same time,

<!-- chunk -->

## however, the unquestionable value and popularity of herbs as

<!-- chunk -->

## medicines in the last 20-30 years has prompted an increasing

<!-- chunk -->

## amount of research into the action of plant components that is

<!-- chunk -->

## not only fascinating but also greatly helpful to the modern

<!-- chunk -->

## practitioner.

<!-- chunk -->

### The bark from the Cinchona tree,

<!-- chunk -->

### native to South America, is the source

<!-- chunk -->

### of quinine in anti-malarial drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

## Alongside this enquiry into the world of herbs has come a re-

<!-- chunk -->

## emergence in popularity of more ancient systems of medicine

<!-- chunk -->

## with their “energetic” or “holistic” philosophies, as well as more

<!-- chunk -->

## modern systems of healing using plants, such as aromatherapy

<!-- chunk -->

## and flower essences. This has occurred, amid a milieu of natural

<!-- chunk -->

## healing that has challenged modern allopathic medicine to the

<!-- chunk -->

## point that now many people are conscious that valid choices exist

<!-- chunk -->

## for the patient who is embarking on a course of treatment,

<!-- chunk -->

## particularly for addressing one or more chronic problems.

# Whole Plant Medicines

<!-- chunk -->

## To stand up to scrutiny in a modern scientific world, herbalists

<!-- chunk -->

## now have to provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of the

<!-- chunk -->

## therapeutic herbs they use and apply the tools of the scientific

<!-- chunk -->

## world, biochemistry and pharmacology, to their task. While

<!-- chunk -->

## herbalists advocate the use of whole plant medicines, their

<!-- chunk -->

## enquiry necessitates that, for study and evaluation purposes,

<!-- chunk -->

## ingredients are singled out and their actions are ascertained. Such

<!-- chunk -->

## research enables quality testing, identifies efficient extraction

<!-- chunk -->

## methods and provides pointers to potential side effects and herb-

<!-- chunk -->

## drug interactions. Once this is accomplished it does not,

<!-- chunk -->

## however, tell the whole story and the knowledge gained from

<!-- chunk -->

## such study needs still to be incorporated into a more overall view

<!-- chunk -->

## of the whole plant. It has long been held that a herb is more than

<!-- chunk -->

## the sum of its parts, and, despite investigations into what are seen

<!-- chunk -->

## as the active ingredients in a given plant, there are other “lesser”

<!-- chunk -->

## constituents that have an equally important role to play

<!-- chunk -->

## therapeutically. These play an essential role in determining how

<!-- chunk -->

## effective the primary healing agents will be by rendering the

<!-- chunk -->

## body more or less receptive to their powers. Some of these

<!-- chunk -->

## “synergistic” substances will make the active constituents more

<!-- chunk -->

## easily assimilated and readily available in the body, while others

<!-- chunk -->

## will buffer the action of other potent plant chemicals, thus

<!-- chunk -->

## preventing the risk of side effects. It is the natural combination of

<!-- chunk -->

## both types of substances that determines the healing power and

<!-- chunk -->

## safety of any herbal medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Opium poppies in Tasmania,

<!-- chunk -->

### Australia; some 50% of the world's

<!-- chunk -->

### crop used in medicine is grown here.

<!-- chunk -->

## Before the development of modern scientific methods for

<!-- chunk -->

## isolating active constituents, whole plant medicines were used.

<!-- chunk -->

## Then, as science progressed, many of these constituents were

<!-- chunk -->

## able to be synthesised in the laboratory, perhaps in the

<!-- chunk -->

## assumption that synthetic compounds were similar to those

<!-- chunk -->

## derived from the plant world and as such would be assimilated

<!-- chunk -->

## just as easily by the body, and herbs became more or less

<!-- chunk -->

## redundant. However, chemical analysis of medicinal plants has

<!-- chunk -->

## demonstrated that there is a similarity in the molecular structure

<!-- chunk -->

## of components of plants and the human body, which makes the

<!-- chunk -->

## foods we eat and the herbs we use as medicines easily

<!-- chunk -->

## assimilated. The isolation and synthesis of potent active

<!-- chunk -->

## ingredients can produce an array of side-effects. Plant-derived

<!-- chunk -->

## drugs such as morphine, digoxin, ephedrine and atropine clearly

<!-- chunk -->

## need to be used with great caution. Even aspirin carries its risks

<!-- chunk -->

## and after 1986 all children's aspirin based drugs were withdrawn

<!-- chunk -->

## from the market due to their implication in association with

<!-- chunk -->

## Reye's syndrome in children, which can cause damage to the

<!-- chunk -->

## kidneys and brain.

# Constituents of Herbal Medicines

# Through photosynthesis, plants manufacture

# carbohydrates and give off oxygen, and through

# this process they create metabolic pathways that

# provide building blocks for the production of a

# vast array of compounds.

<!-- chunk -->

## In medicinal plants these include minerals, vitamins and trace

<!-- chunk -->

## elements, and a vast assortment of substances known to have

<!-- chunk -->

## specific therapeutic actions in the body. The more widely known

<!-- chunk -->

## of these are as follows:

# Phenols

<!-- chunk -->

## Phenols, sometimes called phenolic compounds, are a large class

<!-- chunk -->

## of secondary plant compounds. They are aromatic alcohols and

<!-- chunk -->

## the building blocks of many plant components, and generally

<!-- chunk -->

## have antiseptic, antibacterial and anthelmintic actions. The

<!-- chunk -->

## simplest of the class is the antimicrobial phenol (C


<!-- chunk -->

## H


<!-- chunk -->

## OH).

<!-- chunk -->

## Another simple phenolic compound is salicylic acid, which

<!-- chunk -->

## forms glycosides found in willow, cramp bark, and

<!-- chunk -->

## meadowsweet, and has antiseptic, painkiller and has anti-

<!-- chunk -->

## inflammatory properties. It forms the basis of aspirin.

<!-- chunk -->

## Other compounds include hydroxycinnamic acids, including

<!-- chunk -->

## caffeic, ferulic and sinapic acids, which form the basis of

<!-- chunk -->

## phenolic esthers, coumarins, glycosides and lignans; also

<!-- chunk -->

## cynarin, the main constituent of globe artichoke, with its liver-

<!-- chunk -->

## protective and cholesterol-lowering actions, and curcumin, the

<!-- chunk -->

## main component from turmeric, which is famous as an anti-

<!-- chunk -->

## inflammatory agent and also for its ability to lower blood

<!-- chunk -->

## pressure and protect the liver (Pengelly, 2004).

<!-- chunk -->

## Other phenolic compounds include stilbenes, which occur in

<!-- chunk -->

## grape skins and red wine, with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,

<!-- chunk -->

## anti-clotting and anti-allergy actions, and quinones, including

<!-- chunk -->

## anthraquinones (see overleaf) and naphthaquinones. The latter

<!-- chunk -->

## have antimicrobial and anti-tumour properties, for example

<!-- chunk -->

## juglone in walnut bark, and lapachol in pau d'arco.

# Coumarins

<!-- chunk -->

## Coumarins occur widely in plants, including black cohosh, wild

<!-- chunk -->

## oats, angelica, and horse chestnut, and they are generally

<!-- chunk -->

## antimicrobial and antifungal. The evocative smell of hay is due to

<!-- chunk -->

## the presence of coumarins that are lactones of hydroxycinnamic

<!-- chunk -->

## acids. They generally occur as glycosides, for example aesculin

<!-- chunk -->

## from horse chestnut. Dicoumarol that is originally derived from

<!-- chunk -->

## sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis) is used a strong anti-clotting

<!-- chunk -->

## agent, in the form of Warfarin, in allopathic medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Furanocoumarins include angelican and archangelican from

<!-- chunk -->

## angelica roots, which are antispasmodic. These need to be used

<!-- chunk -->

## cautiously as they can cause photosensitivity, increasing the

<!-- chunk -->

## effect of sunlight on the skin, but they can also be used

<!-- chunk -->

## therapeutically for vitiligo and psoriasis. (Pengelly, 2004).

# Anthraquinones

<!-- chunk -->

## Anthraquinones occur as glycosides, and have a yellow-brown

<!-- chunk -->

## colour that has often been used for producing commercial dyes.

<!-- chunk -->

## They are found in senna, aloes, yellow dock, and cascara, and

<!-- chunk -->

## they pass unaltered through the stomach and small intestine, to

<!-- chunk -->

## be converted to their active form by micro-organisms. 8–12

<!-- chunk -->

## hours after ingestion, they stimulate peristalsis and inhibit water

<!-- chunk -->

## reabsorption in the large intestine, producing a laxative effect.

<!-- chunk -->

## Their peristaltic action can sometimes cause griping in the bowel,

<!-- chunk -->

## so they are best combined with herbs such as peppermint, ginger

<!-- chunk -->

## or fennel. They are contraindicated in spastic bowel problems

<!-- chunk -->

## and pregnancy, and should not be used over a long period of

<!-- chunk -->

## time as they can reduce the normal bowel reflexes and cause

<!-- chunk -->

## habituation.

# Tannins

<!-- chunk -->

## Tannins occur widely in nature, often as glycosides, and they

<!-- chunk -->

## represent the largest group of polyphenols. Tannins are the main

<!-- chunk -->

## therapeutic constituents in witch hazel, agrimony, raspberry leaf,

<!-- chunk -->

## and meadowsweet. Their main therapeutic action is astringent,

<!-- chunk -->

## brought about by their ability to bind albumin, a protein in the

<!-- chunk -->

## skin and mucous membranes, to form a tight, insoluble

<!-- chunk -->

## protective layer that is resistant to infection. On the skin and in,

<!-- chunk -->

## the delicate linings of the mouth, the respirary, digestive, urinary

<!-- chunk -->

## and reproductive systems, tannins can separate bacteria that

<!-- chunk -->

## threaten to invade from their source of nutrition.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tannins occur either as hydrolysable or condensed tannins.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sxq hydrolysable tannins have the ability to protect the skin and

<!-- chunk -->

## mucosa from irritation and to reduce swelling and inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

## They have a drying effect that is useful for curbing over-

<!-- chunk -->

## secretion of mucous, bleeding and diarrhoea. Herbs rich in

<!-- chunk -->

## tannins make useful mouthwashes for infected and bleeding

<!-- chunk -->

## gums, gargles for sore throats, eyewashes for inflamed or

<!-- chunk -->

## infected eyes, remedies for catarrh, inflammation of the GI tract,

<!-- chunk -->

## diarrhoea, and heavy menstrual bleeding, compresses to heal

<!-- chunk -->

## burns, abrasions and cuts, and lotions to bathe haemorrhoids and

<!-- chunk -->

## inflammatory skin conditions.

<!-- chunk -->

## Condensed tannins include oligomeric procyanidins, which

<!-- chunk -->

## have become widely known for their antioxidant and

<!-- chunk -->

## cardiovascular properties. They are found in green and black tea,

<!-- chunk -->

## red wine and grape seeds. Grape seed extract has been

<!-- chunk -->

## demonstrated to have strong antioxidant activity, protecting

<!-- chunk -->

## against free radical damage and cardiovascular disease, and

<!-- chunk -->

## preventing degeneration of connective tissue.

<!-- chunk -->

### Filipendula, or meadowsweet, is a

<!-- chunk -->

### source of tannin and can be used as an

<!-- chunk -->

### astringent in fighting infection.

# Flavonoids

<!-- chunk -->

## Flavonoids and flavonoid glycosides occur widely in nature and

<!-- chunk -->

## impart a yellow, orange and red colour to fruits, vegetables and

<!-- chunk -->

## flowers. With their antioxidant actions, they are an important part

<!-- chunk -->

## of our daily diet, having a beneficial effect on the heart and

<!-- chunk -->

## circulation, strengthening and healing blood vessel walls and

<!-- chunk -->

## enhancing our resilience to stress. They act synergistically with

<!-- chunk -->

## ascorbic acid to enhance the body's ability to metabolise it.

<!-- chunk -->

## Flavonoids are also anti-inflammatory (e.g. quercitrin), hepato-

<!-- chunk -->

## protective (e.g. silymarin and quercitrin), anti-tumour, anti-viral

<!-- chunk -->

## and hypotensive. Herbs rich in flavonoids (e.g. kaempherol,

<!-- chunk -->

## myricitin, quercitrin) protect against cardiovascular disease and

<!-- chunk -->

## are used to treat vascular problems, including for example

<!-- chunk -->

## venous insufficiency, bruising, piles and nose bleeds.

<!-- chunk -->

## Isoflavones, such as genistein from soya, have a similar

<!-- chunk -->

## structure to oestrogen. They bind to oestrogen receptors in the

<!-- chunk -->

## body and are known as phytoestrogens. They occur in herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## includingare shatavari, wild indigo, liquorice, red clover and

<!-- chunk -->

## black cohosh. They have been found to help prevent tumours

<!-- chunk -->

## and breast cancer, and to relieve menopausal symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

## Anthocyanins and anthocyanidins are found in red, blue and

<!-- chunk -->

## black fruits, and particularly found in high amounts in grape

<!-- chunk -->

## skins, elderberries and bilberries. They also occur in herbs,

<!-- chunk -->

## including ginkgo, cat's claw and corn silk. They have antioxidant

<!-- chunk -->

## actions that protect against oxidative damage, particularly in the

<!-- chunk -->

## eyes and connective tissue.

# Terpenes

<!-- chunk -->

## Terpenes, or terpenoids, occur widely in a variety of forms,

<!-- chunk -->

## including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and triterpenes.

<!-- chunk -->

## Monoterpenes are the main components of volatile oils (see

<!-- chunk -->

## next page), and include bitter iridoids, as in the sedative

<!-- chunk -->

## valepotriates in valerian, hypotensive asperulsides in cleavers,

<!-- chunk -->

## and paeoniflorin in peony, which has anti-inflammatory,

<!-- chunk -->

## febrifuge and sedative actions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cimicifuga, or black cohosh, contains

<!-- chunk -->

### isoflavones, which have been found

<!-- chunk -->

### to prevent tumours.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sesquiterpenes are also found in volatile oils or as lactones,

<!-- chunk -->

## and have a bitter taste, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial

<!-- chunk -->

## actions. Sesquiterpenes are found in myrrh, hops, German

<!-- chunk -->

## chamomile and vitex, and sesquiterpene lactones occur in

<!-- chunk -->

## boneset, feverfew, yarrow, wormwood, globe artichoke and

<!-- chunk -->

## elecampane.

<!-- chunk -->

## Triterpenes have a similar structure to steroids (see below).

# Bitters

<!-- chunk -->

## Bitter principles is a term for a group of chemicals that have a

<!-- chunk -->

## very bitter taste and a cooling effect. They are diverse in structure

<!-- chunk -->

## but have certain therapeutic actions in common, and include

<!-- chunk -->

## mostly terpenes, flavonoids and some alkaloids. Through their

<!-- chunk -->

## effect on the bitter receptors on the tongue, they promote

<!-- chunk -->

## secretion of digestive enzymes from the stomach and intestines,

<!-- chunk -->

## flow of bile from the liver and release of hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

## Bitters are prescribed for poor appetite and digestion, gastritis,

<!-- chunk -->

## heartburn, to regulate blood sugar, to relieve allergies and

<!-- chunk -->

## inflammation and to aid convalescence. Many bitter herbs have

<!-- chunk -->

## other actions; some are relaxant or sedative like hops and

<!-- chunk -->

## valerian, others are anti-inflammatory like devil's claw, and some,

<!-- chunk -->

## like marigold, exert a beneficial action on the immune system,

<!-- chunk -->

## acting as natural antibiotics and anti-neoplastics. Well known

<!-- chunk -->

## “bitter tonics” include dandelion, cleavers, blessed thistle,

<!-- chunk -->

## wormwood, dock root and gentian.

# Triterpenoids and Saponins

<!-- chunk -->

## Triterpenoids represent a large and diverse group that includes

<!-- chunk -->

## phytosterols, triterpenoid saponins, steroidal saponins and

<!-- chunk -->

## cardiac glycodises.

<!-- chunk -->

### The leaves of Cynara scolymus, or

<!-- chunk -->

### globe artichoke, contain sequiterpene

<!-- chunk -->

### actones, which can reduce

<!-- chunk -->

### inflamation and protect against


# Phytosterols

<!-- chunk -->

## Phytosterols such as sitosterol and stigmasterol are vital to the

<!-- chunk -->

## formation of cell membranes and help regulate cholesterol, for

<!-- chunk -->

## example guggulsterones in guggulu which lower cholesterol and

<!-- chunk -->

## triglycerides by their regulatory effect on the thyroid are a good

<!-- chunk -->

## example. Phytosterols have been used as building blocks for

<!-- chunk -->

## making steroid drugs and may have the ability to inhibit tumour

<!-- chunk -->

## formation; withanolides in ashwagandha, for example, have

<!-- chunk -->

## antitumour and hepatoprotective properties (Pengelly, 2004).

# Saponins

<!-- chunk -->

## Saponins are glycosides that form a soap-like lather when they

<!-- chunk -->

## are mixed with water and precipitate cholesterol. Herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## containing saponins have a bitter taste and haemolytic activity.

<!-- chunk -->

## They can dissolve red blood cells walls so should never be

<!-- chunk -->

## injected into the blood stream. Taken orally, however, they are

<!-- chunk -->

## hardly absorbed through an intact intestine and help to promote

<!-- chunk -->

## digestion and absorption, for example of nutrients including

<!-- chunk -->

## calcium and silicon. Some, like horse chestnut, have a beneficial

<!-- chunk -->

## action on blood vessel walls, some decrease blood coagulation,

<!-- chunk -->

## blood sugar and cholesterol levels (Tillotson, 2001). Some, like

<!-- chunk -->

## goldenrod and horsetail, are duiretic. Others like mullein are

<!-- chunk -->

## expectorant, and several have hepato-protective and immuno-

<!-- chunk -->

## modulating effects, for example Korean ginseng and liquorice.

# Triterpenoid saponins

<!-- chunk -->

## These help regulate steroidal hormonal activity and counter the

<!-- chunk -->

## effects of stress, and often have antifungal properties. Herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## containing these hormone-regulating properties are known as

<!-- chunk -->

## adaptogens, the most famous of which is panax ginseng. Others

<!-- chunk -->

## include liquorice, wild yam and fenugreek. Some, like wild yam

<!-- chunk -->

## and liquorice, act as anti-inflammatories.

<!-- chunk -->

### Solidago virgaurea, or goldenrod,

<!-- chunk -->

### contains saponins, which promote

<!-- chunk -->

### digestion and absorption.

# Steroidal saponins

<!-- chunk -->

## These, such as diosgenin from wild yam, are used in the body as

<!-- chunk -->

## building blocks for the production hormones secreted by the

<!-- chunk -->

## testes, ovaries and adrenal glands, and for vitamin D.

# Cardiac glycosides

<!-- chunk -->

## Discovered in 1785 in foxglove, these have been widely

<!-- chunk -->

## researched for their ability to increase cardiac output by effecting

<!-- chunk -->

## the force and speed of heart contractions, which is beneficial in

<!-- chunk -->

## dealing with heart failure. Herbs containing these are generally

<!-- chunk -->

## for use by practitioners only.

# Volatile Oils

<!-- chunk -->

## The exotic perfumes and delicious tastes of aromatic herbs are

<!-- chunk -->

## derived from volatile oils, which are complex combinations

<!-- chunk -->

## compounds, and the different combinations of these produce the

<!-- chunk -->

## wide variation in scent and therapeutic effects in the herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## containing them. Up to 60 different chemical constituents have

<!-- chunk -->

## been identified in some oils. Categories of volatile oils include

<!-- chunk -->

## terpenoids, including monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes and

<!-- chunk -->

## phenylpropanoids. Herbs rich in volatile oils have to be stored

<!-- chunk -->

## carefully in sealed bottles or containers as volatile oils can

<!-- chunk -->

## evaporate easily.

<!-- chunk -->

## All volatile oils are antiseptic, stimulating the production of

<!-- chunk -->

## white blood cells and enhancing immunity. Many oils have

<!-- chunk -->

## antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral actions, as well as anti-

<!-- chunk -->

## inflammatory and antispasmodic properties, especially those

<!-- chunk -->

## containing sesquiterpenes, such as for example azulene in

<!-- chunk -->

## German chamomile which is particularly applicable for the relief

<!-- chunk -->

## of inflamed and irritated conditions of the digestive tract, while

<!-- chunk -->

## those in dill relax spasm and colicky pain in the gut. Some oils

<!-- chunk -->

## have an expectorant action such as in thyme and hyssop, clearing

<!-- chunk -->

## mucous from the chest, while others are diuretic, useful for fluid

<!-- chunk -->

## retention and urinary infections. While they exert their beneficial

<!-- chunk -->

## effects on the physical body, they also reach the brain and

<!-- chunk -->

## nervous system and have a wide range of mento-emotional

<!-- chunk -->

## applications.

# Fixed Oils

<!-- chunk -->

## These are the lipids found in all plants, especially in the seeds,

<!-- chunk -->

## and they contain fatty acids which are either saturated,

<!-- chunk -->

## monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. They are vital for growth

<!-- chunk -->

## and health, the formation of cell membranes andthe healthy

<!-- chunk -->

## functioning of the immune and cardiovascular systems. Two

<!-- chunk -->

## fixed oils that exist in every cell, particularly in the nervous

<!-- chunk -->

## system, known as essential fatty acids, are linoleic (found in

<!-- chunk -->

## evening primrose oil, and saw palmetto berries), and linolenic

<!-- chunk -->

## acid (found in flax seed). These essential fatty acids are not able

<!-- chunk -->

## to be synthesised in the body and so need to be taken in through

<!-- chunk -->

## our diet. In the body linoleic acid is converted into gamma

<!-- chunk -->

## linolenic acid (GLA); atopic allergies such as eczema and asthma

<!-- chunk -->

## and other immune problems have been related to the lack of the

<!-- chunk -->

## enzyme responsible for this conversion in some individuals.

<!-- chunk -->

## Evening primrose oil contains GLA and for this reason is very

<!-- chunk -->

## useful for treating such problems.

# Polysaccharides

<!-- chunk -->

## These large sugar molecules are found widely in the plant world,

<!-- chunk -->

## for example in fructose, glucose, and cellulose, and consist of

<!-- chunk -->

## chains of sugars linked to other molecules. They include

<!-- chunk -->

## mucilage, gums, and fructans. Some polysaccharides,

<!-- chunk -->

## particularly beta-glucans found in, for example, reishi and

<!-- chunk -->

## shiitaki mushrooms, have immune-stimulating properties. They

<!-- chunk -->

## achieve this through throughactivating cytokines which enhance

<!-- chunk -->

## the production of white blood cells and antibodies, and with their

<!-- chunk -->

## anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour properties. Liquorice,

<!-- chunk -->

## codonopsis, aloe vera, rehmania and cinnamon also contain

<!-- chunk -->

## immune-stimulating polysaccharides.

# Mucilage

<!-- chunk -->

## This is a sugary, gel-like substance with the ability to draw water

<!-- chunk -->

## to it to form as viscous fluid. When taken orally, mucilage coats

<!-- chunk -->

## the mucous membranes of the digestive, respiratory and genito-

<!-- chunk -->

## urinary tracts and protects them from irritation and inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbs rich in mucilage including slippery elm, marshmallow and

<!-- chunk -->

## plantain are prescribed for their cooling and soothing properties.

<!-- chunk -->

## They can relieve diarrhoea by reducing peristalsis caused by

<!-- chunk -->

## irritation of the gut lining, but can also be used as laxatives as

<!-- chunk -->

## they absorb water into the bowel and bulk out the stool, e.g.

<!-- chunk -->

## psyllium seeds.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aloe Barbadensis, or aloe vera,

<!-- chunk -->

### contains polysaccharides, which

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulate the immune system.

# Gums

<!-- chunk -->

## These are protective and healing exudates composed of

<!-- chunk -->

## monosaccharides which are released when a plant is damaged.

<!-- chunk -->

## Those in guggulu enhance the liver's metabolism of cholesterol

<!-- chunk -->

## by promoting the uptake of LDL cholesterol from the blood

<!-- chunk -->

## (Tillotson, 2001). Marigold is high in gums with antimicrobial,

<!-- chunk -->

## antifungal and anti-inflammatory effects.

# Fructans

<!-- chunk -->

## These are composed of fructose and occur especially in the

<!-- chunk -->

## Asteraceae family as inulin. Herbs rich in inulin include

<!-- chunk -->

## elecampane, globe artichoke, goldenrod, gentian, codonopsis and

<!-- chunk -->

## burdock. Inulin helps regulate blood sugar and enhances the

<!-- chunk -->

## immune system by acting as a prebiotic to nourish the beneficial

<!-- chunk -->

## flora in the gut.

<!-- chunk -->

### Calendula officinalis, or marigold, is

<!-- chunk -->

### high in gums.

# Alkaloids

<!-- chunk -->

## A diverse group of chemicals that contain a nitrogen-bearing

<!-- chunk -->

## molecule and are pharmacologically very potent. Many of the

<!-- chunk -->

## more toxic plants contain alkaloids, such as atropine in

<!-- chunk -->

## belladonna and morphine from the opium poppy, the first

<!-- chunk -->

## alkaloid to be isolated in 1806 (Tillotson, 2001). Caffeine,

<!-- chunk -->

## ephedrine, quinine, strychnine, piperine, nicotine and codeine are

<!-- chunk -->

## all alkaloids with diverse actions, ranging from stimulants,

<!-- chunk -->

## bronchodilators, antimicrobials and anti-inflammatories, to

<!-- chunk -->

## narcotics and painkillers.

# The Herbal Consultation

# Before you make a diagnosis, prescribe remedies

# and prepare herbal medicines, it is important to

# understand the concepts of holism and

# homeostasis, and how plants can enhance the

# body's own innate healing processes. Treating

# underlying causes and not simply addressing

# symptoms forms the basis of a herbalist's

# practice, and every consultation, treatment plan

# and herbal prescription is tailored to each

# individual patient's needs, with the aim of

# bringing positive and lasting results.

# Healing the Whole Person

# Modern medical herbalism is a synthesis of

# ancient and modern theories and practices. Its

# underlying philosophy is that health is intimately

# connected to the harmony of body, mind and

# spirit, which enables a balance of natural forces in

# the body. In a clinical context the herbalist will

# interpret symptoms of ill health as a disturbance

# of this balance, and consider them in the context

# of the patient as a whole, their lives, both inner

# and outer.

<!-- chunk -->

## As Dr Edward Bach, famed for his flower remedies, said: “…

<!-- chunk -->

## disease of the body itself is nothing but the result of the

<!-- chunk -->

## disharmony between the soul and mind” and “…health is

<!-- chunk -->

## therefore the true realisation of what we are; we are perfect; we

<!-- chunk -->

## are children of God.”

<!-- chunk -->

## The now familiar World Health Organisation's definition of

<!-- chunk -->

## health as: “The condition of perfect bodily, spiritual and social

<!-- chunk -->

## well-being, and not solely the absence of disease and injury,” is a

<!-- chunk -->

## lofty aim, but certainly one that the herbal practitioner aspires to.

<!-- chunk -->

## We are not here solely to relieve symptoms. Bearing this in mind,

<!-- chunk -->

## ideally herbs are prescribed not only to redress specific

<!-- chunk -->

## imbalances but also to attend to the deeper causes of imbalance

<!-- chunk -->

## within a framework of life-affirming lifestyles and eating habits.

<!-- chunk -->

## In their “holistic” approach, the herbalist recognises that our

<!-- chunk -->

## bodies are made up of a complex organisation of tissues and cells

<!-- chunk -->

## that operate on a molecular level, and yet the human organism is

<!-- chunk -->

## so much more than this. Behind the physical manifestation that is

<!-- chunk -->

## the body is the existence of subtle energy, which is recognised by

<!-- chunk -->

## mythology and religion, but largely denied by modern science. It

<!-- chunk -->

## is known throughout the world by different names – life-force,

<!-- chunk -->

## vital-force, qi, and prana. We can neither see it nor define it, but

<!-- chunk -->

## it is there, and we are animated by this living force on every level

<!-- chunk -->

## of existence: physical, emotional, mental and spiritual.

<!-- chunk -->

## Through this we have an inherent ability to regulate the

<!-- chunk -->

## functions of the body and to heal ourselves, something that is

<!-- chunk -->

## known in the West as homoeostasis. When our life-force is

<!-- chunk -->

## disturbed on any level, the health of the whole person is affected,

<!-- chunk -->

## and illness results. Body, emotion, mind and spirit form one

<!-- chunk -->

## inter-related system, and an imbalance in one creates disharmony

<!-- chunk -->

## in another. Symptoms of ill-health in the body represent the

<!-- chunk -->

## attempt by our whole being to correct the imbalance and heal

<!-- chunk -->

## itself. If these symptoms are suppressed, as they are by modern

<!-- chunk -->

## drugs, the energy of the vital force is depleted, our healing ability

<!-- chunk -->

## dwindles and finally chronic illness results.

<!-- chunk -->

## The body needs to be permitted to express its symptoms as far

<!-- chunk -->

## as possible, and any treatment should be aimed at augmenting the

<!-- chunk -->

## efforts of the vital force, to enhance its healing energy and not

<!-- chunk -->

## work against it. The task of the herbalist is to analyse a patient's

<!-- chunk -->

## presenting symptoms in this respect and support their

<!-- chunk -->

## homoeostatic mechanisms through counselling, the use of herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## and foods and lifestyle guidance. A maxim of natural therapy is

<!-- chunk -->

## that medicine cannot change the workings of the body, it can

<!-- chunk -->

## only help them. One of the oldest medical teachings says:

<!-- chunk -->

## “Medicus curat, natura sanat” (“the doctor treats, but nature

<!-- chunk -->

## heals”).

# Using Herbs as Medicines

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbalists use the leaves, flowers, stems, berries, roots or seeds

<!-- chunk -->

## of medicinal plants as their therapeutic tools. By definition a herb

<!-- chunk -->

## is any plant that has a medicinal action in the body, and this

<!-- chunk -->

## includes most fruits and vegetables. In fact herbs act very much

<!-- chunk -->

## like foods, and many common foods are used for their medicinal

<!-- chunk -->

## actions: carrots are good for skin and urinary problems; oats are

<!-- chunk -->

## a great tonic to the nervous system, garlic fights infection,

<!-- chunk -->

## regulates blood pressure and prevents cholesterol and blueberries

<!-- chunk -->

## combat free radicals, strengthen blood vessels and help prevent

<!-- chunk -->

## urinary tract infections.

<!-- chunk -->

## Plants absorb, process and store vital nutrients from the soil,

<!-- chunk -->

## providing raw materials (close in chemical composition to those

<!-- chunk -->

## that make up the human body) for the growth and repair of all

<!-- chunk -->

## bodily tissues that are easily digested and assimilated. Their

<!-- chunk -->

## vitamins, minerals, and trace elements are vital for health and

<!-- chunk -->

## recovery, while other medicinal substances such as tannins,

<!-- chunk -->

## volatile oils, phenols and saponins have affinities for particular

<!-- chunk -->

## tissues and systems and act more specifically to promote

<!-- chunk -->

## homeostasis and healing.

<!-- chunk -->

## Clearly, then, herbs operate at the level of biochemical

<!-- chunk -->

## reactions in the body, but they are capable of much more. They

<!-- chunk -->

## certainly provide us with a wealth of wonderful chemicals but

<!-- chunk -->

## their healing power goes far beyond the physical to the realms of

<!-- chunk -->

## the vital force. When herbs work in the body they enhance the

<!-- chunk -->

## healing action of this force and as they do this they may also heal

<!-- chunk -->

## our hearts and minds, for they help to restore harmony to an

<!-- chunk -->

## integrated whole.

# The First Visit

# It is worth recommending to patients that they

# prepare for a first visit to a herbalist by compiling

# lists of present symptoms, past medical and drug

# history, illnesses and operations as far back as

# infancy. Their immediate family may provide

# extra information that has been forgotten about,

# for example breast feeding and illness, as well as

# temperament in early childhood.

<!-- chunk -->

## Medical reports from other consultants, as well as blood profiles,

<!-- chunk -->

## urine analyses, allergy tests, x-ray or scan reports, can provide

<!-- chunk -->

## important information. A diary of food eaten over the previous

<!-- chunk -->

## weeks will also be helpful to the practitioner when analysing the

<!-- chunk -->

## diet. A herbalist will always enquire into mento-emotional

<!-- chunk -->

## realms, and some patients may find it helpful to prepare for this

<!-- chunk -->

## since they may find it hard to talk about painful experiences, or

<!-- chunk -->

## may not be accustomed to talking about themselves.

# Individual Evaluation

<!-- chunk -->

## The consultation begins the minute patient meets practitioner.

<!-- chunk -->

## Consciously or unconsciously, the practitioner will be assessing

<!-- chunk -->

## the patient. The build of the body, the hue and tone of the skin,

<!-- chunk -->

## the brightness of the eyes and hair, the colour of the lips, the

<!-- chunk -->

## expression on the face, the tone of voice, general appearance and

<!-- chunk -->

## dress sense all begin to tell the story. Then there is body

<!-- chunk -->

## language; the expression in the face, the level of tension in the

<!-- chunk -->

## muscles, gait and posture all convey important messages.

<!-- chunk -->

## During the consultation the patient is given time and

<!-- chunk -->

## opportunity to describe their concerns in detail. Each person is

<!-- chunk -->

## evaluated as an individual by the herbalist, who records and

<!-- chunk -->

## analyses current presenting symptoms in relation to the complete

<!-- chunk -->

## medical history in order to understand the underlying causes and

<!-- chunk -->

## contributing factors that have made the patient seek help.

<!-- chunk -->

## A case history includes:

<!-- chunk -->

## • main presenting symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

## • other symptoms that occur from time to time

<!-- chunk -->

## • detailed past medical history

<!-- chunk -->

## • lifestyle including daily habits, diet, sleep, exercise and

<!-- chunk -->

## relaxation

<!-- chunk -->

## • temperament, stress levels and mento-emotional concerns

<!-- chunk -->

## • bodily systems review

<!-- chunk -->

## • appetite, digestion and elimination

<!-- chunk -->

## • thirst and sweat

<!-- chunk -->

## • body temperature, intolerance of heat or cold

<!-- chunk -->

## • sleep

<!-- chunk -->

## • energy

<!-- chunk -->

## • other medicines being taken

<!-- chunk -->

## • cautions, for example pregnancy, lactation

<!-- chunk -->

## Through questioning, the practitioner will systematically go

<!-- chunk -->

## through the bodily systems and the status of their functions will

<!-- chunk -->

## all contribute to their analysis of the total health picture of the

<!-- chunk -->

## patient. This will be followed by necessary and relevant physical

<!-- chunk -->

## examinations, which may include tongue, urine and pulse

<!-- chunk -->

## diagnosis, taking the blood pressure, listening to the heart or

<!-- chunk -->

## chest, palpating the abdomen, examining the nails, and so on.

<!-- chunk -->

### The consultation begins the minute

<!-- chunk -->

### patient meets practitioner.

<!-- chunk -->

## CASE HISTORY

<!-- chunk -->

## I remember thinking to myself when the herbalist asked me

<!-- chunk -->

## why I had come to see her, where would I start, what would

<!-- chunk -->

## I say?…“My heart is broken, some days I barely have

<!-- chunk -->

## enough energy to pick up a glass of water and if I manage to

<!-- chunk -->

## drink it, it seems to come out of my eyes…my diet is

<!-- chunk -->

## extremely healthy but completely erratic, I seem to punish

<!-- chunk -->

## myself with gruelling exercise regimes and work like it is

<!-- chunk -->

## going out of fashion and I don't sleep enough. HELP!” How

<!-- chunk -->

## on earth could this poor herbalist possibly know how or

<!-- chunk -->

## with what to treat me?

<!-- chunk -->

## I consulted a herbalist who combined Western herbal

<!-- chunk -->

## medicine with Ayurvedic techniques. From the minute we

<!-- chunk -->

## met, I could see her watching and listening, not in an

<!-- chunk -->

## intrusive way, just to get the whole picture from where I was

<!-- chunk -->

## in the present to where I had come from. I was made to feel

<!-- chunk -->

## extremely at ease as my story and tears flowed and looking

<!-- chunk -->

## back on it, the way I was gently encouraged to talk and

<!-- chunk -->

## unravel my muddles was quite impressive, as not once did I

<!-- chunk -->

## feel I was being interrogated.

<!-- chunk -->

## I remember being asked about a number of things; my

<!-- chunk -->

## sleeping pattern, diet, menstrual cycle and childhood

<!-- chunk -->

## illnesses, which to me may have seemed of little importance

<!-- chunk -->

## but as the herbalist explained several possible links to my

<!-- chunk -->

## conditions, things started to make sense. The herbalist

<!-- chunk -->

## wanted to check my tongue and I was intrigued to know that

<!-- chunk -->

## tooth marks around the edge may be due to “over-doing and

<!-- chunk -->

## exhaustion causing poor absorption of nutrients,” while a

<!-- chunk -->

## thin coating may be linked to poor digestion. She asked “did

<!-- chunk -->

## I feel the need to push myself to perfection, have any history

<!-- chunk -->

## of tonsillitis, bronchitis or cystitis, ever suffer with

<!-- chunk -->

## hypoglycaemia, insomnia or over competitiveness?” It was

<!-- chunk -->

## at this stage that I thought my boyfriend had pre-warned her

<!-- chunk -->

## about me as I quietly nodded my head, answering her

<!-- chunk -->

## questions. I learnt about the three primary forces or humours

<!-- chunk -->

## derived from the five elements known as doshas, in

<!-- chunk -->

## Ayurveda. They are responsible for all functions in the body,

<!-- chunk -->

## physical and psychological. My predominant dosha is pitta.

<!-- chunk -->

## Some aspects of pitta aggravation described me in a nutshell:

<!-- chunk -->

## I am a perfectionist, I miss meals, suppress my emotions,

<!-- chunk -->

## look after everybody first and put myself last, work far too

<!-- chunk -->

## much, and am hopeless in inflammatory situations such as

<!-- chunk -->

## anger, frustration or irritation…no wonder I was out of

<!-- chunk -->

## balance, all of these things are no good for a pitta type!

<!-- chunk -->

## The herbalist took a detailed record of my diet and daily

<!-- chunk -->

## routines and within minutes I began to understand why I

<!-- chunk -->

## was lacking in energy, felt tearful and sensitive and why my

<!-- chunk -->

## digestion needed attention.

<!-- chunk -->

## The herbalist took notes on the condition of my skin, hair,

<!-- chunk -->

## eyes and nails. I was already feeling better and I had not

<!-- chunk -->

## even been prescribed any herbs. I felt that the hour's

<!-- chunk -->

## consultation was relaxed yet I had gained a deep and

<!-- chunk -->

## comprehensive understanding of myself as an individual.

<!-- chunk -->

## One thing which I found an enormous help was that the

<!-- chunk -->

## logistics of taking the herbs prescribed to me were realistic to

<!-- chunk -->

## me and my life situation. I did not have to boil up this or that

<!-- chunk -->

## whilst on the run, or take a third of this at any other specific

<!-- chunk -->

## time. I left the consultation feeling extremely positive, full of

<!-- chunk -->

## great ideas on how to help myself and was looking forward

<!-- chunk -->

## to trying out lots of new recipes. I enjoyed the “holistic”,

<!-- chunk -->

## approach as I could really see the importance of the, “whole

<!-- chunk -->

## story”. We certainly are linked in mind and body and not

<!-- chunk -->

## seeing this had played a huge part of where I had been going

<!-- chunk -->

## wrong.

<!-- chunk -->

## I regularly see my herbalist for top ups and checks. She

<!-- chunk -->

## always takes the time to listen and this, for me, is vital and I

<!-- chunk -->

## have never looked back.

# Treatment

# The treatment of most ailments begins at home.

# Many people are almost unwittingly using herbal

# medicine in common household remedies like salt

# gargles for sore throats, hot lemon and honey

# drinks for colds and catarrh, chamomile tea for

# sleep, peppermint to settle the stomach, vinegar

# for wasp stings and dock leaves for nettle stings.

<!-- chunk -->

## The more you can learn about simple remedies for minor

<!-- chunk -->

## ailments, which could be sitting in your larder, growing in your

<!-- chunk -->

## garden or wild in the hedgerows, the more opportunity you will

<!-- chunk -->

## have to treat the first signs of acute infections and minor ailments

<!-- chunk -->

## without the necessity of drugs such as antibiotics, and thereby

<!-- chunk -->

## help to prevent the development of more serious disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbs used in this way make excellent preventive medicines

<!-- chunk -->

## and can enhance general well-being when taken in conjunction

<!-- chunk -->

## with a healthy diet and lifestyle. For more chronic or serious

<!-- chunk -->

## disorders it is advisable to consult a professional herbalist who

<!-- chunk -->

## uses herbs in the context of a holistic approach to healing, where

<!-- chunk -->

## physical symptoms are viewed in relation to other factors,

<!-- chunk -->

## including temperament, stress, social, domestic and working

<!-- chunk -->

## environment, relationships, diet, relaxation and exercise. All play

<!-- chunk -->

## a part in the emergence of an individual pattern of symptoms.

# Who Consults a Herbalist?

<!-- chunk -->

## Most people who consult a herbalist present with chronic

<!-- chunk -->

## disorders rather than acute symptoms. They may be seeking a

<!-- chunk -->

## more natural alternative or complement to allopathic drugs from

<!-- chunk -->

## their doctor for their disorder, that addresses causes rather than

<!-- chunk -->

## symptoms or they may have been treated unsuccessfully

<!-- chunk -->

## elsewhere. Frequently it is those whose symptoms do not fit into

<!-- chunk -->

## a classical “disease” picture or who have symptoms for which

<!-- chunk -->

## there is little in the way of allopathic medicine to remedy their

<!-- chunk -->

## situation. Allergies such as eczema, urticaria and conjunctivitis,

<!-- chunk -->

## and hormonal, nervous and immune problems are good

<!-- chunk -->

## examples of these. Often people come after years of coping with

<!-- chunk -->

## health problems, in which case it may take some time to return

<!-- chunk -->

## completely to health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Plenty of exercise, rest and good food

<!-- chunk -->

### enhances wellbeing and makes

<!-- chunk -->

### preventive remedies more effective.

<!-- chunk -->

## As people are becoming more health aware in the holistic

<!-- chunk -->

## sense, they are looking to “alternative” or “complementary”

<!-- chunk -->

## health models as a first line of treatment rather than a last resort.

<!-- chunk -->

## They may simply feel under the weather, tired or run down with

<!-- chunk -->

## vague symptoms, which they would like to understand and

<!-- chunk -->

## resolve before they progress further. In many cases they may just

<!-- chunk -->

## need to have time to talk, to be heard and understood, and to

<!-- chunk -->

## activate their own self-healing mechanisms with the support of a

<!-- chunk -->

## herbal practitioner. The role of the herbalist is often that of

<!-- chunk -->

## counsellor.

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbal treatment can be taken alongside allopathic drugs in

<!-- chunk -->

## many instances and a herbalist will check for any possible herb-

<!-- chunk -->

## drug interactions before prescribing. For those with long term

<!-- chunk -->

## problems, such as cardiovascular and auto-immune disease,

<!-- chunk -->

## working with a herbalist will help improve general health, energy

<!-- chunk -->

## and “joie de vivre” so that the patient is better able to cope with

<!-- chunk -->

## their problems.

# Scheduling Visits

<!-- chunk -->

## Generally, medical herbalists do not hold open surgery, since

<!-- chunk -->

## appointments tend to be lengthy and so need to be booked in

<!-- chunk -->

## advance. First appointments are likely to last about an hour and

<!-- chunk -->

## follow up visits are thirty to forty-five minutes. Many herbalists

<!-- chunk -->

## operate a sliding scale of charges for the consultation and the

<!-- chunk -->

## herbal medicines prescribed, and for students, pensioners, the

<!-- chunk -->

## unemployed or those experiencing hard financial times fees may

<!-- chunk -->

## be reduced.

<!-- chunk -->

## To illustrate, a patient who presents with chronic ear infections

<!-- chunk -->

## may not require antibiotics to provide an effective and lasting

<!-- chunk -->

## cure. Examination of past medical history may show that there is

<!-- chunk -->

## a history of digestive problems, eczema, asthma, or hay fever,

<!-- chunk -->

## and several courses of antibiotics that have been prescribed in the

<!-- chunk -->

## past. Further questioning may reveal chronically sluggish

<!-- chunk -->

## bowels, a tendency to bloating and abdominal discomfort, a high

<!-- chunk -->

## intake of milk products, white bread, sugary foods and drinks

<!-- chunk -->

## and not enough fruit and vegetables. It may be that stress has

<!-- chunk -->

## also played its part in compromising digestion and liver function.

<!-- chunk -->

## It is likely that the underlying problem here lies in the gut. Poor

<!-- chunk -->

## digestion and elimination suggested by the sluggish bowels and

<!-- chunk -->

## wind indicate that food is not being digested adequately, resulting

<!-- chunk -->

## in poor absorption, a low nutritional profile and some degree of

<!-- chunk -->

## dysbiosis (disturbance of the gut flora) leading to leaky gut

<!-- chunk -->

## syndrome and toxicity. A diet high in gluten, dairy produce,

<!-- chunk -->

## refined carbohydrates and sugar, tends to disturb the gut, lower

<!-- chunk -->

## immunity and cause accumulation of mucous and chronic

<!-- chunk -->

## congestion in the eustachian tube that leads from the throat to the

<!-- chunk -->

## ear, predisposing to ear infections. Courses of antibiotics further

<!-- chunk -->

## aggravate the disturbance of the gut flora and lower immunity,

<!-- chunk -->

## and the cycle continues.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal teas may be prescribed as part

<!-- chunk -->

### of dietary changes, replacing

<!-- chunk -->

### caffeinated drinks that may aggravate

<!-- chunk -->

### health problems.

<!-- chunk -->

## The herbalist would take time to make detailed dietary

<!-- chunk -->

## changes, recommending that the patient avoid dairy products and

<!-- chunk -->

## gluten, as well as refined sugar and carbohydrates, and eats more

<!-- chunk -->

## fresh fruit and vegetables (organic wherever possible) combined

<!-- chunk -->

## with culinary herbs and spices that help combat intestinal

<!-- chunk -->

## dysbiosis, such as oregano, thyme, rosemary, garlic, ginger,

<!-- chunk -->

## turmeric and pepper. The importance of regular aerobic exercise

<!-- chunk -->

## and the right balance of activity and rest would be discussed.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mental pressures and emotional difficulties would also be gently

<!-- chunk -->

## brought into the open as these play a large role in the digestive

<!-- chunk -->

## system and immunity. Then, the herbal prescription would be

<!-- chunk -->

## made. This could consist of herbs in the form of tinctures, teas,

<!-- chunk -->

## capsules or powders for internal use or creams, lotions, or oils

<!-- chunk -->

## for external application. A follow up appointment would be

<!-- chunk -->

## made to review progress, and the treatment may then be

<!-- chunk -->

## modified if necessary. It is always preferable if a patient

<!-- chunk -->

## continues treatment until they feel better or the herbalist has

<!-- chunk -->

## taught them how to continue caring for themselves adequately at

<!-- chunk -->

## home. The role of the herbalist is definitely one of educator.

<!-- chunk -->

### Including garlic in a diet is one of the

<!-- chunk -->

### first steps towards combating

<!-- chunk -->

### intestinal dysbiosis.

# Formulating a Herbal Prescription

# Herbal prescriptions are generally tailor-made for

# each individual, depending on their specific

# needs. They need to address a variety of different

# issues. Digestion and elimination are absolutely

# central to good health and poor digestion, as

# dysbiosis and toxicity are underlying factors in a

# whole range of different illness including gut

# problems, lowered immunity, allergies, auto-

# immune disease, obesity and cancer.

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbs to improve digestion and clear toxicity from the gut are

<!-- chunk -->

## therefore the first consideration. Then there are herbs that can be

<!-- chunk -->

## added for the constitutional imbalance and the system of the

<!-- chunk -->

## body affected, whether it is the nervous system in the case of

<!-- chunk -->

## anxiety and insomnia or the respiratory system in the case of

<!-- chunk -->

## bronchitis. Finally, herbs need to be included that are specific to

<!-- chunk -->

## the actual symptoms or disease, like frankincense for arthritis and

<!-- chunk -->

## uva ursi for urinary tract infections.

<!-- chunk -->

## In short, the following factors need to be addressed when

<!-- chunk -->

## formulating a prescription:

<!-- chunk -->

## • digestion

<!-- chunk -->

## • toxicity

<!-- chunk -->

## • constitution

<!-- chunk -->

## • system involved

<!-- chunk -->

## • disease

<!-- chunk -->

## In the above instance of chronic ear infection, antimicrobial

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs like garlic, turmeric, ginger, golden seal, neem and

<!-- chunk -->

## cinnamon could be given to combat infection and dysbiosis.

<!-- chunk -->

## Those chosen could be combined with immune-enhancing herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## such as andrographis, thyme, echinacea, and pau d'arco.

<!-- chunk -->

## Decongestant herbs like peppermint, elderflowers, yarrow and

<!-- chunk -->

## ginger can be given in teas (as hot infusions work better than

<!-- chunk -->

## tinctures) to clear excess mucous. Diluted essential oils of

<!-- chunk -->

## lavender, chamomile or thyme can be used in ear drops or used

<!-- chunk -->

## for massage around the ear and throat to relieve congestion in the

<!-- chunk -->

## eustachian tube.

<!-- chunk -->

## Many ask how long it will take to recover, and of course this

<!-- chunk -->

## depends very much on the nature of the illness and how long the

<!-- chunk -->

## symptoms have been apparent, as well as on the age,

<!-- chunk -->

## constitution, vitality and strength of the patient. A person treated

<!-- chunk -->

## with herbs may not necessarily “recover” as quickly as one

<!-- chunk -->

## treated with conventional allopathic drugs, but once better the

<!-- chunk -->

## patient will feel stronger than after a course of orthodox

<!-- chunk -->

## medicine. By increasing general health and the efficiency of

<!-- chunk -->

## weak organs or body systems, herbal medicine helps raise

<!-- chunk -->

## resistance to further illness and prevents chronic disease.

# Prescribing Herbal Medicines

<!-- chunk -->

## The method of administering herbs and the length of treatment

<!-- chunk -->

## needed by a patient will vary considerably according to the

<!-- chunk -->

## condition being treated, which herbs are used, their age, build

<!-- chunk -->

## and constitution, and even the time of year.

<!-- chunk -->

### The dosage of herbs chosen for the

<!-- chunk -->

### prescription needs to be carefully

<!-- chunk -->

### determined.

<!-- chunk -->

## The dosage, the herbs chosen for the prescription, and the

<!-- chunk -->

## timing of administration all need to be determined. A largely

<!-- chunk -->

## built person with big bones and muscles, and a comparatively

<!-- chunk -->

## sluggish metabolism, will generally require herbs to be given in

<!-- chunk -->

## larger doses and over a longer period of time than a small

<!-- chunk -->

## framed, lightweight person with a more sensitive body and faster

<!-- chunk -->

## metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dosage for adult patients can also vary according to the

<!-- chunk -->

## practitioner and which kind of herbal medicines they practice. A

<!-- chunk -->

## standard dose of tincture can vary from a few drops to 5mls (one

<!-- chunk -->

## teaspoon). Teas are generally taken a cupful at a time, powders

<!-- chunk -->

## are taken in doses of ¼–1 tsp and syrups may require being

<!-- chunk -->

## taken a dessertspoon or tablespoon at a time.

# Chronic and Acute Conditions

<!-- chunk -->

## When treating chronic conditions, generally mild herbal remedies

<!-- chunk -->

## are taken three times daily, over months at a time if necessary. It

<!-- chunk -->

## may be that the first prescription and dietary advice is intended to

<!-- chunk -->

## improve digestion and absorption and to clear toxins from the

<!-- chunk -->

## system, which is necessary in so many cases. This will be

<!-- chunk -->

## followed up by more nourishing tonic medicines until the patient

<!-- chunk -->

## is better. Acute conditions may require stronger herbs given up

<!-- chunk -->

## to every two hours. To illustrate, ashwagandha is nourishing and

<!-- chunk -->

## strengthening and is taken often 2–3 times a day over a few

<!-- chunk -->

## weeks or months to improve energy, vitality, immunity and

<!-- chunk -->

## enhance resilience to stress. Echinacea and wild indigo are taken

<!-- chunk -->

## every 2 hours to enhance immunity and combat acute infections.

# Appropriate Administration

<!-- chunk -->

## Hot preparations are needed when treating fevers, colds, catarrh

<!-- chunk -->

## and problems associated with cold, such as poor circulation and

<!-- chunk -->

## menstrual cramps. Others problems such as urinary problems

<!-- chunk -->

## and conditions associated with heat, such as hot flushes and acne,

<!-- chunk -->

## are better suited to cool preparations. Skin problems may

<!-- chunk -->

## improve more rapidly using herbal teas as opposed to tinctures,

<!-- chunk -->

## while tinctures may be preferable when more concentrated

<!-- chunk -->

## medicines are needed, as when treating a virulent infection.

<!-- chunk -->

## The herbs chosen may also indicate their best method of

<!-- chunk -->

## administration. When giving teas, the aerial parts of a plant are

<!-- chunk -->

## prepared as infusions while roots, barks and seeds are better

<!-- chunk -->

## suited to decoctions. Nourishing tonics are best taken as powders

<!-- chunk -->

## stirred into warm milk or water, while warming spices to clear

<!-- chunk -->

## catarrhal congestion and coughs can be taken as powders mixed

<!-- chunk -->

## with honey and taken off a spoon.

<!-- chunk -->

## Generally, herbs are taken either side of or during a meal.

<!-- chunk -->

## When using herbs to enhance appetite, digestion and absorption,

<!-- chunk -->

## they can be taken before a meal; for problems associated with

<!-- chunk -->

## heat, acidity and inflammation they can be taken with a meal,

<!-- chunk -->

## otherwise they can be taken immediately after eating. Tinctures

<!-- chunk -->

## need to be diluted with water, otherwise they can be unpleasant

<!-- chunk -->

## tasting and can irritate a delicate stomach.

# Safety Issues

# The question of possible side effects and toxicity

# has arisen more lately as herbs are increasingly

# under the scrutiny of the scientific eye. However,

# adverse reactions to herbal medicines seldom

# occur in practice, and those that do occur

# generally consist of mild rashes or bowel

# changes. A herbal practitioner would not

# normally expect a “healing crisis” with an

# exacerbation of symptoms before they start to

# recede.

<!-- chunk -->

## There are two main sources of information about the efficacy and

<!-- chunk -->

## the safety of herbal medicines – ancient folklore and modern

<!-- chunk -->

## science. The empirical evidence gathered by herbalists over

<!-- chunk -->

## thousands of years, which is now being increasingly justified by

<!-- chunk -->

## scientific research, means that patients may be assured that their

<!-- chunk -->

## herbal prescriptions are based on reliable foundations. Many

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs form the basis of modern orthodox medicines, and it may

<!-- chunk -->

## be surprising to learn that the pharmaceutical industry harvests

<!-- chunk -->

## huge plantations of herbs for use in the production of drugs each

<!-- chunk -->

## year. It also grows herbs for further research activities.

<!-- chunk -->

## The use of whole plant medicines, as opposed to isolated active

<!-- chunk -->

## ingredients, helps to prevent adverse side effects. The many

<!-- chunk -->

## types of substances in medicinal plants work synergistically

<!-- chunk -->

## together, and probably all have important roles to play in the

<!-- chunk -->

## healing process. The primary healing agents are the active

<!-- chunk -->

## constituents that were isolated by the early chemists and

<!-- chunk -->

## developed into modern drugs, but the importance of the other

<!-- chunk -->

## apparently secondary constituents should not be ignored, since

<!-- chunk -->

## they are vital for determining the efficacy of the primary healing

<!-- chunk -->

## agents. Some secondary synergistic substances make the active

<!-- chunk -->

## constituents more easily assimilated and available in the body,

<!-- chunk -->

## while others will buffer the action of other potent plant

<!-- chunk -->

## chemicals, preventing possible side effects. It is largely the

<!-- chunk -->

## combination of both types of substances occurring in the whole

<!-- chunk -->

## plant that determines the potency and safety of herbal medicine.

# Potential Adverse Reactions

<!-- chunk -->

## Having said this, with the huge range of biochemical constituents

<!-- chunk -->

## that occur in herbs it is possible that, though generally safe, some

<!-- chunk -->

## could potentially cause allergic reactions and idiosyncratic

<!-- chunk -->

## responses in the same way that foods do. Most of these can be

<!-- chunk -->

## avoided by herbalists who are generally familiar with the

<!-- chunk -->

## chemistry of herbs they are prescribing and only prescribe herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## which are formulated to suit the specific needs of the patient in

<!-- chunk -->

## appropriate doses only after taking a detailed case history.

<!-- chunk -->

## Certain people are more likely to have hypersensitive reactions to

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs than others, particularly those who already have a history

<!-- chunk -->

## of food allergy or intolerance or chemical sensitivity. This is

<!-- chunk -->

## more likely if they suffer from digestive problems, specifically

<!-- chunk -->

## imbalances in the intestinal flora and leaky gut syndrome, which

<!-- chunk -->

## actually lend themselves very well to herbal treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

## The risk of adulteration of herbs supplied to herbalists is one

<!-- chunk -->

## that is obviously a concern. Adverse effects have occurred on

<!-- chunk -->

## occasions due to adulteration with toxic herbs, as well as bad

<!-- chunk -->

## labelling. When buying herbs, it is vital that their sources are

<!-- chunk -->

## known, reputable and preferably organic, since adverse reactions

<!-- chunk -->

## to pesticides and preservatives are hard to quantify and could be

<!-- chunk -->

## confused with reactions to a plant itself. Indian and Chinese

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs are considered more of a safety problem than European

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs, although the use of pesticides in Eastern Europe has also

<!-- chunk -->

## attracted negative attention.

# Herb/Drug Interactions

<!-- chunk -->

## This is a relatively new science but available information on the

<!-- chunk -->

## subject (much of which may be speculative rather than empirical)

<!-- chunk -->

## is growing all the time. Although herbs have been taken for

<!-- chunk -->

## thousands of years, they have only been used in combination

<!-- chunk -->

## with nutritional supplements and allopathic drugs on a

<!-- chunk -->

## widespread basis for approximately the last forty years or so.

<!-- chunk -->

## The concern is not so much that the reaction between a herb and

<!-- chunk -->

## a drug is toxic, rather that it is possible that certain herbs can

<!-- chunk -->

# The Herbal Pharmacy

# There are many ways to prepare herbal remedies

# so that they will be absorbed by the body and

# exert their beneficial effects. Depending on the

# condition being treated, and the health and age of

# the patient, a herbalist might choose to prescribe

# an infusion, a powder or a tincture, or a cream to

# apply to the skin. Here are step-by-step

# instructions for preparing these remedies and

# others including decoctions, honeys, elixirs,

# poultices and fragrant baths. Dosage instructions

# are included.

# Preparing Herbs

# Collecting wild herbs or growing them in your

# garden and harvesting them for making medicines

# can be very rewarding and uplifting. For those

# who do not have access to fresh plants, dried

# herbs are available from many suppliers. Try to

# use organic herbs as pesticides may disrupt the

# therapeutic effect of your remedies or cause

# adverse reactions.

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbs can be prepared as medicines in a variety of ways. What is

<!-- chunk -->

## important is that they are absorbed into the body so that they can

<!-- chunk -->

## exert their benefit. When internal preparations are swallowed,

<!-- chunk -->

## they pass through the digestive tract and into the bloodstream.

<!-- chunk -->

## Many people are unconsciously taking herbal remedies in their

<!-- chunk -->

## food on a daily basis, for not only do all the culinary herbs and

<!-- chunk -->

## spices add flavour to our diet, but also they contain volatile oils

<!-- chunk -->

## that have digestive and antimicrobial effects among many other

<!-- chunk -->

## benefits. As foods are absorbed from the digestive tract, so the

<!-- chunk -->

## therapeutic constituents of the herbs enter the bloodstream and

<!-- chunk -->

## then circulate around the body.

<!-- chunk -->

## When used externally, herbs can be applied to the skin as in an

<!-- chunk -->

## aromatherapy massage or when we rub a dock leaf on to a nettle

<!-- chunk -->

## sting. They can also be used in herbal baths, compresses and

<!-- chunk -->

## poultices. Once in contact with the skin, they are absorbed into

<!-- chunk -->

## tiny capillaries under the surface and then circulated round the

<!-- chunk -->

## body. The conjunctiva of the eye also absorbs herbal

<!-- chunk -->

## preparations. A chamomile eyebath or a marigold compress will

<!-- chunk -->

## relieve sore and inflamed eyes. Inhalations are another very good

<!-- chunk -->

## therapeutic pathway and one that is utilised by aromatherapists.

<!-- chunk -->

## By inhalation into the nose which is lined with nerve endings, the

<!-- chunk -->

## messages from the herbs are carried directly to the brain and also

<!-- chunk -->

## to the lungs, where they are absorbed with oxygen into the

<!-- chunk -->

## bloodstream and circulated throughout the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Grinding herbs ready for use.

# Preparations for Internal Use

# Infusions

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbal teas, often known as infusions, are simple water-based

<!-- chunk -->

## preparations that extract the medicinal properties of herbs, used

<!-- chunk -->

## either fresh or dried. They can either be drunk as teas or used

<!-- chunk -->

## externally as skin washes, eyebaths, compresses, douches, or

<!-- chunk -->

## added to baths or sitz baths.

<!-- chunk -->

## Infusions are prepared like a normal cup of tea using the soft

<!-- chunk -->

## parts of plants: leaves, stems and flowers.


<!-- chunk -->

## Take 1oz /25 gms of dried herb per pint of water or a

<!-- chunk -->

## teaspoon of herb per cupful of water. Double the amount of

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs if they are being used fresh.


<!-- chunk -->

## Place the herbs in a warmed teapot and pour on boiling

<!-- chunk -->

## water. Cover immediately to prevent volatile oils escaping

<!-- chunk -->

## into the atmosphere.

# 3

<!-- chunk -->

## Leave to infuse for 10–15 minutes and then strain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Infusions are generally best drunk when still hot, especially

<!-- chunk -->

## when treating fevers, colds and catarrh, but they need to be taken

<!-- chunk -->

## luke warm to cool for problems of the skin and urinary tract. If

<!-- chunk -->

## necessary, they can be covered and stored in the fridge for up to

<!-- chunk -->

## two days. Some herbs need to be prepared as cold infusions as

<!-- chunk -->

## their therapeutic components are likely to be destroyed by high

<!-- chunk -->

## temperatures. These include herbs that have a high proportion of

<!-- chunk -->

## mucilage like marshmallow and plantain leaf. They are prepared

<!-- chunk -->

## in the same way but with cold water and left to infuse for 10–12

<!-- chunk -->

## hours.

# Dosage

<!-- chunk -->

## Infusions are generally taken by the cupful three to six times a

<!-- chunk -->

## day, depending on whether the ailment being treated is chronic or

<!-- chunk -->

## acute. It may come as a surprise to some who are used to the

<!-- chunk -->

## enticing tastes of culinary herbs such as basil and rosemary, that

<!-- chunk -->

## many herbs are found by our pampered palates to taste strange,

<!-- chunk -->

## often even unpleasant. Although the bitters in some herbs need

<!-- chunk -->

## to be tasted to be effective, the bitter taste is generally not

<!-- chunk -->

## something we relish. However, it is possible to combine several

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs together in an infusion so that aromatic, pleasant tasting

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs such as peppermint, fennel, lemon balm and lavender can

<!-- chunk -->

## disguise less palatable herbs while not reducing their effects.

<!-- chunk -->

## Liquorice and aniseed also make excellent herbs for flavouring.

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbal teabags are sold in all high street health food shops and

<!-- chunk -->

## supermarkets (buy organic if you can) and normally comprise

<!-- chunk -->

## the more aromatic, pleasant tasting herbs like lime flower, fennel,

<!-- chunk -->

## peppermint.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hot infusions are more effective than

<!-- chunk -->

### tinctures for treating skin complaints,

<!-- chunk -->

### fevers, colds and catarrh.

# Decoctions

<!-- chunk -->

## The hard woody parts of plants have tough cell walls that require

<!-- chunk -->

## greater heat to break them down before they will release their

<!-- chunk -->

## constituents into water. Bark, seeds, roots, rhizomes and nuts all

<!-- chunk -->

## need to be prepared as decoctions. Use the same proportion of

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs to water as you do when preparing an infusion, just add a

<!-- chunk -->

## little more water to make up for losses during boiling.


<!-- chunk -->

## To make their constituents more accessible to the water,

<!-- chunk -->

## break the herb up into small pieces with a pestle and mortar

<!-- chunk -->

## if the parts are very hard.


<!-- chunk -->

## Place herbs in a stainless steel or enamel saucepan and cover

<!-- chunk -->

## them with cold water. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer for

<!-- chunk -->

## 10–15 minutes.

# 3

<!-- chunk -->

## Strain and drink in the same way as an infusion.

# Tinctures, Glycerites and Vinegars

<!-- chunk -->

## Tinctures are concentrated extracts of herbs made with a mixture

<!-- chunk -->

## of water and alcohol which acts to extract the constituents of the

<!-- chunk -->

## plants and also as a preservative. According to herbal

<!-- chunk -->

## pharmacopoeias there is a correct ratio of water and alcohol to

<!-- chunk -->

## plant matter for each herb depending on the constituents that

<!-- chunk -->

## need extracting. This can range from 25% alcohol for simple

<!-- chunk -->

## glycosides and tannins, to 90% for resins and gums such as those

<!-- chunk -->

## in marigold flowers. Herbs can be used either fresh or dried.


<!-- chunk -->

## Place the chopped herbs in a large clean jar and pour the

<!-- chunk -->

## water and alcohol mixture over it so the plant is immersed.

<!-- chunk -->

## Using dried herbs, the ratio is 1 part of herbs per 5 parts of

<!-- chunk -->

## liquid. Fresh herbs are used in a ratio of 1 part herb to 2 parts

<!-- chunk -->

## liquid. To illustrate, to make 1 litre (1¾ pints) of sage

<!-- chunk -->

## tincture, take 200g (7oz) of dried leaves and pour over 1 litre

<!-- chunk -->

## (1¾ pints) of fluid. Sage requires a 45% alcohol solution so

<!-- chunk -->

## neat brandy or vodka would be perfectly adequate. (It is

<!-- chunk -->

## possible to obtain 96% naturally fermented alcohol. In the

<!-- chunk -->

## UK this requires an alcohol licence which can be obtained

<!-- chunk -->

## from HM Revenue and Customs. If you have this, use 450ml

<!-- chunk -->

## alcohol to 550ml water.) Place an airtight lid on the jar and

<!-- chunk -->

## leave it to macerate away from direct sunlight for no less

<!-- chunk -->

## than two weeks, shaking the jar well about once a day.


<!-- chunk -->

## Once the tincture has macerated, use a press such as a wine

<!-- chunk -->

## press to extract as much of the fluid as possible.

<!-- chunk -->

## Alternatively, squeeze it through muslin which is much

<!-- chunk -->

## harder work but possible. Then discard the herbs, transfer

<!-- chunk -->

## the tincture to a clean, dark bottle with a lid, label it with the

<!-- chunk -->

## name of the herb and the date and store in a cool place.

<!-- chunk -->

## Glycerites are prepared similarly using a mixture of water,

<!-- chunk -->

## alcohol and glycerol to extract the plant's constituents and as a

<!-- chunk -->

## preservative. Glycerol has a sweet, syrup-like consistency which

<!-- chunk -->

## imparts a sweet taste to the preparation making it more palatable

<!-- chunk -->

## than a tincture, and a good medium for children's medicines.

<!-- chunk -->

## Glycerol breaks down chemically into 3 parts fatty acids and

<!-- chunk -->

## part alcohol, so although it tastes sweet it does not contain sugar.

<!-- chunk -->

## Glycerol is particularly good at extracting the aromatic properties

<!-- chunk -->

## of plants and is best used for plants such as lavender, rosemary,

<!-- chunk -->

## rose, basil, chamomile, mint, oregano, thyme and lemon balm.

<!-- chunk -->

### Macerating tinctures.

<!-- chunk -->

## The herbs are used in the same ration as when making

<!-- chunk -->

## tinctures; using dried herbs, the ratio is 1 part of herbs per 5 parts

<!-- chunk -->

## of liquid. Fresh herbs are used in a ratio of 1 part herb to 2 parts

<!-- chunk -->

## liquid. If using vodka or brandy, the ratio of ingredients for the

<!-- chunk -->

## liquid is 60% glycerol, 40% alcohol. (If you have access to 96%

<!-- chunk -->

## alcohol, use 60% glycerol, 20% alcohol and 20% water.)

<!-- chunk -->

## To make a glycerite, place the chopped herbs in a large clean

<!-- chunk -->

## jar and pour the water, alcohol and glycerol mixture over it so

<!-- chunk -->

## the plant is immersed and follow instructions from here on for

<!-- chunk -->

## making tinctures.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tinctures and glycerites are more concentrated than infusions

<!-- chunk -->

## and decoctions, meaning only small amounts need to be taken at

<!-- chunk -->

## regular intervals through the day. The dose will vary from 5-10

<!-- chunk -->

## drops to a 5ml teaspoon which is taken in a little warm water or

<!-- chunk -->

## herbal tea, 3 to 6 times daily depending on whether the condition

<!-- chunk -->

## being treated is chronic or acute. Tinctures can also be added to

<!-- chunk -->

## bath water, mixed with water to compresses, mouthwashes or

<!-- chunk -->

## gargles, or stirred into a base to make ointments or creams. They

<!-- chunk -->

## require more preparation time but they have several advantages.

<!-- chunk -->

## They are easy to store, do not deteriorate in cold or damp

<!-- chunk -->

## conditions, take up relatively little storage space, are easy to carry

<!-- chunk -->

## around and keep almost indefinitely, although they are best taken

<!-- chunk -->

## within two years.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tinctures can also be prepared using neat cider vinegar as the

<!-- chunk -->

## acetic acid acts as a solvent and preservative. Raspberry vinegar

<!-- chunk -->

## for example is a traditional remedy for coughs and sore throats.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fill a wide mouth glass jar full of one fresh herb of your choice.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cover the herb with good quality (preferably apple cider)

<!-- chunk -->

## vinegar, filling the jar to the brim. Cork or cover with a screw

<!-- chunk -->

## top lid. Keep in a cool, dark place for six weeks. Strain through

<!-- chunk -->

## muslin and press well.

# Oxymels

<!-- chunk -->

## The combination of infused cider vinegar and honey is known as

<!-- chunk -->

## an oxymel. The practice originated in the Middle East and was

<!-- chunk -->

## brought to England following the Crusades when the medicines

<!-- chunk -->

## of Avicenna were widely used. Knights and their ladies would be

<!-- chunk -->

## offered hot oxymels when they broke their fast as a stimulating

<!-- chunk -->

## way to start the day. Prepare in the same way as herb vinegars,

<!-- chunk -->

## using equal proportions of honey and cider vinegar.

# Herbal Honeys

<!-- chunk -->

## Honey has been used for healing for thousands of years. It is

<!-- chunk -->

## hydroscopic which means that it absorbs water-soluble

<!-- chunk -->

## constituents and the volatile oils of plants. Honey has

<!-- chunk -->

## antibacterial, immune-enhancing, expectorant and healing

<!-- chunk -->

## properties, and makes an excellent medium for antimicrobial

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs such as garlic, onions, holy basil, thyme, hyssop, oregano

<!-- chunk -->

## and rosemary. It contains pollen which is rich in protein,

<!-- chunk -->

## vitamins, minerals and fatty acids and helpful in the treatment of

<!-- chunk -->

## allergies and asthma, as well as propolis which is a powerful

<!-- chunk -->

## antimicrobial. Being rich in easily digestible sugars, honey is also

<!-- chunk -->

## highly nutritive and energy giving. Herbal honeys can be used to

<!-- chunk -->

## treat sore throats, coughs and colds, chest infections, asthma.

<!-- chunk -->

## They can also be used externally to heal or soothe skin problems

<!-- chunk -->

## such as cuts and grazes, burns and varicose ulcers. Thyme honey

<!-- chunk -->

## from Greece is renowned for its health giving properties, as is

<!-- chunk -->

## Manuka honey from New Zealand, which is often used as an

<!-- chunk -->

## antibacterial.

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbal honeys are made by pouring honey over herbs. Dried

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs preserved in honey are more likely to keep for longer than

<!-- chunk -->

## fresh ones.


<!-- chunk -->

## Place your chosen herbs, coarsely chopped, in a clean,

<!-- chunk -->

## sterilized jar, cover them with runny honey and stir well.


<!-- chunk -->

## Seal with an airtight lid, label clearly and leave to macerate

<!-- chunk -->

## for at least 4 weeks but preferably several months. Store in a

<!-- chunk -->

## cool dark place or in the fridge.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fresh herbs can be used if you have them; simply chop them

<!-- chunk -->

## finely and mix with a teaspoon of honey. You can also make

<!-- chunk -->

## sweets and throat lozenges by mixing powdered dried herbs into

<!-- chunk -->

## honey to make a paste which can be rolled into balls, and then

<!-- chunk -->

## again in the powder to prevent stickiness for handling and

<!-- chunk -->

## storing. Store in a tightly fitting tin.

# Dosage

<!-- chunk -->

## Take 1 tablespoonful of herbal honey in a little hot water or

<!-- chunk -->

## simply off the spoon. Do not give to children under 1 year old

<!-- chunk -->

## due to risk of botulinus.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal honeys.

# Elixirs

<!-- chunk -->

## Honey can also be combined with equal parts of brandy to make

<!-- chunk -->

## my favourite way to take herbs. Elixirs have several benefits.

<!-- chunk -->

## Both the honey and the brandy act as preservatives, increase the

<!-- chunk -->

## shelf life of the medicine, they are very easy to prepare and the

<!-- chunk -->

## combination tastes delicious! The honey brings out the flavour of

<!-- chunk -->

## aromatic herbs and its sweetness offsets the pungency of the

<!-- chunk -->

## brandy.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1 part of dried herbs is mixed with 5 parts of honey and

<!-- chunk -->

## brandy. When using fresh herbs use 1 part of herbs to 2 parts of

<!-- chunk -->

## honey and brandy. Unlike most sweet medicines, it can be used

<!-- chunk -->

## in small doses, thanks to the particular combination of honey and

<!-- chunk -->

## alcohol. Elixirs can either be made with a single herb or

<!-- chunk -->

## combinations of your choice. The dose is 1/2tsp/30 drops 3–6

<!-- chunk -->

## times daily according to whether the problem is chronic or acute.

<!-- chunk -->

## For example, to make elecampane root elixir, take 200gm of

<!-- chunk -->

## the dried root, place in a large jar and cover it with a mixture of

<!-- chunk -->

## 500ml of brandy and 500ml of runny honey. Use a tightly fitting

<!-- chunk -->

## lid and store in a dark place for at least 3 weeks and up to a few

<!-- chunk -->

## months before pressing.

# Herbal Powders

<!-- chunk -->

## Dried herbs can be ground into powder which can be used in a

<!-- chunk -->

## fluid medium or made into tablets or capsules to prolong its shelf

<!-- chunk -->

## life as powder tend to deteriorate relatively quickly. Taking

<!-- chunk -->

## powders has the advantage of ingesting the whole plant and not

<!-- chunk -->

## an extract of it, as in infusions or decoctions, and so it may be

<!-- chunk -->

## more efficacious.

<!-- chunk -->

## Powders are generally taken ½–1 teaspoon in milk, water or

<!-- chunk -->

## honey depending on the vehicle best suited to the condition

<!-- chunk -->

## being treated two to three times daily.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal powders.

# Tablets and Capsules

<!-- chunk -->

## Many herbs are available from herbal suppliers in tablet or

<!-- chunk -->

## capsule form and this is certainly a convenient way to take herbs,

<!-- chunk -->

## but it bypasses the taste buds on the tongue which may reduce

<!-- chunk -->

## the therapeutic effects in some cases. Only standard preparations

<!-- chunk -->

## will be available commercially, so should you require a specific

<!-- chunk -->

## combination of herbs to be given to a patient, these can be made

<!-- chunk -->

## up in vegetable gelatine capsules. Capsules can be filled with

<!-- chunk -->

## mixtures of the appropriate powdered herbs using a capsule

<!-- chunk -->

## maker. There are two main sizes of capsule used by medical

<!-- chunk -->

## herbalist, size 0 which holds 0.35gm of powder and 00 which

<!-- chunk -->

## holds about 0.5gm. One or two of the size 0 capsules can taken

<!-- chunk -->

## times daily and one of the size 00 capsule three times daily.

# Fresh Juices

<!-- chunk -->

## Extracting the juice of a plant is the best way to prepare soft,

<!-- chunk -->

## juicy plants such as aloe vera, purslane, pomegranate, cleavers,

<!-- chunk -->

## ginger, marshmallow, nettle, mint or dandelion. Juice provides a

<!-- chunk -->

## concentrate, easily assimilated by the body. Cabbage juice, for

<!-- chunk -->

## example, is excellent for relieving peptic ulcers, gastritis, heart

<!-- chunk -->

## burn and ulcerative colitis. Fresh juices provide the best source

<!-- chunk -->

## of vital energy and are often preferable, but practically they can

<!-- chunk -->

## only be used where there are fresh herbs available. 10–30ml can

<!-- chunk -->

## be taken daily.

# Herbal Pastes

<!-- chunk -->

## Crushed dried plants or powder mixed with water or aloe gel can

<!-- chunk -->

## be used to make a paste. Pastes are generally intended for

<!-- chunk -->

## poultices and plasters which can be used externally. Herbs that

<!-- chunk -->

## speed healing and soothe the skin can be made into pastes

<!-- chunk -->

## including calendula, turmeric, slippery elm, aloe vera and gotu

<!-- chunk -->

## kola.

# Suppositories

<!-- chunk -->

## Suppositories can be made easily by mixing powdered herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## with cocoa butter. Warm cocoa butter in a double boiler until it

<!-- chunk -->

## melts, remove from the heat and stir in powdered herbs, enough

<!-- chunk -->

## to make a paste. Mix well then place in the fridge to harden.

<!-- chunk -->

## Next, roll it out until it is about ¾″thick and cut into ¾″ strips

<!-- chunk -->

## which can be inserted into the rectum or vagina. Insert one

<!-- chunk -->

## suppository 2–3 times daily.

<!-- chunk -->

## The advantage of using suppositories is that the herbal remedy

<!-- chunk -->

## can be absorbed quickly directly into the bloodstream through

<!-- chunk -->

## the mucosa of the rectum or vagina. This not only enables both

<!-- chunk -->

## local and systemic problems to be treated quickly and simply but

<!-- chunk -->

## it also obviates the laborious process of giving herbs by mouth to

<!-- chunk -->

## travel the distance of the alimentary canal before being absorbed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Making suppositories.

# Preparations for External Use

# Most herbal constituents are absorbed readily

# through the skin and the following preparations

# are designed to enhance this pathway into the

# body. The easiest way of course to use herbs

# externally is to apply them directly to the skin as

# we do when we rub a dock leaf on to a nettle

# sting.

# Juice

<!-- chunk -->

## The fresh juice of many remedies can be applied directly to the

<!-- chunk -->

## skin. Aloe vera juice, for example can be rubbed on to the skin

<!-- chunk -->

## to soothe burns, bites, and stings. The juice of dock leaves is

<!-- chunk -->

## famous for relieving nettle stings. Greater celandine is a very

<!-- chunk -->

## effective treatment for warts. Just pick a stem and it will

<!-- chunk -->

## immediately start to ooze brilliant tangerine-yellow sap. Cover

<!-- chunk -->

## the wart in the juice every day for three weeks and the wart will

<!-- chunk -->

## disappear.

# Ointments and Creams

<!-- chunk -->

## Ointments and creams can be applied to the skin not only to treat

<!-- chunk -->

## skin problems but also to relieve less superficial problems such

<!-- chunk -->

## as inflamed joints and headaches. Any herb fresh or dried can be

<!-- chunk -->

## included in an ointment using this simple recipe:


<!-- chunk -->

## Melt 50gm (2oz) of beeswax with 450mls (¾ pint) of olive

<!-- chunk -->

## oil in a pyrex bowl over a low heat in a double boiler.


<!-- chunk -->

## Add as much herb as possible to the oil and leave to

<!-- chunk -->

## macerate on the heat for a few hours. After this time the

<!-- chunk -->

## constituents will have been taken up by the oil and the

<!-- chunk -->

## mixture can then be poured through a piece of muslin placed

<!-- chunk -->

## over a jug and then squeezed to extract as much of the oil as

<!-- chunk -->

## possible. The herb can then be discarded.

# 3

<!-- chunk -->

## When the oil is still warm it can be poured into clean

<!-- chunk -->

## ointment jars where it will quickly solidify. Seal with an

<!-- chunk -->

## airtight lid and label clearly. Store in a cool, dark place.

<!-- chunk -->

## Creams can be made up easily by stirring tinctures, infusions,

<!-- chunk -->

## decoctions or a few drops of essential oil into a cream base such

<!-- chunk -->

## as aqueous cream. 2–3 drops of chamomile oil mixed into 2oz

<!-- chunk -->

## (50gm) of cream works well on many types of eczema.

# Compresses

<!-- chunk -->

## A clean cloth or flannel can be soaked in a strong hot or cold

<!-- chunk -->

## infusion or a decoction, a dilute tincture or water with a few

<!-- chunk -->

## drops of diluted essential oil, then wrung out and applied to the

<!-- chunk -->

## affected part. This can help relieve symptoms such as headaches,

<!-- chunk -->

## abdominal pain and colic, backache, boils and painful joints. The

<!-- chunk -->

## treatment needs to repeated several times for good effect.

# Poultices

<!-- chunk -->

## These are similar to compresses but involve using the herb itself

<!-- chunk -->

## rather than an extract of the herb.


<!-- chunk -->

## Place the herb, fresh or dried between two pieces of gauze.

<!-- chunk -->

## If you use fresh leaves, stems or roots, they need to be

<!-- chunk -->

## bruised before being applied. If the herbs are dry, add a little

<!-- chunk -->

## hot water to powdered or finely chopped herbs to make a

<!-- chunk -->

## paste.


<!-- chunk -->

## Use a light cotton bandage to bind the gauze poultice to the

<!-- chunk -->

## affected part and keep it warm with a hot water bottle.

<!-- chunk -->

## Replace after 4 hours and apply about 3 times a day in total.

<!-- chunk -->

## Some herbs, such as cabbage leaves, can be applied directly to

<!-- chunk -->

## the skin. They need to be softened first by removing any hard

<!-- chunk -->

## stalks or ribs and immersing them briefly in hot water to prevent

<!-- chunk -->

## any discomfort to the skin. Once applied they can be secured in

<!-- chunk -->

## place by a light bandage and left overnight.

# Liniments

<!-- chunk -->

## A rubbing oil or liniment consists of extracts of herbs in an oil or

<!-- chunk -->

## tincture, or a mixture of both. The oils can be infused oils or

<!-- chunk -->

## essential oils diluted in a base such as sesame oil. They are used

<!-- chunk -->

## in massage to relax or stimulate muscles and ligaments, or to

<!-- chunk -->

## soothe away pain from inflammation or injury. They are intended

<!-- chunk -->

## to be absorbed by the skin to reach the affected part, and so they

<!-- chunk -->

## often contain stimulating essential oils such as ginger or black

<!-- chunk -->

## pepper and are therefore not suitable for use on delicate baby

<!-- chunk -->

## skins.

# Oils

<!-- chunk -->

## Essential oils need to be used with care especially with children

<!-- chunk -->

## and babies. They can be used diluted in a base oil such as sesame

<!-- chunk -->

## oil (1–2 drops of oil per 5ml of base oil) for massage and to add

<!-- chunk -->

## to the bath. They can be used in burners to permeate the

<!-- chunk -->

## atmosphere or in inhalations for a variety of symptoms such as

<!-- chunk -->

## colds, catarrh, coughs, insomnia and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

## While essential oils are extracted from aromatic plants

<!-- chunk -->

## professionally by steam distillation, infused oils can be prepared

<!-- chunk -->

## easily at home.


<!-- chunk -->

## Place finely chopped, preferably fresh herbs (make sure

<!-- chunk -->

## they are not wet) in a jar with a tight fitting lid, cover them

<!-- chunk -->

## with an oil such as almond, coconut, olive or sesame,

<!-- chunk -->

## pouring it up to the top of the jar, and then stir well.


<!-- chunk -->

## Add the lid, label the jar with the name of the herb and the

<!-- chunk -->

## date, then leave the jar on a sunny windowsill to macerate for

<!-- chunk -->

## about 2 to 4 weeks. Be aware that if there is moisture on the

<!-- chunk -->

## plant or in the jar, or it is left too long, the oil may go

<!-- chunk -->

## mouldy.

<!-- chunk -->

## The oil will gradually take up the constituents of the plant; you

<!-- chunk -->

## can see this in action when you macerate St John's wort flowers

<!-- chunk -->

## in oil. In a matter of minutes, the oil will turn a deep red colour.

<!-- chunk -->

## St John's wort oil is a very useful remedy for healing cuts and

<!-- chunk -->

## sores, and when massaged over the affected part, it can relieve

<!-- chunk -->

## painful nerve conditions such as trigeminal neuralgia and

<!-- chunk -->

## shingles. After 2–4 weeks filter the oil through muslin into a

<!-- chunk -->

## clean jug, squeezing hard to extract as much oil as possible from

<!-- chunk -->

## the flowers. Then pour into an airtight, dark bottle, label it with

<!-- chunk -->

## the name and date of the oil, and store in a cool dark place to

<!-- chunk -->

## retain its therapeutic value for a maximum length of time.

# Herbal Baths

<!-- chunk -->

## A fragrant hot bath makes a very pleasant and simple way to take

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs. There are various ways of adding herbs to bath water; you

<!-- chunk -->

## can use dilute essential oils (1 drop of essential oil per drop of

<!-- chunk -->

## base oil such as sesame oil) and add them to the bath water; hang

<!-- chunk -->

## a muslin bag containing fresh or dried aromatic herbs under the

<!-- chunk -->

## hot tap as you draw the bath; or pour a pint (600ml) of a strong

<!-- chunk -->

## herbal infusion (double the standard dose described on page 79)

<!-- chunk -->

## into the water. Soak in the warm bath for 10-20 minutes.

<!-- chunk -->

## When herbs are used in this way, the essential oils from the

<!-- chunk -->

## plants are taken in via the pores of the skin which are opened up

<!-- chunk -->

## by the warmth of the water. The oils are also carried on the steam

<!-- chunk -->

## which is simultaneously inhaled via nose and mouth into the

<!-- chunk -->

## lungs, and from there into the bloodstream. From the nose

<!-- chunk -->

## messages are carried from the oils via nerve pathways to the

<!-- chunk -->

## brain. In this way herbal medicines are assimilated quickly and

<!-- chunk -->

## directly, bypassing the lengthy process of digestion involved

<!-- chunk -->

## when herbs are taken by mouth. They are particularly useful for

<!-- chunk -->

## relaxing and soothing the nervous system and for easing mental

<!-- chunk -->

## and emotional strain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lavender, lemon balm, basil, holy basil, rose and chamomile

<!-- chunk -->

## are not only wonderfully fragrant but also relaxing, calming

<!-- chunk -->

## tension and anxiety and helping to ensure restful sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

## Chamomile is excellent for fractious children, particularly when

<!-- chunk -->

## they are unwell, for not only does it possess antimicrobial

<!-- chunk -->

## properties but also it helps induce sleep – nature's best way to

<!-- chunk -->

## ward off infection and enable self-healing. Rosemary baths,

<!-- chunk -->

## while also relaxing, have a stimulating edge as they enhance

<!-- chunk -->

## blood flow to the head and promote alertness and concentration.

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbal sitz baths can be very useful for soothing the pain and

<!-- chunk -->

## irritation of cystitis, vaginal infections or haemorrhoids. Simply

<!-- chunk -->

## fill a large, shallow bowl with about a litre (1.75 pints) of

<!-- chunk -->

## strained, strong infusion, enough to reach the necessary areas, sit

<!-- chunk -->

## in it and relax for 10–15 minutes!

# Hand and Foot Baths

<!-- chunk -->

## Mustard foot baths were used historically for all afflictions of

<!-- chunk -->

## cold and damp climates, from colds and flu to poor circulation

<!-- chunk -->

## and arthritis. The ancient tradition of hand and foot baths was

<!-- chunk -->

## made popular by the famous French herbalist, Maurice

<!-- chunk -->

## Messegue, who has written several books on herbal therapy

<!-- chunk -->

## based simply on this form of treatment. He recommends foot

<!-- chunk -->

## baths for 8 minutes in the evening and hand baths for 8 minutes

<!-- chunk -->

## in the morning. According to Messegue, the hands and feet are

<!-- chunk -->

## highly sensitive areas of the skin, rich in nerve endings and,

<!-- chunk -->

## despite some thickening of the skin from use, the constituents

<!-- chunk -->

## pass easily from the skin into the body. To try this, add

<!-- chunk -->

## 1tablespoon of mustard powder to a bowl of hot water, test the

<!-- chunk -->

## temperature and then sit with your feet in it for 8–10 minutes.

# Shelf Life

<!-- chunk -->

## The way herbs are prepared and stored is important as it will

<!-- chunk -->

## affect the length of time that plants will maintain their therapeutic

<!-- chunk -->

## components and therefore their beneficial effects. Powders have

<!-- chunk -->

## the shortest “shelf life,” which means the amount of time they

<!-- chunk -->

## can be stored on your shelves, and generally should be kept in

<!-- chunk -->

## dark, air tight containers and for no more than 6–9 months.

<!-- chunk -->

## Because they tend to oxidise and thereby deteriorate relatively

<!-- chunk -->

## rapidly, powders are often made into capsules and tablets to

<!-- chunk -->

## extend their shelf life; some are given protective coatings.

<!-- chunk -->

## Powders can also be combined with pastes and herbal extracts to

<!-- chunk -->

## extend their shelf life. Tablets will keep for longer, although they

<!-- chunk -->

## should be stored similarly away from direct sunlight. Herbal

<!-- chunk -->

## tinctures and glycerites will keep up to 3 years.

<!-- chunk -->

### Stored properly, herbal tinctures will

<!-- chunk -->

### keep up to 3 years.

# The Materia Medica

# A Materia Medica is a compendium of medicinal

# herbs used for their theraputic effects, and

# traditionally describes each herb's

# pharmacological properties and medicinal actions.

# The first such collection of knowledge on healing

# plants appeared in India around 700 BCE,

# compiled by the scholar Charaka, and a similar

# manual was assembled in China around 1000 CE.

# The term Materia Medica is Latin and has been

# around since Roman times when Dioscorides

# wrote a five-volume in Greek, De Materia

# Medica, which was subsequently translated into

# Latin around 60 CE. Dioscorides' book was a

# commentary on around 500 medicinal plants.

# How to Use the Materia Medica

# The Materia Medica is the heart of this book. It is

# a comprehensive directory of the 150 herbs most

# commonly used by modern Western herbalists.

# They are all easily available from most herbal

# suppliers, and because this book is intended for

# use by lay people as well as students and

# practitioners of herbal medicine, none of them is a

# “Schedule 3” herb, that is herbs whose dosage is

# restricted by law due to the presence of powerful

# constituents, often alkaloids, that require caution

# in their use.

# The Materia Medica is a detailed herb directory,

# organised alphabetically by Latin name. Each

# entry includes the common name, family, parts

# used, major constituents and the actions of the

# plants. It then lists the herb's indications for use

# in treatment according to the systems of the body,

# including recent cross-reference to the Treating

# Common Ailments chapter (see pages 275–353)

# so that you can be informed about the herbs that

# you choose.

# Treating Common Ailments

# The most common health problems that respond

# to herbal remedies are profiled in this chapter. The

# ailments are organised by body system, and each

# treatment protocol offers advice on herbs to be

# used and effective methods for their

# administration. Supportive action is suggested for

# each condition, including changes to diet and

# lifestyle and supplements that could augment

# herbal treatment.

# The Digestive System

# Good digestion is absolutely essential to good

# health. The digestive system enables our bodies

# to convert the food we eat into the energy needed

# for all the minute biochemical reactions that keep

# us alive. It also provides the major pathway for

# the elimination of toxins from the body.

<!-- chunk -->

## Health and vitality largely depend not only on an excellent diet

<!-- chunk -->

## but also on how efficiently our digestion makes the nutrients

<!-- chunk -->

## available to us and, in turn, passes out undigested food residues

<!-- chunk -->

## and the waste products of metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

## The digestive tract is lined with a protective mucous membrane

<!-- chunk -->

## which serves to secrete digestive juices that contain enzymes

<!-- chunk -->

## designed to break food down into a form that our bodies can

<!-- chunk -->

## absorb. Digestion starts in the mouth with the action of the

<!-- chunk -->

## enzymes in saliva on the food we eat, but most of the process

<!-- chunk -->

## takes place in the stomach and small intestine. Other digestive

<!-- chunk -->

## enzymes are supplied to the digestive tract by the liver,

<!-- chunk -->

## gallbladder and pancreas. The conversion of food in the

<!-- chunk -->

## digestive tract provides energy, but it also requires energy to

<!-- chunk -->

## carry out all the essential biochemical reactions involved in the

<!-- chunk -->

## process. If our digestive energy is low or upset, it can lead to

<!-- chunk -->

## digestive symptoms such as wind, bloating stomach aches, IBS

<!-- chunk -->

## (irritable bowel syndrome), diarrhoea and constipation, and can

<!-- chunk -->

## fundamentally affect our general health and energy, predisposing

<!-- chunk -->

## to lethargy, lowered immunity, nervous problems, poor

<!-- chunk -->

## concentration and sleep disturbances.

# Influencing Factors

<!-- chunk -->

## Good digestion and elimination depend on several factors. We

<!-- chunk -->

## need to eat sufficient fibre from whole foods, vegetables and

<!-- chunk -->

## fruits and to drink plenty of fluids to ensure regular peristaltic

<!-- chunk -->

## movements that propel food along the alimentary canal. The

<!-- chunk -->

## right diet is vital to good health and normal function of the

<!-- chunk -->

## digestive tract. Over-refined foods, excess sugar, fizzy drinks, ice

<!-- chunk -->

## cream, and too many fermented and fried foods can all irritate

<!-- chunk -->

## and cause disturbances. Indigestible foods such as bread, hard

<!-- chunk -->

## cheese, red meat and hard raw food such as nuts and seeds can

<!-- chunk -->

## leave partly digested or undigested food residues in the gut that

<!-- chunk -->

## are prone to fermentation and predispose to a toxic state in the

<!-- chunk -->

## gut.

<!-- chunk -->

## We need to eliminate food residues as well as the waste

<!-- chunk -->

## products of cellular metabolism every day, to help prevent

<!-- chunk -->

## fermentation and toxicity and the absorption of these toxins into

<!-- chunk -->

## the blood stream, and thence into the whole body. Dysbiosis, or a

<!-- chunk -->

## toxic state of the bowel involving a disturbance of the bacterial

<!-- chunk -->

## population of the gut, is increasingly being recognised as one of

<!-- chunk -->

## the underlying causes of many health problems including IBS,

<!-- chunk -->

## allergies, auto-immune disease and obesity.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Digestive System

<!-- chunk -->

### Ingested food is broken down in the

<!-- chunk -->

### alimentary canal in a form that can be

<!-- chunk -->

### assimilated by the body. Digestion

<!-- chunk -->

### begins in the mouth with the action of

<!-- chunk -->

### saliva on food, but most of the

<!-- chunk -->

### process takes place within the

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach and small intestine.

<!-- chunk -->

## There is a constant reaction between the brain and the digestive

<!-- chunk -->

## system, making digestion susceptible to the effects of the mind

<!-- chunk -->

## and emotions, and therefore to stress of various kinds. The

<!-- chunk -->

## nervous system regulates the circulation to and from the

<!-- chunk -->

## digestive tract, as well as the secretion of digestive juices.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tension and anxiety can reduce the flow of digestive enzymes

<!-- chunk -->

## and inhibit good digestion. Alternatively, stress may trigger

<!-- chunk -->

## excess secretion of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, which can

<!-- chunk -->

## irritate, inflame and in some cases ulcerate the lining of the

<!-- chunk -->

## stomach or intestine.

<!-- chunk -->

## The herbal Materia Medica offers a huge range of remedies for

<!-- chunk -->

## almost every kind of digestive disorder. For example, warming

<!-- chunk -->

## spices such as ginger, cinnamon, cardamom and long pepper will

<!-- chunk -->

## stimulate the secretion of digestive enzymes; mucilage-rich herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## including slippery elm and marshmallow sooth irritation; fennel,

<!-- chunk -->

## peppermint and chamomile ease pain and spasm and bitter herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## such as dandelion, burdock, agrimony and chicory support the

<!-- chunk -->

## liver.

# Dysbiosis

<!-- chunk -->

## Intestinal bacteria in a healthy gut synthesise vitamins, and aid

<!-- chunk -->

## absorption of minerals and trace elements including calcium,

<!-- chunk -->

## magnesium, zinc and iron. They also break down dietary toxins

<!-- chunk -->

## (making them less harmful), stimulate local immunity (inhibiting

<!-- chunk -->

## infections like Salmonella and decreasing the risk of food

<!-- chunk -->

## poisoning) and enhance general immunity. Four-fifths of the

<!-- chunk -->

## body's immune system is found in the gut lining.

<!-- chunk -->

## The use of antibiotics and steroids, the contraceptive pill and

<!-- chunk -->

## HRT, together with poor digestion and stress, can lead to the

<!-- chunk -->

## proliferation of pathogenic yeasts and bacteria in the gut which

<!-- chunk -->

## create toxins, destroy vitamins, inactivate digestive enzymes and

<!-- chunk -->

## lead to the formation of chemicals which are carcinogenic.

<!-- chunk -->

## Unfriendly microorganisms in the gut can also cause leaky gut

<!-- chunk -->

## syndrome and provoke inflammatory diseases including

<!-- chunk -->

## ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and arthritis by causing

<!-- chunk -->

## autoimmune reactions, as well as liver problems. Symptoms of

<!-- chunk -->

## yeast overgrowth include vaginal thrush, chronic diarrhoea,

<!-- chunk -->

## allergic reactions, asthma, hives, psoriasis, eczema, migraine,

<!-- chunk -->

## recurrent infections, abdominal pain, cystitis, catarrh, depression

<!-- chunk -->

## and lethargy.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Cat's claw, garlic, myrrh, andrographis, golden seal, olive leaf

<!-- chunk -->

## and reishi mushroom are excellent for combating pathogenic

<!-- chunk -->

## microorganisms in the gut.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Oregon grape, elecampane, dill, burdock, bearberry,

<!-- chunk -->

## calendula, echinacea, fennel, amalaki and kelp act similarly.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Aloe vera juice (25mls twice daily) is soothing, immune

<!-- chunk -->

## enhancing and also combats dysbiosis.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Antimicrobial spices turmeric, cinnamon, ginger and long

<!-- chunk -->

## pepper enhance the secretion of digestive enzymes and can be

<!-- chunk -->

## added daily to food and herbal teas.

<!-- chunk -->

### Reishi mushrooms can help overcome

<!-- chunk -->

### intestinal dysbiosis by fighting the

<!-- chunk -->

### growth of pathogenic micro-

<!-- chunk -->

### organisms.


<!-- chunk -->

## Supplements of probiotics including lactobacillus acidophilus

<!-- chunk -->

## and bifida bacteria as well as small amounts of fermented foods

<!-- chunk -->

## such as cider vinegar with the mother, miso, sauerkraut, kefir,

<!-- chunk -->

## kombucha and live yoghurt help restore normal bacterial

<!-- chunk -->

## population of the gut. Vitamin C (500mg daily), caprylic acid

<!-- chunk -->

## (1gm with meals), linseed and evening primrose oil are also

<!-- chunk -->

## helpful.

# Constipation

<!-- chunk -->

## It is important to ascertain and treat the causes of constipation

<!-- chunk -->

## and not to become reliant on the use of laxative medicines, which

<!-- chunk -->

## can be taken in the short term but may aggravate the problem in

<!-- chunk -->

## the long run.

<!-- chunk -->

## Causes of constipation include lack of exercise, ignoring the

<!-- chunk -->

## urge, old age, piles, IBS, diverticulitis, food intolerance or

<!-- chunk -->

## allergy – particularly to dairy and gluten – dysbiosis, nutritional

<!-- chunk -->

## deficiency, excess sugar and refined carbohydrates and

<!-- chunk -->

## insufficient fibre from fruit, vegetables and whole grains, and

<!-- chunk -->

## tension in the bowel from stress. It is important to remedy

<!-- chunk -->

## constipation, since toxins formed from reabsorption in the bowel

<!-- chunk -->

## may cause chronic disease.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Linseed, fenugreek or psyllium seeds can be used to bulk out

<!-- chunk -->

## bowel contents and push them along. Soak 1–2 tsp of seeds in

<!-- chunk -->

## a cup of hot water for 2 hours. Add lemon and honey if you

<!-- chunk -->

## like and drink at bedtime. It is important to drink plenty of

<!-- chunk -->

## water.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Liquorice, dandelion root and burdock root taken as

<!-- chunk -->

## decoctions 3 times a day are also effective for mild

<!-- chunk -->

## constipation.

<!-- chunk -->

## • If necessary, add more stimulating laxative herbs such as

<!-- chunk -->

## yellow dock root or senna pods with a little ginger for a week

<!-- chunk -->

## or two.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For stress-related constipation, add chamomile, lemon balm,

<!-- chunk -->

## dill, hops or cramp bark.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Garlic, thyme, burdock or marigold work well for dysbiosis.

<!-- chunk -->

## Live yoghurt and other fermented foods, as well as

<!-- chunk -->

## supplements of probiotics can also help the dysbiosis that is

<!-- chunk -->

## often at the root of constipation.


<!-- chunk -->

## 30 minutes of exercise daily is recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: If constipation is persistent, develops suddenly or with

<!-- chunk -->

## pain, seek medical attention.

# Diarrhoea

<!-- chunk -->

## Diarrhoea represents the body's attempt to rid itself of poisons or

<!-- chunk -->

## irritants (including drugs, chemicals and allergens), inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

## or infection in the gut, so it is important not to stop it but to

<!-- chunk -->

## address the underlying causes. It is vital to drink plenty of fluids

<!-- chunk -->

## to replace the water and electrolytes that are lost.

<!-- chunk -->

### Raspberry leaf helps to tone the gut

<!-- chunk -->

### and aids digestion.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Astringent herbs agrimony, bayberry, cinnamon, raspberry

<!-- chunk -->

## leaf or yarrow can be used to dry up secretions and tone the

<!-- chunk -->

## gut.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Demulcent herbs slippery elm and marshmallow will soothe

<!-- chunk -->

## irritation and act as prebiotics to support beneficial flora in the

<!-- chunk -->

## gut.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Chamomile, hops, wild yaw, dill and lemon balm will reduce

<!-- chunk -->

## anxiety in stress related diarrhoea.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Digestives ginger, cinnamon, turmeric and coriander taken

<!-- chunk -->

## regularly as teas or in food will enhance secretion of digestive

<!-- chunk -->

## enzymes.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For infection causing gastroenteritis and dysbiosis, use

<!-- chunk -->

## antimicrobials including oregano, thyme, chamomile,

<!-- chunk -->

## cinnamon, pau d'arco, garlic and ginger. Acidophyllus

<!-- chunk -->

## supplements are also useful.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Antispasmodics such as peppermint, ginger, dill and

<!-- chunk -->

## chamomile relieve cramping pain, while anti-inflammatories

<!-- chunk -->

## chamomile, hops, aloe vera, meadowsweet and yarrow will

<!-- chunk -->

## relieve inflammation.


<!-- chunk -->

## Gluten and dairy can cause food intolerances, red meat and too

<!-- chunk -->

## much hard, raw food can be indigestible and aggravate; therefore

<!-- chunk -->

## these are best avoided until better.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: If diarrhoea persists or is accompanied by fever, or there

<!-- chunk -->

## is mucus or blood in stools, seek medical attention.

# Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)

<!-- chunk -->

## The bowel can become irritated and inflamed by poorly digested

<!-- chunk -->

## and putrefying foods caused by weak digestion, stress, poor diet

<!-- chunk -->

## and disturbance of the gut flora resulting from a gut infection,

<!-- chunk -->

## poor digestion or the use of antibiotics or other drugs. This can

<!-- chunk -->

## lead to leaky gut syndrome, food intolerances and lowered

<!-- chunk -->

## immunity. The bowel becomes overactive with alternating

<!-- chunk -->

## diarrhoea and constipation, flatulence, and discomfort.

<!-- chunk -->

### Agrimony is a good astringent and

<!-- chunk -->

### digestive tonic and can be helpful in

<!-- chunk -->

### relieving diarrhoea.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic herbs such as

<!-- chunk -->

## chamomile, wild yam, cramp bark, meadowsweet, peppermint,

<!-- chunk -->

## hops and lemon balm can be helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Demulcents like slippery elm, aloe vera and marshmallow are

<!-- chunk -->

## soothing and healing.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Astringents including yarrow, thyme, agrimony and bayberry

<!-- chunk -->

## protect the gut wall from irritation.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Relaxants such as lemon balm, California poppy, vervain, dill,

<!-- chunk -->

## hops or valerian will help reduce stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Bilberries are helpful for diarrhoea, and liquorice for

<!-- chunk -->

## constipation.

<!-- chunk -->

## • To address dysbiosis and enhance immunity, cat's claw,

<!-- chunk -->

## chamomile, cinnamon, golden seal, oregano, pau d'arco,

<!-- chunk -->

## echinacea, myrrh, amalaka, aloe vera, olive leaf, garlic or

<!-- chunk -->

## turmeric are recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Drinking ginger tea before meals and adding mild spices to

<!-- chunk -->

## cooking will stimulate the secretion of digestive enzymes.


<!-- chunk -->

## Food intolerance is implicated in many cases so temporarily

<!-- chunk -->

## omitting tea, coffee, milk products, eggs, and gluten from your

<!-- chunk -->

## diet is advisable.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Probiotic supplements and small amounts of fermented foods

<!-- chunk -->

## will help the gut flora.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: If there is much mucus or blood in stools or severe

<!-- chunk -->

## abdominal pain, consult your doctor.

# Poor Absorption

<!-- chunk -->

## A healthy digestive system breaks down the food we eat so the

<!-- chunk -->

## nutrients can be absorbed into the bloodstream. Poor secretion of

<!-- chunk -->

## digestive enzymes and damage to the villi in the small intestine

<!-- chunk -->

## where nutrients are absorbed can lead to poor digestion and

<!-- chunk -->

## absorption, fermentation and gas, increased acidity and loss of

<!-- chunk -->

## vitality.

<!-- chunk -->

## Stress, illness, tiredness, old age, dysbiosis and chronic

<!-- chunk -->

## diarrhoea can inhibit digestive enzymes and damage to the villi

<!-- chunk -->

## can be caused by inflammation, infection, and gluten intolerance,

<!-- chunk -->

## as is the case in coeliac disease.


<!-- chunk -->

## • To improve digestion and absorption, starting the day with tea

<!-- chunk -->

## made from fresh ginger or hot water with a squeeze of lime

<!-- chunk -->

## juice is recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Chewing or adding seeds such as cumin, dill, cardamom,

<!-- chunk -->

## fennel and coriander to cooking stimulates the flow of

<!-- chunk -->

## digestive enzymes and promotes absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Long pepper is one of the best herbs for improving

<!-- chunk -->

## absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Hot teas of peppermint, chamomile, basil, fennel, rosemary,

<!-- chunk -->

## thyme, ginger, or cinnamon before and after meals will aid

<!-- chunk -->

## digestion.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Relaxants such as chamomile, lavender, lemon balm, hops,

<!-- chunk -->

## vervian, fennel and rose are recommended for stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For dysbiosis cat's claw, cinnamon, echinacea, myrrh, amalaki,

<!-- chunk -->

## aloe vera, olive leaf, garlic or turmeric are helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

## Supplements of probiotics and small amounts of fermented

<!-- chunk -->

## foods are also useful.


<!-- chunk -->

## Avoid indigestible foods such as salads, raw seeds and nuts,

<!-- chunk -->

## coffee, cheese and bread until digestion improves.

# Obesity

<!-- chunk -->

## Obesity can predispose to high blood pressure, raised

<!-- chunk -->

## cholesterol, heart disease, strokes, cancer and diabetes, especially

<!-- chunk -->

## if these run in the family. It is related to a complex interaction

<!-- chunk -->

## between hormones, digestion, metabolism, liver function and

<!-- chunk -->

## toxicity as well as dietary factors and lack of exercise. A

<!-- chunk -->

## marginally underactive thyroid and insulin resistance are often

<!-- chunk -->

## implicated.

<!-- chunk -->

## It is important to lose weight gradually, no more than 2 lbs a

<!-- chunk -->

## week.

<!-- chunk -->

## instead and taking aloe vera juice in ginger tea in the

<!-- chunk -->

## morning before he ate breakfast. I mentioned adding mild

<!-- chunk -->

## spices to his cooking to enhance the digestion and

<!-- chunk -->

## absorption of nutrients.

<!-- chunk -->

## This treatment helped Peter's bowels to return to normal

<!-- chunk -->

## within a month.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Kelp, ashwagandha, guggulu and chromium supplements help

<!-- chunk -->

## to regulate thyroid hormones and raise metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Hawthorn, gotu kola, neem, fennel, amalaki, cinnamon and

<!-- chunk -->

## turmeric taken regularly and spices like garlic, coriander,

<!-- chunk -->

## cumin, ginger, cinnamon, and turmeric in food diet will

<!-- chunk -->

## stimulate digestion and metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Teas of cleavers, cumin, coriander, fennel, dandelion leaf and

<!-- chunk -->

## chickweed have a reputation for aiding weight loss and

<!-- chunk -->

## clearing excess fluid through their diuretic action.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Metabolism often changes after the menopause causing weight

<!-- chunk -->

## gain. Wild yam, vitex, motherwort, fennel and black cohosh

<!-- chunk -->

## help to regulate your hormone levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric stimulates the digestion and

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Gymnema is helpful in insulin resistance and blocks sweet

<!-- chunk -->

## receptors on the tongue, helping to curb sweet cravings.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Coleus is becoming well known for its effect on thyroid

<!-- chunk -->

## metabolism and insulin resistance.


<!-- chunk -->

## Essential fatty acids in oily fish, nuts, seeds, whole grains,

<!-- chunk -->

## evening primrose and flaxseed oil help to raise metabolic rate.

# Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

<!-- chunk -->

## Chronic inflammation of the gut is a serious problem, which can

<!-- chunk -->

## involve ulceration and bleeding and can necessitate surgery. It is

<!-- chunk -->

## indicated by severe abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea or

<!-- chunk -->

## constipation, mucus or blood in the stools, poor appetite, weight

<!-- chunk -->

## loss, fever and lethargy. The most common forms of IBD are the

<!-- chunk -->

## auto-immune problems ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,

<!-- chunk -->

## which can be sparked off by a bacterial or viral infection and can

<!-- chunk -->

## cause poor absorption and nutritional deficiencies, leading to

<!-- chunk -->

## anaemia and osteoporosis.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Slippery elm powder stirred into warm coconut or almond

<!-- chunk -->

## milk is one of the most soothing and healing remedies for an

<!-- chunk -->

## inflamed gut.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Ground flaxseed in water or flax oil, aloe vera juice and

<!-- chunk -->

## marshmallow also soothe the gut lining and help regulate the

<!-- chunk -->

## bowels.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Chamomile tea taken frequently through the day is excellent.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Turmeric and frankincense are wonderful anti-inflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs and can be very effective for reducing pain and


<!-- chunk -->

## • Liquorice, cat's claw, golden seal, myrrh, hops, peppermint,

<!-- chunk -->

## meadowsweet, yarrow and sarsaparilla are also helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Lemon balm, hops, chamomile, skullcap, wild oats,

<!-- chunk -->

## ashwagandha and passion flower reduce tension and anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

## and Siberian ginseng increases resilience to stress.


<!-- chunk -->

## Avoid possible food allergens, particularly gluten and dairy

<!-- chunk -->

## products, as well as sugar, acidic and spicy foods, citrus,

<!-- chunk -->

## tomatoes, hot spices, alcohol and coffee.

<!-- chunk -->

### Meadowsweet reduces acidity in the

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach and has an anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory action on the intestines.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Bromelain from pineapple and papain from papaya can help

<!-- chunk -->

## resolve inflammation and speed healing.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Avoid getting tired and stressed as these can aggravate

<!-- chunk -->

## symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: Seek medical attention if there is blood in the stools, a

<!-- chunk -->

## change in bowel habits lasting longer than 10 days, or any of the

<!-- chunk -->

## above symptoms that do not improve with treatment.

# Nausea and Vomiting

<!-- chunk -->

## Nausea and vomiting can be due to adverse reactions to foods or

<!-- chunk -->

## drugs, nervous tension, migraine, or infections causing irritation

<!-- chunk -->

## and inflammation in the stomach. Other causes include early

<!-- chunk -->

## pregnancy, travel sickness, peptic ulcers, gastritis, shock,

<!-- chunk -->

## intestinal obstruction, pressure on the brain by fluid in altitude

<!-- chunk -->

## sickness or a tumour, and loss of balance caused by inner ear


<!-- chunk -->

## • The best and most delicious remedy is fresh ginger sipped in

<!-- chunk -->

## tea or simply chewed. This is particularly useful in pregnancy

<!-- chunk -->

## when other herbs might be contra-indicated.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Teas of chamomile, lemon balm, cinnamon, cardamom, fennel

<!-- chunk -->

## or peppermint can also settle the stomach.

<!-- chunk -->

## • If nausea is caused by emotional stress, teas or tinctures of

<!-- chunk -->

## lemon balm, chamomile, lavender, hops, dill, California poppy

<!-- chunk -->

## or passion flower can help.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For an infection or food poisoning, take either cinnamon,

<!-- chunk -->

## ginger, cardamom, garlic, turmeric, chamomile, echinacea or

<!-- chunk -->

## pau d'arco every 2 hours.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Feverfew, wood betony or rosemary are best when there are

<!-- chunk -->

## fever, seek medical attention.

# Mouth Ulcers

<!-- chunk -->

## Mouth ulcers can be caused by minor injuries, for example a

<!-- chunk -->

## sharp edge on a tooth or bad dentures, or they can be aphthous

<!-- chunk -->

## ulcers, indicating that immunity is lowered from physical or

<!-- chunk -->

## psychological stress, poor diet, an overly acidic system,

<!-- chunk -->

## deficiency in vitamin B12, folic acid or iron. Aphthous ulcers

<!-- chunk -->

## can also be caused by viruses, including Herpes and hand, foot

<!-- chunk -->

## and mouth disease, food allergies, dysbiosis, adverse drug

<!-- chunk -->

## reactions to medications or mercury fillings, cigarettes, alcohol,

<!-- chunk -->

## ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Soothing mouthwashes of marshmallow, lavender, chamomile

<!-- chunk -->

## helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: Ulcers that do not heal should always be checked by a

<!-- chunk -->

## doctor. They may indicate mouth cancer.

<!-- chunk -->

### Marigold improves digestion and can

<!-- chunk -->

### help fight infection caused by

<!-- chunk -->

### diverticulitis.

# Heartburn and Acidity

<!-- chunk -->

## These indicate a disordered stomach, hyperacidity and gastro-

<!-- chunk -->

## oesophageal reflux, which can be caused by chronic

<!-- chunk -->

## constipation, obesity, disturbances of gut flora or stress, and

<!-- chunk -->

## triggered by alcohol, chocolate, sugar, refined carbohydrates, tea,

<!-- chunk -->

## coffee, cigarettes, rich, fatty, spicy and acidic foods like tomatoes

<!-- chunk -->

## and citrus fruits, getting upset and eating too fast. Heartburn can

<!-- chunk -->

## be aggravated by bending over, sitting hunched up, and lying in

<!-- chunk -->

## bed.


<!-- chunk -->

## • The first choice is chamomile tea sipped frequently.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Meadowsweet is also cooling and soothing.

<!-- chunk -->

<!-- chunk -->

## effective, cooling heat and inflammation and combating

<!-- chunk -->

## dysbiosis.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Peppermint, lemon balm, basil and dill are excellent digestives

<!-- chunk -->

## and reduce tension in the gut.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Bitter herbs like dandelion root and burdock enhance

<!-- chunk -->

## digestion, are gently laxative and reduce heat and burning.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Chamomile, hops, vervain, or lemon balm are good where

<!-- chunk -->

## heartburn is related to stress.

# Diverticulitis

<!-- chunk -->

## Diverticulitis is inflammation and infection that develops in small

<!-- chunk -->

## pockets in weakened areas of the bowel wall. These tend to occur

<!-- chunk -->

## more in people over the age of 50, often as a result of lack of

<!-- chunk -->

## exercise, an over-refined diet and long-term constipation. It can

<!-- chunk -->

## cause quite severe cramping pains, irregular bowels, sometimes

<!-- chunk -->

## bloody stools, flatulence and fever.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Flax or psyllium seeds, soaked in water and allowed to swell

<!-- chunk -->

## into a gel, or slippery elm powder mixed with water can be

<!-- chunk -->

## taken at night to regulate and soothe the bowels.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Marshmallow and aloe vera are also helpful as they are

<!-- chunk -->

## antibacterial and demulcent.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Chamomile is anti-inflammatory and antiseptic, and sipped

<!-- chunk -->

## throughout the day is excellent.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Wild yam and hops are antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

## and can be combined with liquorice and peppermint.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Cat's claw, turmeric, calendula, echinacea and pau d'arco will

<!-- chunk -->

## combat infection and are particularly useful in acute attacks.


<!-- chunk -->

## It is important to eat plenty of high fibre foods, particularly

<!-- chunk -->

## vegetables, (but not irritating foods such as wheat, nuts and

<!-- chunk -->

## seeds, hard raw vegetables and fruits with seeds such as

<!-- chunk -->

## raspberries, tomatoes, blackberries).

<!-- chunk -->

## – Drink plenty of fluid to ensure regular bowel movements.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Avoid caffeinated drinks and take plenty of exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chamomile tea is anti-inflammatory,

<!-- chunk -->

### and sipped throughout the day will

<!-- chunk -->

### soothe bowel inflammation.

# Wind and Bloating

<!-- chunk -->

## Most wind is produced in the intestines by the fermentation of

<!-- chunk -->

## undigested or indigestible foods, particularly carbohydrates. The

<!-- chunk -->

## gut does not produce enzymes to digest certain carbohydrates,

<!-- chunk -->

## especially those from beans and brassicas. Wind can also be

<!-- chunk -->

## indicative of disturbance of the gut flora, food intolerances, for

<!-- chunk -->

## example of gluten and/or dairy, bad eating habits, low digestive

<!-- chunk -->

## enzymes, stress, gastritis and peptic ulcers, gallbladder disease,

<!-- chunk -->

## constipation and IBS.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Carminative herbs are specific for relieving wind and bloating

<!-- chunk -->

## and act by improving digestion and absorption and reducing

<!-- chunk -->

## inflammation and dysbiosis. Fennel, dill, rosemary,

<!-- chunk -->

## peppermint, ginger, cinnamon, lemon balm, cardamom and

<!-- chunk -->

## chamomile are all carminatives.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Seeds like cumin, coriander, cardamom, fennel and dill are

<!-- chunk -->

## excellent when chewed or added to food. Ginger tea is

<!-- chunk -->

## recommended before meals.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Antimicrobial herbs such as pau d'arco, amalaki, garlic,

<!-- chunk -->

## burdock, echinacea, olive leaf, golden seal, turmeric, rosemary,

<!-- chunk -->

## chamomile, thyme, or oregano will help clear toxins and

<!-- chunk -->

## putrefactive bacteria.


<!-- chunk -->

## It is important to eat slowly and when relaxed, not to eat late at

<!-- chunk -->

## night and to take plenty of exercise to enhance digestion.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Eliminating gluten and dairy from the diet can be helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Gentle massage of the abdomen using dilute oils of cinnamon,

<!-- chunk -->

## ginger, cloves, or peppermint can be very effective for relieving

<!-- chunk -->

## wind and discomfort.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thyme will clear toxins and aid

<!-- chunk -->

### digestion after a meal.

<!-- chunk -->

### Peppermint soothes and relaxes the

<!-- chunk -->

### digestive system, and reduces pain

<!-- chunk -->

### and inflammation.

# Gastritis and Peptic Ulcers

<!-- chunk -->

## The stomach may become irritated and inflamed through weak

<!-- chunk -->

## digestion, poor diet, drugs such as ibuprofen and aspirin, or

<!-- chunk -->

## stress which causes over-secretion of hydrochloric acid in the

<!-- chunk -->

## stomach. This can lead to gastritis. As the condition worsens,

<!-- chunk -->

## ulceration of the lining of the stomach or small intestine can

<!-- chunk -->

## develop. Stomach ulcers can also result from infection by

<!-- chunk -->

## helicobacter pylori. Gastritis and peptic ulcers tend to be

<!-- chunk -->

## aggravated by smoking, alcohol, tea, coffee, refined and fatty

<!-- chunk -->

## foods, pickles and acid foods like oranges and tomatoes.

<!-- chunk -->

## The herbal approach aims to resolve the inflammation and heal

<!-- chunk -->

## the damaged lining while relieving tension and stress.


<!-- chunk -->

## • The first choice is chamomile, an excellent antiulcer herb,

<!-- chunk -->

## either taken as a strong tea or as half a tsp tincture in a glass of

<!-- chunk -->

## warm water 4 times a day.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Liquorice, plantain and marshmallow are wonderfully

<!-- chunk -->

## soothing and healing.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Astringent herbs like meadowsweet, elderflower, yarrow and

<!-- chunk -->

## thyme protect the gut lining from irritation and inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Golden seal, myrrh, turmeric, pau d'arco and calendula with

<!-- chunk -->

## their antimicrobial actions help resolve infection.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Slippery elm gruel made from 1–2 tsp of powder in warm

<!-- chunk -->

## water provides quick relief from pain and, by coating the gut

<!-- chunk -->

## lining, protects it from irritation and acidity.

<!-- chunk -->

## • 25mls of aloe vera juice can be taken twice daily to reduce

<!-- chunk -->

## heat and inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

## • To reduce anxiety and tension chamomile, lemon balm, hops,

<!-- chunk -->

## ashwgandha or vervain are recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: Acute abdominal pain, with a known history of ulcers,

<!-- chunk -->

## may indicate perforation and requires immediate medical

<!-- chunk -->

## attention.

# Gall Stones and Gallbladder Problems

<!-- chunk -->

## The gallbladder stores bile supplied by the liver until it is

<!-- chunk -->

## required for breaking down dietary fats. It can become infected

<!-- chunk -->

## or inflamed, causing indigestion, stomach pain and gallbladder

<!-- chunk -->

## pain, especially after eating fatty food. Gallstones form from

<!-- chunk -->

## excessive concentration of bile and calcium salts, or cholesterol,

<!-- chunk -->

## and if one becomes lodged in the bile duct, which takes bile to

<!-- chunk -->

## the small intestine, it causes great pain.

<!-- chunk -->

## For acute biliary colic, anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs are needed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Wild plantain is an excellent soother

<!-- chunk -->

### for gastric ulcer.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Chamomile and wild yam are excellent when taken every

<!-- chunk -->

## hours.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Alternatively, you can use herbs with an affinity for the

<!-- chunk -->

## gallbladder and an ability to dissolve stones and resolve

<!-- chunk -->

## inflammation like dandelion root, peppermint, rosemary,

<!-- chunk -->

## agrimony, Oregon grape root or calendula. These can be taken

<!-- chunk -->

## singly or in combinations.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For intense pain add pasque flower, valerian, or wild yam.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For chronic, intermittent pain provoked by eating especially

<!-- chunk -->

## fatty foods, take the above herbs 3 times a day until all

<!-- chunk -->

## symptoms subside.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Globe artichoke, milk thistle, turmeric, goldenrod and vervain

<!-- chunk -->

## stimulate the flow of bile from the liver and prevent stagnation

<!-- chunk -->

## in the gallbladder; they are helpful especially to prevent

<!-- chunk -->

## reoccurrence of symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: Development of jaundice may indicate obstruction by

<!-- chunk -->

## gallstones and require medical intervention.

# Liver Problems

<!-- chunk -->

## The liver is the largest and perhaps most overworked organ in

<!-- chunk -->

## the body and performs many vital functions, including filtering

<!-- chunk -->

## and breaking down toxins from the blood, making amino acids

<!-- chunk -->

## for protein production, metabolising carbohydrates, protein and

<!-- chunk -->

## fats, storing nutrients absorbed from the gut, producing

<!-- chunk -->

## cholesterol and bile, and manufacturing urea.

<!-- chunk -->

## Liver disease is mainly caused by alcohol, hepatitis,

<!-- chunk -->

## autoimmune diseases, poisons or drugs, and inherited disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

## Less serious but widespread is poor liver function, causing a

<!-- chunk -->

## wide range of metabolic and hormonal problems, poor immune

<!-- chunk -->

## function, skin problems and allergies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Barberry stimulates the liver to

<!-- chunk -->

### secrete bile in the gall bladder to

<!-- chunk -->

### regulate its flow, helpful in treating

<!-- chunk -->

### problems in these organs.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Cholagogues are bitters like barberry, dock, Oregon grape,

<!-- chunk -->

## rosemary, wormwood, burdock, dandelion and guduchi. These

<!-- chunk -->

## stimulate the flow of bile and support the liver in its work.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Barberry, golden seal, turmeric, milk thistle, calendula,

<!-- chunk -->

## liquorice, bringaraj, amalaki, and St John's wort are antivirals,

<!-- chunk -->

## useful for acute liver infections.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Some amazing adaptogenic herbs, including andrographis,

<!-- chunk -->

## rosemary, milk thistle, schizandra, astragalus, globe artichoke,

<!-- chunk -->

## reishi and shiitake mushroom, sarsaparilla and rehmania,

<!-- chunk -->

## protect the liver from damage from drugs and toxic chemicals.

<!-- chunk -->

## • It is important to avoid alcohol, unnecessary drugs, caffeine

<!-- chunk -->

## and junk foods.

# Parasites

<!-- chunk -->

## Many people have some kind of intestinal parasite, for example

<!-- chunk -->

## threadworms, roundworms or tapeworms, or protozoa such as

<!-- chunk -->

## amoeba and giardia. Their presence increases allergic tendencies,

<!-- chunk -->

## bleeding, loss of nutrients, bowel disturbances, aches and pains

<!-- chunk -->

## and even migraine. Parasites spread easily, often via pets. Their

<!-- chunk -->

## eggs may be ingested with vegetables or fruit or by putting

<!-- chunk -->

## contaminated fingers in the mouth. If someone has worms, treat

<!-- chunk -->

## the whole family and pets too.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Anthelmintic herbs eliminate parasites and need to be taken

<!-- chunk -->

## for 1–2 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Garlic is often a favourite remedy: give 1–2 cloves finely

<!-- chunk -->

## chopped in 1 tsp honey or warm milk half an hour before

<!-- chunk -->

## breakfast.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Olive leaf, pau d'arco, bringaraj, andrographis, neem, myrrh,

<!-- chunk -->

## wormwood, barberry, calendula, gotu kola, ginger, wild carrot,

<!-- chunk -->

## holy basil, elecampane or walnut are also effective taken on an

<!-- chunk -->

## empty stomach.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Add laxatives liquorice, yellow dock or dandelion root to

<!-- chunk -->

## speed the expulsion of worms.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Apply oil of lavender, neem, rosemary or thyme in ointment

<!-- chunk -->

## to the anus at night to prevent worms from laying eggs and to

<!-- chunk -->

## relieve itching.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Pumpkin seeds, raw onions, horseradish, long pepper, grated

<!-- chunk -->

## carrot and carrot juice and cayenne pepper are all toxic to

<!-- chunk -->

## worms and can be added to food.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Check the stools daily for worms and repeat treatment after

<!-- chunk -->

## weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Avoid sugary foods and refined carbohydrates and eat live

<!-- chunk -->

## yogurt daily.

<!-- chunk -->

### Elecampane is effective in

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminating parasites when taken on

<!-- chunk -->

### an empty stomach.

# The Nervous System

# Our nervous system is an amazing

# communication network, by which the brain and

# nerve cells send messages via neurotransmitters

# across synapses from one nerve cell to another, or

# to a bunch of muscle fibres. It is a wonderful

# example of the intimate link between mind and

# body; in fact they are one and the same thing.

<!-- chunk -->

## Part of our physical body, the nervous system is made up of

<!-- chunk -->

## nerve cells (neurons) and fibres, which comprise the brain and

<!-- chunk -->

## spinal cord, the peripheral nerves and the autonomic nervous

<!-- chunk -->

## system. Tiny sacs filled with neurotransmitters are stored at the

<!-- chunk -->

## end of each neuron. There are gaps between each neuron called

<!-- chunk -->

## synapses. When a nerve impulse reaches the end of the nerve

<!-- chunk -->

## cell, it triggers the sacs to release the neurotransmitters into the

<!-- chunk -->

## synapses, which then float across the synaptic space until they

<!-- chunk -->

## reach the neighbouring neuron. The neurotransmitters then click

<!-- chunk -->

## into specialized receptor sites on the next neuron, which then

<!-- chunk -->

## fires an electrical impulse down its length. This causes the

<!-- chunk -->

## transmission of nerve impulses through the nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

## Glutamate and GABA are the most abundant neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

## in the central nervous system, and especially in the cerebral

<!-- chunk -->

## cortex, which is where thinking occurs and sensations are

<!-- chunk -->

## interpreted. GABA receptors are very common in our nervous

<!-- chunk -->

## systems; in fact, about 40% of the synapses in the brain have

<!-- chunk -->

## GABA receptors. GABA is made from glutamate and its

<!-- chunk -->

## function is to inhibit the transmission of nerve impulses from one

<!-- chunk -->

## neuron to another, reducing the anxiety and stress that happens

<!-- chunk -->

## when the neurons are overexcited. Serotonin is another

<!-- chunk -->

## neurotransmitter and it enhances GABA. Without sufficient

<!-- chunk -->

## GABA, our neurons fire too often and too easily and this can

<!-- chunk -->

## give rise to a range of nervous problems including anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

## disorders, panic attacks, depression, seizure disorders,

<!-- chunk -->

## addictions, headaches, Parkinson's disease and cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

## impairment.

<!-- chunk -->

## The nervous system is responsible for carrying out physical

<!-- chunk -->

## actions and registering sensations, while at the same time it is the

<!-- chunk -->

## tool for our experience and the expression of all our thoughts

<!-- chunk -->

## and feelings. Physical imbalances and disease can affect the way

<!-- chunk -->

## we think and feel, while every thought and emotion has a direct

<!-- chunk -->

## effect on our physical state. Negative thoughts and feelings sap

<!-- chunk -->

## our energy and vitality and reduce resistance, and are expressed

<!-- chunk -->

## as symptoms such as migraine, peptic ulcers and heart disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## Happiness and positivity directly affect the chemistry of our

<!-- chunk -->

## tissues and secretions in the body and help to create health and

<!-- chunk -->

## vibrancy.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Nervous System

<!-- chunk -->

### The central nervous system includes

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain and spinal cord and is

<!-- chunk -->

### responsible for integrating all

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous activities. The peripheral

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous system comprises the

<!-- chunk -->

### sensory and motor nerves, which pass

<!-- chunk -->

### information to and from the central

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous system.

# Stress Hormones

<!-- chunk -->

## Stress is part of our everyday lives; there is very little escaping it!

<!-- chunk -->

## And yet some of us are better at dealing with it than others. Our

<!-- chunk -->

## strength and resilience can be worn down by long term mental or

<!-- chunk -->

## emotional difficulties, acute trauma, overwork, lack of sleep,

<!-- chunk -->

## chronic or regular illness, poor diet and digestive problems

<!-- chunk -->

## which inhibit absorption of nutrients. When we feel anxious,

<!-- chunk -->

## fearful, upset or angry, a chain of physiological events is sparked

<!-- chunk -->

## off; messages to secrete stress hormones such as adrenaline and

<!-- chunk -->

## cortisol are triggered from the hypothalamus, pituitary and

<!-- chunk -->

## adrenal glands which flood our bodies and have far-reaching

<!-- chunk -->

## effects throughout the body. The “fight or flight” response is set

<!-- chunk -->

## off, our heart rate increases, our breath quickens as more oxygen

<!-- chunk -->

## flows through the lungs, blood flow is increased to our muscles

<!-- chunk -->

## which are tensed up ready for action to protect our body in an

<!-- chunk -->

## emergency. When the stress response fires continually for days,

<!-- chunk -->

## months, even years, it can put a strain on our body and put our

<!-- chunk -->

## health at risk. For example, under stress, our heart pumps faster,

<!-- chunk -->

## our blood vessels constrict to divert more oxygen to our muscles,

<!-- chunk -->

## which raises our blood pressure. Frequent or chronic stress will

<!-- chunk -->

## make our heart work too hard for too long, our blood pressure

<!-- chunk -->

## can remain high and this increases the risk of having a stroke or

<!-- chunk -->

## heart attack.

# The Gut-Brain Connection

<!-- chunk -->

## It is well known that there is a strong, two-way connection

<!-- chunk -->

## between the gastro-intestinal tract and the central nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

## When adrenaline is secreted, our digestive enzymes do not flow

<!-- chunk -->

## in the same way; we don't digest and absorb the food we eat

<!-- chunk -->

## properly and this allows a residue of undigested or partially

<!-- chunk -->

## digested food to sit around in the gut and ferment, causing a

<!-- chunk -->

## whole range of digestive disturbances and upsetting the

<!-- chunk -->

## metabolism of the body.

<!-- chunk -->

## Just as we have neurons in our brain, we also have them in our

<!-- chunk -->

## gut where they are known as the enteric nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

## Neurons in the gut include those that produce neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

## such as serotonin, the “happy hormone”; apparently about 90%

<!-- chunk -->

## of serotonin is found in our gut in the entero-chromaffin cells,

<!-- chunk -->

## where it is used to regulate intestinal movements. The remainder

<!-- chunk -->

## is synthesised in serotonergic neurons of the brain, where it has

<!-- chunk -->

## various functions including the regulation of mood, feelings of

<!-- chunk -->

## wellbeing and happiness, appetite and sleep. Serotonin also has

<!-- chunk -->

## some cognitive functions, including memory and learning.

<!-- chunk -->

### Happiness and positivity directly

<!-- chunk -->

### affect our body chemistry and help to

<!-- chunk -->

### create health and vibrancy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Recent years have witnessed the rise of the bacterial population

<!-- chunk -->

## of the gut (gut microbiota) as a major topic of research. It is

<!-- chunk -->

## becoming clear that the central nervous system can affect the

<!-- chunk -->

## microbiota and the microbiota has a significant influence on the

<!-- chunk -->

## brain and our behaviour. Within the gut, some organisms are

<!-- chunk -->

## commensal, meaning they have a non-harmful coexistence with

<!-- chunk -->

## us, other are mutualistic, with mutual benefit, and some can be

<!-- chunk -->

## harmful or pathogenic.

<!-- chunk -->

## The commensal and mutualistic microbiota have many roles;

<!-- chunk -->

## they maintain normal mucosal immune function, the integrity of

<!-- chunk -->

## the gut lining and the absorption of nutrients. They synthesise

<!-- chunk -->

## vitamins and short chain fatty acids, and break down dietary

<!-- chunk -->

## toxins, making them less harmful. They inhibit the overgrowth

<!-- chunk -->

## of pathogenic micro-organisms and stimulate local immunity,

<!-- chunk -->

## inhibiting infections like Salmonella, parasites such as pinworms,

<!-- chunk -->

## and decreasing the risk of food poisoning. They also enhance

<!-- chunk -->

## general immunity; in fact, four-fifths of the body's immune

<!-- chunk -->

## system is found in the gut lining. Our gut flora can release

<!-- chunk -->

## molecules that directly influence the chemistry of the brain

<!-- chunk -->

## including the regulation of the production of neurotransmitters,

<!-- chunk -->

## thereby affecting our mood and behaviour. GABA is one of the

<!-- chunk -->

## neurotransmitters in the brain influenced by the gut flora that has

<!-- chunk -->

## a calming or quieting influence.

<!-- chunk -->

## Variations and changes in the composition of the gut

<!-- chunk -->

## microbiota can fundamentally influence our normal physiology

<!-- chunk -->

## and contribute to diseases ranging from inflammation to obesity,

<!-- chunk -->

## headaches, panic attacks and depression. The use of antibiotics,

<!-- chunk -->

## synthetic hormones and steroids, as well as poor digestion and

<!-- chunk -->

## stress can all contribute to the proliferation of pathogenic yeasts

<!-- chunk -->

## and bacteria in the gut (dysbiosis). These create toxins, destroy

<!-- chunk -->

## vitamins, inactivate digestive enzymes and lead to the formation

<!-- chunk -->

## of chemicals which are toxic. They can provoke inflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

## diseases including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and arthritis

<!-- chunk -->

## by causing autoimmune reactions and leaky gut syndrome, as

<!-- chunk -->

## well as a host of neurological and mood disturbances including

<!-- chunk -->

## anxiety, depression and lethargy.

# Herbal Help

<!-- chunk -->

## The emerging concept of a microbiota-gut-brain axis suggests

<!-- chunk -->

## that giving our attention to the balance of the gut microbiota may

<!-- chunk -->

## be a great strategy for treating disorders of the nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

## Stress-related physical problems can also benefit from a

<!-- chunk -->

## psychological approach, such as counselling or psychotherapy,

<!-- chunk -->

## while stress and psychological problems can be helped by

<!-- chunk -->

## working through the body with, for example, massage, yoga,

<!-- chunk -->

## breathing exercises, relaxation and exercise. Research on

<!-- chunk -->

## meditation shows that it can enhance our resilience to stress,

<!-- chunk -->

## reduce cortisol levels, lower blood pressure and help with

<!-- chunk -->

## negative emotions such as fear, aggression, and anger.

<!-- chunk -->

### A massage with essential oils can

<!-- chunk -->

### help relax the body and strengthen

<!-- chunk -->

### resistance to stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## Even diseases such as heart disease, hypertension and stroke

<!-- chunk -->

## are found to significantly improve with the practice of

<!-- chunk -->

## meditation.

<!-- chunk -->

## There are many greatly beneficial herbs that have a direct effect

<!-- chunk -->

## on the nervous system, and which combined with good digestion

<!-- chunk -->

## and healthy eating, as well as antimicrobial herbs to curb

<!-- chunk -->

## dysbiosis, can radically transform our mental and emotional

<!-- chunk -->

## state. It is interesting that many herbs that are classified as

<!-- chunk -->

## nervines, helping to balance the nervous system, are also

<!-- chunk -->

## digestives and antimicrobials. There are herbs that can lift the

<!-- chunk -->

## spirits, calm anxiety, relax muscles, increase memory and

<!-- chunk -->

## concentration and aid sleep; there are some, known as

<!-- chunk -->

## adaptogens, that have a remarkable ability to improve energy and

<!-- chunk -->

## vitality and enhance our resilience to stress, and there are even

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs for feeling broken hearted and for low self esteem!

<!-- chunk -->

## Cat's claw, garlic, burdock, golden seal, olive leaf, myrrh,

<!-- chunk -->

## reishi mushroom and andrographis are some of the most

<!-- chunk -->

## effective to combat disturbances of the gut flora. Oregon grape,

<!-- chunk -->

## elecampane, dill, bearberry, calendula, echinacea, fennel, amalaki

<!-- chunk -->

## and kelp act similarly. Aloe vera juice is soothing, immune

<!-- chunk -->

## enhancing and combats dysbiosis. Antimicrobial spices including

<!-- chunk -->

## turmeric, cinnamon, ginger and long pepper enhance the

<!-- chunk -->

## secretion of digestive enzymes, inhibit the proliferation of

<!-- chunk -->

## pathogenic microorganisms and can be added daily to diet.

<!-- chunk -->

## Several herbs increase GABA including valerian, lemon balm,

<!-- chunk -->

## skullcap and baikal skullcap, ashwagandha, lavender and

<!-- chunk -->

## chamomile. Caffeine inhibits GABA release, while theanine, an

<!-- chunk -->

## amino acid, is found in large amounts in increased GABA levels,

<!-- chunk -->

## which is why a cup of tea can be calming despite the fact it

<!-- chunk -->

## contains caffeine, while coffee can cause a host of nervous

<!-- chunk -->

## problems!

<!-- chunk -->

## Probiotics in the form of live yoghurt as well as sprouted and

<!-- chunk -->

## fermented foods such as kefir, miso, cider vinegar and sauerkraut

<!-- chunk -->

## or supplements of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria

<!-- chunk -->

## can help restore the normal microbiota. The probiotic

<!-- chunk -->

## Lactobacillus rhamnosus has a marked effect on GABA.

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamins B, C and E, calcium, magnesium, zinc and essential

<!-- chunk -->

## fatty acids are all essential to the normal functioning of the

<!-- chunk -->

## nervous system and may need to be increased in times of stress

<!-- chunk -->

## when the body's uptake of these can increase dramatically. Foods

<!-- chunk -->

## devoid of nutrients such as refined carbohydrates, sugar and

<!-- chunk -->

## junk foods can result in deficiencies of vital nutrients and are

<!-- chunk -->

## best avoided completely to optimise your resilience.

<!-- chunk -->

### Passion flower is an effective herb for

<!-- chunk -->

### calming anxiety, relaxing tense

<!-- chunk -->

### muscles and promoting sleep.

# Tension and Anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

## Tension or anxiety are normal responses to a difficult situation,

<!-- chunk -->

## which should settle once the problem is resolved, but can

<!-- chunk -->

## become habitual when you are run down by long term stress,

<!-- chunk -->

## nutritional deficiencies, excess alcohol, caffeine, and lack of

<!-- chunk -->

## exercise.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Calming herbs for acute anxiety include passion flower,

<!-- chunk -->

## California poppy, wild lettuce, skullcap and wild oats, taken

<!-- chunk -->

## every hour or two if necessary.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For chronic problems, adaptogens like ginseng, ashwagandha,

<!-- chunk -->

## bacopa, gotu kola, he shou wu, schizandra, shatavari,

<!-- chunk -->

## bhringaraj, liquorice and holy basil will strengthen the nerves

<!-- chunk -->

## and increase resilience to stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Other good anxiolytic herbs include chamomile, lemon balm,

<!-- chunk -->

## vervain, St John's wort, rose, motherwort, lime flower, hops,

<!-- chunk -->

## lavender, rosemary, and paeony.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Hot herbal baths and/or massage using relaxing essentials oils

<!-- chunk -->

## of holy basil, nutmeg, lavender, rosemary, rose or chamomile

<!-- chunk -->

## in a base of sesame oil will ease muscle tension and soothe

<!-- chunk -->

## anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### St John's wort is a good anxiolytic

<!-- chunk -->

### herb; taken 3-6 times daily it can lift

<!-- chunk -->

### the spirits and replenish the body

<!-- chunk -->

### with nutrients necessary for the

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous system.


<!-- chunk -->

## Regular aerobic exercise is recommended to stimulate the

<!-- chunk -->

## secretion of endorphins and increase resilience to stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Meditation cultivates a calmness that eases anxiety and gives a

<!-- chunk -->

## sense of control.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Pranayama – breathing exercises – are also calming.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Inhalations of frankincense oil are helpful as they deepen

<!-- chunk -->

## breathing.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Avoid caffeine, sugar, alcohol and any unnecessary drugs as

<!-- chunk -->

## they can all reduce resistance to stress.

# Depression

<!-- chunk -->

## Mood elevating herbs are wild oats, lemon balm, rosemary,

<!-- chunk -->

## vervain, skullcap, St John's wort and Siberian ginseng. Taken

<!-- chunk -->

## times daily, these can help to lift the spirits and replace essential

<!-- chunk -->

## nutrients that are necessary for your nervous system. Damiana,

<!-- chunk -->

## St John's wort, wild oats, basil, and wood betony taken 3-6 times

<!-- chunk -->

## daily can help acute depression.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Adding essential oils of lavender, rosemary, chamomile,

<!-- chunk -->

## bergamot, or rose to baths and/or massage oils can also help.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Rosemary, rhodiola, gotu kola, Siberian ginseng, liquorice,

<!-- chunk -->

## and wild oats are great adaptogens, excellent for debility and

<!-- chunk -->

## depression following illness or long term stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Rose, shatavari, vitex, evening primrose, black cohosh, and St

<!-- chunk -->

## John's wort are particularly useful for depression related to

<!-- chunk -->

## hormone imbalances, either premenstrually or during

<!-- chunk -->

## menopause.


<!-- chunk -->

## It is important to take regular exercise, which enhances the

<!-- chunk -->

## secretion of natural opiates (endorphins) and creates a feeling of

<!-- chunk -->

## well being.

# Insomnia

<!-- chunk -->

## For problems getting off to sleep, useful herbs include hops,

<!-- chunk -->

## passion flower, chamomile, lemon balm, lime flower, wild oats,

<!-- chunk -->

## wild lettuce, ashwagandha, or valerian as teas, or 1-3 tsp of

<!-- chunk -->

## tincture.


<!-- chunk -->

## • 1 tsb of ashwagandha or nutmeg is good taken in hot milk.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For problems getting to sleep, try chamomile, gotu kola,

<!-- chunk -->

## California poppy, hops or wild lettuce.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For problems staying asleep, ashwagandha, bacopa, wild oats,

<!-- chunk -->

## skullcap, nutmeg, passion flower, St John's wort or valerian.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Nourishing nervines such as wild oats, skullcap, vervain,

<!-- chunk -->

## rosemary, holy basil, liquorice, Siberian ginseng and

<!-- chunk -->

## ashwagandha taken in the daytime can help when insomnia is

<!-- chunk -->

## related to being tired and rundown.


<!-- chunk -->

## Warm sesame oil massage followed by a bath before bed can

<!-- chunk -->

## work wonders.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Add strong infusions/oils of lavender, chamomile, neroli, or

<!-- chunk -->

## rose to the bath for added effect.

<!-- chunk -->

## – 45 minutes of quiet time before retiring is important.

<!-- chunk -->

## – It is best to avoid all caffeine and have regular meals, exercise

<!-- chunk -->

## and sleep times, with no sleeping during the day, to settle the

<!-- chunk -->

## nervous system.

# Headache and Migraine

<!-- chunk -->

## These may be warning signs of stress or fatigue, or related to eye

<!-- chunk -->

## strain, sinusitis, hormonal imbalances, allergy, liver and digestive

<!-- chunk -->

## problems, disturbance of the gut flora, pollution, poor diet, high

<!-- chunk -->

## blood pressure, low blood sugar, alcohol, and pain such as back

# ADD and ADHD

<!-- chunk -->

## Attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity have been linked to

<!-- chunk -->

## toxic metals, gut flora issues, food sensitivities, nutritional

<!-- chunk -->

## deficiencies (B vitamins, magnesium EFAs, iron, or zinc), and

<!-- chunk -->

## excess sugar. Impaired glucose metabolism may be a major

<!-- chunk -->

## contributory factor, caused by excessive intake of simple

<!-- chunk -->

## carbohydrates and nutrient-poor junk foods. Lack of fresh air

<!-- chunk -->

## and exercise, hypoglycaemia, over exposure to smoky

<!-- chunk -->

## atmospheres and noise, too much time on computers or in front

# Neuralgia and Sciatica

<!-- chunk -->

## Inflammation or injury of a nerve can cause excruciating pain as

<!-- chunk -->

## is experienced by anyone who has had sciatica, lumbago or

<!-- chunk -->

## trigeminal neuralgia. Nerves can be traumatised by injury, burns,

<!-- chunk -->

## cuts, slipped discs, vertebrae out of alignment, a tumour or

<!-- chunk -->

## muscle spasm. Heavy metals such as lead or mercury can

<!-- chunk -->

## damage nerves, as can alcoholism and diabetes. To ensure

<!-- chunk -->

## recovery, the cause of the pain needs to be identified and treated.

<!-- chunk -->

## Where there is pressure on a nerve from a spinal problem,

<!-- chunk -->

## consult a chiropractor or an osteopath.


<!-- chunk -->

## • To relieve nerve pain you can use California poppy, hops, St

<!-- chunk -->

## John's wort, wood betony, pasque flower, feverfew,

<!-- chunk -->

## meadowsweet or black cohosh, in acute doses if necessary.

<!-- chunk -->

## tissue.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Where circulation to the area is poor, hawthorn, gotu kola,

<!-- chunk -->

## cinnamon and ginger will bring blood and nutrition to the

<!-- chunk -->

## area.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Externally, St John's wort oil is specific for damaged nerves

<!-- chunk -->

## and neuralgia and is wonderfully pain-relieving. It can be

<!-- chunk -->

## gently massaged into the area.

<!-- chunk -->

## • A few drops of cayenne tincture added to the oil will increase

<!-- chunk -->

## its pain-relieving properties. You can start with 1-2 drops and

<!-- chunk -->

## gradually build up the ratio of cayenne, as it may have a

<!-- chunk -->

## tendency to cause a burning sensation in some people with

<!-- chunk -->

## hypersensitive nerves.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Other pain-relieving essential oils, which can be used for

<!-- chunk -->

## massage in a base of sesame oil, include ginger, rosemary,

<!-- chunk -->

## lavender, peppermint, chamomile and coriander.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lemon balm is an antiviral and will

<!-- chunk -->

### help to combat the Herpes infection

<!-- chunk -->

### in shingles.

# Shingles

<!-- chunk -->

## Shingles is a painful inflammatory nerve problem, caused by a

<!-- chunk -->

## reactivation of the latent varicella-zoster virus which causes

<!-- chunk -->

## chickenpox. It causes a rash along a nerve pathway of the

<!-- chunk -->

## abdomen or the face accompanied by tingling and pain which is

<!-- chunk -->

## often severe, followed by the appearance of fluid-filled blisters

<!-- chunk -->

## (vesicles) on the skin. Tiredness, stress, poor nutrition and

<!-- chunk -->

## depleted immunity increase the risks of developing shingles after

<!-- chunk -->

## contact with chickenpox.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Useful antiviral herbs include St John's wort, lemon balm,

<!-- chunk -->

## barberry, lavender, pau d'arco, andrographis, neem, echinacea

<!-- chunk -->

## and olive leaf, which help combat the Herpes infection.

<!-- chunk -->

## • To reduce nerve pain and inflammation, use California poppy,

<!-- chunk -->

## chamomile, St John's wort, passion flower, skullcap, pasque

<!-- chunk -->

## flower, meadowsweet or gotu cola, in acute doses if necessary.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Adaptogenic herbs liquorice, ashwagandha, shatavari, aloe

<!-- chunk -->

## vera, wild oats, shiitake and reishi mushrooms strengthen

<!-- chunk -->

## immunity, help speed recovery and prevent post-herpetic

<!-- chunk -->

## neuralgia.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Externally, St John's wort oil with a few drops of essential

<!-- chunk -->

## lavender (5 drops per 5mls) can be applied gently to the rash.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Aloe vera gel can also be soothing.


<!-- chunk -->

## When infection occurs, avoid foods that inhibit immunity and

<!-- chunk -->

## stimulate inflammation such as saturated fats, refined foods and

<!-- chunk -->

## sugar, caffeine and alcohol.

<!-- chunk -->

## – A diet low in the amino acid arginine, which can activate the

<!-- chunk -->

## virus and high in lysine which can suppress it, is recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Supplements of beta-carotene, zinc, vitamin C and vitamin E

<!-- chunk -->

## enhance immunity and speed healing of the skin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lavender, as well as being antiviral

<!-- chunk -->

### and antibacterial, helps to reduce pain

<!-- chunk -->

### and has a soothing effect on the

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous system.

# The Immune System

# The immune system consists of the lymphatic

# system, white blood cells, and specialised cells

# and chemicals, including antibodies. When

# infection threatens to overcome our homeostatic

# mechanisms and invade the body, the immune

# system rallies its defences to deal with it.

<!-- chunk -->

## The lymphatic system produces more lymphocytes and

<!-- chunk -->

## macrophages which work with cytokine chemicals to destroy the

<!-- chunk -->

## invaders. The thymus gland aids the production of, and stores,

<!-- chunk -->

## white blood cells known as T-cells, which attack cells infected by

<!-- chunk -->

## bacteria, fungi and viruses. The spleen, liver, tonsils, adenoids

<!-- chunk -->

## and wall of the intestine also contain lymphatic tissue. The

<!-- chunk -->

## lymphatic tissue lining the gut is responsible for maintaining

<!-- chunk -->

## lymphocytes capable of responding to all the antigens that enter

<!-- chunk -->

## the body through food entering the digestive tract.

<!-- chunk -->

## Should these protective mechanisms fail, specific immune

<!-- chunk -->

## responses occur. Molecules on the surface of infecting organisms

<!-- chunk -->

## (antigens) stimulate lymphocytes and produce antibodies to

<!-- chunk -->

## destroy the antigens. These have a memory so that antigens are

<!-- chunk -->

## recognised should infection reoccur, ensuring the body is able to

<!-- chunk -->

## respond effectively with the organisms before an infection

<!-- chunk -->

## develops.

<!-- chunk -->

## A healthy lifestyle is the key to an efficient immune system. It

<!-- chunk -->

## is essential to have plenty of nutritious, natural, preferably

<!-- chunk -->

## organic food to eat, a balance of work and play, exercise and

<!-- chunk -->

## relaxation, sufficient sleep, a minimum of pollution in our

<!-- chunk -->

## environment, a positive attitude to dealing with stress and the

<!-- chunk -->

## cultivation of practices to engender peace of mind. A positive

<!-- chunk -->

## outlook, fun, laughter, serenity, being in beautiful, peaceful

<!-- chunk -->

## surroundings, and clean air can all boost immunity. Our natural

<!-- chunk -->

## immunity is clearly lowered by physical or emotional stress,

<!-- chunk -->

## burning the candle at both ends, poor diet, toxins, smoking

<!-- chunk -->

## cigarettes, and drinking excess alcohol.

<!-- chunk -->

## The importance of good digestion is often overlooked when

<!-- chunk -->

## considering immunity. If our “digestive fire” is good, the food

<!-- chunk -->

## eaten will be digested and assimilated well and the residue of

<!-- chunk -->

## wastes remaining to be eliminated from the body will be

<!-- chunk -->

## minimal. If, however, the digestive fire is low, much of what is

<!-- chunk -->

## eaten will remain in the gut as partially digested or undigested

<!-- chunk -->

## food, which produces toxins that can undermine the local

<!-- chunk -->

## immune mechanisms in the gut. These toxins can permeate the

<!-- chunk -->

## body and in turn lower resistance to a range of immune

<!-- chunk -->

## problems. To maintain good digestion avoid eating heavy, rich

<!-- chunk -->

## foods such as fatty meats, cream and cheese, bread, pastries and

<!-- chunk -->

## sugar, drinking alcohol and too much cold water. Have plenty of

<!-- chunk -->

## steamed vegetables, grains and pulses, and drink plenty of

<!-- chunk -->

## warming herbal teas to enhance digestion. Spices such as ginger,

<!-- chunk -->

## cinnamon, cardamom, coriander, clove, black pepper and

<!-- chunk -->

## asafoetida are some of the best remedies for the digestion and for

<!-- chunk -->

## raising our immunity.

<!-- chunk -->

### A network of vessels produces and

<!-- chunk -->

### carries lymphocytes around the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### These white blood cells contain

<!-- chunk -->

### antibodies that give protection

<!-- chunk -->

### against bacteria and viruses.

<!-- chunk -->

## The world of herbs is replete with immune stimulants which

<!-- chunk -->

## perform their work in a variety of ways. Some increase the

<!-- chunk -->

## production and activity of macrophages, cells that the immune

<!-- chunk -->

## system sends to digest foreign invaders. Some herbs also

<!-- chunk -->

## stimulate the production of defence substances, such as

<!-- chunk -->

## interferon, which protect non-infected cells from viruses. Herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## can also enhance the production and function of T-cells, vital

<!-- chunk -->

## immune cells that kill viruses, fungi and certain bacteria. Immune

<!-- chunk -->

## enhancing herbs include ginseng, guduchi, cat's claw,

<!-- chunk -->

## aswagandha, liquorice, astragalus, echinacea, olive leaf, garlic,

<!-- chunk -->

## reishi and shiitake mushrooms and turmeric.

# Fevers

<!-- chunk -->

## A fever is the body's vital reaction to an infection and a symptom

<!-- chunk -->

## that the body is fighting against the invaders, whether they are

<!-- chunk -->

## bacterial, viral or fungal. Raising the internal thermostat enables

<!-- chunk -->

## the body to fight off the infection quickly as this has a natural

<!-- chunk -->

## antibiotic and antiviral effect.


<!-- chunk -->

## • At the first sign of a fever, fast to boost the immune system

<!-- chunk -->

## and drink plenty of fluids to assist elimination of toxins. If the

<!-- chunk -->

## fever is causing discomfort take hot teas of diaphoretics like

<!-- chunk -->

## chamomile, lime flowers or meadowsweet every couple of

<!-- chunk -->

## hours to bring heat to the surface of the body. This will cause

<!-- chunk -->

## sweating and hasten the elimination of heat and toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Other fever-reducing herbs include willow bark, vervain,

<!-- chunk -->

## cleavers, rose, holy basil, boneset, elderflower, yarrow,

<!-- chunk -->

## peppermint, lavender, and lemon balm, which can be taken

<!-- chunk -->

## singly or in combinations.

<!-- chunk -->

## • These infusions, when tepid, can be used to sponge the body.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Take half a tsp of echinacea, andrographis, pau d'arco, neem,

<!-- chunk -->

## myrrh, or wormwood tincture every 2 hours to help fight off


<!-- chunk -->

## NB: Do not give herbs containing salicylates to children under

<!-- chunk -->

## 12.

# Infections

<!-- chunk -->

## There are many immune-enhancing herbs, which strengthen and

<!-- chunk -->

## assist our innate defence mechanisms and can help to prevent

<!-- chunk -->

## infection. Many have effective antiviral and antibacterial effects.

<!-- chunk -->

## A healthy diet, good digestion, a healthy gut flora (much of our

<!-- chunk -->

## immunity lies in the gut), sufficient exercise, rest and relaxation

<!-- chunk -->

## will support our immunity.


<!-- chunk -->

## • For prevention, add immune enhancing spices such as garlic,

<!-- chunk -->

## ginger, nutmeg, coriander, cumin, turmeric, long pepper or

<!-- chunk -->

## cinnamon daily to food.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Drinking tea made from freshly grated ginger before breakfast

<!-- chunk -->

## is highly recommended. Adaptogenic herbs including shiitake

<!-- chunk -->

## and reishi mushrooms, cat's claw, astragalus, guduchi,

<!-- chunk -->

## bhringaraj, ashwagandha, shatavari and ginseng are great

<!-- chunk -->

## preventatives.

<!-- chunk -->

## • At first signs of infection, fast to boost immunity, drink plenty

<!-- chunk -->

## of fluids to aid the elimination of toxins, and take half a

<!-- chunk -->

## teaspoon of echinacea, wild indigo, golden seal, barberry,

<!-- chunk -->

## myrrh, andrographis, pau d'arco or boneset tincture every

<!-- chunk -->

## hours.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Add a little liquorice, which has antiviral and immune

<!-- chunk -->

## enhancing properties.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Raw garlic is also excellent.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Teas of aromatic herbs with effective antimicrobial properties,

<!-- chunk -->

## such as dill, calendula, oregano, cinnamon, celery seed, lemon

<!-- chunk -->

## balm, chamomile, lavender, sage, thyme, elecampane,

<!-- chunk -->

## rosemary or rose can be drunk throughout the day.

# MRSA

<!-- chunk -->

## Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA is a

<!-- chunk -->

## “superbug” which is resistant to antibiotics, including methicillin.

<!-- chunk -->

## The implicated bacteria is Staphylococcus aureus, which is found

<!-- chunk -->

## on the skin in about 1 in 3 people and generally causes no

<!-- chunk -->

## problems unless immunity is lowered and the bacteria get

<!-- chunk -->

## through a break in the skin. If this happens it can cause boils and

<!-- chunk -->

## abscesses or more serious infections in the bloodstream, bones or

<!-- chunk -->

## joints. Outbreaks in hospitals are common.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Despite the fact that MRSA is resistant to drugs it is not

<!-- chunk -->

## resistant to antimicrobial herbs including pau d'arco, garlic,

<!-- chunk -->

## milk thistle, golden seal, turmeric, and myrrh. These can be

<!-- chunk -->

## taken internally 3–6 times daily and used in washes for the

<!-- chunk -->

## skin.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Green tea, tea tree oil, manuka honey, grapefruit seed extract

<!-- chunk -->

## and sea salt are all excellent when used externally.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Immuno-stimulating herbs like ginseng, astragalus, guduchi,

<!-- chunk -->

## aswagandha, liquorice and shatavari enhance resistance and

<!-- chunk -->

## help prevent infection.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Beta glucans from oats and medicinal mushrooms including

<!-- chunk -->

## shiitake and reishi can enhance immunity by activating white

<!-- chunk -->

## blood cells.

# Allergies

<!-- chunk -->

## When our immune system reacts against substances that are not

<!-- chunk -->

## infectious or harmful, we have an allergy. Allergic symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

## include sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, itchy nose and

<!-- chunk -->

## eyes, digestive disturbances, eczema and asthma. Stress, poor

<!-- chunk -->

## diet, nutritional deficiencies, environmental pollution, drugs,

<!-- chunk -->

## injury, surgery, digestive problems, disturbance of the gut flora

<!-- chunk -->

## and genetic tendencies can all predispose to allergies. Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

## involves improving nutrition, temporarily avoiding the allergen,

<!-- chunk -->

## and balancing the digestive and immune systems.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Adaptogenic herbs ashwagandha, guduchi, astragalus,

<!-- chunk -->

## Chinese angelica, amalaki, liquorice, shiitake and reishi

<!-- chunk -->

## mushroom, shatavari, aloe vera and ginseng will increase

<!-- chunk -->

## immunity and help prevent allergic reactions.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Cat's claw, walnut, burdock, turmeric, ginger, myrrh,

<!-- chunk -->

## cinnamon and andrographis will combat unfriendly gut

<!-- chunk -->

## bacteria and fungi which predisposes to leaky gut syndrome

<!-- chunk -->

## and allergies.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Chamomile, nettles, baikal skullcap, lemon balm and yarrow

<!-- chunk -->

## soothe the allergic response and inhibit histamine, which is

<!-- chunk -->

## responsible for inflammatory symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Evening primrose seed oil provides GLA, a deficiency of

<!-- chunk -->

## which is implicated in several allergic conditions.


<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin C (500mg twice daily) and magnesium (500mg daily),

<!-- chunk -->

## act as natural anti-histamines.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Minimise allergenic foods especially dairy produce, citrus,

<!-- chunk -->

## chocolate, peanuts, gluten, shellfish, the nightshade family

<!-- chunk -->

## (potatoes, tomatoes, peppers and aubergines) food colourings

<!-- chunk -->

## and preservatives. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, sugar and

<!-- chunk -->

## junk foods, which increase susceptibility to allergies.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Quercetin, a bioflavonoid found in citrus fruits, helps to inhibit

<!-- chunk -->

## the secretion of histamine, leukotrienes and prostaglandins and

<!-- chunk -->

## has an antihistamine action. Other flavonoid containing foods

<!-- chunk -->

## and herbs could also prove helpful as they have anti-

<!-- chunk -->

## inflammatory, antioxidant, immuno-regulating properties and

<!-- chunk -->

## capillary-strengthening magnesium with vitamins B and C and

<!-- chunk -->

## can be taken at the onset of symptoms.

# Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)

<!-- chunk -->

## Also known as post-viral fatigue syndrome or ME (myalgic

<!-- chunk -->

## encephalomyelitis), CFS is common between the ages 25 and 45,

<!-- chunk -->

## and is characterised by prolonged fatigue and other symptoms,

<!-- chunk -->

## including poor memory and concentration, swollen glands,

<!-- chunk -->

## muscle and/or joint pain, headaches, poor sleep and malaise after

<!-- chunk -->

## exertion. It tends to follow an acute viral infection and lowered

<!-- chunk -->

## immunity related to over work, exhaustion, toxicity, drugs and

<!-- chunk -->

## alcohol, poor diet, disturbance of the gut flora, a major life event

<!-- chunk -->

## like bereavement or job loss or depression.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Adaptogenic herbs including ashwagandha, shatavari,

<!-- chunk -->

## astragalus, liquorice, guduchi, Chinese angelica, shiitake and

<!-- chunk -->

## reishi mushrooms, rhodiola and Siberian ginseng are excellent

<!-- chunk -->

## for increasing resistance to stress and strengthening immunity.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Ginkgo and gotu kola enhance memory and concentration and

<!-- chunk -->

## relieve depression.

<!-- chunk -->

## • St John's wort, lemon balm and vervain are good

<!-- chunk -->

## antidepressants.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Black cohosh, turmeric, boswellia, devil's claw, skullcap and

<!-- chunk -->

## ginger, as well as supplements of bromelain, help alleviate

<!-- chunk -->

## joint and muscle pain.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Ginger tea made from freshly grated ginger taken before

<!-- chunk -->

## breakfast helps to improve digestion and absorption of

<!-- chunk -->

## nutrients.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Andrographis, cat's claw, burdock, neem, myrrh and olive leaf

<!-- chunk -->

## can be helpful to combat disturbance of the gut flora.


<!-- chunk -->

## It is important to eliminate inflammatory foods including refined

# The Respiratory System

# The respiratory system is responsible for

# supplying the blood with oxygen, which then

# carries it to the cells of the body which require

# oxygen to carry out their vital functions. As they

# use oxygen they give off carbon dioxide as a

# waste product, which is then carried to the lungs

# where it is exhaled.

<!-- chunk -->

## Oxygen is breathed in through the mouth and the nose and then

<!-- chunk -->

## passes through the larynx and trachea into the chest cavity. The

<!-- chunk -->

## trachea then divides into 2 bronchi, which branch into numerous

<!-- chunk -->

## bronchial tubes leading to the lungs where they divide into many

<!-- chunk -->

## smaller tubes which connect to tiny air sacs called alveoli. Our

<!-- chunk -->

## lungs contain about 600 million alveoli, and these allow oxygen

<!-- chunk -->

## to diffuse through them into the surrounding capillaries, and for

<!-- chunk -->

## carbon dioxide from the veins to enter the respiratory system to

<!-- chunk -->

## be exhaled by the same pathway. Breathing is brought about by

<!-- chunk -->

## movements of the diaphragm, a sheet of muscle lying at the base

<!-- chunk -->

## of the chest. When it contracts, oxygen is pulled into the lungs

<!-- chunk -->

## and when it relaxes, carbon dioxide is pumped out.

<!-- chunk -->

## We may be able to go days without food and water but only a

<!-- chunk -->

## few minutes without air. To ensure sufficient intake of oxygen

<!-- chunk -->

## we need to have a healthy respiratory system, plenty of fresh air

<!-- chunk -->

## and exercise and to breathe properly. Congestion of the airways

<!-- chunk -->

## from excess catarrh reduces the amount of oxygen we take in.

<!-- chunk -->

## The quality of the air is also of vital importance. Pollution,

<!-- chunk -->

## cigarette smoke, carbon monoxide and lead from car fumes are

<!-- chunk -->

## all things that can become pollution in the lungs, which is then

<!-- chunk -->

## carried in the blood round the body and into the cells.

<!-- chunk -->

## In India air is called prana, the breath of life, gases vital for

<!-- chunk -->

## normal functioning of our cells and tissues, as well as the energy

<!-- chunk -->

## of the atmosphere around us, which radiates from the trees and

<!-- chunk -->

## other green plants and ultimately from the sun. Correct breathing

<!-- chunk -->

## is important for our nerves and muscles to enable relaxation and

<!-- chunk -->

## rest, as well as engendering a clear alert mind. In many cultures

<!-- chunk -->

## and religions the use of the breath is central to spiritual practices

<!-- chunk -->

## such as yoga and meditation and traditional movements like Qi

<!-- chunk -->

## Gong and Tai Chi.

<!-- chunk -->

## The respiratory system is open to the atmosphere via the nose

<!-- chunk -->

## and mouth and so vulnerable to airborne irritation and infection.

<!-- chunk -->

## It also functions as a pathway for elimination of toxins, along

<!-- chunk -->

## with the skin, the bowels and the urinary tract. If the body is

<!-- chunk -->

## overloaded with toxins it can overburden the respiratory system

<!-- chunk -->

## and lead to problems. For this reason, our overall health needs to

<!-- chunk -->

## be considered when treating respiratory problems.

<!-- chunk -->

## A healthy diet with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables rich in

<!-- chunk -->

## antioxidant vitamins including A, C and E is essential to a

<!-- chunk -->

## healthy respiratory tract and to protect it from infection and the

<!-- chunk -->

## effects of pollution. Nutritional deficiencies, low hydrochloric

<!-- chunk -->

## acid levels in the stomach and a lack of zinc and magnesium are

<!-- chunk -->

## often found in people who suffer from respiratory diseases. If

<!-- chunk -->

## you have a tendency to respiratory problems it is best to avoid

<!-- chunk -->

## mucus forming foods, particularly wheat, milk and sugar. The

<!-- chunk -->

## herbal approach to the treatment of respiratory problems is firstly

<!-- chunk -->

## prevention through diet, lifestyle and herbs to maximise

<!-- chunk -->

## immunity and resistance to infections. Herbs such as echinacea,

<!-- chunk -->

## garlic, thyme, ginger and turmeric all have effective immune-

<!-- chunk -->

## stimulatory as well as antimicrobial actions.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Respiratory System

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxygen is inhaled as air through the

<!-- chunk -->

### nose and mouth and taken to the

<!-- chunk -->

### lungs, where it is diffused through the

<!-- chunk -->

### alveoli walls into the blood cells. At

<!-- chunk -->

### the same time, carbon dioxide is

<!-- chunk -->

### absorbed from the blood into the

<!-- chunk -->

### alveoli, to be expelled through

<!-- chunk -->

### exhalation.

# Colds and Flu

<!-- chunk -->

## The common cold virus can only thrive where the conditions in

<!-- chunk -->

## the body are right, and this is more likely when you are run

<!-- chunk -->

## down, stressed, don't take enough exercise, have sluggish

<!-- chunk -->

## bowels, a poor diet, gut flora disturbances or are overloaded with

<!-- chunk -->

## toxins. The resulting symptoms, particularly fevers and catarrh,

<!-- chunk -->

## are the body's way of clearing these. Supplements of vitamin C

<!-- chunk -->

## and zinc will help to prevent and decrease the duration of a cold.


<!-- chunk -->

## • At the first signs of infection take a hot infusion of boneset,

<!-- chunk -->

## elderflower, peppermint, and yarrow every hour or two to

<!-- chunk -->

## relieve aches and pains, reduce fever and clear catarrh.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Ginger tea or hot lemon with honey are also excellent.

<!-- chunk -->

## • At the same time take half a tsp of echinacea tincture and

<!-- chunk -->

## 500mg vitamin C every 2 hours.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Other immune-enhancing, antimicrobial and decongestant

<!-- chunk -->

## spices like cinnamon, cardamom, fenugreek, turmeric and

<!-- chunk -->

## coriander improve digestion, balance the gut flora and can be

<!-- chunk -->

## taken similarly.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Andrographis, elderberries and flowers, garlic, golden seal,

<!-- chunk -->

## lemon balm, pau d'arco, cat's claw, amalaki and wormwood are

<!-- chunk -->

## other effective remedies to combat infection and reduce fevers.

## • Aromatic inhalations or hot foot baths of rosemary, lavender,

<!-- chunk -->

## thyme, cinnamon or chamomile will reduce swelling of the

<!-- chunk -->

## mucous membranes, and loosen and clear catarrh.

<!-- chunk -->

## • A mustard foot bath can be equally effective.

# Catarrh and Sinusitis

<!-- chunk -->

## Irritation and inflammation of the nasal passages and sinuses

<!-- chunk -->

## from infection or inhaled pollutants causes the cells lining the

<!-- chunk -->

## mucous membranes of the respiratory tract to secrete extra

<!-- chunk -->

## mucus as a protective mechanism. This accumulates as catarrh

<!-- chunk -->

## and can predispose to sinusitis, which can be very painful and

<!-- chunk -->

## cause headaches and postnasal drip, which in turn causes

<!-- chunk -->

## recurrent throat and chest problems. Chronic catarrh and sinusitis

<!-- chunk -->

## can be due to infection, pollution, poor diet, food allergy, gut

<!-- chunk -->

## flora disturbances and toxicity.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Antimicrobial herbs including golden seal, wild indigo,

<!-- chunk -->

## elderberry, andrographis, echinacea, amalaki, neem, turmeric,

<!-- chunk -->

## garlic and myrrh can be taken to enhance immunity, combat

<!-- chunk -->

## infection in the respiratory and clear toxicity from the gut.

<!-- chunk -->

## • These are best combined with decongestants and astringents

<!-- chunk -->

## taken in hot teas such as ginger, cinnamon, coriander, thyme,

<!-- chunk -->

## ground ivy, yarrow, elderflowers, chamomile, eyebright,

<!-- chunk -->

## agrimony, meadowsweet and peppermint.

## and sinuses.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Washing the sinuses by sniffing salt water can work wonders.


<!-- chunk -->

## Omitting gluten, dairy and sugar from the diet and taking a

<!-- chunk -->

## supplement of vitamin C is recommended.

# Earache

<!-- chunk -->

## Earache can arise from pain in the throat, gums, teeth, parotid

<!-- chunk -->

## glands, or inflammation of the outer ear. Acute and severe

<!-- chunk -->

## earache can also be caused by acute middle ear infection (otitis

<!-- chunk -->

## media) which is more common in children. Children treated with

<!-- chunk -->

## antibiotics can be prone to recurrent ear infections with antibiotic

<!-- chunk -->

## resistant strains and glue ear. Other underlying causes include

<!-- chunk -->

## disturbance of the gut flora, passive smoking, chronic catarrh, as

<!-- chunk -->

## well as infection in the throat, tonsils or sinuses.

<!-- chunk -->

## Ideally use a combination of internal and local herbs.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Chamomile is an excellent antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

## and pain reliever, especially for children.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Echinacea enhances the immune system's fight against


<!-- chunk -->

<!-- chunk -->

## Provided there is no pus from a perforated eardrum, drop warm

<!-- chunk -->

## mullein, St John's wort or olive oil with a few drops of either

<!-- chunk -->

## lavender, garlic, or chamomile oil into the ear and plug it with

<!-- chunk -->

## cotton wool to help relieve inflammation or infection.


<!-- chunk -->

## Avoid mucus-producing foods including sugar, junk foods,

<!-- chunk -->

## gluten and dairy.

# Tonsillitis and Laryngitis

<!-- chunk -->

## Acute throat infections can be caused by viral or bacterial

<!-- chunk -->

## infection. Tonsillitis causes swollen and pus filled tonsils, quite

<!-- chunk -->

## severe throat pain, difficulty swallowing, fever and malaise.

<!-- chunk -->

## Laryngitis is inflammation or infection of the larynx which

<!-- chunk -->

## causes a sore throat aggravated by talking, dry cough, hoarseness

<!-- chunk -->

## and fever.

<!-- chunk -->

## The tonsils are bundles of lymphatic tissue whose role it is to

<!-- chunk -->

## clear the blood of toxins. Chronic tonsillitis develops when other

<!-- chunk -->

## eliminative pathways (bowels, kidneys and lungs) are

<!-- chunk -->

## overburdened, putting the lymphatic system under extra

<!-- chunk -->

## pressure. It is often related to disturbances of the gut flora, food

<!-- chunk -->

## intolerances and allergies and leaky gut syndrome.

## infections.

# Sore Throat and Swollen Glands

<!-- chunk -->

## Generally a prelude to a bacterial or viral infection, a sore throat

<!-- chunk -->

## can also be caused by irritation of the throat lining by tobacco

<!-- chunk -->

## smoke, post-nasal drip, allergies, acid reflux, dry heat and

<!-- chunk -->

## shouting. Swelling of lymph glands in the neck indicate that the

## of fresh vegetables and minimise gluten and dairy.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Supplements of vitamins A, B and C help to enhance

<!-- chunk -->

## immunity.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: If a child runs a fever with an acute sore throat and

<!-- chunk -->

## swollen tonsils, seek professional help. It could indicate a

<!-- chunk -->

## streptococcal infection with risk of further complications such as

<!-- chunk -->

## nephritis and rheumatic fever.

# Asthma

<!-- chunk -->

## Asthma is caused by the release of inflammatory chemicals,

<!-- chunk -->

## which inflame and narrow the bronchial tubes, making it difficult

<!-- chunk -->

## to breathe.

<!-- chunk -->

## Increased mucus production blocks the airways still further.

<!-- chunk -->

## Asthma can be triggered by food allergies, environmental

<!-- chunk -->

## pollutants, respiratory infections, immune problems (caused by

<!-- chunk -->

## suppression of eczema and chest infections for example),

<!-- chunk -->

## emotional problems, digestive disturbance and gut flora issues.

<!-- chunk -->

## Prevention is the best line of treatment. Herbs can be taken in

<!-- chunk -->

## conjunction with other medication or inhalants, and may need to

<!-- chunk -->

## be taken over several months.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Expectorant herbs elecampane, thyme, hyssop, garlic, ginger,

<!-- chunk -->

## liquorice and mullein liquefy and clear mucus from the

<!-- chunk -->

## bronchial tubes, and strengthen and relax bronchial muscles,

<!-- chunk -->

## thereby opening the airways.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Thyme, elecampane, pleurisy root, angelica, pau d'arco and

<!-- chunk -->

## oregano are excellent for combating chest infections.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Adaptogens schizandra, ashwagandha, shatavari, liquorice,

<!-- chunk -->

## turmeric, shiitake and reishi mushrooms enhance immunity,

<!-- chunk -->

## reduce inflammation and increase resilience to stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Ginkgo, chamomile, yarrow, feverfew, baikal skullcap and

<!-- chunk -->

## nettles decrease allergic responses that may trigger asthma.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Relaxing herbs skullcap, holy basil, rose, lavender,

<!-- chunk -->

## honeysuckle, wild oats, California poppy or chamomile help

<!-- chunk -->

## reduce tension.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Treat the first signs of respiratory infection vigorously to

<!-- chunk -->

## prevent asthma from getting worse.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: Seek medical attention in acute asthma.

# Hay Fever

<!-- chunk -->

## Hay fever, also known as allergic rhinitis, it is a common atopic

<!-- chunk -->

## condition mostly occurring when high concentrations pollens are

<!-- chunk -->

## released during late spring and summer, especially in hot

<!-- chunk -->

## weather. The familiar symptoms are caused by release of

<!-- chunk -->

## histamine and other inflammatory chemical, and are generally

<!-- chunk -->

## worse in the morning and evening coinciding with the changes in

<!-- chunk -->

## air temperature. House dust and animal hair can produce similar

<!-- chunk -->

## reactions. Hay fever and other atopic conditions like eczema and

<!-- chunk -->

## asthma tend to be genetic and occur when immunity is lowered,

<!-- chunk -->

## for example by long term stress and disturbance of the gut flora.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Immuno-stimulants such as ashwagandha, astragalus,

<!-- chunk -->

## guduchi, amalaki, Siberian ginseng or echinacea are

<!-- chunk -->

## recommended for a few months before the hay fever season

<!-- chunk -->

## starts.

<!-- chunk -->

## • 1–2 dessertspoonful of local honey in honeycombs with each

<!-- chunk -->

## meal can be for 2–4 months before the hay fever season.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Cutting out gluten and dairy is also helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Antihistamine and anti-inflammatory herbs including

<!-- chunk -->

## turmeric, echinacea, golden seal, chamomile, nettle, lemon

<!-- chunk -->

## balm, feverfew, baikal skullcap and yarrow with a little

<!-- chunk -->

## liquorice can reduce symptoms once they start.

<!-- chunk -->

## • They can also be used as teas for inhalations to ease

<!-- chunk -->

## symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Agrimony, elderflowers, plantain and eyebright tone mucous

<!-- chunk -->

## membranes and help desensitise them to allergens.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Marshmallow and slippery elm soothe irritation of the

<!-- chunk -->

## mucosa.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Ginger, garlic, thyme, burdock and marigold combat

<!-- chunk -->

## disturbance of the gut flora.

<!-- chunk -->

## early hours of the morning with mild asthma. His symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

## worsened during cold winter weather and when he was

<!-- chunk -->

## anxious.

<!-- chunk -->

## THE HERBAL TREATMENT

<!-- chunk -->

## I made David a prescription of antispasmodic and demulcent

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs to relax and soothe the bronchi and open the airways.

<!-- chunk -->

## It included marshmallow, elecampane, thyme, hyssop,

<!-- chunk -->

## coltsfoot, liquorice and mullein. I added ashwagandha and

<!-- chunk -->

## shatavari to enhance immunity and increase resilience to

<!-- chunk -->

## stress, a little ginger to aid digestion and elimination of

<!-- chunk -->

## toxins from the gut, and suggested he drink chamomile and

<!-- chunk -->

## nettle tea to decrease any allergic responses that may trigger

<!-- chunk -->

## his asthma.

<!-- chunk -->

## I recommended that David's parents remove dairy

<!-- chunk -->

## products and wheat from his diet, as he frequently ate pizza

<!-- chunk -->

## and pasta. I also suggested that they ensured David had

<!-- chunk -->

## plenty of calcium in his diet from other sources, such as

<!-- chunk -->

## green vegetables, bony fish, nuts and seeds.

<!-- chunk -->

## With this treatment, David's asthma was better within a

<!-- chunk -->

## few months.


<!-- chunk -->

## Supplements of vitamin C and magnesium are recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Sunglasses may help to reduce eye irritation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Baikal skullcap has antihistamine

<!-- chunk -->

### effects, useful in the treatment of hay

<!-- chunk -->

### fever.

# Coughs and Bronchitis

<!-- chunk -->

## A cough is a reflex response, designed to remove irritants such

<!-- chunk -->

## as dust, toxins, pathogenic microorganisms or mucus blocking

<!-- chunk -->

## the throat or bronchial tubes, but if it becomes chronic a cough

<!-- chunk -->

## can be debilitating and disturb sleep. Coughs can be aggravated

<!-- chunk -->

## by stress and cold weather.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Demulcent herbs like marshmallow, mullein, plantain,

<!-- chunk -->

## liquorice and slippery elm soothe irritation and inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

## in dry tickly coughs.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Expectorants and decongestants including thyme, elecampane,

<!-- chunk -->

## ground ivy, white horehound, hyssop, ginger, angelica and

<!-- chunk -->

## oregano liquefy and clear phlegm.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Vitamin C in elderberries, blackberries and bilberries, as well

<!-- chunk -->

## as infusions of rose petals stimulate the muco-ciliary escalator,

<!-- chunk -->

## clear phlegm and protect the lungs from infection.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Nervous coughs can be eased with relaxing nervines such as

<!-- chunk -->

## chamomile, lemon balm and holy basil.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Antimicrobials thyme, elecampane, hyssop, cat's claw, pau

<!-- chunk -->

## d'arco, garlic, cinnamon and pleurisy root help combat

<!-- chunk -->

## infection and support the immune system.

<!-- chunk -->

## • A cough formula can be made consisting of mixtures of these

<!-- chunk -->

## depending on the nature of the cough.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Use oils of rosemary, rose, thyme, ginger, or cinnamon for

<!-- chunk -->

## herbal baths and inhalations.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: Fever and malaise with cough, green phlegm or

<!-- chunk -->

## breathlessness may indicate acute bronchitis or pneumonia. Seek

<!-- chunk -->

## medical attention.

<!-- chunk -->

### Blackberries are full of vitamin C,

# The Urinary System

# The urinary system consists of the kidneys,

# bladder and ureters. During circulation, blood

# passes through the kidneys, which act as an

# elaborate filtering system. They remove used and

# unwanted water, minerals, urea and wastes from

# the blood which becomes urine, and reabsorb

# what is still required by the body back into the

# bloodstream.

<!-- chunk -->

## In this way the kidneys control the amount of water and salts that

<!-- chunk -->

## are absorbed back into the blood and what is excreted as waste.

<!-- chunk -->

## They also help maintain the correct acid/alkali balance in the

<!-- chunk -->

## body. The kidneys funnel the urine into the bladder along 2 tubes

<!-- chunk -->

## which are the ureters. The bladder stores the urine until muscular

<!-- chunk -->

## contractions push it out through the urethra. Each day, your

<!-- chunk -->

## kidneys produce about 1.5 litres of urine. The Chinese value the

<!-- chunk -->

## kidneys as the seat of vital energy, known as kidney Jing, which

<!-- chunk -->

## promotes longevity and immunity.

<!-- chunk -->

## The urinary tract is prone to damage from the effects of an

<!-- chunk -->

## unhealthy lifestyle, poor diet and pollution. Solvents, paint,

<!-- chunk -->

## synthetic fragrances and colours, preservatives and nitrogenous

<!-- chunk -->

## waste from a high protein diet have to be passed out of the body

<!-- chunk -->

## via urine, and all impose a strain on the kidneys and can

<!-- chunk -->

## contribute to urinary problems. Urinary tract infections can affect

<!-- chunk -->

## the urethra, then pass into the bladder causing cystitis. From the

<!-- chunk -->

## bladder, infection can pass along the ureters to the kidneys and

<!-- chunk -->

## cause pyelonephritis. Other kidney infections can develop as

<!-- chunk -->

## secondaries from infection, such as Streptococcal throat

<!-- chunk -->

## infection, causing tonsillitis. Infections in babies and children

<!-- chunk -->

## may be related to structural abnormalities, but most often they

<!-- chunk -->

## are caused by E. Coli bacteria from the bowel that creep round

<!-- chunk -->

## from the anus, their journey aided by wiping from back to front

<!-- chunk -->

## rather than vice versa after urination or a bowel movement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Urinary tract infections tend to affect girls more than boys due to

<!-- chunk -->

## their anatomical differences, in that the passage from the urethra

<!-- chunk -->

## to the bladder is much shorter in girls. Vaginal infections, such as

<!-- chunk -->

## thrush, can also be related to urinary tract infections.

<!-- chunk -->

## It is important to drink plenty of fluids to assist the kidneys in

<!-- chunk -->

## their cleansing work, to flush through toxins and the waste

<!-- chunk -->

## products of metabolism, and to prevent them from causing

<!-- chunk -->

## irritation of the urinary tract along the way.

<!-- chunk -->

## There are many herbs that exert their action on the urinary

<!-- chunk -->

## system and which can be used preventatively and therapeutically.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mucilaginous herbs like marshmallow, corn silk, slippery elm,

<!-- chunk -->

## aloe vera and oats soothe irritation and inflammation. Aromatic

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs rich in antimicrobial volatile oils with a diuretic action,

<!-- chunk -->

## including chamomile, fennel, lemon balm, thyme and coriander,

<!-- chunk -->

## taken regularly as teas or in food are excellent for helping to

<!-- chunk -->

## prevent infection. Cranberries and bilberries/blueberries are also

<!-- chunk -->

## valuable, helping to prevent infection by preventing pathogenic

<!-- chunk -->

## bacteria from sticking to the walls of the urinary tract. During

<!-- chunk -->

## any kind of infection or inflammatory process, diuretic herbs to

<!-- chunk -->

## increase the flow of urine, including celery seed, cleavers,

<!-- chunk -->

## dandelion leaf, corn silk, couch grass and bearberry can help the

<!-- chunk -->

## body to throw off accumulated toxins and debris produced in the

<!-- chunk -->

## system from the immune system's fight against infection and


<!-- chunk -->

## The kidneys

<!-- chunk -->

### These organs are responsible for the

<!-- chunk -->

### excretion of nitrogenous wastes,

<!-- chunk -->

### principally urea, from the blood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nephrons within the cortex and

<!-- chunk -->

### medulla filter the blood under

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure and then reabsorb water and

<!-- chunk -->

### other useful substances back into the

<!-- chunk -->

### blood.

# Urinary Tract Infections

<!-- chunk -->

## Infections tend to affect women more than men due to their

<!-- chunk -->

## anatomical differences but in men they can be caused by prostate

<!-- chunk -->

## problems. Cystitis refers to unpleasant urinary symptoms caused

<!-- chunk -->

## by irritation, as well as infection, generally from E coli bacteria.

<!-- chunk -->

## Underlying causes include lowered immunity, stress,

<!-- chunk -->

## disturbances of the gut flora, nutritional deficiencies, insufficient

<!-- chunk -->

## fluids, excess alcohol and caffeine, blood sugar problems and

<!-- chunk -->

## sex.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Antiseptic diuretics buchu, bearberry, goldenrod, chamomile,

<!-- chunk -->

## fennel, coriander, sarsaparilla and yarrow help combat

<!-- chunk -->

## infection and flush out bacteria, debris and irritants.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Soothing herbs marshmallow, plantain, slippery elm, aloe

<!-- chunk -->

## vera, corn silk and couch grass help relieve irritation, pain and


<!-- chunk -->

## • Horsetail is soothing and healing, particularly useful for

<!-- chunk -->

## repairing damage after repeated infection.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For irritation causing incontinence or bedwetting, use

<!-- chunk -->

## marshmallow, bayberry, horsetail, gravel root and yarrow.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Drink lukewarm to cool teas of any of these every hour or

<!-- chunk -->

## two in acute infections and 3 times daily in chronic problems.

<!-- chunk -->

## To relieve the burning/passing broken glass sensation, sit in a

<!-- chunk -->

## bath of strong chamomile tea for 10–15 minutes.


<!-- chunk -->

## To prevent infection and irritation, drink 3–4 litres of fluid daily

<!-- chunk -->

## to flush toxins and bacteria out of the body. Fluids can include

<!-- chunk -->

## water, herb teas or soothing barley water.

<!-- chunk -->

### Marshmallow is a soothing herb that

<!-- chunk -->

### will relieve urinary irritation and


<!-- chunk -->

## – Bilberries prevent bacteria from sticking to the walls of the

<!-- chunk -->

## urinary tract and are excellent as a preventative.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Soups and juices made from carrots, parsley, asparagus, celery,

<!-- chunk -->

## leeks and garlic are also helpful.

# Fluid Retention

<!-- chunk -->

## Excess water in the tissues causes oedema, swelling and

<!-- chunk -->

## discomfort, particularly in the feet and legs where, due to gravity,

<!-- chunk -->

## fluid first accumulates. It also causes cellulite. It can occur

<!-- chunk -->

## temporarily in premenstrual women, during pregnancy, hot

<!-- chunk -->

## weather and long flights. More chronic fluid retention can be

<!-- chunk -->

## caused by thyroid problems, obesity, poor circulation, varicose

<!-- chunk -->

## veins and poor diet, especially insufficient protein. Excess

<!-- chunk -->

## sodium in salty foods increases fluid retention, while the

<!-- chunk -->

## potassium in foods like bananas, tomatoes and green vegetables

<!-- chunk -->

## encourages the elimination of sodium. Oedema can indicate

<!-- chunk -->

## kidney and heart problems, which require professional treatment.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Useful diuretics to aid the elimination of water through the

<!-- chunk -->

## kidneys include dandelion leaf, celery seed, nettles, cleavers,

<!-- chunk -->

## fennel, coriander, buchu, meadowsweet, corn silk, chamomile

<!-- chunk -->

## and bearberry.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Add vitex, shatavari or lady's mantle for premenstrual fluid

<!-- chunk -->

## retention, including tender swollen breasts.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Yarrow, gingko, gotu kola, marigold, shepherd's purse,

<!-- chunk -->

## golden seal, garlic, lime flower and hawthorn improve venous

<!-- chunk -->

## circulation, and relieve swelling and discomfort. Antioxidants

<!-- chunk -->

## such as ginkgo, bilberries, elderberries and horse chestnut

<!-- chunk -->

## strengthen and heal blood vessels.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Kelp and guggulu are helpful for low thyroid function and

<!-- chunk -->

## weight reduction.


<!-- chunk -->

## It is important to take plenty of exercise, to raise the feet when

<!-- chunk -->

## sitting, and avoid tea, coffee, and alcohol.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Supplements of B complex, magnesium and evening primrose

<!-- chunk -->

## oil can help where fluid retention is related to hormones.

# Kidney Stones

<!-- chunk -->

## Infection and irritation in the kidney and insufficient fluids can

<!-- chunk -->

## lead to the formation of crystals, which can develop into stones

<!-- chunk -->

## and gravel. They are mostly formed from calcium oxalate,

<!-- chunk -->

## calcium phosphate or uric acid. When they move they cause

<!-- chunk -->

## sudden, excruciating pain, which passes once the stones have

<!-- chunk -->

## passed out of the bladder.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Antilithic and diuretic herbs including wild carrot, gravel root,

<!-- chunk -->

## bilberry, buchu, dandelion leaves, goldenrod, or bearberry can

<!-- chunk -->

## be used to dissolve and facilitate the passing of stones and

<!-- chunk -->

## gravel. These also combat urinary tract infection.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Demulcent diuretics marshmallow, slippery elm, corn silk and

<!-- chunk -->

## couch grass reduce inflammation, soothe and heal irritated

<!-- chunk -->

## urinary tubules, and help dissolve and ease passing of stones

<!-- chunk -->

## and gravel.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Antispasmodics chamomile, cramp bark, wild yam, passion

<!-- chunk -->

## flower and valerian can reduce pain and muscle spasm in the

<!-- chunk -->

## urinary tract caused by passing stones.


<!-- chunk -->

## It is important to drink plenty of fluids and eat foods rich in

<!-- chunk -->

## magnesium and B vitamins to help reduce the formation of

<!-- chunk -->

## stones.

# Prostate Problems

<!-- chunk -->

## The prostate is a walnut sized gland surrounding the ureter which

<!-- chunk -->

## carries urine from the bladder to the penis. An enlarged or

<!-- chunk -->

## swollen prostate obstructs the flow of urine and can cause

<!-- chunk -->

## sensations of pressure, hesitancy or urgency to empty the

<!-- chunk -->

## bladder. Incomplete bladder emptying predisposes to urinary

<!-- chunk -->

## infections and disturbs sleep caused by frequent trips to the toilet.

<!-- chunk -->

## Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) commonly affects men

<!-- chunk -->

## from their late forties and is related to dwindling testosterone

<!-- chunk -->

## levels and the conversion of testosterone into dihydro

<!-- chunk -->

## testosterone (DHT), which can be linked to deficiencies of zinc,

<!-- chunk -->

## B6 and essential fatty acids. Infection (prostatitis) and cancer can

<!-- chunk -->

## also cause enlargement of the prostate.


<!-- chunk -->

## • The best herb for shrinking the prostate is saw palmetto when

<!-- chunk -->

## taken long term.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Liquorice prevents conversion of testosterone to DHL and so

<!-- chunk -->

## prevents enlargement.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Other useful herbs include golden seal, nettle root, red clover,

<!-- chunk -->

## horsetail, dandelion, gravel root, Siberian ginseng, evening

<!-- chunk -->

## primrose seed oil, Chinese angelica, echinacea, and goldenrod.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For prostatitis, useful herbs include nettle root, echinacea,

<!-- chunk -->

## golden seal, garlic, buchu, bearberry, chamomile and couch

<!-- chunk -->

## grass. These can be taken in acute doses if necessary

<!-- chunk -->

## • For cramping pain caused by infection or inflammation you

<!-- chunk -->

## can use cramp bark, chamomile and Chinese angelica.


<!-- chunk -->

## A high protein diet is recommended as this helps to maintain

<!-- chunk -->

## good testosterone levels, increasing zinc and essential fatty acid

<!-- chunk -->

## intake.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Eating pumpkin seeds daily helps provide extra zinc, as well as

<!-- chunk -->

## eating cooked tomatoes which are rich in lycopene, and taking

<!-- chunk -->

## supplements of vitamins A, C and E, selenium and zinc.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Drinking cranberry or blueberry juice and plenty of water is

<!-- chunk -->

## advised.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: If you suspect prostate problems seek medical attention.

<!-- chunk -->

### Saw palmatto is traditionally thought

<!-- chunk -->

### of as a man's herb and is prescribed to

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce enlarged prostate glands.

<!-- chunk -->

### Drink cranberry juice every day to

<!-- chunk -->

### keep the prostate healthy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eating pumpkin seeds every day

# The Circulatory System

# Our bodies contain about 5 litres of blood,

# consisting of plasma, red blood cells, white blood

# cells, and platelets, which is continually

# transported around the body via the circulatory

# gases and nutrients to every cell of the body and

# to take away the waste products of metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

## The blood is also responsible for maintaining the correct body

<!-- chunk -->

## temperature and ph of the body. The circulatory system also

<!-- chunk -->

## includes the transport of lymph. The lymphatic system distributes

<!-- chunk -->

## immune cells called lymphocytes which protect the body against

<!-- chunk -->

## infection, it absorbs lipids from the gut and carries them to the

<!-- chunk -->

## blood. With the circulatory system, it returns fluids and plasma

<!-- chunk -->

## proteins from cells and tissues to the blood, and thus maintains

<!-- chunk -->

## fluid balance.

## The heart pumps oxygen and nutrient-rich blood into the aorta,

## the main artery, from where it flows about 60,000 miles through

<!-- chunk -->

## a vast network of vessels of different sizes, arteries and

<!-- chunk -->

## capillaries, to reach and nourish all the tissues of the body. Once

<!-- chunk -->

## the waste products, including carbon dioxide, are collected from

<!-- chunk -->

## the cells, the deoxygenated blood flows into the veins and is

<!-- chunk -->

## circulated back to the heart and the lungs where carbon dioxide

<!-- chunk -->

## and oxygen are exchanged. On its journey round the body, the

<!-- chunk -->

## blood passes through the kidneys which filter much of the waste

<!-- chunk -->

## from the blood. It also passes through the small intestine and into

<!-- chunk -->

## the portal vein which passes through the liver, where sugars from

<!-- chunk -->

## the blood are filtered and stored.

<!-- chunk -->

## Most circulatory problems are caused by blocked arteries,

<!-- chunk -->

## which in turn are caused by atherosclerosis or hardening of the

<!-- chunk -->

## arteries. For the heart muscle to work efficiently it requires its

<!-- chunk -->

## own supply of oxygenated blood, which is carried through four

<!-- chunk -->

## small coronary arteries. Should these become blocked and

<!-- chunk -->

## prevent blood flow to the heart muscle, serious damage to the

<!-- chunk -->

## heart may occur.

<!-- chunk -->

## There are several factors that contribute to circulatory

<!-- chunk -->

## problems, including high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol,

<!-- chunk -->

## smoking, obesity, heredity, lack of exercise and emotional stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## Damage or stress to the inner lining of the blood vessels leads

<!-- chunk -->

## over time to a build-up of debris and narrowing of the artery,

<!-- chunk -->

## predisposing to blockage. High homocysteine levels increase the

<!-- chunk -->

## build up of plaque in the arteries and emotional stress can cause

<!-- chunk -->

## the release biochemicals that contribute to the injury of arterial

<!-- chunk -->

## tissues. Inflammation within the blood vessels can also cause the

<!-- chunk -->

## deposition of cholesterol as a protective mechanism. Cholesterol

<!-- chunk -->

## from excess dietary sugar and carbohydrates, or errors of the

<!-- chunk -->

## liver's metabolism of cholesterol can also line and narrow the

<!-- chunk -->

## arteries, making them susceptible to plaque deposits.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Circulatory System

<!-- chunk -->

### A complex network of veins, arteries

<!-- chunk -->

### and capillaries allows blood to

<!-- chunk -->

### circulate all around the body. This

<!-- chunk -->

### enables the transportation of nutrients

<!-- chunk -->

### and oxygen to every part of the body,

<!-- chunk -->

### as well as the removal of waste

<!-- chunk -->

### products.

<!-- chunk -->

## It is sensible to reduce the intake of sugar, junk food and

<!-- chunk -->

## refined carbohydrates. Folic acid and other B vitamins help

<!-- chunk -->

## lower cholesterol and homocysterine levels. Red, yellow and

<!-- chunk -->

## orange fruits and vegetables, and herbs including bilberries and

<!-- chunk -->

## ginkgo are rich in antioxidants which protect arteries from

<!-- chunk -->

## oxidation and reduce plaque deposits. Several other herbs such

<!-- chunk -->

## as lime flower, gotu kola and hawthorn help to regulate blood

<!-- chunk -->

## pressure, nourish the heart and strengthen the arteries. Fibres in

<!-- chunk -->

## complex carbohydrates such as oats carry cholesterol out of cells,

<!-- chunk -->

## tissues and arteries to the liver where it is excreted. Limiting salt

<!-- chunk -->

## and sugar intake, taking regular aerobic exercise and maintaining

<!-- chunk -->

## ideal body weight are also a good preventative measure against

<!-- chunk -->

## circulatory disorders.

# Anaemia

<!-- chunk -->

## Lack of dietary iron, excess loss of blood (from heavy periods,

<!-- chunk -->

## haemorrhoids, bleeding gums, or peptic ulcers) and digestive

<!-- chunk -->

## problems causing poor digestion and absorption can result in

<!-- chunk -->

## iron deficiency and are the most common cause of anaemia.

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency can also cause anaemia,

<!-- chunk -->

## while other more serious problems such as leukaemia or

<!-- chunk -->

## radiation therapy can cause disturbance to red blood cells.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Ashwagandha, dandelion leaves, bilberries, raspberry leaves,

<!-- chunk -->

## nettles, dock root, codonopsis, amalaki, guggulu and coriander

<!-- chunk -->

## leaves are all rich in iron and folic acid.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Chinese angelica is rich in B12 and folic acid, and increases

<!-- chunk -->

## red blood cell production.

<!-- chunk -->

## • To improve iron absorption, iron-rich digestive herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## burdock, vervain, hawthorn, skullcap, gentian and hops can be

<!-- chunk -->

## helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Drinking a hot cup of tea made from fresh ginger before

<!-- chunk -->

## meals will also aid iron absorption. Siberian ginseng increases

<!-- chunk -->

## resilience and strength in anaemia.


<!-- chunk -->

## Eating plenty of vitamin C-rich foods such as red, yellow and

<!-- chunk -->

## green vegetables and dark red fruit such as bilberry, blackberries

<!-- chunk -->

## and blackcurrants, is recommended to enhance iron absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Tea, coffee and alcohol are best avoided as they can inhibit iron

<!-- chunk -->

## absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

## – The diet needs to be rich in iron, folic acid, protein, and

<!-- chunk -->

## vitamins E and B12.

# Heart Conditions

<!-- chunk -->

## • There is much that can be done to prevent and remedy heart

<!-- chunk -->

## problems, including dietary changes, exercise, nutritional

<!-- chunk -->

## supplements and herbs. Antioxidant herbs turmeric, bilberry,

<!-- chunk -->

## hawthorn, shiitake and reishi mushrooms and ginkgo can

<!-- chunk -->

## reduce oxidative damage to the heart and blood vessels caused

<!-- chunk -->

## by free radicals and strengthen the heart muscle by improving

<!-- chunk -->

## blood flow through the coronary arteries.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Many herbs such as guggulu, olive leaf, hawthorn, cayenne,

<!-- chunk -->

## ginger, turmeric, evening primrose, Chinese angelica and

<!-- chunk -->

## garlic can significantly lower blood pressure and LDL

<!-- chunk -->

## cholesterol and prevent (and even reverse) atherosclerotic

<!-- chunk -->

## plaque from forming, thereby reducing the tendency to heart

<!-- chunk -->

## attacks.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Coleus relaxes the arteries, lowers blood pressure, improves

<!-- chunk -->

## blood flow through the heart and is indicated in congestive

<!-- chunk -->

## heart failure, arteriosclerosis and angina.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Angelica is a calcium-channel blocker in the heart, useful for

<!-- chunk -->

## high blood pressure, angina and heart arrhythmias.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Astragalus is a good antioxidant and diuretic and lowers blood

<!-- chunk -->

## pressure. It improves blood flow through the heart, and heart

<!-- chunk -->

## function, and reduces ischemic heart disease and angina.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Hawthorn, motherwort, lime flower, lemon balm, passion

<!-- chunk -->

## flower and rosemary steady heart contractions and reduce

<!-- chunk -->

## palpitations.

<!-- chunk -->

## • When these are related to menopausal flushes add sage or

<!-- chunk -->

## black cohosh.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Adaptogens such as ashwagandha and Siberian ginseng help

<!-- chunk -->

## to protect the heart against the effects of stress.


<!-- chunk -->

## Regular exercise is vital to keep the heart healthy.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Avoiding coffee, cola and tea is advisable.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: If you are on medication for a heart condition, check with

<!-- chunk -->

## your practitioner before taking herbs.

# Poor Circulation

<!-- chunk -->

## Poor circulation to the extremities causes cold hands and feet and

<!-- chunk -->

## increases the tendency to chilblains and cramp. Chilblains are

<!-- chunk -->

## itchy, sore red lumps on fingers or toes, which develop due to

<!-- chunk -->

## insufficient oxygen and nutrients being carried to the area by the

<!-- chunk -->

## blood. Poor circulation is caused by constriction of the arteries

<!-- chunk -->

## and can be inherited. It is aggravated by lack of exercise,

<!-- chunk -->

## smoking, caffeine, poor diet, tiredness and stress. Reynaud's

<!-- chunk -->

## syndrome and circulatory problems associated with heart or

<!-- chunk -->

## arterial disease can also cause circulatory problems.


<!-- chunk -->

## • The best circulatory stimulants include ginger, garlic, cayenne,

<!-- chunk -->

## gotu kola, coriander, cinnamon, prickly ash, and hawthorn.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Hot teas of yarrow, peppermint, elderflower, rosemary and

<!-- chunk -->

## lime flowers increase blood flow, dilate the arteries and reduce

<!-- chunk -->

## cramp.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Bilberry and horse chestnut improve circulation and

<!-- chunk -->

## strengthen blood vessels.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Evening primrose seed oil also improves circulation.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Warm baths, foot baths or massage with oils of ginger,

<!-- chunk -->

## cinnamon, coriander, oregano, thyme and rosemary relax tense

<!-- chunk -->

## muscles and stimulate blood flow.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Calendula cream, gotu kola or lavender oil soothes chilblains.


<!-- chunk -->

## Supplements of vitamin C and bioflavonoids, omega-3 fatty

<!-- chunk -->

## acids and regular exercise are recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

### Evening primrose is prescribed to

<!-- chunk -->

### help lower blood pressure and keep

<!-- chunk -->

### platelets from clumping in the blood

<!-- chunk -->

### vessels.

# Cramp

<!-- chunk -->

## Cramp is caused by muscular spasm and can be very painful.

<!-- chunk -->

## Pregnant women and the elderly are more likely to suffer from

<!-- chunk -->

## cramp; it may be a sign of low calcium levels, deficiencies of

<!-- chunk -->

## vitamins B or D, low digestive enzymes, poor absorption and

<!-- chunk -->

## circulatory problems. Varicose veins, tiredness, lack of exercise,

<!-- chunk -->

## insufficient fluids and nervous tension may also be contributory

<!-- chunk -->

## factors.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Useful circulatory stimulants include ginger, garlic, gotu kola,

<!-- chunk -->

## turmeric, gingko, hawthorn, prickly ash, cinnamon and

<!-- chunk -->

## cayenne.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Amalaki, guggulu, and coriander are also helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Hot teas of ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, yarrow, peppermint

<!-- chunk -->

## and elderflowers will also promote circulation and prevent

<!-- chunk -->

## cramp.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Gotu kola, bilberry and gingko will aid venous return if there

<!-- chunk -->

## are varicose veins.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For cramps related to stress, tension and tiredness, cramp

<!-- chunk -->

## bark, passion flower, rosemary, skullcap, gotu kola, holy basil,

<!-- chunk -->

## limeflowers and ashwagandha are recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Nettles, dill, wild oats, celery seed, meadowsweet, dandelion

<!-- chunk -->

## leaves, and buchu are all rich in calcium.

<!-- chunk -->

### Drinking hot peppermint tea will

<!-- chunk -->

### promote circulation and prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### cramp.


<!-- chunk -->

## Moving the affected limb briskly, walking, stretching and

<!-- chunk -->

## massage with essential oils of ginger, cinnamon, rosemary, thyme

<!-- chunk -->

## or oregano in a base of sesame oil will swiftly relieve pain.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Supplements of vitamins B and C, calcium and magnesium can

<!-- chunk -->

## be taken to support the nervous system and aid circulation.

# Altitude Sickness

<!-- chunk -->

## High altitudes in mountainous regions contain less oxygen than

<!-- chunk -->

## lower areas and when travelling or climbing in such areas, it is

<!-- chunk -->

## advised to make the ascent gradually to allow the body time to

<!-- chunk -->

## acclimatise. A rapid ascent causes fluids to move from the blood

<!-- chunk -->

## to the tissues, which results in dehydration, and this is aggravated

<!-- chunk -->

## by vigorous exercise and alcohol. As the blood thickens from

<!-- chunk -->

## fluid loss, it inhibits the elimination of toxins and causes

<!-- chunk -->

## headaches, fatigue, malaise and extreme thirst. One of the best

<!-- chunk -->

## preventative measures is to drink plenty of liquid. Herbs can help

<!-- chunk -->

## prevent and combat altitude sickness.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Cloves, carrot seed, cinnamon and oregano contain eugenol

<!-- chunk -->

## which helps thin the blood. Garlic, ginger, dill, fennel,

<!-- chunk -->

## cayenne, celery seed act similarly.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Garlic, ginger, cayenne, gotu kola and gingko increase blood

<!-- chunk -->

## flow and oxygen supply throughout the body, including the

<!-- chunk -->

## brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Adaptogens rhodiola, reishi mushroom, Siberian and panax

<!-- chunk -->

## ginseng, ashwagandha and other herbs rich in anti-oxidants

<!-- chunk -->

## like hawthorn, milk thistle and schizandra increase the body's

<!-- chunk -->

## ability to adapt to changes in oxygen levels as many of the

<!-- chunk -->

## symptoms of altitude sickness appear to be related to free

<!-- chunk -->

## radical activity.


<!-- chunk -->

## Supplements of vitamins C and E, alpha lipoic acid, co-enzyme

<!-- chunk -->

## Q 10, glutathione, l-glutamine and flavonoids can help

<!-- chunk -->

## endurance of higher altitudes.

# High Blood Pressure

<!-- chunk -->

## An increase in pressure inside the arteries weakens the heart and

<!-- chunk -->

## arteries, impedes blood flow to vital organs such as the kidneys,

<!-- chunk -->

## brain and eyes and predisposes to heart attacks and strokes. The

<!-- chunk -->

## most common causes of this are hereditary tendency, stress,

<!-- chunk -->

## obesity, kidney problems, excess alcohol, smoking and

<!-- chunk -->

## hardening of the arteries.


<!-- chunk -->

## • The best antihypertensive herbs, which relax and dilate

<!-- chunk -->

## arteries include hawthorn, lime flowers, garlic, gingko,

<!-- chunk -->

## motherwort, cramp bark, valerian and gotu kola. Antioxidant

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs amalaki, holy basil, self heal, turmeric, cayenne, shiitake

<!-- chunk -->

## mushroom, blueberries, elderberries, ginger and guggulu

<!-- chunk -->

## prevent damage to arteries from free radicals and reduce the

<!-- chunk -->

## risk of heart attacks and strokes.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For problems related to anxiety and tension, add to your

<!-- chunk -->

## prescription cramp bark, rosemary, wild oats, chamomile,

<!-- chunk -->

## passion flower, or skullcap.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Lime flower tea is relaxing and dilates the arteries, reducing

<!-- chunk -->

## blood pressure.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For excess fluid take diuretic herbs dandelion leaves, corn

<!-- chunk -->

## silk, bearberry, cleavers, and goldenrod.


<!-- chunk -->

## Meditation and yoga can be very helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

## – A largely vegetarian diet, together with cold-pressed vegetable

<!-- chunk -->

## oils is recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Avoid tea, coffee, alcohol and smoking and take regular

<!-- chunk -->

## aerobic exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: Seek medical attention if you have high blood pressure.

# Arterial Disease

<!-- chunk -->

## Hardening of the arteries (arteriosclerosis) and deposits of

<!-- chunk -->

## cholesterol (atherosclerosis) in the artery walls cause the arteries

<!-- chunk -->

## to narrow, limiting blood flow to the tissues and resulting in poor

<!-- chunk -->

## circulation to the limbs, as in Buerger's disease. When the arteries

<!-- chunk -->

## in the heart are narrowed, lack of blood to the heart muscle

<!-- chunk -->

## causes anginal pain, and increases the risk of heart attack.

<!-- chunk -->

## Arterial disease is related to high blood pressure, blood sugar

<!-- chunk -->

## disorders, high homocysteine levels, overconsumption of animal

<!-- chunk -->

## fats, refined carbohydrates, sugar, alcohol, smoking, lack of

<!-- chunk -->

## exercise, and obesity.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Antioxidant herbs prevent damage to artery walls that can lead

<!-- chunk -->

## to plaque development and oxidation of LDL cholesterol,

<!-- chunk -->

## which forms deposits. Hawthorn is the herb of choice,

<!-- chunk -->

## improving blood flow through the heart and arteries, reducing

<!-- chunk -->

## inflammation in arteries, regulating blood pressure, lowering

<!-- chunk -->

## cholesterol and preventing build-up of deposits and formation

<!-- chunk -->

## of clots.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Other beneficial herbs include cayenne, turmeric, shiitake

<!-- chunk -->

## mushroom, blueberries, elderberries, amalaki, garlic and

<!-- chunk -->

## ginger.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Guggulu lowers cholesterol and scrapes existing plaque from

<!-- chunk -->

## the arteries.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Ginger, ginkgo, turmeric, bilberries and elderberries are rich

<!-- chunk -->

## in antioxidants, which strengthen and stabilise artery walls and

<!-- chunk -->

## prevent clots.


<!-- chunk -->

## Supplements of B vitamins, co-enzyme Q 10, selenium, omega-3

<!-- chunk -->

## oils and antioxidants are recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Avoid tea, coffee, alcohol, and cigarettes, and take regular

<!-- chunk -->

## exercise.

# Raised Cholesterol

<!-- chunk -->

## There are 2 types of cholesterol: low density lipoproteins (LDL),

<!-- chunk -->

## which increase the risk of heart attacks, and high density

<!-- chunk -->

## lipoproteins (HDL) which actually reduce it. Cholesterol is a

<!-- chunk -->

## fatty, waxy substance, 25% of which comes from food, whilst

<!-- chunk -->

## the rest is manufactured in the liver. Excess sugar, refined

<!-- chunk -->

## carbohydrates and fats and errors of liver metabolism are largely

<!-- chunk -->

## to blame. Plant fibres can lower cholesterol, so a diet high in fruit

<!-- chunk -->

## and vegetables and whole grains with minimal fats helps

<!-- chunk -->

## maintain normal cholesterol levels.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Antioxidant herbs protect arteries, inhibit the formation of

<!-- chunk -->

## atherosclerotic plaque, lower cholesterol and help prevent

<!-- chunk -->

## cardiovascular disease. Useful herbs include hawthorn,

<!-- chunk -->

## cayenne, amalaki, guggulu, bilberry, elderberry, ginger,

<!-- chunk -->

## turmeric, evening primrose, Chinese angelica and liquorice.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Shiitake and reishi mushrooms and oats contain beta-glucans

<!-- chunk -->

## which help lower cholesterol.

<!-- chunk -->

## • A clove of garlic a day can substantially lower cholesterol

<!-- chunk -->

## levels.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Red clover reduces its absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Artichoke leaves help lower cholesterol by help the liver's

<!-- chunk -->

## metabolism of cholesterol.


<!-- chunk -->

## Niacin (vitamin B3) lowers total cholesterol as well as LDL,

<!-- chunk -->

## triglycerides and fibrinogen, a blood protein responsible for

<!-- chunk -->

## forming clots. It also raises HDL. Take in a B complex

<!-- chunk -->

## supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Reduce sugar, refined carbohydrates, and other processed

<!-- chunk -->

## foods.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Eat a diet high in vegetables, whole grains especially oats,

<!-- chunk -->

## beans and pulses, good fats and oily fish.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Take regular aerobic exercise.

# Varicose Veins, Ulcers and Haemorrhoids

<!-- chunk -->

## Dilation and enlargement of veins in the legs cause varicose

<!-- chunk -->

## veins, and when they occur in the anal area, they cause

<!-- chunk -->

## haemorrhoids. They tend to be hereditary and are caused by

<!-- chunk -->

## stagnation of blood in the veins and aggravated by too much

<!-- chunk -->

## standing, not enough exercise, pregnancy, constipation, obesity,

<!-- chunk -->

## shallow breathing and stress. Poor circulation in the legs, often

<!-- chunk -->

## associated with varicose veins, can cause the tissues and skin to

<!-- chunk -->

## break down; if the leg is knocked the skin will break easily and

<!-- chunk -->

## become ulcerated. This can take a long time to heal.


<!-- chunk -->

## • For prevention and treatment, useful herbs include yarrow,

<!-- chunk -->

## ginkgo, gotu kola, marigold, garlic, lime flower and hawthorn

<!-- chunk -->

## to improve venous circulation and relieve pain and discomfort.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Antioxidants such as bilberries, elderberries, ginkgo and horse

<!-- chunk -->

## chestnut strengthen and heal blood vessels. Horse chestnut

<!-- chunk -->

## improves the tone of veins and circulation through them and

<!-- chunk -->

## can improve chronic venous insufficiency dramatically.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Astringent herbs such as calendula, witch hazel, rose,

<!-- chunk -->

## agrimony, and horsetail externally in creams and lotions can

<!-- chunk -->

## help to tone and soothe varicose veins and haemorrhoids.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Aloe vera gel can also be helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

## • A calendula poultice will speed healing of varicose ulcers and

<!-- chunk -->

## relieve pain and inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Manuka honey is also recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

## • The area can be bathed with chamomile or calendula tea

<!-- chunk -->

## between dressings.

<!-- chunk -->

## • If an ulcer is infected or inflamed add garlic, pau d'arco,

<!-- chunk -->

## neem, echinacea, and marigold to the internal formula.


<!-- chunk -->

## Supplements of vitamins E and C, bioflavonoids and zinc will

<!-- chunk -->

## help strengthen the veins.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Regular exercise, fibre rich foods and avoiding sitting or

<!-- chunk -->

## standing for long periods are all important.

<!-- chunk -->

### Calendula (marigold) makes an

<!-- chunk -->

### excellent mouthwash and prevents

<!-- chunk -->

### bleeding gums.

# The Musculo-skeletal System

# Our musculo-skeletal system consists of bones,

# muscles, tendons, ligaments, joints, cartilage and

# other connective tissue, which together provide

# the form and stability of the body and enable

# movement. Bones provide the structure of the

# body and protect the delicate internal structures

# such as the brain, spinal column, lungs and heart.

# They contain bone marrow where specialised

# cells including stem cells manufacture red blood

# cells.

<!-- chunk -->

## Although bone seems hard and rigid, bone cells are constantly

<!-- chunk -->

## being made and replaced and it is completely re-formed every

<!-- chunk -->

## years. The hard outer part is made mainly of protein such as

<!-- chunk -->

## collagen and hydroxyapatite, which largely consists of calcium

<!-- chunk -->

## and other minerals. Bones depend on minerals including calcium,

<!-- chunk -->

## and vitamin D for their density and strength. They also rely on

<!-- chunk -->

## activity and weight bearing exercise and the action of hormones,

<!-- chunk -->

## including growth and parathyroid hormone, oestrogen,

<!-- chunk -->

## testosterone, and calcitonin. They need a good blood supply

<!-- chunk -->

## which is brought to them by vessels that enter via their outer

<!-- chunk -->

## membrane, the periosteum, where most of their nerve supply is

<!-- chunk -->

## located.

<!-- chunk -->

## The junctions between bones are our joints, of which some,

<!-- chunk -->

## such as the shoulder and knee joints, move and allow a wide

<!-- chunk -->

## range of movement and some, like those in the skull, do not.

<!-- chunk -->

## Joints are designed to provide stability and protect against

<!-- chunk -->

## damage from use. They are lined with synovial fluid which

<!-- chunk -->

## provides nourishment to cartilage on the end of bones and

<!-- chunk -->

## prevents friction as they move. Cartilage is a tough and resilient

<!-- chunk -->

## tissue composed of collagen and proteoglycans that also prevents

<!-- chunk -->

## friction as the joints move. Ligaments are strong elastic fibrous

<!-- chunk -->

## cords composed largely of connective collagen surrounding the

<!-- chunk -->

## joints, and these act to strengthen and stabilise them. Their

<!-- chunk -->

## elasticity allows movement and protects the joints by ensuring

<!-- chunk -->

## that these movements are only in certain directions.

<!-- chunk -->

## There are 3 types of muscles: skeletal, smooth and cardiac.

<!-- chunk -->

## Skeletal muscles are bundles of elastic fibres attached to bones

<!-- chunk -->

## and joints. They contract and relax, enabling smooth, controlled

<!-- chunk -->

## movements and maintain our posture. The action of skeletal

<!-- chunk -->

## muscle is voluntary, controlled by the conscious brain unlike

<!-- chunk -->

## smooth muscle in the blood vessels, chest and abdominal organs

<!-- chunk -->

## and cardiac muscle in the heart which is involuntary. Their

<!-- chunk -->

## growth, strength and elasticity depends on growth hormone and

<!-- chunk -->

## testosterone and is maintained and increased by regular exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

## The health of our musculo-skeletal system depends on good

<!-- chunk -->

## diet, digestion, absorption and elimination. Over-using or

<!-- chunk -->

## neglecting certain groups of muscles, posture, and the amount of

<!-- chunk -->

## fresh air and exercise we take all have their effect. Stress and the

<!-- chunk -->

## inability to relax put a strain on the system and can contribute to

<!-- chunk -->

## joint and muscle problems. The biggest factor however is age.

<!-- chunk -->

## From around the age of 30 our bone density diminishes, and this

<!-- chunk -->

## accelerates in women after the menopause, meaning that our

<!-- chunk -->

## bones become more fragile and prone to fractures and breaks.

<!-- chunk -->

## Changes in cartilage and connective tissue affect the strength and

<!-- chunk -->

## stability of the joints. Thinning of the cartilage makes the joint

<!-- chunk -->

## more susceptible to damage and to wear and tear, predisposing to

<!-- chunk -->

## osteoarthritis. The connective tissue in the ligaments and tendons

<!-- chunk -->

## becomes less elastic, which can cause stiffness and limited

<!-- chunk -->

## movement. Muscle tissue is also affected and the size and

<!-- chunk -->

## strength of muscles gradually diminishes, which means less

<!-- chunk -->

## support and stability generally, and particularly of the joints,

<!-- chunk -->

## making them more prone to damage.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Skeletal System

<!-- chunk -->

### There are 2 skeletons: the axial, and

<!-- chunk -->

### the appendicular. The former is the

<!-- chunk -->

### basic structure of skull, spine, rib

<!-- chunk -->

### cage and sternum, while the latter

<!-- chunk -->

### comprises the bones of the limbs.

<!-- chunk -->

### More aches and pains develop in the

<!-- chunk -->

### skeletal system than in any other part

<!-- chunk -->

### of the body.

<!-- chunk -->

## Regular, moderate or low impact exercise however can go a

<!-- chunk -->

## long way to slowing this process. Massage, stretching,

<!-- chunk -->

## manipulation, rest and certain herbs can also be helpful. Horsetail

<!-- chunk -->

## nourishes the bones, aloe vera, wild celery seed, burdock, devil's

<!-- chunk -->

## claw and liquorice help prevent and remedy joint problems while

<!-- chunk -->

## cramp bark, rosemary, skullcap, hops and St John's wort help

<!-- chunk -->

## relax tense muscles and prevent them from damage.

# Arthritis

<!-- chunk -->

## Arthritis causes joint stiffness and inflammation and can lead to

<!-- chunk -->

## degeneration of the joints, disfigurement and pain. Osteoarthritis

<!-- chunk -->

## involving wear and tear as well as inflammation is most

<!-- chunk -->

## common, whilst rheumatoid arthritis is a more serious and

<!-- chunk -->

## progressive autoimmune disease. Underlying causes include

<!-- chunk -->

## poor diet, digestive problems, gut flora disturbances, toxicity,

<!-- chunk -->

## free radical damage, age, stress and chronic infection. Poor

<!-- chunk -->

## digestion and constipation cause nutritional deficiencies and

<!-- chunk -->

## accumulation of toxins in the gut, which are absorbed into the

<!-- chunk -->

## circulation and contribute to joint problems.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Turmeric and frankincense are recommended for osteo and

<!-- chunk -->

## rheumatoid arthritis. They are potent antioxidants, enhance

<!-- chunk -->

## immunity, reduce pain and inflammation and have an affinity

<!-- chunk -->

## with muscles and bones.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Devil's claw and myrrh are excellent anti-inflammatories that

<!-- chunk -->

## reduce pain and stiffness.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Black cohosh is anti-inflammatory and analgesic, excellent for

<!-- chunk -->

## post-menopausal arthritis.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Liquorice has cortisone-like anti-inflammatory actions and

<!-- chunk -->

## increases tolerance to physical and emotional stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Ashwagandha, with its pain killing and anti-inflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

## action and immune-stimulating properties is ideal for

<!-- chunk -->

## autoimmune problems including rheumatoid arthritis.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Long pepper, turmeric and cinnamon improve digestion.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Burdock, nettles, dock, calendula, and cleavers help to clear

<!-- chunk -->

## toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Other beneficial herbs include meadowsweet, kelp, gotu kola,

<!-- chunk -->

## shiitake, echinacea, wild yam, feverfew, willow, and angelica.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Fresh ginger tea taken daily is useful for is anti-inflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

## and antioxidant properties to reduce pain, swelling and

<!-- chunk -->

## associated bursitis.


<!-- chunk -->

## Supplements of evening primrose oil, glucosamine sulphate,

<!-- chunk -->

## MSM, omega-3 oils and selenium help protect and promote

<!-- chunk -->

## repair of cartilage.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Massage with liniments containing essential oils of rosemary,

<!-- chunk -->

## peppermint, lavender, or marjoram.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Add a few drops of cayenne tincture to increase circulation to

<!-- chunk -->

## the joint and decrease pain.

# Gout

<!-- chunk -->

## Gout is caused by a build up of uric acid in the blood. Uric acid

<!-- chunk -->

## is a by-product of protein metabolism in the liver, and when this

<!-- chunk -->

## reaches a certain level, uric acid crystals form and collect in joints

<!-- chunk -->

## causing intense pain, swelling and inflammation. It usually starts

<!-- chunk -->

## in the big toe first. It tends to run in families, is more common in

<!-- chunk -->

## men who are overweight and is associated with high blood

<!-- chunk -->

## pressure and triglycerides. It may be related to excess fatty foods,

<!-- chunk -->

## purines (from red meat, organ meats and shellfish), nightshades

<!-- chunk -->

## (potatoes, peppers, aubergines and tomatoes), cheese, citrus fruits

<!-- chunk -->

## and alcohol (particularly beer) and can be triggered by certain

<!-- chunk -->

## drugs, crash diets and exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nettles have been shown in studies to

<!-- chunk -->

### relieve the pain of arthritis; they also

<!-- chunk -->

### have diuretic and cleansing

<!-- chunk -->

### properties.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Diuretics to help the kidneys eliminate excess uric acid and

<!-- chunk -->

## other toxins can be useful, especially celery seed and nettles.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Gravel root, fennel, oat straw, gokshura and cleavers act

<!-- chunk -->

## similarly.

<!-- chunk -->

## • These can be combined with anti-inflammatories including

<!-- chunk -->

## devil's claw, turmeric, liquorice, cat's claw, rose hips, olive

<!-- chunk -->

## leaf, willow, meadowsweet, frankincense, ginger, sarsaparilla,

<!-- chunk -->

## or wild yam to reduce joint pain and swelling.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Herbs to support the liver can be added to prescriptions

<!-- chunk -->

## including burdock, dock, gentian, milk thistle or rosemary.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Externally, painful joints can be massaged with essential oils

<!-- chunk -->

## of peppermint, rosemary or lavender oil in sesame oil.


<!-- chunk -->

## Bromelain from pineapple is excellent for acute attacks and can

<!-- chunk -->

## be taken as a supplement along with quercitrin, and vitamin C

<!-- chunk -->

## from cherries, for prevention of future attacks.

# Osteoporosis

<!-- chunk -->

## Loss of bone tissue actually begins in our thirties but is hastened

<!-- chunk -->

## through lower oestrogen levels after the menopause.

<!-- chunk -->

## Other contributing factors are lack of calcium and other

<!-- chunk -->

## important bone nutrients including essential fatty acids, vitamin

<!-- chunk -->

## D, magnesium and boron, caused by a bad diet, poor digestion

<!-- chunk -->

## and absorption, disturbances of the gut flora, smoking, lack of

<!-- chunk -->

## exercise and a history of total hysterectomy. Women who are

<!-- chunk -->

## underweight, who have dieted frequently or who have suffered

<!-- chunk -->

## from coeliac disease are more at risk, since oestrogen is stored in

<!-- chunk -->

## fat tissue. A sedentary lifestyle, excess alcohol, and lack of

<!-- chunk -->

## exercise are also implicated. It is indicated by a tendency to

<!-- chunk -->

## fractures, back pain, loss of height due to compression of the

<!-- chunk -->

## spine and muscle spasm.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Adaptogenic herbs including shatavari, ashwagandha, maca

<!-- chunk -->

## and Siberian ginseng help protect the bones against the aging

<!-- chunk -->

## process and restore hormone balance.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Oestrogenic herbs including Chinese angelica, red clover,

<!-- chunk -->

## calendula, wild yam, liquorice, sage and hops are also

<!-- chunk -->

## recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

## • These can be combined with herbs, including long pepper,

<!-- chunk -->

## ginger, fennel, cumin or coriander, to improve digestion and

<!-- chunk -->

## absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Evening primrose seed oil also helps restore hormone balance.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Calcium-rich herbs are also important, such as nettles,

<!-- chunk -->

## dandelion leaves, horsetail, kelp, dill, celery seed, wild oats,

<!-- chunk -->

## codonopsis, hawthorn and amalaki.


<!-- chunk -->

## Plenty of exercise and supplements of vitamins E and D,

<!-- chunk -->

## magnesium and boron are recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Green vegetables such as spinach, turnip, broccoli, cabbage,

<!-- chunk -->

## sprouts, beans, whole grains, oatmeal, nuts and seeds, especially

<!-- chunk -->

## sesame seeds and tahini, provide calcium.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna and sardines provide

<!-- chunk -->

## vitamin D.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Soya bean, lentils, chickpeas and tofu help restore hormone

<!-- chunk -->

## balance after the menopause.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Walnuts and flaxseeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids which

<!-- chunk -->

## help prevent osteoporosis.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Avoid excess caffeine and alcohol. Caffeine has diuretic

<!-- chunk -->

## properties and causes excretion of calcium in the urine. Coffee,

<!-- chunk -->

## tea, sugar and soft drinks decrease calcium absorption and

<!-- chunk -->

## contribute to loss of bone density.

# Muscle Pain and Fibromyalgia

<!-- chunk -->

## Tender, stiff and aching muscles can occur after unaccustomed

<!-- chunk -->

## exercise, while more extreme muscle pain is caused by cramp,

<!-- chunk -->

## muscle strain or other injuries such as a compressed nerve. The

<!-- chunk -->

## muscles affected, or those nearby, can go into spasm, which

<!-- chunk -->

## further increases the pain. Generalised muscle pain, combined

<!-- chunk -->

## with fatigue and malaise can be a symptom of chronic stress,

<!-- chunk -->

## overwork, tiredness, flu and fibromyalgia (which is associated

<!-- chunk -->

## with post viral fatigue syndrome). Fibromyalgia is accompanied

<!-- chunk -->

## by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. Associated

<!-- chunk -->

## symptoms involve irritable bowel syndrome, migraines,

<!-- chunk -->

## cognitive difficulties, interstitial cystitis and temporomandibular

<!-- chunk -->

## joint disorders. It is thought that the condition involves

<!-- chunk -->

## amplification of the sensation of by affecting the way the brain

<!-- chunk -->

## processes pain signals.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Massage tense and aching muscles with essential oils of

<!-- chunk -->

## rosemary, thyme, basil, lavender, chamomile or ginger diluted

<!-- chunk -->

## in sesame oil. This will increase circulation to the affected area,

<!-- chunk -->

## ease tension and spasm, and reduce pain. Sesame oil is rich in

<!-- chunk -->

## calcium and magnesium, which help to release muscle tension.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Muscle relaxing herbs rosemary, thyme, chamomile, ginger,

<!-- chunk -->

## lavender, basil, skullcap, black cohosh, wild yam, and

<!-- chunk -->

## ashwagandha can be taken internally. Ashwagandha has a

<!-- chunk -->

## special affinity for muscle tissue.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For inflammation after an injury or muscle strain, use anti-

<!-- chunk -->

## inflammatories such as frankincense, devil's claw, liquorice,

<!-- chunk -->

## meadowsweet, ginger, black willow, turmeric, black cohosh or

<!-- chunk -->

## cat's claw.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Adaptogenic, immune-enhancing and tonic herbs such as

<!-- chunk -->

## ashwagandha, Siberian ginseng, shiitake and astragalus are

<!-- chunk -->

## useful for states of depletion and fibromyalgia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary stimulates the circulation

<!-- chunk -->

### of blood and has a restorative effect

<!-- chunk -->

### on the body.


<!-- chunk -->

## Rest aching muscles if they develop from overuse but only for

<!-- chunk -->

## 2–3 days, after which gently start to stretch them.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Supplements of calcium and magnesium can help to reduce

<!-- chunk -->

## muscle pain and spasm.

# The Skin

# Our skin is a mirror of our health and plays many

# important roles in the body. It protects us against

# dirt, infection, extremes of temperate and climate,

# sunlight, pollution, and physical injury. It secretes

# antiseptic substances to ward off infection, backed

# up by beneficial flora that live on the skin and the

# acid mantle formed by sweat, also helping to

# inhibit infection.

<!-- chunk -->

## Below the outer layer of skin, the epidermis, is the dermis, a

<!-- chunk -->

## thick, strong and elastic layer of tissue which is richly supplied

<!-- chunk -->

## with blood vessels, sweat and oil glands, and nerve endings.

<!-- chunk -->

## When the weather is cold the blood vessels contract to keep heat

<!-- chunk -->

## inside the body, and when it is hot they dilate to bring blood to

<!-- chunk -->

## the surface to enable the body to loose heat and maintain the

<!-- chunk -->

## correct temperature of the body.

<!-- chunk -->

## The several million sweat glands enable the skin to be a major

<!-- chunk -->

## organ of excretion. Sweat contains water, mineral salts,

<!-- chunk -->

## nitrogenous wastes and other toxins and is similar in content to

<!-- chunk -->

## urine. Most adults excrete about 1 pint (600mls) of fluid through

<!-- chunk -->

## the skin daily and up to ten times more when taking vigorous

<!-- chunk -->

## exercise or in hot weather. It is important to take sufficient

<!-- chunk -->

## exercise to produce a sweat on a regular basis, in order to clear

<!-- chunk -->

## toxins and not overburden the other pathways of elimination, the

<!-- chunk -->

## kidneys and bowels. Sweat production also helps maintain a

<!-- chunk -->

## stable inner environment by regulating the water and electrolyte

<!-- chunk -->

## balance in the body, and in this way it works hand in hand with

<!-- chunk -->

## the kidneys.

<!-- chunk -->

### Skin has 3 layers: the epidermis,

<!-- chunk -->

### dermis and sub-cutaneous tissue. The

<!-- chunk -->

### hypodermis connects the skin to

<!-- chunk -->

### muscle and bone.

<!-- chunk -->

## The skin is also a sense organ, richly endowed with nerve

<!-- chunk -->

## endings which relay messages to the brain about sensations from

<!-- chunk -->

## the environment, heat or cold, pleasure or pain. It can be a useful

<!-- chunk -->

## diagnostic tool, reflecting the effect of our outer environment as

<!-- chunk -->

## well as our inner state physically and emotionally. When we are

<!-- chunk -->

## healthy our skin glows, when unwell it may look sallow. When

<!-- chunk -->

## stressed or anxious it can looked pale and pinched, when happy

<!-- chunk -->

## and carefree it has a rosy lustre. Rashes and eczema may be

<!-- chunk -->

## related to contact with outside allergens, micro organisms,

<!-- chunk -->

## chemicals, sunlight, pollutants or poor diet, or may be related to

<!-- chunk -->

## emotional problems like anxiety or grief.

<!-- chunk -->

## The skin's resilience to external and internal disturbance

<!-- chunk -->

## depends to some extent on the nutrients brought to the skin by

<!-- chunk -->

## the underlying blood vessels which also need to remove the

<!-- chunk -->

## waste products of metabolism. A healthy skin will not allow

<!-- chunk -->

## infection to proliferate because its local immune mechanisms

<!-- chunk -->

## work well, but impaired skin function will allow infection to

<!-- chunk -->

## spread, unable to rally its defences sufficiently to resolve the

<!-- chunk -->

## infection without outside help. To maintain good blood flow to

<!-- chunk -->

## the skin, it is important to take regular exercise and avoid

<!-- chunk -->

## smoking, since it causes constriction of blood vessels and

<!-- chunk -->

## prevents the flow of blood, oxygen and nutrients to the skin.

<!-- chunk -->

## To keep your skin healthy, eat a well-balanced diet that

<!-- chunk -->

## includes plenty of protein, essential fatty acids, particularly

<!-- chunk -->

## omega-3 from oily fish and flax seeds and antioxidants from

<!-- chunk -->

## fresh organic fruit and vegetables. Deficiencies of certain

<!-- chunk -->

## minerals, vitamins and trace elements and an excess of junk

<!-- chunk -->

## foods that create a state of toxicity can impair the skin's resilience

<!-- chunk -->

## and predispose to a number of skin disorders. Herbs can perform

<!-- chunk -->

## vital roles of increasing blood flow to the skin, providing vital

<!-- chunk -->

## nutrients, helping to clear the toxins, heat and infection that give

<!-- chunk -->

## rise to a variety of skin problems.

# Herpes

<!-- chunk -->

## Herpes simplex comes in two forms, cold sores that generally

<!-- chunk -->

## appear around the mouth (HSV-1) and genital Herpes (HSV-2).

<!-- chunk -->

## In the past, it was thought that HSV-2 was responsible for

<!-- chunk -->

## causing most genital Herpes infections, but today an increasing

<!-- chunk -->

## proportion of these are due to HSV-1, which causes cold sores

<!-- chunk -->

## on the lips or mouth as it can be spread to the genital area.

<!-- chunk -->

## This highly contagious virus is a relative of chicken pox and

<!-- chunk -->

## Epstein-Barr virus and Herpes zoster, which causes shingles.

<!-- chunk -->

## Once infected, the virus remains dormant but erupts when

<!-- chunk -->

## immunity is lowered by stress, poor diet, infections such as colds

<!-- chunk -->

## and exposure to sun, wind and cold.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Adaptogenic herbs shatavari, aloe vera, Chinese angelica,

<!-- chunk -->

## shiitake and reishi mushrooms and gotu kola can be taken long

<!-- chunk -->

## term to strengthen immunity and help prevent outbreaks.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Effective antiviral herbs include lemon balm, calendula,

<!-- chunk -->

## oregano, thyme, cat's claw, lavender, St John's wort, echinacea

<!-- chunk -->

## and liquorice.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Other good antivirals include bearberry, golden seal, olive

<!-- chunk -->

## leaf, andrographis, pau d'arco, garlic, neem, Oregon grape,

<!-- chunk -->

## and wild indigo.

<!-- chunk -->

## • When outbreaks occur these can be taken every 2 hours and

<!-- chunk -->

## used externally also.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Fresh bruised leaves of lemon balm can be applied or used in

<!-- chunk -->

## infusion to bathe the area. Melissa oil, aloe vera gel, or a black

<!-- chunk -->

## teabag can also be applied directly.


<!-- chunk -->

## A diet low in the amino acid arginine, which can activate the

<!-- chunk -->

## virus, and high in lysine, which can suppress it, is recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Supplements of vitamin C, zinc and quercetin also help combat

<!-- chunk -->

## the Herpes virus.

# Eczema

<!-- chunk -->

## Eczema is a systemic problem, not simply an external irritation.

<!-- chunk -->

## An allergic reaction to foods such as gluten and dairy or other

<!-- chunk -->

## external irritants such as animal dander and house dust mites is

<!-- chunk -->

## often involved. The local immune mechanisms in the skin may

<!-- chunk -->

## be put under pressure by underuse of the other eliminative

<!-- chunk -->

## pathways, the bowels and kidneys, or immunity may be lowered

<!-- chunk -->

## by dietary deficiencies, chronic toxicity, poor digestion,

<!-- chunk -->

## dysbiosis and stress. Adverse drug reactions and chemical

<!-- chunk -->

## irritants such as washing powder can also be implicated.


<!-- chunk -->

## • To soothe the allergic response, use antihistamines chamomile,

<!-- chunk -->

## yarrow, feverfew, nettles, biakal skullcap or lemon balm.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Adaptogenic herbs aswagandha, guduchi, amalaki, shizandra,

<!-- chunk -->

## liquorice, shiitake and reishi mushroom, aloe vera and ginseng

<!-- chunk -->

## all increase general immunity and improve resilience to stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Antimicrobial herbs to combat unfriendly gut microorganisms

<!-- chunk -->

## that can be implicated in allergies can be used, including pau

<!-- chunk -->

## d'arco, neem, andrographis, chamomile, burdock and turmeric.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Gentle relaxants chamomile, passion flower, skullcap, vervain,

<!-- chunk -->

## lavender and rosemary help reduce tension and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Alterative herbs are cleaning and support the liver's

<!-- chunk -->

## detoxifying work, taking the strain off the skin. Burdock, red

<!-- chunk -->

## clover, cleavers, neem, dandelion, globe artichoke, milk thistle

<!-- chunk -->

## and aloe vera help clear heat and inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Creams or oils containing chamomile, evening primrose oil,

<!-- chunk -->

## calendula, chickweed or lavender, or aloe vera gel can soothe


<!-- chunk -->

## Probiotics help replace beneficial gut flora.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Evening primrose seed oil will provide GLA, which is often

<!-- chunk -->

## deficient in eczema sufferers.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Vitamins A, B, C, and E, zinc magnesium, calcium, and iron

<!-- chunk -->

## are also helpful.

# Acne

<!-- chunk -->

## Overactive sebaceous glands due to hormonal changes during

<!-- chunk -->

## adolescence make the skin oily. The sebum blocks hair follicles,

<!-- chunk -->

## causing them to become inflamed and infected, and producing

<!-- chunk -->

## the characteristic blackheads and spots. Acne can also be

<!-- chunk -->

## indicative of food intolerances, particularly to dairy produce,

<!-- chunk -->

## junk foods (especially sugar), nutritional deficiencies, toxicity,

<!-- chunk -->

## dysbiosis, and stressed adrenals.


<!-- chunk -->

## • It is important to support the liver and bowels in their

<!-- chunk -->

## detoxifying work in order to take the load off the skin as an

<!-- chunk -->

## eliminative organ, and prevent a build up of hormones in the

<!-- chunk -->

## body. Burdock, milk thistle, dandelion root, red clover,

<!-- chunk -->

## guduchi, cleavers, liquorice and dock are all suitable.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For constipation take 1–2 teaspoons of linseeds or psyllium

<!-- chunk -->

## seeds, soaked in a little warm water, before bed.

<!-- chunk -->

## • To clear the skin use antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs like echinacea, neem, myrrh, turmeric, amalaki, Oregon

<!-- chunk -->

## grape, and wild indigo.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Other cleansing herbs include nettles, bringaraj, aloe vera, pau

<!-- chunk -->

## d'arco, cat's claw, wild pansy and andrographis.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Useful hormone balancing herbs are vitex, wild yaw, evening

<!-- chunk -->

## primrose oil and saw palmetto.


<!-- chunk -->

## Try to leave the skin alone, clean it daily with rose water, apply

<!-- chunk -->

## infusions of marigold, elderflower or lavender afterwards and

<!-- chunk -->

## never squeeze pimples.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Once the skin has cleared of spots, apply use a few drops of

<!-- chunk -->

## either neroli or lavender oil in aqueous cream or vitamin E cream

<!-- chunk -->

## to heal the scars.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Avoid fatty foods, dairy produce, chocolate, alcohol, sweets,

<!-- chunk -->

## red meats, iodine-rich foods, tea and coffee.

<!-- chunk -->

### Burdock helps to clear inflamed skin.

# Urticaria/Hives

<!-- chunk -->

## An allergic skin condition causing an itchy rash looking like a

<!-- chunk -->

## nettle sting, urticaria is linked to underlying problems including

<!-- chunk -->

## intestinal parasites, dysbiosis, poor liver function and lowered

<!-- chunk -->

## immunity. It can be triggered by food allergies, for example to

<!-- chunk -->

## citrus fruits, dairy, strawberries, chocolate, tomatoes, shell fish,

<!-- chunk -->

## foods high in salicylates, nuts and artificial colourings, or contact

<!-- chunk -->

## with substances like animal dander, pollen, chemicals, insect

<!-- chunk -->

## stings and drugs. It can be aggravated by cold, heat, exercise and

<!-- chunk -->

## sunlight.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Alterative herbs burdock, Oregon grape, barberry, dandelion

<!-- chunk -->

## root, chickweed, cleavers, neem, guduchi, calendula and blue

<!-- chunk -->

## flag taken internally clear toxins from the body and support

<!-- chunk -->

## the liver. Strong teas of these can be added to baths or used to

<!-- chunk -->

## bathe the skin.

<!-- chunk -->

## • 25mls of aloe vera juice in the morning and evening also

<!-- chunk -->

## clears toxins and enhances immunity, and the gel is soothing

<!-- chunk -->

## applied to the skin.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Useful herbs with antihistamine actions, turmeric, ginger,

<!-- chunk -->

## liquorice, nettles, yarrow, chamomile, lemon balm, baikal

<!-- chunk -->

## skullcap or feverfew can be taken to reduce the allergic

<!-- chunk -->

## reaction.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Echinacea, golden seal, gotu kola, bringaraj, manjishta,

<!-- chunk -->

## schizandra, coriander, red clover or rose can also be taken to

<!-- chunk -->

## clear heat and reduce inflammation.


<!-- chunk -->

## Supplements of evening primrose oil and quercitrin reduce

<!-- chunk -->

## inflammation and enhance immunity.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Probiotics and oregano oil capsules taken separately help

<!-- chunk -->

## resolve dysbiosis.

# Infections of the Skin

<!-- chunk -->

## A variety of microorganisms can invade the skin. Boils and

<!-- chunk -->

## abscesses arise from infections of the hair roots and sweat glands

<!-- chunk -->

## caused by Staphylococcus bacteria and dead white corpuscles.

<!-- chunk -->

## Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection that starts as a

<!-- chunk -->

## rash of small blisters and then forms yellow scabs around the

<!-- chunk -->

## lips, nose and ears. It can develop as a secondary infection on the

<!-- chunk -->

## skin where it is already disturbed as in eczema, scabies and cold

<!-- chunk -->

## sores. Ringworm or athlete's foot is a contagious fungal

<!-- chunk -->

## infection, which spreads in warm, moist condition such as

<!-- chunk -->

## around swimming pools and in bathrooms, and can be resilient

<!-- chunk -->

## to treatment. Caused by tiny mites burrowing into the skin,

<!-- chunk -->

## scabies is an intensely itchy condition and highly contagious.

<!-- chunk -->

## When the eggs hatch they can be passed on easily by direct

<!-- chunk -->

## contact or from bed linen, clothing (where they can survive for

<!-- chunk -->

## about 2 weeks) or from pets.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Echinacea, marigold, thyme, sage, pau d'arco, cat's claw, wild

<!-- chunk -->

## indigo, or turmeric, are useful antimicrobial herbs to take to

<!-- chunk -->

## enhance immunity and combat infection.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Garlic is excreted via the pores, disinfecting the skin as it

<!-- chunk -->

## goes.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Cleavers, nettles, chickweed, dandelion, burdock, milk thistle

<!-- chunk -->

## and red clover help clear heat and toxins from the system that

<!-- chunk -->

## predispose to infection and boost immunity.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Externally, hot poultices of marshmallow or burdock with

<!-- chunk -->

## antiseptic oils of lavender or thyme will bring boils to a head.

<!-- chunk -->

## Infected skin ban be bathed with warm teas of marigold,

<!-- chunk -->

## myrrh, golden seal, echinacea, cat's claw, or neem, or dilute

<!-- chunk -->

## oils of lavender, rosemary or peppermint

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: Repeated attacks of boils indicate a run-down condition

<!-- chunk -->

## that requires further investigation and could be sign of diabetes.

# Warts and Verrucae

<!-- chunk -->

## Warts are small growths composed of dead cells and caused by a

<!-- chunk -->

## virus (HPV or human papilloma virus). They are spread easily

<!-- chunk -->

## by direct contact or in wet places, for example in bathrooms and

<!-- chunk -->

## around swimming pools, and are most common on the hands

<!-- chunk -->

## and feet, where they are called plantar warts or verrucae. They

<!-- chunk -->

## also occur around the genitals and in women can predispose to

<!-- chunk -->

## cervical dysplasia (precancerous changes in the cervix). The

<!-- chunk -->

## development of warts, especially when several occur at a time,

<!-- chunk -->

## indicates lowered immunity, and it is important to treat the

<!-- chunk -->

## problem systemically as well as locally.

<!-- chunk -->

### Greater celandine encourages the skin

<!-- chunk -->

### to heal, and its enzymes dissolve

<!-- chunk -->

### warts.


<!-- chunk -->

## • The most successful remedy is fresh juice of greater celandine

<!-- chunk -->

## (Chelidonium majus) applied twice daily.

<!-- chunk -->

## • The white juice from the fresh dandelion, fresh elderberry

<!-- chunk -->

## juice, aloe vera juice, fresh lemon balm, garlic, ginger or olive

<!-- chunk -->

## leaf preparations can be applied to the warts.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Immune-enhancing and antiviral herbs lemon balm, wild

<!-- chunk -->

## indigo, St John's wort, pau d'arco, cat's claw, aloe vera,

<!-- chunk -->

## barberry, garlic, echinacea and olive leaf help combat the


<!-- chunk -->

## • Burdock, cleavers, dandelion root, blue flag, red clover and

<!-- chunk -->

## poke root help clear toxins from the system and are indicated

<!-- chunk -->

## in most skin problems.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: Seek medical attention if a wart grows or changes

<!-- chunk -->

## suddenly as it may indicate skin cancer.

# Psoriasis

<!-- chunk -->

## A complex auto-immune skin problem, psoriasis speeds up the

<!-- chunk -->

## normal growth and renewal of skin cells by 5–10 times and

<!-- chunk -->

## produces the build up of scaly patches which can appear almost

<!-- chunk -->

## anywhere on the body. It can affect fingernails, leaving them

<!-- chunk -->

## discoloured, pitted or split and is sometimes associated with

<!-- chunk -->

## polyarthritis. It may be hereditary or triggered by excess alcohol,

<!-- chunk -->

## sunburn, skin injury, a Streptococcal throat infection, stress or

<!-- chunk -->

## shock and can be improved by sunlight and visits to the Dead

<!-- chunk -->

## Sea. Food allergies, incomplete protein digestion, disturbances of

<!-- chunk -->

## the gut flora, poor liver function and nutritional deficiencies can

<!-- chunk -->

## also play a part.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Herbs containing psoralens such as angelica, wild carrot,

<!-- chunk -->

## celery seed, and fennel can help clear the skin especially in

<!-- chunk -->

## combination with sun bathing.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Antioxidant herbs like Oregon grape, barberry, golden seal, or

<!-- chunk -->

## gotu kola reduce free radical damage to the skin and decrease


<!-- chunk -->

## • Alkaloids in Oregon grape root slow the proliferation of skin

<!-- chunk -->

## cells.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Milk thistle and coleus can also slow down the growth of skin

<!-- chunk -->

## cells.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Sarsaparilla, honeysuckle, boswellia, raw rehmannia root,

<!-- chunk -->

## neem, turmeric, evening primrose oil and paeony are other

<!-- chunk -->

## good anti-inflammatories. To aid the liver in its detoxifying

<!-- chunk -->

## work, use burdock, yellow dock, red clover, turmeric or

<!-- chunk -->

## dandelion. Guggulu is also excellent.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Externally, creams containing chamomile, liquorice, turmeric,

<!-- chunk -->

## lavender oil, evening primrose oil, aloe vera juice, Oregon

<!-- chunk -->

## grape, capsaicin from cayenne, or oats can relieve discomfort.


<!-- chunk -->

## Supplements of omega-3 essential fatty acids, vitamin A and zinc

<!-- chunk -->

## are recommended.

# The Eyes

# Often described as the “gateway to the soul”, our

# eyes are one of the sense organs and clearly

# express emotions like joy, excitement and

# happiness as well as fear, anxiety, anger, grief,

# and suffering. As such they convey much about

# our state of health both physically and mentally.

<!-- chunk -->

## The white, opaque part of the eye is the sclera which protects the

<!-- chunk -->

## eye and serves as an attachment for the muscles that move it.

<!-- chunk -->

## Light passes through the transparent cornea, which is like a dome

<!-- chunk -->

## at the front of the eye, under which is the iris and pupil. The iris

<!-- chunk -->

## is the coloured part of the eye which is composed of muscles that

<!-- chunk -->

## govern the amount of light that enters it, while the pupil is the

<!-- chunk -->

## hole that lets light pass through into the back of the eye. The

<!-- chunk -->

## aqueous humour is the fluid between the lens and cornea and the

<!-- chunk -->

## vitreous humour is the fluid in the major part of the eyeball. The

<!-- chunk -->

## crystalline lens behind the pupil focuses light onto the retina,

<!-- chunk -->

## which is composed of thousands of tiny structures known as

<!-- chunk -->

## rods and cones, which are responsible for conveying messages

<!-- chunk -->

## via the optic nerve to the brain, and ultimately results in vision.

<!-- chunk -->

## Light also influences our physical health, and mental and

<!-- chunk -->

## emotional state. Sunlight entering the eye stimulates the secretion

<!-- chunk -->

## of endorphins by the pineal gland and these give us a feeling of

<!-- chunk -->

## well-being. During the winter months in the Northern

<!-- chunk -->

## Hemisphere the many hours of darkness can predispose to

<!-- chunk -->

## seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and reduced resistance to

<!-- chunk -->

## infection, so it is important to spend time outside in sunlight,

<!-- chunk -->

## even on a dull day.

<!-- chunk -->

## The production of tears and crying is another important

<!-- chunk -->

## function of the eyes. Tears contain endorphins, which are opiate-

<!-- chunk -->

## like substances that help us to release emotional pain and tension

<!-- chunk -->

## and calm us down. In addition, tears washed constantly in tiny

<!-- chunk -->

## amounts across the eyes protect them from damage and help

<!-- chunk -->

## clear away debris. The inner and outer surfaces of each eye are

<!-- chunk -->

## covered with the delicate conjunctiva lubricated by tears which

<!-- chunk -->

## drain into the channels passing into the nose. The eyelids also

<!-- chunk -->

## protect the eyes.

<!-- chunk -->

## There are certain nutrients which are vital to eye health. Lutein

<!-- chunk -->

## and zeaxanthin are antioxidant carotenoids found in dark, green,

<!-- chunk -->

## leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, squash, peas, broccoli,

<!-- chunk -->

## corn and eggs. It helps protect the eyes from oxidative stress and

<!-- chunk -->

## high-energy light. It is found in the macula, a small area of the

<!-- chunk -->

## retina responsible for central vision, and a diet rich in lutein helps

<!-- chunk -->

## to prevent cataracts and macular degeneration as we get older.

<!-- chunk -->

## Essential fatty acids including omega-3 from fatty fish, walnuts,

<!-- chunk -->

## soya beans and flax seeds are also vital. High levels of

<!-- chunk -->

## antioxidant vitamins A, C and E can reduce the risk of cataracts

<!-- chunk -->

## and also play a role in delaying age-related macular

<!-- chunk -->

## degeneration. Copper found in mixed nuts, sunflower seeds,

<!-- chunk -->

## liver, beans and lentils is another antioxidant that has a specific

<!-- chunk -->

## relevance to the eyes. Red meat and poultry contain a good level

<!-- chunk -->

## of zinc. Zinc found in oysters, fortified cereals, nuts, beans, red

<!-- chunk -->

## meat and poultry is also important to eye health and the

<!-- chunk -->

## maintenance of good vision through macular function.

<!-- chunk -->

## Elderberries and bilberries are rich in antioxidants, known as

<!-- chunk -->

## anthocyanocides, and help to protect the eyes. Anthocyanocides

<!-- chunk -->

## contain or boost the action of a molecule known as glutathione, a

<!-- chunk -->

## key antioxidant found in the aqueous humour and necessary for

<!-- chunk -->

## prevention of a variety of eye problems, including cataracts, in

<!-- chunk -->

## later life. They help support the repair and synthesis of new

<!-- chunk -->

## capillaries and are used to improve night vision and treat

<!-- chunk -->

## disorders of the retina. Other herbs with a similar action include

<!-- chunk -->

## astragalus root, milk thistle seed, turmeric root, and garlic. The

<!-- chunk -->

## eyelids and conjunctiva are prone to various problems which can

<!-- chunk -->

## be successfully treated using herbs including chamomile,

<!-- chunk -->

## calendula, marshmallow and elderflowers.

# Conjunctivitis, Blepharitis and Sties

<!-- chunk -->

## In conjunctivitis the lining of the eye becomes irritated by

<!-- chunk -->

## infection, allergies such as hay fever and rhinitis, dust or

<!-- chunk -->

## pollution in the atmosphere, and the eye becomes red, inflamed,

<!-- chunk -->

## and often weepy. In blepharitis the eyelids become red and

<!-- chunk -->

## inflamed, often indicating depleted immunity, a toxic system or

<!-- chunk -->

## allergy. Sties are inflammations or infections of the glands at the

<!-- chunk -->

## base of the eyelashes that tend to occur when you are run down

<!-- chunk -->

## or tired.


<!-- chunk -->

## • To soothe irritated and inflamed eyes, infusions of astringent

<!-- chunk -->

## and antiseptic herbs eyebright, calendula, chamomile,

<!-- chunk -->

## elderflower and rose can be taken internally and used to bathe

<!-- chunk -->

## the eyes.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Always use a sterilized eyebath and don't use the same

<!-- chunk -->

## solution for both eyes. Black tea is a useful remedy to bathe

<!-- chunk -->

## the eyes, or a warm chamomile tea bag over each eye for 10–

<!-- chunk -->

## 15 minutes.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Warm infusions of eyebright, chamomile, elderflowers,

<!-- chunk -->

## plantain or calendula can be applied as compresses.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Antimicrobial herbs echinacea, golden seal, pau d'arco,

<!-- chunk -->

## burdock, red clover or liquorice can be taken internally to

<!-- chunk -->

## combat infection, boost immunity and detoxify the system.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Chamomile, nettles, lemon balm, yarrow, feverfew and baikal

<!-- chunk -->

## skullcap have antihistamine actions which relieve allergic eye

<!-- chunk -->

## conditions.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Eye

<!-- chunk -->

### Each eye is protected by an eyebrow,

<!-- chunk -->

### eyelashes and eyelid, while tear ducts

<!-- chunk -->

### produce a fluid that keeps the eye

<!-- chunk -->

### moist and free from infection. The

<!-- chunk -->

### eye's movement is controlled by

<!-- chunk -->

### pairs of extrinsic eye muscles.


<!-- chunk -->

## Chronic conjunctivitis and blepharitis often respond well to

<!-- chunk -->

## omitting dairy products, tea and coffee from the diet.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Taking supplements of evening primrose oil, probiotics and

<!-- chunk -->

## vitamins C and B can also be helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB. All teas used to bathe eyes should be prepared as

<!-- chunk -->

## decoctions and simmered for 10 minutes to make sure they are

<!-- chunk -->

## sterilized.

# Eye Disorders

<!-- chunk -->

## The tendency to eye problems including cataracts, glaucoma and

<!-- chunk -->

## macular degeneration increases with age, largely due to free

<!-- chunk -->

## radical damage which is increased by smoking, stress and drugs

<!-- chunk -->

## such as steroids. Damage to the retina associated with diabetes,

<!-- chunk -->

## and atherosclerosis and inflammatory eye conditions, including

<!-- chunk -->

## episcleritis and iritis, can also respond to herbal treatment.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Foods and herbs rich in antioxidants can improve blood flow

<!-- chunk -->

## to the eyes and prevent degenerative eye conditions.

<!-- chunk -->

## Antioxidant herbs include bilberries, elderberries, hawthorn

<!-- chunk -->

## berries, rosemary, thyme, sage, oregano, kelp, self heal,

<!-- chunk -->

## rehmania, shatavari, amalaki, ashwagandha, ginkgo and cat's

<!-- chunk -->

## claw.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Grape seed extract strengthens blood vessels within the eye

<!-- chunk -->

## and inhibits macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Coleus increases circulation within the eye and decreases

<!-- chunk -->

## intra-occular pressure in glaucoma.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Rosemary, ginkgo, eyebright, vervain, and peppermint

<!-- chunk -->

## increase the circulation to and from the eye.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Pasque flower and chamomile can be taken for painful

<!-- chunk -->

## inflammatory eye conditions such as scleritis and iritis.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Turmeric, paeony root, boswellia, gentian, dandelion root and

<!-- chunk -->

## amalaki are also helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Tepid chamomile tea bags laid on the eyes for 10-15 minutes

<!-- chunk -->

## can bring swift relief to pain.


<!-- chunk -->

## Foods containing vitamins A, B and C and supplements of

<!-- chunk -->

<!-- chunk -->

## and help prevent macular degeneration and cataracts.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: Seek medical attention immediately if you experience eye

<!-- chunk -->

## pain or sudden changes in vision.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rose, prepared as an infusion, makes

<!-- chunk -->

### a soothing eyebath for sore or

<!-- chunk -->

### inflamed eyes.

# Mouth and Gum Problems

# Good oral hygiene and a healthy immune system

# The Hormonal System

# The hormonal or endocrine system is a system of

# chemical messaging. Its purpose is

# communication and coordinating many different

# functions of the body which enable homeostasis,

# i.e. maintaining the stable state within the body

# which is vital for health. These include tissue

# function, metabolism and the production of

# energy, reproduction, mood, growth and

# development.

<!-- chunk -->

## These huge feats are accomplished via a network of endocrine

<!-- chunk -->

## glands and organs that produce, store, and secrete hormones as

<!-- chunk -->

## they are required by the body. They work in conjunction with the

<!-- chunk -->

## nervous system, reproductive system, kidneys, gut, liver and

<!-- chunk -->

## pancreas. Hormones are special chemicals that are manufactured

<!-- chunk -->

## by one cell or a group of cells and carried in the bloodstream to

<!-- chunk -->

## specific targets, which may be organs, tissues, or cells. Different

<!-- chunk -->

## types of hormones cause different effects on other cells or tissues

<!-- chunk -->

## of the body. Endocrine glands are located in many regions of the

<!-- chunk -->

## body, and include the hypothalamus, which controls the pituitary

<!-- chunk -->

## or master gland, and which in turn controls the other glands

<!-- chunk -->

## which include the thyroid, parathyroid, thymus and adrenal

<!-- chunk -->

## glands, the pancreas, the ovaries and testis.

<!-- chunk -->

## For healthy functioning of our endocrine system, the glands

<!-- chunk -->

## need to work correctly, the blood needs to carry hormones

<!-- chunk -->

## efficiently to their target points, and the receptor sites on the

<!-- chunk -->

## target cells need to respond properly for the hormones to enter

<!-- chunk -->

## the cells and do their work. Too much or too little of any of the

<!-- chunk -->

## hormones secreted by these glands can cause disruption in the

<!-- chunk -->

## body. For example too much growth hormone from the pituitary

<!-- chunk -->

## gland will mean you grow excessively tall. Too little and you will

<!-- chunk -->

## be very short. Too little insulin from the pancreas causes

<!-- chunk -->

## diabetes. Excess thyroid hormones cause an increase in

<!-- chunk -->

## metabolism which imposes a strain on the nervous system and

<!-- chunk -->

## heart, while low thyroid function causes lethargy and weight

<!-- chunk -->

## problems. Imbalances of reproductive hormones cause a wide

<!-- chunk -->

## range of menstrual, sexual and gynaecological problems and

<!-- chunk -->

## influence fertility. Such hormonal imbalances may be caused by

<!-- chunk -->

## problems with cell receptor sites, problems regulating the

<!-- chunk -->

## hormones in the blood stream, or the body may have difficulty

<!-- chunk -->

## controlling hormone levels due to poor breakdown and excretion

<!-- chunk -->

## of hormones from the body due to low liver or kidney function.

<!-- chunk -->

## For our hormonal system to function well we need to eat a

<!-- chunk -->

## healthy diet, with plenty of essential fatty acids, minerals,

<!-- chunk -->

## particularly magnesium, trace elements and antioxidant nutrients

<!-- chunk -->

## including beta carotene, zinc, selenium, and vitamins B, C, and

<!-- chunk -->

## E. Stress, coffee and alcohol and nutritional deficiencies can

<!-- chunk -->

## significantly disrupt hormonal balance. Herbs such as liquorice

<!-- chunk -->

## and echinacea support the thymus gland in its immune work;

<!-- chunk -->

## bladderwrack and ashwagandha influence the thyroid; vitex

<!-- chunk -->

## helps to regulate the pituitary gland; liquorice, wild yam and

<!-- chunk -->

## ginsengs influence the adrenals; wild yam, black cohosh, vitex,

<!-- chunk -->

## shatavari, ashwagandha and ginseng all help regulate

<!-- chunk -->

## reproductive hormones. Bitter herbs such as dandelion root, milk

<!-- chunk -->

## thistle and burdock help the liver's breakdown of hormones so

<!-- chunk -->

## they are excreted from the body once they have done their work.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Endocrine System

<!-- chunk -->

### The endocrine glands produce

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones, the “chemical

<!-- chunk -->

### messengers”, and release them into

<!-- chunk -->

### the bloodstream. Endocrine glands

<!-- chunk -->

### include the pituitary, thyroid,

<!-- chunk -->

### parathyroid and adrenal glands, as

<!-- chunk -->

### well as the ovaries, the testes, part of

<!-- chunk -->

### the pancreas and the placenta.

# Premenstrual Syndrome

<!-- chunk -->

## The familiar physical, mental and emotional symptoms of PMS

<!-- chunk -->

## in the second half of the cycle are generally linked to excess

<!-- chunk -->

## oestrogen in relation to progesterone. Environmental toxins from

<!-- chunk -->

## plastics, PCBs, and pesticides that mimic oestrogen in the body,

<!-- chunk -->

## oestrogen residues in tap water and meat as well as the liver's

<!-- chunk -->

## inability to break down oestrogen, all disrupts normal hormone

<!-- chunk -->

## balance. Deficiencies of nutrients, particularly magnesium, B

<!-- chunk -->

## complex, zinc and essential fatty acids are often responsible also.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Vitex is the best known herb to increase progesterone and is

<!-- chunk -->

## generally taken as a tincture – half a tsp half an hour before

<!-- chunk -->

## breakfast.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Adaptogenic herbs wild yam, liquorice, ashwagandha,

<!-- chunk -->

## shatavai, Chinese angelica, and black cohosh are rich in

<!-- chunk -->

## steroidal saponins and increase resilience to stress and balance

<!-- chunk -->

## hormones. Nervines to stabilise emotions include wild oats,

<!-- chunk -->

## skullcap, chamomile, gotu kola, bringaraj and motherwort.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Liver herbs such as burdock, dandelion, guduchi, milk thistle,

<!-- chunk -->

## barberry and dock are important to help the breakdown of

<!-- chunk -->

## hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Diuretic herbs cleavers, dandelion, corn silk, fennel,

<!-- chunk -->

## coriander, celery and wild carrot will help relieve fluid

<!-- chunk -->

## retention, bloating and breast discomfort.


<!-- chunk -->

## Evening primrose oil and supplements of calcium, magnesium,

<!-- chunk -->

## vitamin E, and B complex can significantly relieve PMS

<!-- chunk -->

## symptoms.

# Menstrual Problems

<!-- chunk -->

## Menstrual problems are largely due to hormone imbalances and

<!-- chunk -->

## nutritional deficiencies. Irregular or absent periods are also

<!-- chunk -->

## associated with intense exercise, nutritional deficiency, sudden

<!-- chunk -->

## weight loss, drugs, and psychological stress or shock. Other

<!-- chunk -->

## endocrine disorders can be involved. Painful periods are related

<!-- chunk -->

## to poor circulation, stress, overwork and muscular tension, lack

<!-- chunk -->

## of exercise, bad posture and caffeine. Heavy periods can be

<!-- chunk -->

## caused by fibroids, polyps, thyroid problems, uterine congestion,

<!-- chunk -->

## and perimenopause.


<!-- chunk -->

## • To regulate hormones use vitex, wild yam, Chinese angelica

<!-- chunk -->

## or shatavari with liquorice and evening primrose oil.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Combine these with liver herbs like burdock, holy thistle,

<!-- chunk -->

## Oregon grape or dandelion to aid the breakdown of hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For intense cramps with scanty bleeding, cramp bark, black

<!-- chunk -->

## haw, motherwort, pasque flower, and black cohosh are

<!-- chunk -->

## excellent taken every 2 hours when necessary.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For associated tension add valerian, passion flower,

<!-- chunk -->

## chamomile or hops.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Rub oils of chamomile, lavender or rosemary gently into the

<!-- chunk -->

## abdomen.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For heavy bleeding astringent herbs like beth root, yarrow,

<!-- chunk -->

## periwinkle, lady's mantle, agrimony, bearberry, rehmania,

<!-- chunk -->

## bayberry, and rose can be taken 3–6 times daily as required.

<!-- chunk -->

## Iron containing foods and herbs like nettle, coriander leaf,

<!-- chunk -->

## codonopsis, amalaki, kelp and dock help combat anaemia.


<!-- chunk -->

## Avoid caffeine, alcohol, refined and junk foods.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Take supplements of vitamin C, B complex, zinc and

<!-- chunk -->

## magnesium.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Take regular exercise.

# Benign Breast Problems

<!-- chunk -->

## Benign mammary dysplasia (BMD) (also known as fibrocystic

<!-- chunk -->

## breast disease or cyclical mastalgia) is characterized by breast

<!-- chunk -->

## lumps and tenderness, which fluctuates through the menstrual

<!-- chunk -->

## cycle, usually worst when premenstrual. It is related to oestrogen

<!-- chunk -->

## levels, deficiencies of selenium, and aggravated by the

<!-- chunk -->

## methlyxanthines in coffee, tea, chocolate and cola. Thyroid

<!-- chunk -->

## hormones help the liver's metabolism of oestrogen and low

<!-- chunk -->

## thyroid levels are related to high blood oestrogen levels. Excess

<!-- chunk -->

## dietary fat, dairy produce, refined carbohydrates, constipation,

<!-- chunk -->

## and stress are also contributory factors. Mastitis involves

<!-- chunk -->

## infection in the breast that occurs when breastfeeding.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chaste tree is renowned for its ability

<!-- chunk -->

### to balance hormones through its

<!-- chunk -->

### action on the pituitary or master

<!-- chunk -->

### gland.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Hormone balancing herbs vitex, wild yam, Chinese angelica,

<!-- chunk -->

## saw palmetto, shatavari or liquorice can help normalise breast

<!-- chunk -->

## tissue.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Liver remedies burdock, dandelion, holy thistle, milk thistle,

<!-- chunk -->

## and gentian aid the liver's metabolism of oestrogen.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Cleavers, dandelion root, blue flag, calendula and poke root

<!-- chunk -->

## stimulate lymphatic drainage from the breast and reduce lumps

<!-- chunk -->

## and infection.

<!-- chunk -->

## • If breasts are particularly painful add analgesic and the

<!-- chunk -->

## hormone balancer black cohosh.

<!-- chunk -->

## • To regulate the thyroid gland kelp and guggulu are

<!-- chunk -->

## recommended.


<!-- chunk -->

## Supplements of evening primrose oil, magnesium, vitamins B6,

<!-- chunk -->

## B12 and E are helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Use dilute oils of lavender, fennel or rose, or castor oil for

<!-- chunk -->

## daily breast massage.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: It is important to investigate further any breast problems.

# Vaginal Infections

<!-- chunk -->

## The delicate environment of pH and flora of the vagina can be

<!-- chunk -->

## disturbed by hormonal imbalances, antibiotics, stress, poor diet,

<!-- chunk -->

## the pill, pregnancy, post menopausal changes and diabetes, and

<!-- chunk -->

## becomes susceptible to inflammation and infection. Yeast

<!-- chunk -->

## infections (thrush) are most common and tend to be related to

<!-- chunk -->

## gut dysbiosis. Trichomonas, gardenerella, HPV (vaginal warts),

<!-- chunk -->

## Herpes and bacterial vaginiosis (common after menopause) can

<!-- chunk -->

## also occur.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Antimicrobial herbs to combat infection include calendula,

<!-- chunk -->

## golden seal, thyme, chamomile, lavender, pau d'arco, neem,

<!-- chunk -->

## turmeric, echinacea or oregano which can be taken internally.

<!-- chunk -->

## They can also be used locally in creams, douches, sitz baths

<!-- chunk -->

## and lotions in which tampons can be soaked and inserted for

<!-- chunk -->

## half an hour, morning and night.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Garlic is a great antimicrobial for internal and external use,

<!-- chunk -->

## active against bacterial, viral and fungal infections like thrush.

<!-- chunk -->

## Peel a clove carefully without nicking it, wrap it in clean gauze

<!-- chunk -->

## and insert for 6 consecutive nights.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Alternatively, add a teaspoon of fresh garlic juice to a few

<!-- chunk -->

## tablespoons of yogurt, soak a tampon in it or use as a douche

<!-- chunk -->

## twice daily.

<!-- chunk -->

## • If the area is sore and inflamed sitting in a bowl of chamomile

<!-- chunk -->

## tea is wonderfully relieving. These herbs will resolve infection

<!-- chunk -->

## in the vagina and more systemic problems of toxicity and

<!-- chunk -->

## dysbiosis.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Immune enhancing herbs like ashwagandha, shatavari,

<!-- chunk -->

## guduchi, amalaki and shizandra can be taken after infection to

<!-- chunk -->

## prevent further problems.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Hormone balancing herbs vitex, sage, wild yam or sage can

<!-- chunk -->

## be used for post-menopausal infections.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gentian stimulates the gall bladder

<!-- chunk -->

### and liver, and helps the liver process

<!-- chunk -->

### oestrogen.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: Seek medical attention if you suspect sexually transmitted


# Endometriosis

<!-- chunk -->

## This is the growth of tissue similar to that lining the uterus,

<!-- chunk -->

## normally within the pelvic cavity and rarely in the lungs and

<!-- chunk -->

## even the nose. It grows and bleeds through the cycle just like the

<!-- chunk -->

## uterine wall. Symptoms can include sharp pain before periods

<!-- chunk -->

## and with intercourse, and heavy bleeding. Adhesions may form

<!-- chunk -->

## between womb and bowel and inhibit conception, leading to

<!-- chunk -->

## infertility. Causes include hormone imbalances, retroverted

<!-- chunk -->

## menstruation linked to the use of tampons and IUDs, stress, and

<!-- chunk -->

## immune problems caused by oestrogen mimicking pollutants as

<!-- chunk -->

## in plastics and pesticides.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Vitex, ashwagandha, Chinese angelica, wild yam, shatavari,

<!-- chunk -->

## paeony, liquorice or black cohosh help to balance hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Cramp bark, pasque flower, black cohosh, or passion flower

<!-- chunk -->

## help to relieve pain and can be taken in acute doses.

<!-- chunk -->

## • A massage with sesame or castor oil with 2 drops of lavender,

<!-- chunk -->

## rosemary, rose, chamomile or ginger oil per 5mls will also

<!-- chunk -->

## help.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Hawthorn, ginger, gotu kola and prickly ash improve

<!-- chunk -->

## circulation to the uterus and relieve pelvic congestion.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Ashwagandha, skullcap, Siberian ginseng, shatavari and wild

<!-- chunk -->

## oats increase resilience to stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For heavy bleeding astringent herbs beth root, yarrow,

<!-- chunk -->

## periwinkle, lady's mantle, agrimony, rehmania, bayberry or

<!-- chunk -->

## rose can be helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

## • To help the breakdown and excretion of hormones, use liver

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs burdock, milk thistle, holy thistle or dandelion.


<!-- chunk -->

## Supplements of evening primrose oil, magnesium, vitamins B

<!-- chunk -->

## and E, zinc, and calcium are helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

## – It is important to avoid caffeine, alcohol, refined and junk

<!-- chunk -->

## foods, and to take regular exercise.

# Menopause

<!-- chunk -->

## Low libido, hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings, “mid-life

<!-- chunk -->

## crises”, depression and insomnia are some of the symptoms that

<!-- chunk -->

## can characterise the menopause, when levels of oestrogen and

<!-- chunk -->

## progesterone decline to the point where menstruation ceases. The

<!-- chunk -->

## adrenal glands take over the production of similar hormones, but

<!-- chunk -->

## stress and adrenal exhaustion can impair their ability to do so

<!-- chunk -->

## adequately, triggering the familiar symptoms. Subsequent health

<!-- chunk -->

## problems include increased risk of osteoporosis and heart and

<!-- chunk -->

## arterial disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ashwagandha enhances resilience to

<!-- chunk -->

### stress and has a balancing effect on

<!-- chunk -->

### the hormones.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Several plants contain isoflavones, similar in structure to

<!-- chunk -->

## oestrogen, called phyto-oestrogens. They occur in shatavari,

<!-- chunk -->

## red clover, Chinese angelica, wild yam, wild indigo, Siberian

<!-- chunk -->

## ginseng, liquorice, red clover and black cohosh which also

<!-- chunk -->

## support the adrenals, increase resilience to stress and are very

<!-- chunk -->

## helpful for relieving menopausal symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Vitex, motherwort, sage, chamomile, hops, lady's mantle, aloe

<!-- chunk -->

## vera, hawthorn, fennel, sarsaparilla and rehmania will also

<!-- chunk -->

## reduce menopausal symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Burdock, dandelion, holy thistle, and milk thistle will aid the

<!-- chunk -->

## liver's metabolism of hormones. Relaxants chamomile, pasque

<!-- chunk -->

## flower, chamomile, motherwort, vervain, wild oats and lemon

<!-- chunk -->

## balm are calming where anxiety is aggravating symptoms.


<!-- chunk -->

## Evening primrose oil and supplements of vitamin E, calcium and

<!-- chunk -->

## magnesium are recommended.

# Low Sex Drive/Impotence

<!-- chunk -->

## Lack of sexual interest in men and women and erectile

<!-- chunk -->

## dysfunction in men are increasingly common problems.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hormone imbalances, stress, depression, pain, obesity, poor

<!-- chunk -->

## health, low energy, marital problems, diabetes, high blood

<!-- chunk -->

## pressure, circulatory problems, effects of drugs and smoking are

<!-- chunk -->

## all contributory factors. Low libido is frequently experienced by

<!-- chunk -->

## women around the menopause, and male impotence is related to

<!-- chunk -->

## environmental toxins and particularly the oestrogenic effects of

<!-- chunk -->

## plastics, pesticides and hormones used in animal rearing.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Excellent herbs for balancing hormones, increasing sexual

<!-- chunk -->

## energy and performance, are ashwagandha, gokshura,

<!-- chunk -->

## shatavari, astragalus, Chinese angelica, schizandra, liquorice,

<!-- chunk -->

## panax and Siberian ginseng. These adaptogenic remedies also

<!-- chunk -->

## increase resilience to stress and counter the effects of anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

## and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Oats, rose, rosemary, gotu kola, vervain and skullcap are good

<!-- chunk -->

## relaxants.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Black cohosh, wild yam, sage, motherwort and vitex balance

<!-- chunk -->

## hormones during the menopause.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Sarsaparilla, saw palmetto and damiana support production of

<!-- chunk -->

## male hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Gingko, ginger, cinnamon, hawthorn, and gotu kola help

<!-- chunk -->

## circulatory problems.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Detoxifying remedies burdock, nettles, dock, and milk thistle

<!-- chunk -->

## to support the liver and clear side effects of drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hawthorn improves circulation to the

<!-- chunk -->

### uterus and relieves pelvic congestion.

# Infertility and Low Sperm Count

<!-- chunk -->

## Infertility is reaching epidemic proportions, perhaps related to

<!-- chunk -->

## the effect of environmental toxins and residues of the

<!-- chunk -->

## contraceptive pill in water supplies which are causing widespread

<!-- chunk -->

## hormonal imbalances. Men and women are both affected, with

<!-- chunk -->

## approximately one third of problems being accounted for in

<!-- chunk -->

## men. Hernia surgery, tubule infection, chlamydia, diabetes,

<!-- chunk -->

## drugs, mumps, stress, smoking, toxic metals and nutritional

<!-- chunk -->

## deficiencies all may effect sperm count. It takes 100 days for

<!-- chunk -->

## sperm to develop, so treatment needs to be continued over

<!-- chunk -->

## several months.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Detoxifying herbs including kelp, burdock, andrographis,

<!-- chunk -->

## globe artichoke, reishi and shiitake mushrooms, guduchi, milk

<!-- chunk -->

## thistle and nettle all help to support the liver's breakdown of

<!-- chunk -->

## drugs and toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Hormone balancing and adaptogenic herbs to enhance fertility

<!-- chunk -->

## include ashwagandha, shatavari, vitex, wild yam, astragalus,

<!-- chunk -->

## Chinese angelica, schizandra, liquorice, panax and Siberian

<!-- chunk -->

## ginseng. They also increase resilience to stress and counter the

<!-- chunk -->

## effects of anxiety and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Black cohosh, motherwort, evening primrose oil and rose can

<!-- chunk -->

## also be used for menstrual problems.


<!-- chunk -->

## Supplements of B-complex, zinc, vitamin E, omega-3 and 6 oils,

<!-- chunk -->

## and coenzyme Q10 are recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Pesticides are designed to disrupt the reproductive cycle of the

<!-- chunk -->

## insect, fungus, or weed it is trying to kill! Eat Organic!

# Fibroids

<!-- chunk -->

## Fibroids are benign growths consisting of smooth muscle tissue,

<!-- chunk -->

## which develop in the uterine wall. There may be a single fibroid,

<!-- chunk -->

## or, more commonly, several. They are related to excess

<!-- chunk -->

## oestrogen, overuse of the contraceptive pill, uterine congestion,

<!-- chunk -->

## overweight and stress and shrink after the menopause.

<!-- chunk -->

## Approximately 1 in 3 women have fibroids, but they are so small

<!-- chunk -->

## they are symptomless. Large fibroids cause heavy periods, clots,

<!-- chunk -->

## enlarged abdomen, pressure symptoms in the bladder,

<!-- chunk -->

## constipation, and anaemia. They tend to grow in pregnancy and

<!-- chunk -->

## may cause miscarriage. Methylxanthines in coffee also stimulate

<!-- chunk -->

## their growth.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Hormone balancing herbs vitex, wild yam, motherwort,

<!-- chunk -->

## paeony, saw palmetto or liquorice can help normalise

<!-- chunk -->

## oestrogen levels.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Liver remedies burdock, dandelion, holy thistle, milk thistle,

<!-- chunk -->

## dock or gentian aid the liver's metabolism of oestrogen and

<!-- chunk -->

## help reduce tumours.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Astringent herbs like beth root, raspberry leaf, yarrow,

<!-- chunk -->

## periwinkle, lady's mantle, agrimony, bearberry, rehmania,

<!-- chunk -->

## bayberry, or rose reduce heavy bleeding.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Iron containing foods and herbs like nettle, coriander leaf,

<!-- chunk -->

## codonopsis, amalaki, kelp and dock help combat anaemia.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Poke root and guggulu are also specific for reducing fibroid

<!-- chunk -->

## growths.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Siberian ginseng, ashwagandha and shizandra enhance

<!-- chunk -->

## resilience to stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Paeony helps to regulate female

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones and is highly regarded in

<!-- chunk -->

### traditional Chinese medicine.


<!-- chunk -->

## Avoid caffeine, alcohol, fatty and junk food.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Take supplements of vitamin C, B complex, zinc and

<!-- chunk -->

## magnesium.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Take regular exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Supplements of evening primrose oil, magnesium and zinc are

<!-- chunk -->

## helpful.

# Ovarian Cysts

<!-- chunk -->

## Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs on or near the ovaries which

<!-- chunk -->

## cause no symptoms if small, but if large or numerous

<!-- chunk -->

## (polycystic) cause abdominal swelling, pain with intercourse,

<!-- chunk -->

## pressure on the bladder, hormone imbalances, irregularity or

<!-- chunk -->

## absence of periods, infertility and risk of miscarriage. Lack of

<!-- chunk -->

## dietary fibre and excess carbohydrates and junk foods, combined

<!-- chunk -->

## with overburdening the liver from toxins are linked to the rise of

<!-- chunk -->

## ovarian cysts. Pelvic congestion from poor circulation and lack

<!-- chunk -->

## of exercise are also implicated. Polycystic ovarian syndrome

<!-- chunk -->

## (PCOS) is a metabolic problem related to excess testosterone,

<!-- chunk -->

## raised blood sugar or insulin levels and insulin resistance. It is

<!-- chunk -->

## associated with weight gain, acne, hirsutism, sugar cravings and

<!-- chunk -->

## mood swings.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Chinese angelica, paeony, liquorice, vitex or saw palmetto

<!-- chunk -->

## with evening primrose seed oil can be taken to balance

<!-- chunk -->

## hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Liver herbs milk thistle, barberry, dandelion root, burdock,

<!-- chunk -->

## agrimony or holy thistle help breakdown and excretion of

<!-- chunk -->

## hormones and reestablishment of normal hormone levels by

<!-- chunk -->

## increasing production of sex hormone binding globulins

<!-- chunk -->

## (SHBGs), which bind free testosterone and reduce its effects,

<!-- chunk -->

## such as acne and hirsutism.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Gymnema, fenugreek, neem, turmeric and goat's rue help to

<!-- chunk -->

## regulate blood sugar and reduce insulin resistance.


<!-- chunk -->

## Losing weight can have dramatic results.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Avoiding tea, coffee, fatty and refined foods and supplements

<!-- chunk -->

## of chromium, B complex, vitamin E, vitamin C and

<!-- chunk -->

## bioflavonoids, zinc, co-enzyme Q 10 and magnesium is

<!-- chunk -->

## recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

## NB: Cysts can be cancerous so seek medical attention to

## confirm diagnosis.

# Thyroid Problems

<!-- chunk -->

## The thyroid gland works in conjunction with the pituitary gland,

<!-- chunk -->

## which produces thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to make

<!-- chunk -->

## hormones T3 and T4, which play a vital role in metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hypothyroidism, when the thyroid is underactive, causes slow

<!-- chunk -->

## metabolism, low energy, weight gain, fluid retention, dry skin

<!-- chunk -->

## and hair. Hyperthyroidism, when it is over-active, causes goitre,

<!-- chunk -->

## weight loss, anxiety, heat intolerance and palpitations.

<!-- chunk -->

## Thyroid imbalances are complex and linked to poor diet,

<!-- chunk -->

## excess sugar, stress, adrenal exhaustion, autoimmune problems,

<!-- chunk -->

## food allergies, gluten intolerance, hormonal changes, viruses and

<!-- chunk -->

## dysbiosis.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Herbs to help balance the gut floras can be taken regularly in

<!-- chunk -->

## diet and as herbal preparations. These include cinnamon,

<!-- chunk -->

## ginger, turmeric, andrographis, garlic, burdock, oregano and

<!-- chunk -->

## thyme.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Coleus, guggulu and kelp can be taken to increase production

<!-- chunk -->

## of thyroid hormones and regulate the thyroid.

<!-- chunk -->

## • For auto-immune problems, detoxifying herbs which help

<!-- chunk -->

## metabolism include Oregon grape, dandelion root, gentian,

<!-- chunk -->

## dock, horsetail and barberry.

<!-- chunk -->

## • These can be combined with adaptogenic herbs ashwagandha,

<!-- chunk -->

## bacopa, gotu kola, wild oats, he shou wu and Siberian

<!-- chunk -->

## ginseng, which are high in anti-oxidants to regulate thyroid

<!-- chunk -->

## activity, enhance immunity and increase resilience to stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## • To calm an over-active thyroid, use meadowsweet,

<!-- chunk -->

## motherwort, and lemon balm.


<!-- chunk -->

## Supplements of selenium, zinc, and vitamins E and B6 help

<!-- chunk -->

## conversion of T4 to T3.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Probiotics and beta glucans are recommended.

# Diabetes

<!-- chunk -->

## Type 2 diabetes is a widespread problem, particularly among

<!-- chunk -->

## obese people, that involves lack of insulin production by the

<!-- chunk -->

## pancreas or resistance of the cell wall to insulin (known as

<!-- chunk -->

## insulin resistance), meaning that glucose being carried in the

<!-- chunk -->

## bloodstream cannot enter the cell to produce energy. It is

<!-- chunk -->

## currently thought that diabetes may be an autoimmune problem

<!-- chunk -->

## that is on the coeliac spectrum, meaning that a gluten intolerance

<!-- chunk -->

## could be implicated.

<!-- chunk -->

## Type 2 diabetes can be greatly improved by weight loss,

<!-- chunk -->

## changes in diet and using herbs and supplements that help to

<!-- chunk -->

## balance the gut flora and the blood sugar by supporting the

<!-- chunk -->

## pancreas and decreasing insulin resistance. These measures can

<!-- chunk -->

## help prevent complications including circulatory problems,

<!-- chunk -->

## atherosclerosis, nerve damage, retinopathy, and cataracts.


<!-- chunk -->

## • Gymnema, turmeric, karela and fenugreek can reduce blood

<!-- chunk -->

## sugar and the need for insulin. Gymnema is thought to

<!-- chunk -->

## regenerate pancreatic cells and increase insulin receptors.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Other helpful herbs include garlic, nettle, guggulu, pau d'arco,

<!-- chunk -->

## cat's claw, turnera, goat's rue, and neem.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Bilberry and ginkgo help prevent complications by improving

<!-- chunk -->

## circulation, strengthening blood vessel walls and preventing

<!-- chunk -->

## oxidative damage.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Dandelion and agrimony promote liver function, which is

<!-- chunk -->

## involved in maintaining normal sugar levels.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Adaptogens like holy basil, liquorice, Siberian ginseng,

<!-- chunk -->

## amalaki and guduchi improve resilience to stress, including

<!-- chunk -->

## free radical damage which can contribute to diabetes.


<!-- chunk -->

## Weight loss, low fat diet, avoidance of refined carbohydrates and

<!-- chunk -->

## taking regular exercise are recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

## – Supplements of chromium, zinc, magnesium, probiotics and B

<!-- chunk -->

## complex are helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

### Burdock can be taken to balance the

### gut flora and help the metabolism.

# Growing, Harvesting and Storing

# Herbs

# There's no better way to be sure of the provenance

# of your herbs than growing them yourself; then

# you will be sure of their identity, be reassured of

# their organic status and be able to harvest them at

# the most potent time for their active ingredients.

# Many herbs are easy to grow – indeed a few are

# considered invasive weeds by some – and

# instructions on preparing the soil, sowing and

# propagating, harvesting and preserving herbs to

# retain their maximum therapeutic properties are

# included in this chapter.

# Growing Herbs

# Herbs are greatly rewarding plants to grow.

# Providing they have suitable soil and shelter from

# prevailing winds, most medicinal herbs grow

# easily in temperate climates, with no specialist

# knowledge or skills required. Any herbs that

# originate from tropical regions will take a little

# more care, can be put outside only after the last

# frosts have gone, and should be taken indoors in

# the autumn.

<!-- chunk -->

## A herb garden can be as large or small, and as formal or informal

<!-- chunk -->

## as you like. Whatever space you have available can be adapted to

<!-- chunk -->

## growing herbs. They can be intermingled with flowers and

<!-- chunk -->

## shrubs in large or small herbaceous borders, adding interest and

<!-- chunk -->

## beauty with their attractive foliage and architectural shapes, not

<!-- chunk -->

## to mention their delicious scents. Or they can be planted in

<!-- chunk -->

## specially designed herb gardens, in corners of vegetable gardens,

<!-- chunk -->

## or intermingled with the vegetables (where they can work well as

<!-- chunk -->

## companion plants to deter pests). If you have less space you can

<!-- chunk -->

## plant herbs in pots on a patio or even on your window sill, or in

<!-- chunk -->

## window boxes. Both the planning and the practical laying out of

<!-- chunk -->

## a herb garden can bring many hours of pleasure and satisfaction.

<!-- chunk -->

## Medicinal herbs consist of a mixture of annuals, biennials,

<!-- chunk -->

## perennials, shrubs and even trees. Annual herbs include dill,

<!-- chunk -->

## coriander, basil, German chamomile, and marigold, and these can

<!-- chunk -->

## easily be grown from seed. Once grown they may self-seed

<!-- chunk -->

## fairly freely and can be either left to grow as they are or, as

<!-- chunk -->

## seedlings, transplanted to their preferred site in the garden in

<!-- chunk -->

## springtime. Biennials take two summers to come into flower,

<!-- chunk -->

## usually producing an attractive rosette of leaves in the first year.

<!-- chunk -->

## They include burdock, angelica, mullein, and evening primrose,

<!-- chunk -->

## all of which also self-seed freely. Herbaceous perennials continue

<!-- chunk -->

## from one year to the next, dying down in autumn and

<!-- chunk -->

## reappearing in spring the following year. They can mostly be

<!-- chunk -->

## grown from seed, but may be easier to grow from other methods

<!-- chunk -->

## of propagation such as root division, planting cuttings or offsets.

<!-- chunk -->

## Many common herbs can be bought in nurseries or garden

<!-- chunk -->

## centres, and more unusual herbs can be found in specialist herb

<!-- chunk -->

## nurseries. Pot herbs can be planted at most times of the year,

<!-- chunk -->

## except when the ground is frozen or covered with snow, and

<!-- chunk -->

## provided they are healthy they will establish themselves with

<!-- chunk -->

## very little trouble. Try to avoid planting new pot herbs in dry, hot

<!-- chunk -->

## weather, and if weather does become dry around newly planted

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs then keep them well-watered until they are fully

<!-- chunk -->

## established. Always ensure that you choose strong healthy-

<!-- chunk -->

## looking plants, free from disease or insects, and avoid straggly

<!-- chunk -->

## plants and those whose roots are escaping from the bottom of the

<!-- chunk -->

## pot. Make sure the plants are clearly labelled to avoid confusion

<!-- chunk -->

## later. If you want your herb garden to look established quickly

<!-- chunk -->

## buy 2 or 3 of each herb to plant in groups. Some fast-growing

<!-- chunk -->

## perennials may have to be moved once they grow and need more

<!-- chunk -->

## space.

# Planning Your Herb Garden

<!-- chunk -->

## Before planting your herbs it is well worth making rough plans

<!-- chunk -->

## of your garden, or the space you have available, and a planting

<!-- chunk -->

## design on paper before approaching the practical side of

<!-- chunk -->

## planting. Firstly, you need to decide where you will grow your

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs. Planting them near the house has its advantages, as it is

<!-- chunk -->

## easy to gather them, and harder to forget what you have and risk

<!-- chunk -->

## letting them go over before you notice them, which can be very

<!-- chunk -->

## annoying! You will also see and have more chance to appreciate

<!-- chunk -->

## them, and their delicious scents, the nearer you have them to the

<!-- chunk -->

## house. You also need to take into account your type of soil, and

<!-- chunk -->

## how much sun or shade you have in the space you have

<!-- chunk -->

## allocated.

# Soil Conditions

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbs are fairly easy to grow, since they are generally not fussy

<!-- chunk -->

## about where they grow and will take in most situations and soils.

<!-- chunk -->

## If your soil is deep, moist and rich the plants will probably grow

<!-- chunk -->

## quickly, with lots of lush foliage, but their flavour and smell will

<!-- chunk -->

## not be as strong as herbs grown in poorer dry soil. Many of our

<!-- chunk -->

## favourite herbs, such as rosemary, sage, lavender, basil and

<!-- chunk -->

## oregano, are natives of the Mediterranean where it is dry and the

<!-- chunk -->

## soil is hard and stony, so they are used to withstanding fairly

<!-- chunk -->

## adverse conditions. Plants grown in such soils do not look so

<!-- chunk -->

## vibrant and lushly attractive but will taste and smell wonderful.

<!-- chunk -->

## However, because they grow less fast than those grown on rich,

<!-- chunk -->

## moist soil they cannot be harvested as frequently. The kind of

<!-- chunk -->

## soil that herbs tolerate least is heavy clay soil, which in wet

<!-- chunk -->

## conditions does not drain well and can become waterlogged.

<!-- chunk -->

## Many Mediterranean herbs will rot away in such damp situations.

<!-- chunk -->

## If your soil is wet and heavy add plenty of organic matter and

<!-- chunk -->

## sharp sand to lighten it and help drainage. If your soil is very

<!-- chunk -->

## light and sandy, dig in a small amount of organic matter to make

<!-- chunk -->

## it more water retentive, and therefore more able to retain

<!-- chunk -->

## nutrients in the soil.

<!-- chunk -->

## Most herbs, particularly those that originate in warm climates,

<!-- chunk -->

## like to be grown in warm, sheltered and sunny positions, while

<!-- chunk -->

## some prefer light shade, so your herb-growing area should

<!-- chunk -->

## ideally include a shady spot. This is often provided by a hedge or

<!-- chunk -->

## fence which, when suitably placed for their protection, will have

<!-- chunk -->

## another advantage in that it allows the delicate scents of aromatic

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs to linger on warm air, and not be blown away as the would

<!-- chunk -->

## in a breezy open position. However if your garden is warm and

<!-- chunk -->

## sheltered there is no need to be too concerned about enclosing it,

<!-- chunk -->

## and herbs can be planted in the open.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbs such as angelica are biennials,

<!-- chunk -->

### and can take two summers to come

<!-- chunk -->

### into flower.

# Sowing Seeds

<!-- chunk -->

## You can buy herb seeds from specialist suppliers or save them

<!-- chunk -->

## from the previous year. For early plants, sow seeds in early

<!-- chunk -->

## spring, in pots or seed trays in a greenhouse or propagator.

<!-- chunk -->

## Using fresh seedling compost, sow the seeds evenly and

<!-- chunk -->

## sparingly by sprinkling them over the firmed surface of the soil

<!-- chunk -->

## or in shallow drills. Cover the seeds lightly with a thin layer of

<!-- chunk -->

## compost or fine sand and water with a fine rose on your watering

<!-- chunk -->

## can. Label clearly. Cover the tray with a piece of glass or plastic

<!-- chunk -->

## or a sheet of newspaper.

<!-- chunk -->

## Once the seeds have germinated, remove the newspaper, or

<!-- chunk -->

## once the seedlings reach the glass/plastic sheet, remove it. When

<!-- chunk -->

## the seedlings are large enough to handle you can thin them or

<!-- chunk -->

## transplant them to pots to encourage growth. Once they have

<!-- chunk -->

## become sturdy little plants they are ready to plant outdoors in

<!-- chunk -->

## early summer. Alternatively, you can sow seeds directly into

<!-- chunk -->

## warmer soil in late spring/early summer once all sign of winter

<!-- chunk -->

## frosts has gone. Cover the seeds with soil, the depth of which

<!-- chunk -->

## can be measured by multiplying the diameter of the seeds 2–3

<!-- chunk -->

## times.

<!-- chunk -->

### Specially designed raised beds make

<!-- chunk -->

### a feature of architectural perennials,

<!-- chunk -->

### such as globe artichoke and fennel.

<!-- chunk -->

## Growing herbs from seeds is both rewarding and fascinating,

<!-- chunk -->

## particularly if you are using seeds that you have collected

<!-- chunk -->

## yourself. You may often find that your own seeds germinate

<!-- chunk -->

## more successfully than bought ones, particularly if they are fresh

<!-- chunk -->

## and sown immediately they are ripe and ready to drop. They can

<!-- chunk -->

## be sown in trays and left in a greenhouse or cold frame covered

<!-- chunk -->

## with a piece of glass or polythene until they germinate. They

<!-- chunk -->

## may not germinate until the following spring, so you need to be

<!-- chunk -->

## fairly patient.

<!-- chunk -->

## Many herbs self-seed freely if their seed heads are left alone,

<!-- chunk -->

## for example elecampane, lady's mantle, chamomile, coriander,

<!-- chunk -->

## marigold and motherwort. Seeds will germinate when conditions

<!-- chunk -->

## are right, and will grow into strong healthy plants. If they grow

<!-- chunk -->

## where you don't want them they can be easily moved when

<!-- chunk -->

## ready.

<!-- chunk -->

## Many variegated types of herbs, and decorative coloured herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## such as purple and golden sages, will not come true when grown

<!-- chunk -->

## from seed and so need to be propagated by other methods, such

<!-- chunk -->

## as cuttings or root division.

# Root Division

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbs that form good clumps are excellent candidates for root

<!-- chunk -->

## division. In fact, for best results, herbs such as irises, valerian,

<!-- chunk -->

## lemon balm, elecampane and yarrow need to be divided every 3–

<!-- chunk -->

## 4 years into smaller clumps. Root division is best done in autumn

<!-- chunk -->

## or early spring. First cut back the top growth and dig up the

<!-- chunk -->

## entire plant with a fork. Carefully divide the clump with your

<!-- chunk -->

## hands into several pieces, each retaining a good system of roots,

<!-- chunk -->

## and replant where you have chosen. If the clump is too solid to

<!-- chunk -->

## divide with your hands you will need to use a garden fork. Dig

<!-- chunk -->

## the fork into the middle of the clump and lever it about, forcing

<!-- chunk -->

## the clump to separate.

# Taking Cuttings

<!-- chunk -->

## Taking cuttings from established plants is an easy way to

<!-- chunk -->

## propagate herbs and can be very rewarding. Softwood, semi-ripe

<!-- chunk -->

## and hardwood cuttings can be taken depending on the plant. Soft

<!-- chunk -->

## tip cuttings are generally successful with most herbaceous

<!-- chunk -->

## perennials, while semi-ripe and hardwood cuttings are suitable

<!-- chunk -->

## for shrubs and small trees.

<!-- chunk -->

### Prick out the seedlings once they

<!-- chunk -->

### have developed their first true leaves,

<!-- chunk -->

### transferring them into individual

<!-- chunk -->

### pots.

<!-- chunk -->

## Full sun

<!-- chunk -->

## Lavender, basil, rosemary, coriander, sage, hyssop, thyme,

<!-- chunk -->

## marjoram.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dappled shade

<!-- chunk -->

## Angelica, mint, fennel, lemon balm, ground ivy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Shade

<!-- chunk -->

## Valerian, sweet violet.

<!-- chunk -->

## Moist loam

<!-- chunk -->

## Angelica, elecampane, meadowsweet, mints, valerian, lady's

<!-- chunk -->

## mantle, lemon balm, skullcap, sweet violet.

<!-- chunk -->

## Well drained loam

<!-- chunk -->

## Lavender, basil, coriander, marjoram, wood betony, hyssop,

<!-- chunk -->

## rosemary, burdock, thyme, sage, dill, fennel, lady's mantle.

<!-- chunk -->

## Chalky soil

<!-- chunk -->

## Hyssop, lavender, marjoram, motherwort, pasque flower,

<!-- chunk -->

## rosemary.

<!-- chunk -->

## Light sandy soil

<!-- chunk -->

## Chamomile, coriander, evening primrose, fennel, lavender,

<!-- chunk -->

## thyme, wild carrot, marjoram.

<!-- chunk -->

## Clay soil

<!-- chunk -->

## Burdock, mints, wormwood. Other plants will grow well in

<!-- chunk -->

## clay if there is adequate top soil, with reasonable drainage

<!-- chunk -->

## loam and moist loam.

<!-- chunk -->

## Marshy ground

<!-- chunk -->

## Horsetail, mints, iris, marshmallow, meadowsweet, skullcap,

<!-- chunk -->

## valerian, angelica.

<!-- chunk -->

## When taking cuttings, gently tear a small side-shoot off a stem

<!-- chunk -->

## so that it has a heal on it, or cut the shoot's stem just below a leaf

<!-- chunk -->

## joint using a sharp knife 2-4″/5–10cm long. Remove the lower

<!-- chunk -->

## leaves and insert into holes made with a pencil, stick or dibber

<!-- chunk -->

## around the edge of a pot of cutting compost, or a mixture of peat

<!-- chunk -->

## and sand. You may wish to dip the end into hormone rooting

<!-- chunk -->

## powder first. Firm the soil around the cuttings and water it well.

<!-- chunk -->

## Once you detect signs of new growth at the tip, lift each cutting

<!-- chunk -->

## gently using your fingers or your dibber and plant up in

<!-- chunk -->

## individual pots, disturbing the new roots as little as possible.

# Softwood cuttings

<!-- chunk -->

## These are best taken in spring and early summer from healthy

<!-- chunk -->

## looking plants. Once inserted around the edge of your pot or

<!-- chunk -->

## tray, spray the cuttings with water using a plant spray and cover

<!-- chunk -->

## with a plastic propagator lid, a sheet of polythene or an inflated

<!-- chunk -->

## plastic bag to retain the moisture. Roots develop quickly on

<!-- chunk -->

## softwood cuttings, generally within 3–6 weeks, but it can be just

<!-- chunk -->

## a few days in warm conditions. Root development stimulates leaf

<!-- chunk -->

## growth, so you will know roots are formed when you see tiny

<!-- chunk -->

## new leaves shooting at the growing tip. Once the root system has

<!-- chunk -->

## had a chance to establish itself the cutting can be gently lifted and

<!-- chunk -->

## potted up in an individual pot or planted in a nursery bed.

<!-- chunk -->

## Generally speaking, cuttings are best kept during their first

<!-- chunk -->

## winter in pots in a sheltered area, a greenhouse or plastic tunnel

<!-- chunk -->

## in cold areas, and planted out in their positions the following

<!-- chunk -->

## spring.

<!-- chunk -->

### Take softwood cuttings just below a

<!-- chunk -->

### leaf joint, remove the lower leaves

<!-- chunk -->

### and insert into cutting compost.

# Semi-ripe cuttings

<!-- chunk -->

## These are taken in summer when stems are harder as they ripen

<!-- chunk -->

## at the base but are still flexible. Side-shoots are taken off the new

<!-- chunk -->

## growth, torn away from the main stem leaving a little heal of

<!-- chunk -->

## older wood. Once inserted in pots or trays and watered in, they

<!-- chunk -->

## are also best covered with plastic or polythene to retain moisture,

<!-- chunk -->

## but it is not absolutely vital as they are more resilient than

<!-- chunk -->

## softwood cuttings. Keep in pots in a cold frame or a sheltered

<!-- chunk -->

## area of the garden out of direct sunlight until growth starts the

<!-- chunk -->

## following spring, as rooting takes considerably longer than

<!-- chunk -->

## softwood cuttings.

# Hardwood cuttings

<!-- chunk -->

## These are taken from shrubby herbs or trees such as witch hazel,

<!-- chunk -->

## rosemary, hawthorn and cramp bark in autumn, once the plant is

<!-- chunk -->

## dormant. Take a side shoot of the current year's growth up to

<!-- chunk -->

## 12″/30cm, remove lower leaves and insert half their length in

<!-- chunk -->

## compost in light soil in the garden in a sheltered position. Firm

<!-- chunk -->

## the soil around the cutting and water well. Leave in position for

<!-- chunk -->

## around a year until a good root system is developed.

# Root cuttings or offsets

<!-- chunk -->

## This is the ideal method of propagation for herbs that have

<!-- chunk -->

## running roots or that send up side-shoots around the main plant,

<!-- chunk -->

## such as yarrow, chamomile, elecampane, and mint. Cut the

<!-- chunk -->

## spreading roots or runners from the parent plant at the end of

<!-- chunk -->

## summer or early autumn. Cut the root into small pieces approx

<!-- chunk -->

## 2″/5cm long and put them flat on top of a compost with a little

<!-- chunk -->

## sand in a seed tray. Cover with a plastic bag or sheet of plastic

<!-- chunk -->

## and leave in a cold frame, greenhouse, plastic tunnel or sheltered

<!-- chunk -->

## part of the garden. Once new shoots appear, remove the plastic

<!-- chunk -->

## bag and plant out.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chamomile can be partially covered

<!-- chunk -->

### with soil in the centre so that, once

<!-- chunk -->

### rooted, new plants can be separated

<!-- chunk -->

### off.

# Layering

<!-- chunk -->

## Low growing and shrubby herbs such as sage, thyme, lavender

<!-- chunk -->

## and periwinkle can be propagated by layering. Take a low

<!-- chunk -->

## growing branch and fix it with a peg or a stone in contact with

<!-- chunk -->

## the soil. If you nick the underside of the branch it will root more

<!-- chunk -->

## readily. Once a root has developed you can separate the thus

<!-- chunk -->

## formed new plant, dig it up and replant.

# Mounding

<!-- chunk -->

## Spreading herbs such as chamomile, thyme and marjoram can be

<!-- chunk -->

## partially covered with soil in their centre, thus bringing many

<!-- chunk -->

## different parts of the plant in contact with the soil so that, once

<!-- chunk -->

## rooted, lots of new plants can be separated off.

# Harvesting Herbs

# When harvesting herb plants it is important to

# establish first which part of the plant you need,

# whether that be the leaves, flowers, root, rhizome

# or seeds, and when is the best time to harvest that

# required part. Choose plants that look as healthy

# and vibrant as possible, so they are free from

# disease and infestation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Make sure they are growing well away from areas that have been

<!-- chunk -->

## sprayed or polluted by traffic, industry or animals. Only pick the

<!-- chunk -->

## amount of herb that you need at any one time, as they will easily

<!-- chunk -->

## spoil and be wasted otherwise. Harvest just a few leaves and

<!-- chunk -->

## flowers from each plant so as not to threaten the health or

<!-- chunk -->

## survival of any one plant.

# Leaves and Flowers

<!-- chunk -->

## Aromatic leaves of herbs, e.g. basil, thyme, sage, mint and lemon

<!-- chunk -->

## balm are best harvested when the flowers are about to open as

<!-- chunk -->

## the essential oil content is highest at that period. Flowers and

<!-- chunk -->

## flowering tops such as St John's wort, agrimony, goldenrod,

<!-- chunk -->

## yarrow, skullcap and hyssop are best picked as they are about to

<!-- chunk -->

## burst into bloom. A flat basket is the best vessel to collect herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## in as it makes it easier to avoid bruising or crushing leaves or

<!-- chunk -->

## flowers. They should be collected on a dry day once the dew has

<!-- chunk -->

## dried. During the growing season leaves and flowers are best

<!-- chunk -->

## gathered and used fresh, ideally straight from the garden. At the

<!-- chunk -->

## same time, harvest some extra ones for drying or freezing to last

<!-- chunk -->

## through the winter months as the growing time for herbs is

<!-- chunk -->

## relatively short. Herbs that are particularly worth storing are

<!-- chunk -->

## those which could be useful for treating winter colds and coughs,

<!-- chunk -->

## for example hyssop, thyme, oregano, ground ivy and mullein,

<!-- chunk -->

## and for fevers, for example chamomile, yarrow and elderflowers.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fresh herbs for use in the kitchen, such as coriander leaves, mint,

<!-- chunk -->

## sage, marjoram, rosemary, basil and fennel, can be picked

<!-- chunk -->

## throughout the growing season.

# Seeds

<!-- chunk -->

## Seeds such as dill, coriander and fennel need to be caught when

<!-- chunk -->

## ripe, before they drop. You can cut off the whole flower head

<!-- chunk -->

## when harvesting them, tie it up in muslin or a paper bag with

<!-- chunk -->

## string or a rubber band and hang it upside down in a well

<!-- chunk -->

## ventilated dry room. As the flower head dries the seeds will

<!-- chunk -->

## conveniently drop into the bag. Store the seeds in envelopes, foil

<!-- chunk -->

## or small boxes with well fitting lids, and label clearly with the

<!-- chunk -->

## herb name and collection date.

# Roots and Rhizomes

<!-- chunk -->

## Roots and rhizomes, for example valerian, dandelion,

<!-- chunk -->

## elecampane, and burdock, are best harvested when the aerial

<!-- chunk -->

## parts have died down in autumn or before growing recommences

<!-- chunk -->

## in springtime, as they are richest in stored food at this time.

# Preserving Herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## The object of the drying process is to eliminate the moisture in

<!-- chunk -->

## the herb quickly, before it starts to die, so that it can be stored for

<!-- chunk -->

## a few months without deteriorating and retains its therapeutic

<!-- chunk -->

## properties.

# Harvesting and Preparing

<!-- chunk -->

## When harvesting flowers and leaves for storage make sure they

<!-- chunk -->

## are dry from rain or dew and pick them in the morning before

<!-- chunk -->

## the heat of the day reaches its peak. Use your fingers/hands to

<!-- chunk -->

## pick, unless stalks such as agrimony or yarrow are very tough, in

<!-- chunk -->

## which case you will need scissors. Pick gently, taking care not to

<!-- chunk -->

## bruise the plant.

<!-- chunk -->

## When lifting roots, dig them up with a garden fork, trying not

<!-- chunk -->

## to puncture the outer skin. Wash the soil off the roots and cut off

<!-- chunk -->

## any leaves left, then chop up into sections or slices to speed

<!-- chunk -->

## drying and lie them out to dry. If bark is needed – as from witch-

<!-- chunk -->

## hazel or cramp bark – it is best to peel the bark off whole

<!-- chunk -->

## branches that have been pruned rather than shaving bark off

<!-- chunk -->

## branches on the tree, as it may not do the tree much good.

# Drying

<!-- chunk -->

## Providing that herbs are dried properly, those dried at home are

<!-- chunk -->

## often of a much higher quality than shop-bought herbs in terms

<!-- chunk -->

## of colour, flavour and healing properties. Drying needs to occur

<!-- chunk -->

## as quickly and evenly as possible. Shade, air and constant

<!-- chunk -->

## warmth are all essential.

<!-- chunk -->

## The best place for drying herbs is a shaded, well-ventilated

<!-- chunk -->

## room, garden shed or barn, free from moisture or condensation.

<!-- chunk -->

## It is vital to avoid the kitchen, bathroom, utility room, sheds or

<!-- chunk -->

## garages if they are steamy or damp, as the herbs will not dry

<!-- chunk -->

## properly and will deteriorate. A steady temperature of about

<!-- chunk -->

## 90°F/32°C is ideal – such as an airing cupboard, above an aga or

<!-- chunk -->

## rayburn, or in a low oven with the door left open to allow water

<!-- chunk -->

## to evaporate and the circulation of air. If the atmosphere is too

<!-- chunk -->

## cold (below 72°F/22°C) the plants will reabsorb moisture from

<!-- chunk -->

## the air and take too long to dry.

<!-- chunk -->

## You can loosely tie aerial parts of herbs in small bunches by

<!-- chunk -->

## their stems, and hang them from a beam or a hook indoors. In

<!-- chunk -->

## warm, dry climates bunches of herbs can be hung up out of

<!-- chunk -->

## doors in the shade, or from a high ceiling in a warm room with

<!-- chunk -->

## the windows open. This may be rather an unpredictable way to

<!-- chunk -->

## dry herbs as the temperature varies so much through 24 hours.

<!-- chunk -->

## More reliable results may be obtained by spreading sprigs of

<!-- chunk -->

## herbs or pieces of bark/root or seed evenly over a tray, wire

<!-- chunk -->

## netting, box lid, fruit tray, drying frame, sheets of paper or

<!-- chunk -->

## muslin. Drying frames can be made fairly easily by stretching

<!-- chunk -->

## muslin or fine netting over a wooden frame, and are excellent for

<!-- chunk -->

## drying as they allow free circulation of air. Spread out the herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## so there is plenty of space between them and turn them

<!-- chunk -->

## frequently – once or twice on the first day, and once daily after

<!-- chunk -->

## that. Large leaved herbs such will dry more quickly if the leaves

<!-- chunk -->

## are stripped from their fleshy stems and the stems discarded.

<!-- chunk -->

## Always dry herbs separately – never mix with another species.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unless stalks are very tough, use your

<!-- chunk -->

### hands and fingers to pick herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

## Before storing herbs check that they are properly dry by seeing

<!-- chunk -->

## if they are brittle and rustle, crumble or snap easily between your

<!-- chunk -->

## fingers and thumb. If herbs are stored before they are completely

<!-- chunk -->

## dry they will reabsorb moisture from the atmosphere and

<!-- chunk -->

## deteriorate. It takes roughly 3–7 days for most herbs to dry.

# Freezing

<!-- chunk -->

## Some herbs, particularly those with soft leaves, such as

<!-- chunk -->

## marjoram, coriander, fennel, lemon balm, basil, and mint are

<!-- chunk -->

## ideal for freezing. Pick the leaves or flowers, wash them, and

<!-- chunk -->

## then place them in small plastic bags to freeze.

<!-- chunk -->

### The harvest.

# Storing

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbs are best stored in air-tight dark containers, wooden or

<!-- chunk -->

## cardboard boxes, paper bags or jars. Glass jars are ideally kept in

<!-- chunk -->

## a dark cupboard, as exposure to light will cause deterioration of

<!-- chunk -->

## the medicinal constituents of the herbs. Never store in plastic as it

<!-- chunk -->

## encourages condensation. Make sure to label the herbs clearly

<!-- chunk -->

## with their name, and the date they were harvested. Remove stalks

<!-- chunk -->

## and twigs from aerial parts of plants, and break roots, rhizomes

<!-- chunk -->

## and barks into small pieces before storing. Store seeds in packets

<!-- chunk -->

## in the fridge, or in air-tight jars.
