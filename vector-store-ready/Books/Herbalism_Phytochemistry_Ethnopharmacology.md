CRC Press Taylor & Francis Group an informa business www.crcpress.com 6000 Broken Sound Parkway, NW Suite 300, Boca Raton, FL 270 Madison Avenue New York, NY 2 Park Square, Milton Park Abingdon, Oxon OX 14 4RN, UK It is indeed an honour to be invited to write the Foreword for book titled ‘Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology’ with its twin lofty motto both to educate and to provide much needed scientifi c validation to herbal medicine. The author has achieved in this book the multi-faceted objectives of emerging herbal science which is a blend of ancient knowledge coupled with scientifi c proofs. When I received an invitation from the author to write the Foreword to the book I was somewhat puzzled by the invitation. After all, during the past one decade, my work has focused upon the pharmacological aspects of Ayurvedic and herbal medicine. I have coauthored a number of research and review papers along with the author detailing herbal medicine and ethnopharmacology. And prior to that, my original scientifi c training and qualifi cations were as pharmacologist, rather than Herbal Medicine. The scope of this book is truly impressive, reviewing the phytochemical and pharmacological aspects of herbal drugs. The book is thoroughly referenced and illustrates the scientifi c approach to herbalism. The book is not limited to one class of Complementary and Alternative Medicine but also highlights medicinal applications of lesser known systems like Amchi. The book clearly warrants application of algae, fungi and mosses in drug discovery. This book was need of the hour to provide clarifi cations regarding issues related to herbalism. Herbalism and traditional medicine are backbone of the modern pharmaceutical industry. In China and Western countries, herbal medicine has come into the limelight because of advancement in research and development. Taxol (Taxus brevifolia), Silymarin (Silybum marianum), Artemisinin (Artemisia annua) are some reputed drugs in synthetic system of medicine. All the three drugs owe their origin to plants. We need to explore other systems of Complementary and Alternative Medicine such as Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Homeopathy and Amchi for more potent and life saving drugs. I believe that this book should be of great help to people concerned about the value of herbalism in future healthcare.

## Preface

This book has been written with the primary objective of providing scientifi c footage to medical herbalism. With advancement of our knowledge of the subject, a large number of texts have appeared which are useful in their own way but do not fully meet the interdisciplinary nature of herbalism. Herbalism coupled with phytochemistry and ethnopharmacology is a powerful tool for drug discovery. The present treatise has been presented in a simple and lucid style so that a student who has even a limited knowledge of herbalism can understand the phytochemical and pharmacological aspects of herbalism. A simple, clear, well illustrated and a concise account of phytochemicals and experimental pharmacology has been presented. An introductory chapter in the beginning of the text is meant to acquaint the students with a general outline of various issues related to herbalism. Another objective has been to present the entire subject matter in light of new advancements in herbal drug discovery. The book is primarily meant for students of phytochemistry, ethnopharmacology, phytotherapy and medicinal plants. For the benefi t of the readers, concise information in form of tables has been included. Each chapter contains a complete bibliography which may particularly benefi t postgraduate and research-oriented students and teachers. It is certainly not possible to consider all aspects of herbalism in a single book, especially when there are genuine limitations such as lack of standardization and awareness. No originality is claimed in the preparation of this book. It is simply a compilation of work done in a manner so as to meet the needs of the students of herbalism and related subjects. A large of standard books on the subject and research journals have been consulted. I am also greatly indebted to all eminent herbal scientists of the world for sending me copies of original papers. During the three-year period that this book passed through the different stages of preparation and production, I perforce ignored my family. For all kinds of personal help rendered to me by my parents and wife, I have no words to express my feelings. Special thanks is due to my pretty daughter Seerat Kaur for tolerating my whims and moods while working for the project. My heartiest thanks to Dr. Bhupinder Singh Bhoop, viii Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology Professor (Pharmaceutics & Pharmacokinetics), University Institute of

## 1.1 Introduction

A considerable number of defi nitions have been proposed for the term ‘medicinal plant’. According to the World Health Organization, “a medicinal plant is any plant which, in one or more of its organs, contains substances that can be used for therapeutic purposes, or which are precursors for chemopharmaceutical semi synthesis”. This defi nition distinguishes between the already known medicinal plants whose therapeutic properties or characters are precursors of certain molecules which have been established scientifi cally, with that of other plants used in traditional medicine which are regarded as medicinal, but have not yet been subjected to a thorough scientifi c study. Medicinal plants are a signifi cant source of synthetic and herbal drugs. Patterns of herbal utilization are depicted in Fig. 1.1 Medicinal plants have been used for the treatment of diseases since antiquity. According to Alves and Rosa (2007), 20,000 plant species are used for medicinal purposes. India and China have been on the forefront when one refers to the history of herbal drugs. The traditional systems of medicines viz. Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Western Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Homeopathy have roots in medicinal herbs. Herbal medicines have been produced by a number of renowned researchers and due to its accessibility to traditions it is still practiced even by lay practitioners. Ayurveda, the ancient healing system fl ourished in India in the Vedic era. The classical texts of Ayurveda, Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita were written around 1000 B.C. The Ayurvedic Materia Medica includes 600 medicinal plants along with therapeutics. Herbs like turmeric, fenugreek, ginger, garlic and holy basil are integral parts of Ayurvedic formulations. The formulations incorporate a single herb or more than two herbs (polyherbal formulations). The history of traditional Chinese medicine is renowned and the herbal system, is very well preserved. It originated about 3000 years ago 2 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology and is a popular science in western countries. Some of the medicinal herbs mentioned in Chinese medicine are common to Ayurveda. Traditional Chinese medicine favors the use of medicinal herbs in their natural form rather than by extraction. Herbal drugs have a different history in Europe and America and have produced healers like Culpeper. The use of tinctures in homeopathy is based on medicinal herbs. Before the availability of synthetic drugs, man was completely dependent on medicinal herbs for prevention and treatment of diseases. The use of the medicinal herbs for curing diseases has been documented in the history of all civilizations. The drugs were used in crude forms like expressed juice, powder, decoction or infusion. Although the formulations mentioned in ancient texts are diffi cult to understand in terms of scientifi c parameters, some of them are reputed for their curative values. The Napralert database at the University of Illinois establishes ethno medicinal uses for about 9200 of the 33,000 species of monocotyledons, dicotyledons, gymnosperms, lichens, pteridophytes, and bryophytes. Ancient healers, who developed formulations based on medicinal herbs, were probably not aware of the chemical composition of the herbs. However the advances they made despite the non-availability of scientifi c procedures is astonishing. The work on Terminalia chebula (chebulic myrobalan) mentioned in Charaka Samhita is quite authentic and modern studies have revealed that the purgative activity mentioned in Ayurveda is justifi ed by the isolation of chebulic acid, the active constituent of chebulic myrobalan. Initially, the term Materia Medica was coined for the study of natural products. Materia Medica is defi ned as the knowledge of natural history, physical characteristics, and chemical properties of drugs. It includes

The Ayurvedic equivalent for Materia Medica is Dravyaguna, which is the study of medicinal herbs in Ayurvedic terms. Now days the term ‘ Materia Medica’ is known as pharmacognosy.

## 1.2 Phytomedicines and Herbal Extracts

A medicinal herb is considered to be a chemical factory as it contains a multitude of chemical compounds like alkaloids, glycosides, saponins, resins, oleoresins, sesquiterpene lactones and oils (essential and fi xed). Some rare compounds like furanocoumarins, hydroxycoumarins, napthoquinones, acylphloroglucinols and sterones are also distributed among the plant kingdom. The active constituents are usually secondary metabolites, derived from biosynthetic pathways present within the plant tissue. In 1985 it wa s recorded that 74% of the 119 plant derived drugs were discovered as a result of chemical studies to isolate the active substances responsible for their traditional use. Plants are used in different forms varying from powders to extracts. Powder represents the drug in the ground form and these types of preparations are considered to be crude. The Pharmacopoeia mentions standardized vegetable powders for therapeutic application. Herbal systems of medicine have become increasingly popular in recent years. In light of the growing demand of herbal drugs, quality control and assurance is primarily important. The standardized herbal extracts are considered to be more scientifi c than crude drugs. The commonly employed technique for removal of the active substance from the crude drug is called

<!-- chunk -->

## extraction. Selection of the solvent is very critical in preparing the extracts,

because the active constituent of the plants have an affi nity for solvents. 1. Water and petroleum ether are used for extraction of fi xed and essential oils and sterones. 2. Chloroform and ether are used for extraction of alkaloids. 3. Water and alcohol are used for extraction of glycosides. 4. Tannins and phenols are extracted with alcohol and ethyl acetate. Extracts are prepared by separating the soluble matter from vegetable tissues by application of a suitable solvent like alcohol, water or ether. The resultant liquid is concentrated by evaporation to obtain a liquid extract or concentrated almost to dryness to obtain the solid extract. Depending on the solvent used, the extracts are classifi ed as alcoholic, etheral or aqueous.

## The standardized herbal extract is a preparation, which contains a

## certain fi xed proportion of the active constituent (Table 1.1). Although

the most obvious aspect of standardization is the guaranteed content of 4 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology one or more active constituents or marker compounds, standardization involves much more than guaranteed levels of constituents. For example, a standardized extract of Papaver somniferum contains not less than 9.5% of morphine. Standardization has a great impact on the quality of herbal products. Standardization helps in adjusting the herbal drug formulation to a defi ned content of a constituent or constituents with therapeutic activity.

## Table 1.1 Constituents with known activity.

Source: Keller (2001). The biological source of a drug has great impact on fi nished products in herbal drug preparation. Proper identifi cation of the drug is signifi cant for phytochemical screening, which further exerts importance on therapeutic activity of the medicinal herb. Thus presence of the identifi cation standard is necessary in fi nished products of an herbal drug preparation. A constituent of a medicinal herb, which is used for quality control and

## Advantages of standardized extracts

Standardized extracts retain the chemical complexity typical of the natural plant, but offer the added advantage of guaranteed levels of certain key constituents. An increasing number of botanical medicines have had their Herbal Drug Industry clinical effi cacy confi rmed in clinical trials. The vast majority of clinical trials involving botanical medicines have used standardized extracts. The reason is simple: standardized extracts offer consistent and reproducible therapeutic effects and the highest degree of safety. Accordingly, standardized extracts produce the best clinical results.

<!-- chunk -->

## Why standardization?

As botanical extracts are made directly from crude plant material, they can show very substantial variation in composition, quality, and therapeutic effects. The variation and diversity of life is enormous, even within a species. In other words, two medicinal plants of the same species may look similar, yet be substantially different in the levels of active constituents that they contain. Botanical medicines made from plants that differ markedly in their chemical constituents cannot produce the same therapeutic effects. Since the practitioner or consumer will be unable to assess the difference, they cannot compensate for it. The consequence will be inconsistent clinical results. Standardized extracts are: • High quality extracts containing consistent levels of specifi ed compounds • Broad spectrum extracts containing recognized active constituents as well as a variety of other plant constituents (some of which may contribute to the overall therapeutic quality of the extract) • Extracts subjected to rigorous quality controls during all phases of the growing, harvesting and manufacturing processes. Clinical advantages: • High quality extracts with consistent activity • Consistent activity allows for more accurate prescribing • Consistent activity allows for consistent clinical results • Extensive quality control ensures the quality and safety of standardized extracts Quality control ensures: • That the correct botanical species is used • That only high quality raw materials are used • That no other plant material has been used • That the plant material is not contaminated with pesticides, heavy metals, or other noxious agents, that the fi nal extract complies with international limits for microbial content and that the fi nal product is of a consistent high standard preparation. 6 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology Commonly used herbal extracts are listed in the Table 1.3.

## 1.3 Markets and Marketing Issues

Herbal medicine and natural pharmaceuticals are moving from the fringe to mainstream, with a larger number of people seeking remedies and health approaches free of the side-effects caused by synthesized chemicals (Fig. 1.2). This was considered one of the most vital and high growth industries of the 90s and is set to expand even further into the next century. The increasing acceptance of herbal medicines in Australia is well supported by trends around the world. In Germany and France which together represent 39% of the $14 billion global retail market, herbal remedies known as phytotherapeutics are well established, and the cost for therapeutic use is covered by health insurance systems, and the quality criteria applied to regulation and manufacturing are comparable to those for chemical drugs. The crude botanical raw materials for this industry have been grown for long and traded in many countries around the world. As the Australian market for herbal medicine develops, opportunities are arising for raw

## materials to be grown in Australia, both for local and export markets.

Access to export markets may be facilitated by the `clean green’ image that Australian agriculture presents to the world. Botanical raw materials are comprised of dried plant materials in the form of roots, barks, herbs, fl owers, fruits, seeds, and resins. These materials are traded in a whole form or, more commonly, are cut and sifted to a consistently even particle size. Market prices for raw botanical

World Market ExportExportImportImport Raw materials system Wholesale Industry Farm Wild Hospital Production Community Production Direct sale Store Health Consumers Pharmacy Hospital Clinic Herbal Drug Industry materials are usually determined by supply and demand, but generally tend to be stable. At least 25% of medical prescriptions in recent times contain one active compound from plant species, Duke (1990) estimated that the value of drugs containing compounds from plant species is about US$ billion in the United States alone (see Table 1.1). Most traded European materials are priced at source in the range of $2.00 to $6.00/kg. Prices for certifi ed organic produce can be anywhere between $10.00 and $30.00/kg. This supply market is very limited, hence the high prices. Prices for diffi cult-to-grow, wild-harvested, or certifi ed organic materials, usually North American botanicals, can range in price from $20.00 to $120.00/kg (Table 1.4).

## Table 1.4 World market for fl avor and fragrances (US$ m in 1990).

Source: Pearce (1988). The principal primary market for these raw materials is to industries that manufacture: • Essential oils (Table 1.5) • Liquid extracts and tinctures • Herbal teas • Concentrated soft extracts (for further industrial application) • Concentrated dry extracts (for further industrial application) • Plant-derived pure pharmaceutical drugs. The pharmaceutical industry is both large and highly successful. Sales of plant derived drugs reached $30 billion worldwide in 2002. At present about 50% of the total plant-derived drug sales come from single entities, while the remaining 50% come from herbal remedies. Although the latter have greater volumes of consumption, the relatively low volumes of single entities, which are mostly prescription products, are more than compensated by their higher prices. Single entity plant drugs, which mostly treat serious medical ills, include atropine, digoxin, morphine, paclitaxel, pilocarpine, reserpine, scopolamine, topotecan and vincristine, among many others. Several of the compounds have outlived their usefulness in light of better alternatives, and are exhibiting a decline in sales. On the other hand, as a consequence of new drug developments, single entities overall are projected to increase their market share of the combined total future dollar sales. 10 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology Sales of these plant-based drugs in the U.S. amounted to some US$4.5 billion in 1980 and an estimated US$15.5 billion in 1990. Other drugs are derived from animals and microorganisms. Development of drugs from plants is a long and arduous process which involves many disciplines. It has been estimated that only 5 to 15% of the approximately 250,000 species of higher plants have been systematically investigated for the presence of bioactive compounds. In industrialized countries, substances in everyday use derived from plants are -digitalin, ephedrine, morphine, quinine and many more. While the ones used less often like reserpine, guggulipid and artemisinin are equally well known. All 119 plant-derived drugs used worldwide in 1991 came from fewer than 90 of the 250,000 plant species that have been identifi ed. “Each such plant is a unique chemical factory”, according to Norman R. Farnsworth of the University of Illinois at Chicago, “capable of synthesizing unlimited numbers of highly complex and unusual chemical substances whose structures could (otherwise) escape the imagination... forever”. In other words, scientists may be able to synthesize these plant compounds in the laboratory. Commercially, these plant derived medicines are worth about US$14 billion a year in the United States and US$40 billion worldwide. In 1990s, the U.S. National Institute earmarked US$8 million to screen 50,000 natural substances for activity against 100 cancer cell lines and the AIDS virus. China, Germany, India, and Japan, among others, are also screening wild species for new drugs. The European market for herbal supplements is estimated at over US$ 2.7 billion and for herbal remedies, a further US$ 0.9 billion. Germany is by far the largest market. The market is growing rapidly at over 4% per annum for herbal remedies and considerably faster for herbal supplements. The US herbal market is nearing saturation and is expected to peak at US$ 6–8 billion in the next few years. Source: Haq (1993).

## Table 1.5 Some major essential oils and their compounds.

Herbal Drug Industry Their dietary herbal supplement market is estimated at US$4 billion and has been growing at 6–8% per annum. The main producers are manufacturers based in the developed countries, including the large multinational pharmaceutical companies. There are also smaller companies that specialize in herbal products and some have emerged to challenge the multinationals for market leadership in this fi eld. The main products sold are based on plants such as Echinacea and St. John’s Wort that were known for their medicinal properties in the consuming countries. Recent research has helped propel the knowledge of other plants from around the world and this has helped accelerate the development of new supplements and medicines. The market share of herbal products made in developing countries remains comparatively low. Chinese products, mainly in herbal supplements, have achieved major successes. The EU and the US regulations have special provision for herbal medicines that do not use mixtures of herbs. In this respect their regulations are, comparatively, relaxed. But if the exported products contain herbal mixtures and claim curative properties, the rules become much stricter. For medicines, product trials need to be carried out that cost several millions of dollars. Scientifi c knowledge of the products produced in the developing countries, and of their systems of traditional medicine, is limited and this also restricts the market for their herbal products. As markets grow, the search for a wider variety of ingredients is increasing. Phytomedicines have already started to link traditional medicines with modern (allopathic) medicine, with research and development primarily funded by large pharmaceutical manufacturers. Demand for medicinal plants is expected to continue to expand rapidly, fuelled by the growth of sales of herbal supplements and remedies. Their 9.PatentsEasyDiffi cult

## 1.4 Medicinal plant analysis: HPLC

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a highly selective chemical analytical technique, which is suitable for the analysis of a range of plant materials and botanical extracts. HPLC provides both qualitative information about the composition of the sample and quantitative data about the amount present of each constituent. Although HPLC is a sophisticated analytical technique requiring expensive technology, the method is based on the same simple principles as other types of chromatography. A high performance liquid chromatograph contains a narrow stainless steel column. This column is packed with a material (usually fi ne silica particles) that selectively absorbs molecules on the basis of some difference in their chemical structure. Due to the differential retention of individual molecules traveling through the column, compounds in a sample are separated. Compounds that are absorbed weakly or not at all have the shortest retention time and will exit the column fi rst. Compounds that are absorbed more strongly have longer retention times and will exit the column more slowly. As the individual constituents of the sample exit the column, they are monitored by a detection device, which is linked to a printer. Each peak in the chromatogram represents a chemical compound, and the height of the peak is proportional to the concentration of that particular compound in the sample. High performance liquid chromatography is carried out under high pressure and is therefore much faster than most other chromatography techniques. By way of comparing HPLC ‘fi ngerprints’ with reference standards, plant material and botanical extracts can be identifi ed unequivocally. However, HPLC also provides detailed information about the composition of the sample. HPLC is therefore widely used in the quality control of standardized botanical extracts, to ensure the presence of key constituents in specifi ed amounts. The fi gure below shows a three-dimensional HPLC chromatogram of the silymarin extract from milk thistle ( Silybum marianum). The vertical axis shows the concentration, the horizontal axis is the retention time in minutes, and the third axis shows the wavelengths of detection. The group of peaks visible between 12.5 and 17.5 min (the peaks in the right-hand part of the chromatogram) represent the silybin- type compounds: silybin A, silybin B, and isosilybin A/B. Silymarin is Herbal Drug Industry standardized to specifi ed levels of these compounds, and the peaks representing them are validated using reference standards. The peaks that appear to the left of the silybin peaks represent other constituents of the extract. These are not quantifi ed or validated as part of the standardization process, but they contribute to the total ‘fi ngerprint’ of silymarin. The overall HPLC profi le is used to monitor individual batches of extract in order to ensure consistent constituent profi les and consistency in therapeutic activity.

## Well established use

The Expert report must explain the relevance of any data submitted which concern a product different from the product intended for marketing. A judgment must be made whether the product studied can be considered as similar to the product which will be granted a marketing authorization in spite of the existing differences. In the case of ‘classical’ herbal drug preparations such as tinctures and extracts described in pharmacopoeias and used for long time, a ‘comprehensive’ specifi cation will not be available from published literature in most cases. For these preparations the starting material and the extraction solvent must be identical. If there are reasons to expect a different pharmacological or toxicological profi le, additional data and an update of the specifi cation and/or appropriate data on bioavailability may be necessary.

## Aspects of a specifi cation for an extract

The example of Commission E monograph Ginkgo extract (Fig 1.3) is cited here. Requirements • Extract (acetone 60%) from dried Ginkgo leaves • Drug: extract ratio = 35–67: 1 (mean 50: 1) • 22–27% fl avone-glycosides 5–7% terpene lactones (2.8–3.4% Ginkgolides and 2.6–3.2% Bilobalide) • < 5 ppm Ginkgolic acids Ginkgolic acids are alkylphenols related to compounds found in poison ivy ( Rhus toxicodendron). They can cause contact allergy, The German Institute for Drugs and Medicinal Plants has set a maximum limit of 5 parts per dermatitis. Ginkgolic acids are primarily found in the seed cover of Ginkgo biloba but also occur in small amounts in the leaf. In Germany the two best-selling ginkgo products meet the standard for ginkgolic acid content, as these compounds are eliminated or reduced during the extraction or manufacturing processes. In the United States there is no regulation of ginkgolic acid content of ginkgo preparations at present. In the case of rapid release herbal medicinal products without constituents with known therapeutic activity, the test for in-vitro active ingredient release can be omitted (Fig. 1.4, 1.5).

## Bioavailability/bioequivalence

Pharmacokinetic data for complex mixtures, where ‘constituents with known therapeutic activity’ are not established, should not be required (Fig. 1.6). Requirements for pharmacokinetic data should always relate to the Public Health and safety risks associated with the product. When there are safety concerns (e.g. photosensitization in the case of Hypericum perforatum) pharmacokinetic data are useful to provide safety margins. If there is a constituent with known therapeutic activity and a narrow therapeutic range, pharmacokinetic data will be required. The same principles as defi ned for pharmacokinetic data shall apply for bioavailability/bioequivalence data. Need to provide bioavailability data for galenic preparations with modifi ed release in view of the diffi culty to use bibliographical data in such case (Source: European Medicines Evaluation Agency, London, 2001).

## Zingiber offi cinale for nausea/vomiting

Modern-day uses for ginger in Eastern medicine include the use of the herb to treat nausea (including motion sickness and morning sickness of pregnancy). The main components of ginger are the aromatic essential 20 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology oils, antioxidants, and the pungent oleo-resin. These aromatic or pungent compounds have been identifi ed as the phenylalkylketones, known as gingerols, shogaols, and zingerone. Zingerone, diterpenoid constituent of ginger has been shown to have an activity similar to a 5HT3 antagonist, similar to ondesteron and other anti-emetic drugs used as adjuncts to chemotherapy. 5HT3 receptors are found in both the chemoreceptor trigger zone and on the vagal nerve terminals in the intestine. The anti-emetic effects of ginger are due to its local effect on the vagal receptors in the stomach. A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial was carried to investigate the effect of a ginger extract on the symptoms of morning sickness. The participants included 120 women less than 20 wk pregnant, who had experienced morning sickness daily for at least 1 wk and had had no relief of symptoms through dietary changes. Random allocation of 125 mg ginger extract equivalent to 1.5 g of dried ginger or placebo given 4 times per day for 4 d. The nausea experience score was signifi cantly less for the ginger extract group relative to the placebo group after the fi rst day of treatment and this difference was present for each treatment day.

## 2.5 Reverse pharmacology and Ayurveda

Reverse pharmacology correlates with Ayurvedic drug action. The approach has attracted considerable attention, nationally and inter- nationally. Central Scientifi c Instrumental Research (CSIR) and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have done clinical trials with natural products. Moreover, Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha (CCRAS) has recently adopted the golden triangle approach for some new indications of old drugs, as well as for Ayurveda (Fig. 2.5). The golden triangle approach is a combination of Dravyagunavignyan, systems biology, and reverse pharmacology for the discovery of potent and cost-effective remedies. Dravyaguna deals with the Ayurvedic study of drugs derived from natural (plant, animal or marine) origin. Dravya refers to constituent of the universe and guna signifi es property. In the recent past, the study of Dravyaguna has become more important because of global acceptance of the Ayurvedic system of medicine. Ayurveda has its own concept as far as drug formulation is concerned. Ayurveda has documented Dravya, Guna, Rasa, Virya, Vipaka, Prabhava and Karma for all medicinal agents and these represent the pharmacological aspects of drug usage in Ayurveda. In Ayurveda, drugs have been classifi ed in a number of ways but the classifi cation based on action of the drug is widely accepted. For instance a drug used for alleviating worm infection is known as anthelmintic and in Ayurvedic language, as krimighana. In modern medicine, drugs have been classifi ed according to pharmacological actions. Medicinal plants like Ashwagandha, Brahami, Tulsi, Guggul, Kutki, Kalmegha, Gokshura and Shatavari have been targeted for their application in modern science. Active constituents of the plants have been identifi ed and highly purifi ed extracts are being marketed.

## Fig. 2.5 Golden triangle approach.

Reverse Pharmacology Studying the Ayurvedic drugs at bimolecular levels may reveal the mechanism of action which has eluded scientists for long time. As far as the disease segment is concerned, hepatology and rheumatology are two areas where Ayurvedic remedies are even prescribed by allopathic physicians. Silybum marianum is a well-documented western herbal remedy used for liver diseases. In India, Picrorhiza kurroa (kutki), is considered a valued drug for liver diseases. When P. kurroa was compared with S. marianum, the hepatoprotective effect of P. kurroa was found to be similar, or in many cases, superior to the effect of S. marianum. However it can be seen that S. marianum is more popular than P. kurroa. Silymarin the active constituent of S. marianum has been isolated and purifi ed and above all pharmacological and pharmacokinetic data is available for the drug. The reverse approach in pharmacology has been quite successfully applied in the past. The drawback was the long time frame from the observational therapeutics to a new drug. For example, Rauwolfi a serpentina (sarpagandha) was convincingly demonstrated to be anti-hypertensive by Sen and Bose in 1931. But a drug reserprine, emerged only after 20 yr of work by Vakil, Bein, Muller and Schlitter. This occurred because the path of reverse pharmacology was quite discontinuous. The paradigm of reverse pharmacology is actually a rediscovery of the path, which founded modern pharmacology. Table 2.2 lists the names of plants, clinical effects, and experimental correlates. The list illustrates how novel clinical bio-dynamic effects can lead to the development of the basic disciplines in pharmacology and biology.

## Ethnopharmacology

<!-- chunk -->

## 3.1 Introduction

With the isolation of quinine from Cinchona in 1820, an ancient herbal cure was transformed into a chemical drug. This was the inspiration for a new scientifi c discipline—ethnopharmacology—as Western scientists began to reinvent traditional herbal cures by extracting their active principles to make new and profi table drugs. According to preliminary defi nition, ethnopharmacology may be defi ned as a multidisciplinary study of biologically active agents used in traditional medicine. Or Ethnopharmacology is the scientifi c study correlating ethnic groups, their health, and how it relates to their physical habits and methodology in creating and using medicines. Traditional medicine is a term applied to pre-scientifi c medical systems that possess bodies of medical knowledge, including pharmacopoeia, that are passed through generations from healer to healer.

## Differentiation between ethno pharmacology and

<!-- chunk -->

## pharmacognosy

According to Wardwell, ethno pharmacology and pharmacognosy overlap considerably, but can be differentiated by several distinct features as explained below: (1) Pharmacognosy considers a broad range of natural products used as therapeutic agents, for medical purposes (such as cotton), as pharmaceutical aids, biologics, and as poisons; ethnopharmacology is restricted to natural products used in a traditional context. Ethnopharmacology (2) Pharmacognosy is concerned with the history, economics, and commercial processing of natural substances that affect human health; ethno pharmacology seeks to provide a comprehensive view of the human use of crudely processed drugs that includes ethnographic information. (3) Pharmacognosy has tended to move toward specialized fi elds such as biosynthesis and fermentation microbiology; ethnopharmacology aims to support interdisciplinary collaboration.

## 3.2 Ethnopharmacology and Traditional Medicine

Numerous drugs have entered the international pharmacopoeia via the study of ethnopharmacology and traditional medicine. For traditional medicines, newer guidelines of standardization, manufacture and quality control and scientifi cally rigorous research on the scientifi c basis for traditional treatments will be required. Traditional medical traditions can offer a more holistic approach to drug design and myriad possible targets for scientifi c analysis. Powerful new technologies such as automated separation techniques, high-throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry are revolutionizing drug discovery. Traditional knowledge can serve as a powerful search engine, which will greatly facilitate and rediscover intentional, focused and safe natural product drug discovery. By looking at the historical trends in drug and medical developments, it is possible to understand how current drug development will benefi t from this partnership. Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese systems are great living traditions. These traditions have relatively organized databases, and more exhaustive descriptions of botanical material that are available and can be tested using modern scientifi c methods. Both systems of medicine thus have an important role in bioprospecting of new medicines. Good botanical practices which can improve the quality control procedures of monitoring impurities, heavy metals and other toxins in the raw material can make ethnopharmacology research more meaningful. Drug discovery in the current scenario has become unproductive to the point where the economic future of the industry is questionable. The research and development thrust in the pharmaceutical sector needs to focus on development of new drugs, innovative processes for known drugs and development of plant-based drugs through investigation of leads from the traditional systems of medicine. Traditional medicine can provide novel inputs into the drug development process. However, bioprospecting—the search for economically valuable natural resources—by pharmaceutical 28 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology companies, or on their behalf, has not been conspicuously successful in recent years.

## 3.3 Role for Physicians in Ethnopharmacology and Drug

<!-- chunk -->

## Discovery

Ethnopharmacology investigations classically involved traditional healers, botanists, anthropologists, chemists and pharmacologists. The role of some groups of researchers but not of physicians has been highlighted and well defi ned in ethno pharmacological investigations. Historical data has shown that the discovery of several important modern drugs of herbal origin owe to the medical knowledge and clinical expertise of physicians. Current trends indicate a negligible role of physicians in ethnopharmacological studies. The rising cost of modern drug development is attributed to the lack of using a classical ethnopharmacological approach. Physicians can play multiple roles in the ethnopharmacological studies to facilitate drug discovery as well as to rescue the authentic traditional knowledge of use of medicinal plants. These include: (1) Ethnopharmacological fi eld work which involves: interviewing healers; interpreting traditional terminologies into their modern counterparts; examining patients who are consuming herbal remedies; and identifying the disease for which an herbal remedy is used. (2) Interpretation of signs and symptoms mentioned in ancient texts and suggesting the proper use of old traditional remedies in the light of modern medicine. (3) Clinical studies on herbs and their interaction with modern medicines. (4) Advising pharmacologists to carry out laboratory studies on herbs that have been observed during fi eld studies. (5) Work in collaboration with local healers to strengthen the traditional system of medicine in a community. A physician’s involvement in ethnopharmacological studies will lead to more reliable information on traditional use of medicinal plants both from fi eld and ancient texts, more focused and cheaper natural product based drug discovery, and will bridge the gap between traditional and modern medicine.

## 3.4 Ethnopharmacology and Cultural Relativism

It is commonly accepted that people differ culturally. In the Giger and Davidhizar Transcultural Assessment Model, cultural differences are Ethnopharmacology evident in communication, spatial relationships and needs, social organizations, time orientation, the ability or desire to control the environment, and biological variations. While many individuals appreciate that there are differences between cultures, what is less well recognized is that people also vary according to biological variations depending on their racial and ethnic group. In the last 15 years, information about biological variations has rapidly expanded and that knowledge is essential in order to understand and provide care to individuals from another culture or another racial and ethnic group. Attention to biological variations related to race and ethnicity, the last component of the Giger and Davidhizar Transcultural Nursing Assessment Model, is a critical phenomenon that needs to be assessed in order to develop and implement a culturally sensitive plan of care in an effort to understand ethnopharmacolgy. The Giger and Davidhizar Transcultural Assessment Model was developed in 1988 in response to the need for nursing students in an undergraduate program to assess and provide care for culturally diverse patients . The model included six cultural phenomena: communication, time, space, social organization, environmental control, and biological variations. These provide a framework for patient assessment and from which culturally sensitive care can be designed.

## 3.5 Ethnobotany/Ethnopharmacology and Mass

<!-- chunk -->

## Bioprospecting

Ethno botany/ethnopharmacology has contributed to the discovery of many important plant-derived drugs. Field explorations, to seek and document indigenous and traditional medical knowledge (IMK/TMK), and/or the biodiversity, with which the IMK/TMK is attached, and its conversion into a commercialized product is known as bioprospecting or biodiversity prospecting. When performed in a large-scale operation, the effort is referred to as mass bioprospecting. Experiences from the mass bioprospecting efforts undertaken by the United States National Cancer Institute, the National Cooperative Drug Discovery Groups (NCDDG) and the International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups (ICBG) programs demonstrate that mass bioprospecting is a complex process, involving expertise from diverse areas of human endeavors, but central to it is the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that recognizes issues on genetic access, prior informed consent, intellectual property and the sharing of benefi ts that may arise as a result of the effort. Future mass bioprospecting endeavors must take heed of the lessons learned from past and present experiences in the planning for a successful mass bioprospecting venture. 30 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology Traditional medicines play an important role in the provision of health care in many developing countries. Their use is also signifi cant in developed countries, increasing their commercial value. Several ‘high- profi le’ cases of patenting of traditional medicines, without consent from or compensation to their holders, have further focused attention on their importance. Traditional medicine usually involves biological resources and the knowledge of local and indigenous peoples and/or healers regarding their medicinal use; thus, it is interlinked with biodiversity conservation and indigenous peoples’ rights over their knowledge and resources. At this multi-faceted interface, complex ethical questions arise. The key issues involve dilemmas and challenges in utilizing and protecting traditional medicines. Are there ways to modify and devise new forms of intellectual property ownership that may better suit the needs of those who seek to protect traditional medicine? There also is the question whether such protection, which may restrict access, is the preferred option. While intellectual property protection for traditional medicines has multiple and diverse objectives, the priorities are often not clear and the strategies which could be deployed may interfere with each other, as well as with the prioritization of objectives. This is further aggravated by differences in stakeholders’ concepts on ownership of knowledge and by uncertain or paradoxical effects of some potentially useful strategies. Thus, policymakers should address the multiple, multi-layered issues and questions, and try to develop a range of solutions in order to address and balance the various objectives and interests. When new plant-derived therapeutics based on indigenous knowledge are being explored, it is important that the pharmaceutical companies return benefi ts to the native populations and the local governments from which the research material was obtained. When a potentially marketable plant product is being developed, it is essential that equitable agreements have already been established between the pharmaceutical companies and the people and/or countries from which this indigenous knowledge was acquired. Equally important is the commitment to provide immediate reciprocity that will enhance the welfare, the biocultural diversity and the well-being of the forest peoples. These measures should commence when a research project begins and continue during its duration. The development of these measures must be based upon the expressed needs of the indigenous communities. There is a relationship between the stability of the rain forest biocultural diversity, the creation and development of agro-forest resources and long-term benefi ts to the forest people.

## 3.6 Ethnopharmacology: Novel Applications Vaccines

The combined use of vaccines and immunostimulants is emerging as one of the innovative approaches in adjuvant development. The role of herbal drugs as immunomodulator agents are well-documented and their importance in bioprospecting is obvious. Recently researchers have suggested using ethno pharmacology in contrast to the random screening approach since it is more cost and time effective. Antiviral Herbal medicinal products have been used as a source of putative candidate drugs in many diseases. However, in case of viral diseases, the development of antivirals from natural sources is less explored, probably because within the virus there are few specifi c targets where the small molecules can interact to inhibit or kill the virus. The currently available antiherpes drugs are nucleoside analogs that did not cure the lifelong or recurrent infections and the use of these drugs often leads to the development of viral resistance coupled with the problem of side effects, recurrence and viral latency. However a wide array of herbal products, used by diverse medicinal systems throughout the world, showed a high level of antiherpes virus activities and many of them have complementary and overlapping mechanisms of action, either by inhibiting viral replication, or by viral genome synthesis.

## Medicinal Phytochemistry

<!-- chunk -->

## 4.1 Introduction

Phytochemistry is defi ned as the study of chemical composition of medicinal plants or phyto-drugs. Phytochemistry is a signifi cant subject of the pharmacognosy curriculum. Today, one is witnessing an explosive growth of the herbal drug industry. Standardized herbal extracts and phytochemicals are in high demand for applied research as well as commercial use. The phytochemistry course taught in pharmacy schools deals with the process of isolation, purifi cation and pre-clinical studies of herbal extracts and phytochemicals. Before the availability of synthetic drugs, phytodrugs or herbal drugs were the mainstay of treatment. Several factors including the lack of emergency medicines, surgery, research and standardization, led to the decline of phytomedicine. With the discovery of opium alkaloid, morphine, chemists started targeting herbal drugs for bioactive compounds (referred to as phytochemicals). Phytochemicals may affect health, but are not essential nutrients. Most of the phytochemicals used in the modern pharmaceutical industry are secondary metabolites. Emerging factors like drug-resistance, cost-effectiveness and side-effects of synthetic drugs have led to the resurgence of phytomedicine. World Health Organization (WHO) has identifi ed the growing popularity of phytomedicine. Several articles and documents have been published highlighting the future of phytomedicine. Preclinical or non- pharmacological studies published in index journals have demonstrated the utility of standardized herbal extracts and phytochemicals. Clinical- studies done on phytodrugs like garlic, St. John’s wort, purple cone- fl ower, ginseng, black-cohosh and Ginkgo have proved ancient theories to be accurate. More so, these phytodrugs have been documented in reputed medical text-books. 34 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology The herbal drug industry is in the transition stage. The time is ripe for initiating more research activities in this unexplored fi eld. Non- standardized herbal preparations like infusions, decoctions, tinctures and powders have been largely replaced by standardized herbal preparations like extracts. Extracts are standardized to marker-compounds or active- constituents. Marker-compounds are used in identifi cation of plant material. It is of more industrial importance. Active-constituents are responsible for pharmacological or medicinal activity of the extract.

## 4.2 Classifi cation of phytochemistry

In our view, phytochemistry can be divided into two classes: 1. Conventional or traditional phytochemistry. 2. Medicinal or applied phytochemistry. Conventional phytochemistry, adopts procedures for isolation and purifi cation of active constituents of medicinal plants. The study of this discipline is of more relevance to the pharmaceutical industry. A detailed discussion of conventional phytochemical techniques is beyond the scope of this book. Medicinal phytochemistry is emerging as a new subject keeping in mind recent trends in phytotherapy. This subject is of interest to medical and herbal professionals. Recently, some institutes have introduced courses or modules on herbal medicine or phytotherapy in the regular medical syllabus.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4.3 Scope of medicinal phytochemistry

Medicinal phytochemistry seems to be an interdisciplinary subject. For a well-trained medicinal phytochemist, knowledge of subjects like medicinal or pharmaceutical botany, anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacognosy, ethnopharmacology, chemical ecology, conventional phytochemistry, toxicology, traditional systems of medicine (Ayurveda, Siddha, Homeopathy, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Unani), clinical research and biostatistics are prerequisites. While several complementary and alternative systems of medicine are in practice, the Traditional Chinese System (TCM) has made tremendous progress regarding the application of phytochemistry in medicine. A typical medicinal phytochemistry course can be postgraduate and of a 2-yr duration. In case of the Ayurvedic curriculum, medicinal phytochemistry can combine well with Dravyaguna. Dravyaguna is defi ned as a study of Ayurvedic perspective of medicinal plants. A comparative curriculum blending ancient and modern concepts of ancient therapy will be helpful for students of Ayurveda. A curriculum of herbal Medicinal Phytochemistry medicine taught in Australia, Europe and the United States have some courses of medicinal phytochemistry but it needs signifi cant expansion.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4.4 Career prospects

A well-trained medicinal phytochemist can join academic institutes conducting research on natural medicinal products or as an expert in the herbal drug industry. There is a cut-throat competition in the herbal drug industry and well-trained medicinal phytochemists are highly sort after.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4.5 Challenges in the future

Herbal medicine is expanding rapidly. There is a need to create specialty subjects in the existing curriculum of herbal medicine. Many allopathic practitioners are interested in understanding the mechanism of actions of phyto -drugs. Most of the CAM practitioners have little interest towards integrating the modern and traditional systems of medicine. However, some CAM practitioners have begun to understand the importance of the integrative approach. In order to sustain medicinal phytochemistry as a subject in the near future, more funds for research and development are needed. The course is essential for creating super-specialty subjects like phytopharmacology and phytopharmacotherapy.

## Phytochemicals

<!-- chunk -->

## 5.1 Introduction

‘Phyto’ is the Greek word for plants. Phytochemicals literally means chemicals produced by plants. The term is reserved for those plant chemicals that have a benefi cial effect on human-health but are not essential from the point of view nutrition (see phytonutrients). If the term is analyzed minutely, phytochemical means ‘fi ght-o-chemicals’. Twenty fi ve thousand phytyochemicals are known to exist in the plant fl ora. It is estimated that approximately 10,000 alkaloids and 4,000 fl avonoids are distributed in the plant kingdom. Medicinal plants rich in phytochemicals have been used for centuries in the treatment and prevention of diseases. Some phytochemicals can be dangerous and some have no effect on human health. Sometimes some of the compounds in plants with potent medicinal properties may not necessarily be chemicals, but may be elements like selenium or chromium. Thousands of phytochemicals have been isolated and characterized from plants, including fruits and vegetables. The isolated phytochemicals are grouped into distinctive classes by the number and kind of constitutive atoms and the structure of the basic skeleton. Phytochemicals derived from the plants remain the basis for a large proportion of the commercial medications used today for the treatment of a wide range of diseases.

## 5.2 Defi nition of phytochemical

Defi nition A phytochemical is a natural bioactive compound found in plant foods that works with nutrients and dietary fi ber to protect against diseases. Defi nition Phytochemicals are chemicals produced by plants. They may affect health, but are not-essential nutrients as our diet does not require them to sustain life in the same way as vitamins and minerals. Phytochemicals Or Phytochemicals are non-nutritive plant chemicals that contain protective, disease-preventing compounds. Or Phytochemicals are defi ned as non-nutritive biologically active compounds.

## 5.3 Evolution process of phytochemicals

Gottlieb (1993) proposed the redox theory for evolution of phytochemicals. According to this theory, when the evolution of plants took place, a negligible amount of oxygen was present in the atmosphere. With an increase in atmospheric oxygen, the environment was polluted as a direct result of plant metabolism. With the passage of time, plants kept on acquiring antioxidants, which neutralized the ill-effects of free-radicals. Small plants like algae, fungi, liverworts and mosses survived the increase in atmospheric oxygen. Over a period of time, higher plants which were oxygen resistant, like ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms evolved. The plants then evolved phytochemicals possessing a fi ghting capacity (fi ght-o-chemicals) against microorganisms and offering a protective effect to the genetic material. Phytochemicals also exert protective effects against solar-radiation and insect invasion. When the evolution of animal species took place, it made dependent on the plants for food and shelter. The plants consumed by animals, including human-beings, provided them with their own chemical defense mechanisms. Consumption of phytochemicals by humans has shown to keep cells in the body healthy and stable in many ways. Phytochemicals accumulated by plants play a signifi cant role in interaction with the surroundings. Recently, it has been postulated that the underlying mechanism in the evolution of phytochemicals by plants includes biosynthetic enzymes. However the role of transcription factors in coordinating expression of all the genes in the evolution pathways is poorly understood. According to Grotewold (2005), duplication of regulatory genes results in control of new pathways. New pathways are evolved as a result of mutation, which impairs the routine function, resulting in inactivating one or more steps in a metabolic pathway. As a result of which, intermediates start accumulating and are converted into new compounds by specifi c enzymes.

## 5.4.1 Alkaloids

Alkaloids are basically nitrogen bases. The amino acids act as building blocks for the biosynthesis of alkaloids. Alkaloids are responsible for physiological effects in man or in animal. Alkaloids have basic properties and are alkaline in reaction, turning red litmus paper blue. Alkaloids are basically compound ammonias, where various radicals replace one or more atoms of hydrogen. Alkaloids combine with acids to form crystalline salts without the production of water. The majority of alkaloids exist in solid form like atropine and contain oxygen. Some alkaloids like lobeline or nicotine occur in a liquid form and contain carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Alkaloids have one peculiarity regarding solubility in organic solvents. They are readily soluble in alcohol and sparingly soluble in water. The salts of alkaloids are usually soluble in water. In nature, the alkaloids exist in many plants: in larger proportion in the seeds and roots often in combination with vegetable acids. The solutions of alkaloids are intensely bitter. The name of alkaloids, end in -ine suffi x. The salts of alkaloids are offi cial in various pharmacopiea. Codeine, atropine, morphine, ergotamine and ephedrine are common examples. As discussed earlier alkaloids are responsible for physiological effects in man or animals. The physiological effects are due to secondary metabolites arising from biochemical pathways operating in the plant cell. Alkaloids constitute the largest group of secondary chemical constituents. Alkaloids are classifi ed as shown in Fig. 5.1. N N H NN NN N N N N Pyridine Piperidine Pyrrolidine Pyrrolizidine Indole Purine Imidazole Phytochemicals Amino acids act as a precursor for biosynthesis of alkaloids.

They are also known as azosteroids. Depending upon the parent carbon skeleton, they are classifi ed in four types (Fig. 5.4). They are found in Apocynaceae, Buxaceae, Solanaceae, and Liliaceae. Alkaloids are signifi cant sources of pharmaceutical drugs. More than 12,000-alkaloids are known to exist in green fl ora and only few have been exploited for medicinal purposes.

Berberine sulfate has been shown to inhibit the growth of Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas vaginalis, in vitro. The parasites all exhibited morphological changes after exposure to berberine sulfate. In one experiment, berberine hydrochloride reduced the cholera toxin- induced secretion of water, sodium and chloride in perfused rat ileum. Berberine was also found to inhibit the intestinal secretory response of Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli enterotoxins without causing histological damage to the intestinal mucosa. 54 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology Berberine is also active against other intestinal infections that cause acute diarrhea such as Shigella dysenteriae,Salmonella paratyphi and various Klebsiella species.Berberine sulfate has been shown to block the adherence of Streptococcus pyrogenes and E. coli to host cells, possibly explaining it’s mechanism of action against numerous pathogens. Berberine was found to be the active constituent in an extract of Hydrastis canadensis root that demonstrated activity against a multiple drug-resistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosi. Berberine also inhibits Helicobacter pylori. Berberine has a long history of use for eye infections. In one study that looked at the effectiveness in treating trachoma, berberine was better than sulfacetamide in eradicating Chlamydia trachomatis from the eye and preventing a relapse of symptoms. Berberine has a choleretic (bile-stimulating) effect and has been shown to lower bilirubin levels. Berberine inhibited the effects of tumor promotors on the skin using a mouse model. There is evidence that berberine also has a direct tumor killing effect and has the ability to stimulate production of white blood cells. Berberine has hypotensive, antisecretory and sedative effects. The mechanism for these effects may be explained by the fact that berberine has platelet α 2 adrenoceptor agonist activity that is similar to that of clonidine. Berberine inhibits the growth of HepG2 cells by direct interaction with DNA in which it intercalates.

Vinca alkaloids Catharanthus roseus is known as the common or Madagascar periwinkle. Formerly, it was classifi ed as Vinca rosea. It is a perennial evergreen herb in Apocynaceae and originally native to the island of Madagascar. In all 70 alkaloids have been identifi ed in periwinkle. Some have anticancer and hypoglycemic properties. Some act as hemostatics (arrest bleeding). Two groups began working independently on periwinkle in 1950s when they heard of a tea which Jamaicans drank to treat diabetes.

<!-- chunk -->

## Vinblastine (Fig. 5.78) has been especially effective for treating Hodgkin’s

disease. It is the fi rst drug of choice in the treatment of many forms of leukemia and since the 1950’s it has increased the survival rate of childhood leukemias by 80%. Vincristine has been especially effective for treating acute childhood leukemia, often with 99% remission rates. Vinblastine, vincristine, and two semi-synthetic derivatives (vindesine and vinorelbine) all have the same mode of action. They inhibit mitosis in metaphase by binding tubulin. Vinblastine binds to tubulin dimmers in a 1:1 ratio and prevents microtubule formation. Other alkaloids which bind to tubulin include colchicine, maytansine and mescaline, but they have been studied much less than Vinblastine.Vinblastine also seems to fi ght cancer by interfering with glutamic acid metabolism. They are all administered intravenously once a week. The compounds can be fatal if they are administered any other way, and can cause a lot of tissue irritation if they leak out of the vein.

The alkaloids distributed in Solanaceae are of tropine or pyridine type. Tropine alkaloids are formed by combination of Tropic acid and Tropine. Tropine alkaloids are tropane derivatives. Some alkaloids are pyridine (cuscohygrine) or piperdine (isopelliterine) derivatives. Depending upon the basic nucleus, the alkaloids found in Solaneacea are classifi ed into the following types: Phytochemicals 1. Soladulcidine type 2. Solasodine type 3. Tomatidenol type. The majority of alkaloids have anticholinergic activity. They act by

Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (Fig. 5.96) Alkaloids are present in many plants ranging from non-poisonous forms to highly fatal toxic forms. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are one such type, which are highly toxic principles present in Boraginaceae, Compositae, and Leguminosae families. The intoxication is caused by the oral intake of the plants containing the alkaloids either in food or medicinal form. Plants containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids are sometimes contaminated with agricultural crops also. Phytochemicals At least 100 types of pyrrolizidine alkaloids are present in plants. The majority of them are hepatotoxic. The varied manifestations of liver injury caused by pyrrolizidine alkaloids containing herbs are acute and chronic hepatitis, steatosis, hepatic fi brosis, zonal or diffuse hepatic necrosis, bile duct injury, veno-occlusive disease, acute liver failure, and carcinogenesis. Teucrium chamaedrys (germander) causes severe, acute hepatocellular injury. Traditionally it has been used for reducing weight. An elevated level of aminotransferase enzyme has been observed after the intake of the drug.The toxic principle of the herb has not been detected but the presence of pyrrolizidimne alkaloids has been postulated.

<!-- chunk -->

## pyrrolizidine alkaloids including heliosupine, 7-angeloylheliotridine and

<!-- chunk -->

## acetylheloisupine. The herb in experiments has shown that it induces

paralysis in peripheral nerve endings in frogs. The exact cause of this is not known, but because of the presence of the pyrrolizidine alkaloids in the herb, the use should be abolished. The following genera also contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids Senecio longilobus, Lycopodium serratum, Heliotropium eichwaldii, Helitropium indicum, Larrea maxima (chaparral), Crotolaria assamica, Crotolaria juncea,Crotolaria retusa, Eupatorium sp., Alkanna tinctoria (alkanna) Mentha pulegium and Tussilaga farfara (Colt’s foot). All human beings are believed to be susceptible to hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Home remedies and consumption of herbal teas in large quantities can be a risk factor and are the most likely cause of alkaloid poisonings. Evidence of toxicity may not become apparent until sometime after the alkaloid is ingested. The acute illness has been compared to the Budd-Chiari syndrome (thrombosis of hepatic veins, leading to liver enlargement, portal hypertension, and ascites). Early clinical signs include nausea and acute upper gastric pain, acute abdominal distension with prominent dilated veins on the abdominal wall, fever, and biochemical evidence of liver dysfunction. Fever and jaundice may be present. In some cases the lungs are affected; pulmonary edema and pleural effusions have been observed. Lung damage may be prominent and has been fatal.

## 5.4.4 Biofl avonoids

A fl avonoid is identical to a biofl avonoid; furthermore, a fl avonoid by defi nition is a polyphenol, since it contains more than one benzene ring in its structure. However, many regard polyphenols to be tannins. As seen above, green tea has an abundance of fl avonoids and fl avonals as well as tannin. These compounds have been well characterized in the herb and numerous papers support their use as antioxidants or free radical scavengers. 106 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology Flavonoids are an important group of polyphenols, widely distributed in plant fl ora. Four thousand fl avonoids are known to exist and some of

Aescin decreases the transcapillary fi ltration of water and proteins. It has been used to treat a wide variety of infl ammatory and edematous conditions, to reduce swelling associated with bruises, fractures, brain trauma, post-operative and post-traumatic soft tissue swelling, and acute thrombophlebitis. Aescin reduces lysosomal enzyme activity by stabilizing lysosomal membranes and limiting enzyme release. Aescin also improves venous tone by enhancing the constricting effect of noradrenaline. Arterial vessels are not constricted and diastolic blood pressure is not affected. Aescin stimulated the release of prostaglandins (PGF2- (cid:3) ) in the perfused isolated rat lung, and induced prostaglandin- mediated contractions in the isolated portal vein of rats and rabbits. The use of horse chestnut seed in the treatment of chronic venous insuffi ciency has also been supported by placebo-controlled studies. A case series involving more than 5,000 patients with chronic venous insuffi ciency treated with standardized horse chestnut extract reported decreased subjective complaints. Another case series of 1183 patients with chronic venous insuffi ciency receiving an aescin preparation over 5 mon demonstrated a clear reduction in objective and subjective symptoms with few side effects.

Gingerol has been found to have a similar structure to acetyl salicylic acid, and these two compounds have similar effects on prostaglandin production. Some of the benefi cial medicinal qualities claimed for ginger may stem from zingerone’s effectiveness as an antioxidant. Zingerone reacts with free radicals that can cause tissue damage and infl ammation.

## 5.4.12 Tannins

These are widely distributed in plant fl ora. They are phenolic compounds of high molecular weight. Tannins are soluble in water and alcohol and are found in the root, bark, stem and outer layers of plant tissue. Tannins have a characteristic feature to tan, i.e. to convert things into leather. The tannins are acidic in reaction and is attributed to the presence of phenolic or carboxylic group. Tannins form complex with proteins, carbohydrates, gelatin and alkaloids. Tannins are classifi ed in two classes: 1. Hydrolysable tannins. 2. Condensed tannins.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hydrolysable tannins, upon hydrolysis, produce gallic acid (Fig. 5.212)

## 5.4.16 Miscllaneous compounds

5.4.16.1 Diarylheptanoids Diarylheptanoids are rare compounds found in the family Zingiberaceae. They are found in rhizomes of Zingiber offi cinale, Alpinia galangal and Hedychium spicatum. Animal studies have shown diarylheptanoids to be potent anti-infl ammatory agents as they selectively inhibit cycloxygenase enzyme responsible for infl ammation. Gingerenone A and B and galangol are common examples. The pungent odor of Z. offi cinale and A. galangal is due to the presence of these compounds. This group of compounds has not been thoroughly investigated for pharmacological activity. 5.4.16.2 Isofl avones Isofl avones are found in Glycine max (soybean). Clinical research has demonstrated soy isofl avones to be effective in menstrual diseases. They also have an antioxidant activity . Isofl avones belong to a group of compounds known as phyto-estrogens. The isofl avone content of soybean

sulfoxide, an odorless sulfur-containing amino acid derivative), and allicin (diallyldisulfi de-oxide, responsible for the pungent odor of garlic) and ajoene. When garlic is crushed or ground, the enzyme alliinase converts alliin to allicin. Allicin is thought to be responsible for many of the therapeutic benefi ts of garlic. Several investigations suggest that these sulfur compounds may inhibit the induction and growth of cancer. These benefi ts do not appear to be limited to a specifi c carcinogen, tissue or

## 6.1 Introduction

The active principles in medicinal plants are chemical compounds known as secondary plant products or metabolites. Primary plant metabolites can be considered as those metabolites essential to the life of the plant. Ernst Stahl was the pioneer researcher of secondary metabolites. Many biologically active principles have been discovered from the plant kingdom. Some of them discourage herbivores, other inhibit bacterial or fungal pathogens. The biological signifi cance of many secondary metabolites is not exactly known. Secondary metabolites of Rhodiola rosea are depicted in Fig. 6.1. Secondary metabolites are produced by routes other than the normal metabolic pathways, mostly after the phase of active growth and under conditions of defi ciency. Normally the following pathways are involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites: 1. The acetate-malonate pathway 2. Shikiamte pathway 3. Hydroxybenzoate pathway 4. Homegentisate pathway Primary and secondary compound synthesis in plants is represented in Fig. 6.2. Biosynthesis of specialty phytochemicals has been represented in the Figs. 6.3 and 6.4. The active principle or constituent of a drug is usually an alkaloid or glycoside, on the presence of which the characteristic therapeutic action of the substance largely depends. Herbal remedies have been used for centuries but more recently the compounds that are active have 216 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology

been identifi ed and this has enabled them to be extracted and purifi ed. Organic chemists have then been able to provide the molecules in vitro and so produce them on larger scales. History clearly implies that herbal medicines will continue to play a role in the modern drug discovery and development of new drugs. The principal concepts of this process are shown in Fig. 6.5. As suggested in the Figure 6.5, not only single active principles, but also active fractions are validated and improved prescriptions can be investigated for new drug discovery. However, issues should be addressed by transferring herbal medicines from folkloric to mainstream international pharmaceutical use, such as supply, quality control, safety, and proven effi cacy. High quality, batch-to-batch consistency, and effi cacy/safety must be guaranteed using stringent quality control measures including Good Agricultural Practice, Good Manufacturing Practice, and Good Clinical Practice, at each step in the development of standardized new medicines from herbal medicine as shown in Fig. 6.6. The biological signal for a plant to synthesize initial phytochemicals is maturation of the fruit, vegetable and seed. Different parts of a medicinal plant are picked for use in medicine before the phytochemicals are present. This may be described as the basis for picking the medicinal part of a drug at an appropriate time.

According to experts, virya is comparable to active constituent of a drug. Ancient scholars developed the virya parameter to study the therapeutic effi cacy of the drugs. Other alternative systems of medicine like Unani and Siddha give due importance to virya of a drug. In the Unani system of medicine, virya is known as Tasir. CAM believes in using the drug as a whole. This does not mean that active principles have no importance in CAM health practice. Using the drug as a whole, means that the chemical constituents are present in natural synergy with each other. Each constituent contributes towards the biological activity of the medicine/formulation. Let us differentiate between botanical extract and standardized extract. Botanical extracts are prepared by scientifi cally eliminating the non-benefi cial parts of a plant, then continuosly processing it to reach a ratio showing the amount of actual processed vs. the actual amount of benefi cial fi nished product. Standardized extracts are processed by scientifi cally isolating the active constituents desired from a plant. The scientifi c procedure ensures that the fi nished product reaches a specifi c percentage of the desired constituent. Standardized extracts should always show the name of the constituent that has been isolated and its percentage. They are standardized to certain limits of markers or active constituents or both. Phytochemicals and standardized herbal extracts are therapeutically potent as compared to fresh or dried material (Fig. 6.7). During the process of extraction, certain medicinally useful constituents are lost. Like other systems of CAM, Western herbal medicine gives

## phytomedicines

Some of the most popular and widely used phytomedicines are those consisting of St. John’s wort, Echinacea, ginkgo, garlic, kava, and valerian, which have considerable pharmacological and clinical evidence to support their use, and synergy is generally assumed to play a part in their medicinal effects (Table 5.5). Attempts are rarely made to isolate a single constituent from these extracts. In Traditional Indian Medicine (Ayurveda), Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Western Medical Herbalism, the combination of herbs are fundamental to their philosophy as well as being due to empirical observations and historical usage. As an example, pharmaceuticals containing ephedrine, atropine, and menthol, are rarely considered as phytomedicines, despite being derived from plant sources. Modern herbal medicines are usually found as whole or semi-purifi ed extracts and ideally should be standardized for their active constituents wherever possible to ensure clinical reproducibility.

## 6.2.1 Synergy

Synergy means working together. It occurs when the combined action of constituents is greater than would be expected from a consideration of individual constituents. In herbal medicine, better results are obtained with whole plant extracts rather than with isolated constituents. For example, the side-effects of reseprine are not usually found with the crude drug of sarpagandha. If true synergy is occurring in phytomedicines, standardization becomes even more important, since the ratio between 222 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology synergistic agents is critical, and small changes can make results unpredictable. If combination effects are merely additive, changes in the ratio are less crucial. It may therefore be signifi cant to defi ne synergy using the term ‘polyvalent action’. Synergy is deemed present if the total effect of a combination is greater than would be expected from the sum of effects. This can be expressed as follows: E (da, db) = E (da) +E (db) Polyvalent action includes various effects of multiple active constituents acting in combination, in harmony and possible in synergy. In conventional medicine it is common practice to treat a single complaint as in cancer. This applies more to plant extracts, since combinations are already present within the plant. There are good reasons for not isolating active constituents from herbs like St. John’s wort, hawthorn, hops, purple cone fl ower and black cohosh. In herbals like garlic and valerian, active constituents are unstable and attempts to isolate them would render the extract ineffective.

## Example 1: Hypericum perforatum

H. perforatum is traditionally used for the treatment of depression, insomnia, and anxiety. A large body of animal and human clinical research supports its antidepressant effects. Several chemical constituents have been identifi ed in H. perforatum. Hypericin, fl avanols, and xanthones have been shown to inhibit both monoamine oxidase and/or catechol-o- methyltransferase. It has been suggested that exacerbated hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis activity has been associated with the incidence of depression. Corticotropin-releasing factor is thought to be major determinant in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity via activation of CRF (1) receptors. Pseudohypericin (Fig. 6.8) demonstrated antagonistic activity on CRF (1). Thus antidepressant activity of H. perforatum is not only due to hypericin (Fig. 6.8) or hyperforin (Fig. 5.204, chapter 5) but pseudohypericin also contributes to the antidepressant mechanism.

224 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology Hyperforin is a reuptake inhibitor of serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, GABA, and L-glutamate in the nanomolar range (Table 6.2). Radio-labelled hyperforin crosses blood-brain barrier. Four trioxygenated xanthones isolated from the plant and hyperforin-enriched fraction, when combined in suboptimal dosages of 2.5 mg each, caused a signifi cant antidepressant effect which was slightly greater in extent than exhibited by either the hyperforin-enriched- or the xanthone-enriched fraction.

A fl avonoid fraction obtained from crude H. perforatum was active in the forced swimming test. The fraction was further separated into two sub fractions. Both the sub fractions were active in the forced swimming test within varied doses. Further work on fi rst sub fraction showed that the main constituents were hyperoside (Fig. 6.8), isoquercitrin, miquelianin and quercetin. The second sub fraction contained small amounts of hyperoside and astiblin. Further testing on these compounds showed that except for quercetin all the rest were active in the forced swimming test. Pharmacokinetic synergy may occur with H. perforatum, where a combination of constituents improves its oral bioavailability. Procyanidin B2 (Fig. 5.224, Chapter 5) and hyperoside of H. perforatum extract improves the water solubility of hypericin and thereby increases its pharmacological activity in the forced swimming test of Porsolt. Procyanidin increases the water solubility of hypericin, thus increasing its pharmacokinetic availability. Phytochemicals Research-Emerging Concepts

## Example 2: Cannabis sativa (hemp)

The herb has received much attention recently because of the detection of an endogen cannabionoid system in the human brain and the immune system. The endogen cannabionoid system plays a signifi cant role in memory, appetite, lactation, and emesis. Muscle-relaxant, appetite- stimulating, and analgesic effects of (-) trans-delta 9- tetrahydrocannabinol or THC (Fig. 5.205, Chapter 5), are of great interest. A comparative study of cannabis has shown better antispastic activity than THC, as measured in an immunogenic model of multiple sclerosis. The synergistic effect demonstrated with cannabis extract is probably due to presence of cannabidiol or CBD (Fig. 6.9) in the extract, which elevates the level of THC in the brain and at the same time, attenuates the undesired anxiolytic effect of THC. At the same time CBD amplifi es the antispastic effect of THC. Amplifi cation of the antispastic effect is not understood but it is assumed that CBD increases the permeation of THC into the muscles.

Procyanidins and fl avone C-glycosides appear to be the main constituents responsible for cardiac tonic effect of the plant. In vitro studies have demonstrated the inhibitory effect of hawthorn extract containing procyanidins and fl avonoids on angiotensin converting enzyme. As one is aware of the antioxidant, anti-infl ammatory and antiplatelet activities of fl avonoids, it is necessary to produce hawthorn extract having both procyanidins and fl avonoids.

## Example 4: Piper methysticum (kava kava)

The plant is well known for anti-anxiety and sedative effects. The active constituents are known as kavalactones or kavapyrones including kavain, dihydrokavain, yongonin, methysticin, and dihydromethysticin. Kavalactones cross the blood-brain barrier and behavorial effects occur at micromolar concentrations. Kavalactones enhance binding to the GABA A receptor in low micromolar concentrations, through a non- benzodiazepine mechanism. They also block voltage gated Na. sup.+ and Ca. sup.+ channels in micromolar concentrations. Further, kavalactones 226 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology interact with monoamine oxidase systems by blocking the reuptake of neurotransmitters and inhibiting MAO sub B. Combined kavalactones, kavain and dihydromethysticin (Fig. 6.10), act in an additive manner to inhibit Ca. sup.+ channels. Yongonin given with other kava lactones (i.p.) reaches levels 20 times higher in the brain than when given alone. Similarly, kavain levels in the brain are doubled when given in combination of other kavalactones. O O H 3 C O O O CH 3 O O Kavain Yongonin O O O H3C O Methysticin

## 6.3 Multidrug and multitarget therapy with phytomedicine

In the last decade, two revolutionary shifts occurred in classical traditional medicine: A. Gradual withdrawal from the dogma of monosubstance therapy and an increasing transition to the treatment of patients with drug combinations. B. Transition to a new kind of multitarget therapy, which is directed primarily towards the activation of defense, protective and repair mechanisms of the body rather than towards the direct destruction of the damaging agents. Phytomedicine has long followed and developed the above mentioned strategies by using the monoextracts or extract combinations containing mixtures of bioactive compounds. The strategies are based on therapeutic experiences and the consideration that a complex pathophysiological process can be infl uenced more effectively and with less side-effects by combination of several low dosage compounds.

## 6.4 Phytomedicine and cancer

Recently, numerous reviews of plant derived chemo preventive compounds have identifi ed their role in the treatment of cancer. The chemo preventive compounds, precisely known as phytopharmaceuticals, are dietary ingredients, which being food derived, are considered pharmacologically safe. Some of the common chemo- preventive dietary compounds derived from dietary ingredients are depicted in Fig. 6.11.

Botanical medicines are complex natural mixtures of pharmacological musltitaskers, simultaneously exerting infl uence on different levels and via different mechanisms. By contrast, pharmaceutical drugs are classically single synthetic compounds, ideally interfering or disrupting specifi c mechanism.

## 6.5 Phytochemicals and bacterial resistance

Recently there has been a growing interest in characterizing new antimicrobial substances from medicinal plants. The interest can be ascribed to three factors: 1. In terms of plant ecology, plants produce antibacterial metabolites as part of chemical defense. 2. There are countless examples of plants, which have been used topically and systemically to treat bacterial infections. 3. Functional group chemistry, chirality and chemical diversity of phytochemicals. Soy (isofl avones) Pineapple (bromelain) Grapes (resveratrol) Green tea (catechin) Berries (anthocyanidins) Cayenne (capsaicin) Citrus (limonene) Ginger (gingerols) Garlic (allicin) Turmeric (curcumin) Cruciferous vegetables (isothiocyanates) BIOACTIVE PLANT COMPOUNDS Quercitin 228 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology Hyperforin, the acylpholoroglucinol from Hypericum perforatum, has been reported to have antibiotic properties. However it has very low minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and penicillin resistant variants. Sinaicione from Hypericum sinaicum and chinensin from Hypericum chinense are other plant derived antibacterial. Filicinic acid derivatives: drummondin D, isodrummondin D, drummondin E, and drummondin F, extracted from Hypericum drummondii possesses strong antibiotic activity against the Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus and Bacillus subtilis and the acid fast bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis. Falcarindiol from roots of the Chinese medicinal plant Angelica dahurica have been reported effective against effl uxing multidrug-resistant variants of S.aureus. Many clinically relevant bacteria express effl ux mechanisms of resistance. By these mechanisms the bacteria are able to prevent penetration of drugs in side cells. Multidrug resistance (MDR) is posing a real problem in treating bacterial infections. Recently phytochemicals have been added with antibiotics to inhibit multi -drug resistance. Berberine (Fig. 5.5, Chapter 5) and fl avonolignan, methoxyhydnocarpin (Fig. 6.12) have been isolated from Berberis sp. Antibacterial activity of berberine is potentiated by methoxyhydnocarpin. This observation has led to the possibility that plants produce both antibacterial compounds and compounds which target bacterial effl ux mechanisms to inhibit possible resistance to latent plant antibacterial in bacteria in their environment.

## 6.6 Role of phytochemicals in healthcare system

Medicinal plants are a signifi cant source of synthetic and herbal drugs in India and China and have been on the forefront when one refers to phyto drugs. The traditional systems of medicines: Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Western Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Homeopathy have roots in medicinal herbs. A number of distinguished researchers have Phytochemicals Research-Emerging Concepts dealt with herbal medicine and due to its accessibility to traditions; it is still practiced even by lay practitioners. Sterneur isolated morphine from Papaver somniferum (opium poppy) and showed the medical profession that certain phytochemicals produced in plant cells are responsible for pharmacological activity. Later, other alkaloids isolated from opium poppy were investigated for their pharmacological activities. Codeine showed antitussive activity and papaverine antispasmodic activity. The opium based extracts have been utilized for various pharmacological activities, and a number of alkaloids distributed in the plant have different pharmacological activities. Scientifi c validation of phytodrugs has been always questioned, but with recent advances and publication of clinical trials, the researchers and the public are viewing herbal products with more of an open mind. In the commercial market, medicinal herbs are used as raw drugs, extracts or tinctures. Isolated active constituents are used for applied research. There has been a dramatic rise in the sale of phyto products like Allium sativum, Hypericum perforatum, Spirulina, Echinacea angustifolia, Ginkgo biloba and Silybum marianum. Among phytochemicals distributed in plants, fl avonoids sterols and xanthones are of particular interest for a wide range of medicinal activities. Recently several research papers have been published favoring effi cacy of these specialty phytochemicals as medicinal agents (see the table below).

## Dietary phytochemicals are also known as phytonutrients. Phytonutrients

are nutrients derived from plant material that have been shown to be necessary for sustaining human life (distinction form phytochemicals). About 800 phytonutrients are known to exist in plant kingdom. The National Cancer Institute recommends eating at least 5–9 servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Other reputable sources recommend at least 9 servings for men, 7 servings for women, and 5 servings for children. 230 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology Research shows that fruits and vegetables are powerful defenders of our health. Research supporting a critical role for fruits and vegetables in good health grows stronger all the time. Scientists now agree that fruits and vegetables should be the foundation of a healthy diet. Phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables can also help reduce your risk of many chronic diseases including cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and other diseases.

Recent studies have found that cinnamon may have a benefi cial effect on blood sugar. Sixty people with type 2 diabetes took 1, 3, or 6 grams of cinnamon in pill form daily, an amount roughly equivalent to one quarter of a teaspoon to 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. After 40 d, all 3 amounts of cinnamon reduced fasting blood glucose by 18 to 29%, triglycerides by 23 to 30%, LDL cholesterol by 7 to 27%, and total cholesterol by 12 to 26%. Another study looked at the effect of cinnamon on 79 people with type 2 diabetes who were not on insulin therapy but were taking oral anti- diabetic medications or modifying their diet. They took approximately 3 grams of cinnamon or a placebo 3 times a day for 4 mon. There was a signifi cant reduction in blood glucose in the people taking cinnamon compared to people taking the placebo. Surprisingly, there was no difference in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels, a test that measures how well blood sugar has been controlled during the previous 3 to 4 mon.

## ahead

There is no doubt that phytochemicals have the potential as pharmaceutical agents or drugs. In the past, several phytochemicals have been used in the medical practice with signifi cant success. With the emergence of points like drug-resistance and cost effectiveness of synthetic drugs, scientists are targeting phytochemicals for developing cheap as well as potent drugs. According to experts, export of herbal materials and medicines can shoot upto 10,0000 million by 2010 from 4460 million in mid 2003. The international market for herbal remedies is more then US$ 60 billion per year and growing at a rate of 7%. With increased consumer demand for phyto products, the market for phytochemicals is defi nitely promising. Herbal drug industry has witnessed the emergence of subjects like phytopharmacovigilance. The subject deals with the safety index of herbal drugs. It is defi ned as “the systematic research of the safety of herbal medicines”. The main challenges in treating phytochemicals as drugs are discussed below: 236 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology

## A. Herbal/phytochemical-drug interactions

Due to the revised interest in herbal medicine, people are favoring nutraceuticals and botanical supplements. As the same time several companies have introduced designed or pharma foods in the market. These are a rich source of phytochemicals having antioxidant, anti-aging and chemo protective effects. Recent studies have reported that phytomedicines have a modulatory effect on drug-metabolizing enzymes, (particularly cytochrome 450) leading to potential drug interactions. Phytochemicals have the tendency to elevate as well as suppress the cytochrome 450 system. Sales of over-the-counter (OTC) products in 1998 soared to US$46.6 billion, with pharmacies capturing approximately 33%, or US$15.4 billion of the sales. Likewise, the sale of herbal supplements rose to approximately US$5 billion in 2000. Pharmacists routinely advise patients on the use of OTC medicines, and with an increased use of herbal medicines among patients, knowledge of appropriate potential interactions between pharmaceutical drugs, including OTC medications, and herbal supplements is becoming increasingly important. Some of the best-selling herbal supplements are ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba, used for increasing peripheral blood fl ow and in senile dementia), Asian/ Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng, used as an ‘adaptogen’ to help regulate the body’s reaction to various stresses), garlic (Allium sativum), used for cardiovascular health including hypercholesterolemia), echinacea (Echinacea purpurea/ angustifolia), used to support the immune system, especially in the prevention and treatment of colds and infl uenza), St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), used in the management of mild to moderate depression), and saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), used in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (Fig. 6.18). Despite the widespread concurrent use of conventional medicines and herbal supplements, documented herb– drug interactions (HDIs) are still sparse and consist mainly of isolated case reports and laboratory studies. For most potential interactions of herbs and drugs that are reported, the theories are based on very high doses of isolated phytochemicals in laboratory models, or conclusions are drawn from similarities in the pharmacology of constituents in the herb and a particular drug. A customer may say, “Herbs have been used safely for thousands of years.” While this may be true, the people using those herbs were not on several medications at the same time (Fig. 6.19). Below is a reference chart listing potential Herb–OTC interactions. Pharmacists should be always aware of the documented or potential interactions between herbal supplements and prescription drugs.

## Hypericin and hyperforin

As an herbal remedy, Hypericum perforatum has not been subjected to the rigorous clinical testing of modern drug candidates. Several recent reports provide evidence that St. John’s wort promotes the metabolism of coadministered drugs, including the HIV protease inhibitor indinavir, the immunosuppressant cyclosporin, and oral contraceptives. Because each of these drugs is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, a monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of many xenobiotics, these fi ndings suggested that St. John’s wort might induce CYP3A4 expression. Transcription of CYP3A4 is known to be induced by a range of xenobiotics, including drugs such as the antibiotic rifampicin, the antimycotic clotrimazole, the insulinsensitizer troglitazone, and the barbiturate phenobarbital. 240 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology Hyperforin and H. perforatum extracts induce CYP3A4 in hepatocyte cells via the pregnane X nuclear receptor which controls CYP3A4 expression. The crude extracts of H. perforatum inhibit CYP2C9, CYP2CI9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. The extracts were further fractioned and each fraction was tested for inhibitory action on the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activities. Hyperforin, amentofl avone, hypericin, quercetrin and chlorogenic acid, all demonstrated inhibitory affect on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activities. Amentofl avone was shown to be potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. Hyperforin was shown as potent non- competitive inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Hypericin also demonstrated inhibitory activity. The author concluded that H. perforatum extracts contains compounds that have potent inhibitory activity on major drug metabolizing enzymes. A study investigated the effect of H. perforatum on cytochrome CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Seven healthy volunteers were orally administered alprazolam and dextromethorphan along with H. perforatum. Urinary concentrations of alprazolam and dextromethorphan and dextromethorphan metabolic ratios were determined. The authors concluded no signifi cant difference in pharmacokinetic profi le of alprazolam or dextromethorphan metabolic ratios. In a human study, 13 healthy volunteers were given 300mg standardized extract H. perforatum TID for 14 d. 24 h urinary excretion ratios of 6-betahydroxycortisol/ cortisol were used as an index of CYP3A4 activity. A signifi cant increase, from zero up to around 2.5x over base was found in urinary ratios in 12 subjects, suggestive of 3A4 induction. According to a study, researchers were able to determine the structure of a signifi cant molecule (PXR) present in the liver and responsible for the metabolism of a majority of the drugs consumed by humans. The molecule is a regulator of the protein known as P450-3A, which is responsible for breaking the drugs. Recently interactions of H. perforatum have been suggested with oral contraceptives, antivirals and transplant drugs. A study reported that hyperforin contributes to the hepatic CYP3A- inducing effect of H. perforatum extract in the mouse. A hydro alcoholic extract containing 4.5% hyperforin was given at a dose of 300 mg/kg b.i.d. for 4 and 12 d. Hyperforin, its main phloroglucinol component, was given as dicyclohexylammonium salt (18.1 mg/kg, b.i.d.) on the basis of its content in the extract, to ensure comparable exposure to hyperforin. The extract increased hepatic erythromycin-N-demethylase activity, which is cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP) 3A-dependent, about 2.2-fold after 4 d of dosing, with only slightly greater effect after 12 d (2.8 times controls). Hyperforin too increased erythromycin-N-demethylase activity within 4 d to much the same extent as the extract (1.8 times the activity Phytochemicals Research-Emerging Concepts of controls), suggesting that it behaves qualitatively and quantitatively like the extract as regards induction of CYP3A activity. This effect was confi rmed by Western blot analysis of hepatic CYP3A expression. Exposure to hyperforin at the end of the four days’ treatment was still similar to that with extract of H. perforatum, although it was variable and lower than after the fi rst dose in both cases, further suggesting that hyperforin plays a key role in CYP3A induction by the extract of H. perforatum in the mouse. In a subsequent study, it was shown that hyperforin induces the expression of numerous drug metabolism and excretion genes in primary human hepatocytes. The researchers determined the crystal structure of hyperforin in complex with the ligand binding domain of human PXR. Hyperforin induces conformational changes in PXR’s ligand binding pocket relative to structures of human PXR elucidated previously and increases the size of the pocket by 250 A. It was found that the mutation of individual aromatic residues within the ligand binding cavity changes PXR’s response to particular ligands. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PXR employs structural fl exibility to expand the chemical space it samples and that the mutation of specifi c residues within the ligand binding pocket of PXR tunes the receptor’s response to ligands. Recently it has been reported that H. perforatum can reduce the effi cacy of chemotherapy drug known as irinotecan. The study was based on previous fi ndings that H. perforatum can stimulate cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4), an enzyme system involved in drug metabolism. Specifi cally, researchers took the premise that hypericin and hyperforin-components of H. perforatum seem to enhance CYP3A4 activity and the fact that irinotecan is also partly metabolized by the enzyme system (see Fig. 6.20).

Upon activation, PXR forms a heterodimer with the 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (RXR), and this complex binds to the xenobiotic response elements (PXRE) in the CYP3A4 gene. The transcription of the gene is increased, and more CYP3A4 id formed, thereby increasing the metabolism of irinoetcan into an inactive metabolite, oxidized irinotecan. The amount of irinotecan left to be metabolized into SN-38 decreases, leaving less active SN-38 and lower therapeutic effi cacy of irinotecan.

## Guggulsterones (Fig. 5.205)

The molecular basis for the lipid-lowering action of guggulsterones has been suggested to be an antagonism of the farnesoid X receptor, a member of the nuclear receptor super family of ligand-activated transcription factors. Guggulsterones activate the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and pregnane X receptor with EC 50 values in low micromolar range. Guggulsterone-mediated activation of pregnane X receptor induces the expression of CYP3A genes both in rodent and human hepatocytes. Pregnane X receptor activation is known to cause herb-drug interactions and it has been suggested that guggulipid therapy should be used cautiously in patients taking prescription medications that are metabolized by the CYP3A family members.

## Forskolin (Fig. 5.244)

It is an active ingredient in Coleus forskohlii extract. Recent fi ndings have suggested that forskolin and its nonadenyl cyclase-activating analog 1, dideoxyforskolin induce CYP3A gene expression in primary hepatocytes by functioning as agonists of the pregnane X receptor. Activation of the protein kinase-A signaling potentiates pregnane X receptor-mediated induction of CYP3A gene expression in cultured hepatocytes and increases the strength of pregnane X receptor-coactivator protein-protein interaction in cell-based assays.

## B. Adverse drug interactions

The use of complementary and adjunctive therapy has been steadily increasing in the U.S. since the 1960s. This can be attributed to several factors, in particular to over 80 million ‘baby boomers’ embracing alternative medicine as a way to enhance their medical care. The perceived coldness and remoteness of conventional medicine; the entanglement of managed care in red tape; continued emphasis on ‘natural’ which supposedly connotes ‘ better’, as well as the popularity of vegetarian practices have also contributed to the general population’s increasing involvement with alternative medicine. In 1999, 40% of Americans sought alternative medical treatment, outpacing visits to conventional primary care physicians. Phytochemicals Research-Emerging Concepts Till date, there is scarce or very limited data for adverse drug reaction profi le of phytochemicals. This may be attributed to lack of clinical trials with phytochemicals. In phytomedicine, most of the clinical studies have been conducted with herbal extracts standardized to a certain quantity of phytochemical rather than purifi ed phytochemicals. According to Edwards, World Health Organization Adverse Drug Reaction (WHO ADR) has documented 3.6 million adverse drug reactions. Of these, 41,439 are directly or indirectly related to phytodrugs. It should be noted that most of the adverse drug reactions related to phytodrugs are those of crude preparations or extracts and not of phytochemicals. Let us concentrate on nephrotxicity of herbs (see Tables 1.1 and 1.2). The consensus of many renal clinicians is that medicinal herbal use, with its known potent pharmacological activity, chemical components (some unknown), microbial content, and ability to interfere with medications, is rendered dangerous and even unadvisable for the renal patient. Herbal preparation-induced acute renal necrosis and chronic renal failure belie the assumed innocuous nature of these preparations. Substantial morbidities such as chronic renal failure, dialysis, or renal transplant and even death have been seen with herbal products. Since these herbal preparations are not single chemical entities, no activity of toxic component can be subjected to standardized tests of effi cacy and safety.

## withaferin-A

Sangwan et al., 2004 reported the variability of withaferin-A (Fig. 5.249, Chapter 5) in commercial preparations of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera). Commercial samples consisting of 250 mg Ashwagandha (as indicated on the label) were investigated for their phytochemical contents. The samples were quantifi ed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. The amount of withaferin-A estimated in commercial samples is given in Table 5.6. There was signifi cant variation in relative amount of withaferin A. The study refl ected a 117-fold higher concentration of withaferin A in the highest (product 1) holding product compared to one with the least (product 10). Further, according to the recommended intake of the product as mentioned on the label, the dose of withaferin A ranged from 0.02 mg to 1.4 mg.

## The data deals with the evaluation of allicin (Fig. 5.270, Chapter 5): levels in

Australian grown garlic. A total of 200 garlic samples were collected from producers in the Australian states of Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia. The 200 samples tested recorded allicin yields in the range 0.5 to 9.0 mg/g (by fresh weight) with the majority of samples in the 3.0 to 6.0 mg/g range (Fig. 6.21).

Almost 50% (95 out of 200) of the samples assayed had allicin yields over 4.5 mg/g, (i.e., ‘pharmaceutical grade’) and a further 10% of the samples were in the 4.0–4.5 mg/g range. As a comparison to allicin levels previously cited in scientifi c literature, the highest previously recorded allicin level was 7.7 mg/g (by fresh weight) for Romanian Red garlic grown in New York, USA (Table 1.1). Six samples of the Australian grown garlic tested in the current study recorded allicin yields higher than 7.7 mg/g. The next highest allicin yield recorded prior to this study was 6.7 mg/g for Spanish Roja grown in the USA and 6.6 mg/g for Laotouxu garlic obtained from China. Fifteen Australian grown samples from the current study exceeded this level and a number of these samples are listed in Table 5.22.

## E. Cost-effectiveness of isolation methods

Cost-effectiveness of isolation methods of phytochemicals is an important factor in determining the future of phytomedicine. Isolating bioactive compounds is very expensive and complicated. Further a lack of public awareness about health benefi ts of phytomedicine and phytochemicals is another obstacle.

## Conclusion

According to one estimate, only 20% of the plant fl ora has been screened for drugs. Keeping in view the vast treasure of medicinal herbs, one can expect phytochemicals to play a signifi cant role as modern medical science has limited options for diseases like diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Work on the identifi cation and isolation of phytochemicals is an ongoing process and phytomedicine is expected to play a critical role in the future of the healthcare system.

## Therapeutic Utility of Ayurveda

<!-- chunk -->

## 7.1 Introduction

Ayurveda is considered to be the mother of all systems of healing. It is defi ned as a science of life and teaches us what is harmful and what is useful for health. The subject of Ayurveda is divided into eight distinct branches ranging from medicine to geriatrics. For diagnozing diseases, Ayurveda has its own concept like pulse examination, eye and urine diagnosis. Treatment is based on drugs of herbs, minerals and animal origin. Ayurvedic pharmacy is a vast subject and drugs are formulated as powder, decoction, infusion and fl uid extract. Recent trends have suggested the global acceptance of Ayurveda as a science. Various studies have reported increased patient visits to alternative health care practitioners. World Health Organization (WHO) has also recognized certain alternative systems of healing. Ayurvedic medicinal plants are in high demand and some of these (established in Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia) have been screened for pre-clinical studies. Asparagus racemosus (shatavari), Terminalia arjuna (arjuna), Terminalia chebula (haritaki), Tinospora cordifolia (guduchi) and Withania somnifera (ashwagandha) have been identifi ed as plants of good therapeutic potential. However there are concerns over the quality of drugs used in Ayurveda. While the process of procurement of the raw material to the fi nished product appears to be easy, it is not a simple job. The biggest drawback is lack of agricultural and testing standards. These have an ultimate impact on quality control and effi cacy of herbal formulations. Recently the Ayurvedic drug market faced a ban on the sale of certain herbo-mineral formulations in the US market.

## 7.2 Quality standards and Ayurveda

Ayurveda has survived as a science since centuries. Ayurveda was preached by distinguished personalities like Charaka, Sushruta, Madhva 252 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology and Kashyapa. These people established the fundamental aspects of the science which are are still valid today. Later scholars like Vagabhatta, Chakrapani, Arundutta, and Dalhana did a commendable job in preserving this ancient wisdom. Before screening a medicine from the Ayurvedic point of view, the following parameters are observed: 1. Substance (Dravya). 2. Taste (Rasa). 3. Property (Guna). 4. Potency (Virya). 5. Post-digestion effect (Vipaka). 6. Therapeutics (Prabhva). 7. Pharmacological activity (Karma). Since Ayurveda has served humanity for centuries, it is but obvious that without internal quality standards it was not possible for the system to survive. Lack of documentation of ancient medical knowledge seems to be the limiting factor for Ayurveda. Oral transmission was the major tool for transferring theoretical as well as practical knowledge. However after 17th century the scholars felt the need of documentation and several ‘Nighantu’ were written. Nighantu is the Sanskrit word equivalent to Materia Medica (medicinal botany or pharmacognosy). Just like all health systems, the concept of standardization exists in Ayurveda. Charaka, the great Indian physician, has described methods for collection of plant parts in appropriate seasons. In Ayurveda or other herbal systems of medicine, various plant parts ranging from roots to bark are used in formulations. The theme about collecting plant parts in the appropriate season is related to the presence of the active principle- the curative factor of herbals remedies. Today we have isolated the active principles of the plants and given them names like alkaloids and glycosides. The ancient scholars were well aware of the active principles of plant-based remedies. They described it in terms of virya (potency). Ayurvedic pharmacy is a highly developed subject. The herbs are processed into various pharmacopoeial preparations like infusions, decoctions, powders, expressed juice and extracts. Herbs are taken in a specifi c ratio and subjected to various methods like incineration, distillation or extraction. Although these methods apparently seem to be crude but keeping in mind the lack of scientifi c instruments in the Vedic era it can defi nitely be said that the science was at its peak. Doses of all the pharmacopoeial preparations and the mode of administration are been well defi ned in Ayurvedic texts. When we study the nomenclature of medicinal plants from the Ayurvedic point of view, it can be said that names were assigned on anatomical or physiological basis. Brahami is classical example of this. Therapeutic Utility of Ayurveda The leaf of the plant has a similarity to cerebral hemispheres of the human brain. It may be the basis of extensive use of Brahami in the treatment of brain related diseases.The name of Ashwagandha has been derived from the smell of the root which resembles that of a horse feces. Due to lack of development of subjects like taxonomy the ancient scholars devised names mostly on an organo-leptic basis. Ayurvedic drugs have given the scientifi c community a lead to discover molecules from plants. Cassia tora (Chakrmurda) is widely used in the treatment of ringworm in Ayurveda. As the name suggests the plant is useful in the treatment of skin disease with round margins. It was on this lead that chrysophanic acid was isolated from this plant. Earlier when standard antipsoriatic medications were not available, chrysophanic acid was the main stay of antipsoriatic treatment. This is not the only case as many plants provide us with lead molecules for respective segments based on description (irrespective of the objective or subjective factor) in ancient texts. On the whole it can be said that quality standards do exist in Ayurveda. Due to a lack of laboratory facilities and proper clinical documentation these standards were never fully developed.

## 7.3 Controversial Medicinal Plant Identifi cation in

<!-- chunk -->

## Ayurevda

Proper identifi cation of medicinal plants has a signifi cant impact on the fi nished product and therapeutics. In Ayurveda identifi cation of medicinal plants is a major hurdle in laying pharmacopeial standards for formulations. Astavarga (a group of eight medicinal plants; see Table 5.24) is vital part of Ayurvedic formulations like Chyvanprasha and four plants viz, Riddhi, Vriddhi, Jivaka and Rishbhaka have been discussed as possible members of the family Orchidaceae. Although work has been

## done on identifi cation of medicinal plants mentioned under Astavarga,

much remains to be done to identify the true representatives.

## Table 7.1 Eight medicinal plants used in Ashtavarga. The plants marked with stars have been

reported to be orchids. Table 7.1 contd... 254 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology In Ayurveda pasanbheda is a drug of controversial origin. The plant is widely used in the treatment of kidney ailments particularly kidney stones. Various medicinal plants are used as pasanbheda in different parts of India (see Table 5.25).

<!-- chunk -->

## Table 7.2 It shows possible representatives of pasanbheda, an Ayurvedic drug of controversial

origin. Further work on proper botanical identifi cation of pasanbheda is warranted. In the Indian market several commercial lithontriptic preparations are sold for dissolving kidney stones. Some formulations utilize Bergenia ligulata while others Bryophyllum calycinum. The situation is quite confusing for practicing physicians. Further work on proper botanical identifi cation of pasanbheda is warranted. Studies done on plants like Cratavea nurvala (varun) have shown that the active constituents of the plant including lupeol possess signifi cant antiurolithiatic activity in animal models. Most of the companies marketing herbal products are dependent on animal fi ndings. Clinical data is very limited with Ayurvedic drugs. In the studies that have been done, the pattern remains objectionable or inconclusive. In case of pasanbheda, studies similar to that of Cratavea nurvala should be done for all representatives (mentioned in Table 1.2) so as to understand the mode of action and justify the rationale use of the drug. Botanical identity is of prime importance while creating a formulation. Table 7.1 contd... Therapeutic Utility of Ayurveda The list is endless. In the subsequent table we have listed some controversial drugs used in Ayurveda for the benefi t of potential readers.

<!-- chunk -->

## Ayurveda

In Ayurvedic Materia Medica approximately 800 medicinal plants are actively used in creating formulations. Some of the plants are used as single entity in the form of powder, tablet or extract. There is a clear cut description that certain plants should not be subjected to decoction or infusion as it essentially kills the active principle or constituent. Modern studies have proved that if alkaloid containing drugs are subjected to heat at 60oC, they undergo hydrolysis and get converted into isomeride (a compound having the same kind of atoms but with different stereochemistry). In this case it appears to be coherence between traditional and modern view. The majority of medicinal plants used in Ayurveda have been subjected to phytochemcial screening and active principles have been identifi ed. Further pre-clinical (pharmacological investigations) have justifi ed the traditional medical claims of Ayurveda. In the subsequent table we have tried to document pre-clinical research on medicinal plants used in Ayurveda with respect to bioactive constituents. Table 7.3 contd...

## 7.5 Clinical research in Ayurveda

Ayurvedic sciences are expected to play a signifi cant role in the future healthcare system. With the onset of research and development activities in Ayurveda and the herbal system of medicine, there is an acute need for conducting clinical trials with traditional drugs. Most of the work reported in literature is based on pre-clinical studies. Some drugs like Terminalia arjuna (for hearts aliments) and Commiphora mukul (for obesity and arthritis) have been scientifi cally validated for ancient claims. The need of the hour is documentation of clinical knowledge on herbs available with us. At the same time clinical trials on ancient formulations are also warranted. In the subsequent table clinical trials on selected medicinal plants used in Ayurvevda have been elaborated.

## 7.6 Future trends

Ayurveda is moving from the fringe to mainstream use with a greater number of people seeking remedies free of the side-effects caused by synthesized chemicals. Alternative systems of medicine have become increasingly popular in recent years. The effi cacy of some herbal products is beyond doubt, the most recent examples being Artemisia annua, Silymarin marianum and Taxus brevifolia. Several medicinal plants used in Ayurveda (as discussed in this chapter) are being targeted for possible drug development. The future market belongs to standardized Ayurvedic preparations, which have self explanatory advantages over crude drugs.

## Amchi System of Medicine

<!-- chunk -->

## 8.1 Introduction

The Amchi System of medicine (ASM) or Tibetan Medical System (TMS) is one of the practicing systems of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), also known as Sowa Rigpa (classical Tibetan), which means ‘science of life’. Amchi signifi es doctor or physician. Fundamental aspects of the Amchi system of medicine are similar to traditional Indian Medicine (TIM) or Ayurveda. It is estimated that the Amchi System of medicine is the outcome of aspects of medicine that were transmitted from India to Tibet between the 7th and 12th centuries. ASM however, did not make advances as Traditional Indian Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Homeopathy and Western Medicinal Herbalism.

<!-- chunk -->

## 8.2 Basic principles

Historically, the amchi would begin their medical training at an early age. Their knowledge and skills have been transferred from teacher to student, often from father to son. Thus, lineages of amchi families exist throughout the Tibetan cultural world. After learning how to read and write classical Tibetan and studying relevant religious texts, students would learn their vocation by apprenticing with an elder amchi and studying the Gyud Shi, or the Four Root Tantra texts of Tibetan medicine. Young amchi would also learn how to identify and collect medicinal plants, make medicine, remove poisonous qualities of certain ingredients, diagnoze disease using pulse and urine analysis, and provide prescriptions for patients. They would also be trained in moxibustion, cauterization, and other healing techniques. Likewise, the amchi would receive training in astrology, which is an essential component of diagnosis and treatment within the Tibetan medical tradition. 264 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology

## 8.3 Range of drugs used

The present study deals with the Tibetan Medical System and the ingredients used in preparing various ethno medicines to cure several ailments by amchis inhabiting Ladakh and the Lahaul-Spiti region of the Indian trans-Himalaya. A total of 337 plant species, 38 species of animals and six minerals were documented during the survey period. Among 83 amchis interviewed, 36% had disciples or students, primarily their own sons and daughters. The study refl ects that the Tibetan system of medicine is declining in the study area due to the shift in socio-economic patterns and unwillingness of the younger generation to adopt amchi as a profession. Cold deserts are found in the interior of Asia and in the inter mountain zone of North America. In India, cold desert comes under the trans- Himalayan zones, which are confi ned to Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir, Lahaul and Spiti in Himachal Pradesh. The Indian cold desert fl ora is dominated by a few dwarf bushes. Like other parts of the Himalayas, these areas are considered as a treasure of medicinal plants. Keeping in view the above, the Field Research Laboratory (FRL) DRDO carried out extensive ethno-medico- botanical surveys of different parts of the Indian cold desert and has collected 425 plant species, which are used by amchis (herbal doctor) for various ailments. The local tribals have a strong belief in the amchi system of medicine. The important medicinal taxa are Podophyllum hexandrum, Aconitum heterophyllum, Saussurea obvallata, Gentiana aligida, Artemisia sp., Oxytropis microphylla, and Cremanthodium ellisii. Detailed phytochemical and pharmacological studies are required for positive exploitation and wider application of these Amchi-medico- taxa. The majority of medicinal fl ora of the Indian cold desert are rare, endangered and threatened due to unscientifi c exploitation, overgrazing, uprooting for fuel and natural disasters. Therefore, there is a need to conserve the rare and precious cold desert medicinal plants by opening nature reserves and botanical gardens and by developing practices to popularize their commercial cultivation. Amchis may also create confi dential mixtures of medicines for a patient. This confi dentiality was maintained and no data regarding those mixtures were recorded. When permission was granted, the plants species has been indicated (for example with the confi dential nature of the mixture noted). Many plant species are used by amchis to treat a broad range of ailments, while some plant species are found to treat only one aliment. For example, Allium oreoprasum, Aster diplostephioides, and Neopicrorhiza scrophulariifl ora treat a broad range of ailments, while Maharanga bicolor, Maharanga emodi, etc. are used to treat only one ailment (ear pain). In total, 91 medicinal plants were found to be used to Amchi System of Medicine treat 93 ailments. The most commonly treated ailments include gastritis, cough and cold, edema, stomachache, diarrhea, dysentery, jaundice, rheumatism, and numbness of limbs.

Cicerbita macrorhiza (Royle) P Beauv (Asteraceae) The plant is used as febrifuge. Rubus foliolosus (Rubiaceae) It is given in fever, dyspepsia, cough, cold, vertigo. The plant from Japan is reported to contain labdene type diterpene glycosides. Aster diplostephioides (DC) CB Clarke. (Asteraceae) The fl owers are used in Tibetan medicine, they are said to have a bitter taste and a cooling potency. Antidote, febrifuge, haemostatic and tonic, are used in the treatment of infectious fevers, infl uenza, nose bleeds, poisoning, sores from environmental poisoning and an inability to stretch or contract the limbs. Delphinium brunonianum Royle (Ranunculaceae) Amchi name: Bcha-rog-spos. It is commonly known as Musk Larkspur. In the Himalayas it is only used to destroy ticks on animals. Rhododendron anthopogon D.Don (Ericaceae) In Nepal, the leaves are boiled and the vapor inhaled to treat coughs and colds. Rhododendron lepidotum Wall ex D Don (Ericaceae) Two new coumarin glycosides, named rhodonin and rhodonetin were isolated from the aerial parts of R. lepidotum. The plant is reported to have antioxidant and antiviral activities. Neopicrorhiza scrophulariifl ora (Pennell) DY Hong (Scrophulariaceae) This plant is found in the inventory of medicinal plants used in the Amchi system of medicine. It is among rare plants used in the amchi system of medicine, which has been investigated phytochemically. Phenylpropanoid glycosides: scrophulosides A and B, androsin and picroside- I have been reported. Three iridoid glycosides, picrorosides A, B and C, and a cucurbitacin glycoside, scrophoside A, have been isolated from the rhizomes, along with two known iridoid glycosides, picrosides I and II, and three known cucurbitacin glycosides. 266 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology Four new non-glycosidic iridoids, piscrocins D, E, F, and G , as well as two new iridoid glycosides, piscrosides A and B, were isolated from the roots, together with seven known iridoids.

## Ethnopharmacology of Algae

<!-- chunk -->

## 9.1 Introduction

The oldest account known about the use of algae comes from the Chinese King, Shen Nang 2,700 years B.C. Data on the usage of algae in Traditional Indian Medicine (TIM) or Ayurveda is scarce with the exception of Ceratophyllum demersum Linn. (Ceratophyllaceae). The paste of C. demersum is used in bleeding hemorrhoids. It is also used in polydipsia, diarrhea, fever, bleeding diathesis, and biliousness. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), several sea-weeds have been used. Nostoc muscorum Ag. and N. sphaeroides Kütz (Nostocaceae) are used in the treatment of night-blindness and burns. Saragassum fusiforme (Harvey) Setchell (Sargassaceae) has been used as an antifungal and anticoagulant in TCM since 8th century A.D. Kunbu (Laminaria and Ecklonia), Haizao (Sargassum) and Zicai (Porphyra) are integral parts of TCM. The Sargassum decoction is used in the treatment of obesity, breast and ovarian tumors and lymphadenitis. Kunbu and haizao are used in promoting diuresis. Laminaria japonica Aresch. (Laminariaceae) and Undaria pinnatifi da (Harvey) Suringar (Phaeophyceae) are used traditionally in Korea to promote maternal health. Carrageenan is obtained from Irish moss (Chondrus crispus); because of its mucus forming properties it has been used in lung diseases and to improve the bitter drug taste. Carrageenan has also been used in cases of digestive tract irritations and in diarrhea and dysentery. In France and Great Britain, carrageenan has been used to treat stomach ulcers due to its mucous properties. Agar-agar obtained from Gelidium and Gracilaria sp. is used in constipation and stomach prolapse. Fucus vesiculosus Linn. (Fucoideae) has been used for centuries in the treatment of thyroid, obesity, arteriosclerosis and digestive diseases. The recorded use of Fucus vesiculosus dates back to at least the time period of the Eclectic Physicians of the 19th century. Chlorella vulgaris yields chlorellin, an antibiotic compound. Ethnopharmacology of Algae Chondrus crispus Stackh. (Gigartinaceae) is used in bronchitis and diarrhea. Marine algae Gelidiopsis sp. (Gaisellaceae) is consumed in Indonesia by coastal communities for anti-aging property. Interestingly, the chloroform extract of Gelidiopsis sp. has an antioxidant activity. In Vietnam, seaweeds are used for treatment of cough, asthma, hemorrhoid, boils, goiter, urinary diseases, tumors, ulcers, and headaches.

## Dictyota sp. from North Brittany Sea. Four diterpenoids (dischototetroal,

dichotopentanol, dichotone and dichotodione) have been reported from Dictyota dichotoma (Hudson) Lamouroux (Dictyotaceae) growing in Pakistan. Several sterols, terpenes, polyols and certain metabolites have been isolated from these seaweeds. Some signifi cant phytochemicals include dicdichane from Dictyota dichotoma and hauckiosterol from Dictyota hauckiana (Dictyotaceae) and Spatoglossum variabile Figari et De Notaris (Dictyoaceae); dictinol, dictindiol, dictintriol, amijiol and sargasterol from Dictyota indica Sonder (Dictyotaceae), padinolide from Colpomernia sinuosa (Mertens ex Roth) Derbes et Solier (Scytosiphonaceae) and Padina tetrastromatica Hauck (Dictyotaceae). Sterols and volatiles have been reported from Cystoseira barbata J.Ag. (Phaeophaceae) collected from the Black Sea. A diterpenoid (stypolactone) has been isolated from Stypopodium zonale (J.V. Lamouroux) Papenfuss (Dyctiotaceae). Spirulina platensis Linn. is rich in vitamins, proteins, pigments and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Diterpenes (isopachydictyolal from D. dichotoma and 4α- acetyldictyodial from D. linearis) were isolated from plants growing in Greece. Dunaliella salina UTEX is a single celled, salt-water micro-alga that accumulates massive amounts of carotenoids (α-Carotene, and β-Carotene) and xanthophylls (cryptoxanthin, lutein, and zeaxanthin). It is also reported to contain volatile compounds like β-Cyclocitral, α- and β-ionone, neophytadiene, and phytol.

## Antimicrobial activity

Antiviral Polysaccharides and polyphenols obtained from Fucus vesiculosus have anti-HIV activity. It has been postulated that adhesion is the fi rst step in HIV infection; the active compounds from Fucus vesiculosus block adhesion which prevents transmission of HIV-1 (Beress et al., 1993). A novel reverse transcriptase inhibitor has been isolated from Fucus vesiculosus. It inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase by competing with the nucleic acid substrate. Polysaccharides of Gracilaria corticata J. Agardh. (Gracilariaceae) showed selective antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. The galatofurans isolated from Adenocystis utricularis (Bory de Saint-Vincet) Skottsberg (Adenocystaceae) have inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2. A sulfated polysaccharide fraction isolated from hot water extract of Caulerpa racemosa (Forsskal) J. Agardh. (Caulerpaceae) was reported to be active against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) in vitro cells (Ray, 2004). Galactofucan, a sulfated polysaccharide isolated from aqueous extract of Undaria pinnatifi da (Harvey) Suringar (Phaeophyaceae) has signifi cant anti viral activity against several strains of herpes simplex virus. Ditepenoids isolated from Northeast Brazil algae, Dictyota pfaffi i Schnetter (Dictyotaceae) showed strong anti-HSV-1 activity in vitro but only one compound inhibited the reverse transcriptase enzyme of HIV-1. Meroditerpenes (maric acid, epitaondiol and the peroxylactone of 5’a-desmethyl-5’-acetylatomaric acid) isolated from Brazilian algae, Stypopodium zonale showed strong anti-HSV-1 activity in vitro. It also inhibited the transcriptase reverse enzyme of HIV-1. Antibacterial and antifungal Crustose germlings of Chondrus crispus have antibacterial activity against benthic diatoms. The methanolic and ethyl acetate extracts of Gelidiopsis sp. from Indonesia have antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio damsela, Vibrio harveyi and Staphylococcus aureus. Fractions of the hexane, ethyl ether and dichloromethane extract of Cystoseira tamariscifolia Hudson (Cystoseriaceae) has signifi cant antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. Methanolic extracts of Nitella tenuissima (Desv.) Kuetzing. (Characeae), Microchaete tenera Thuret ex Bornet (Microchaetaceae) and Sphaeroplea annulina (Roth) Ag. (Sphaeropleaceae) have been investigated for in vitro antimicrobial activity against Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fl avus and Rhizopus nigricans using agar cup-plate method. Blue-green alga, Ethnopharmacology of Algae namely, Microchaete tenera; and green algae, namely, Nitella tenuissima and Sphaeroplea annulina showed signifi cant antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Microchaete tenera showed good antimicrobial activity against Proteus vulgaris and Aspergillus niger. Sphaeroplea annulina showed feeble antifungal activity against Aspergillus fl avus. Different pressurized liquid extracts obtained from Dunaliella salina has signifi cant antimicrobial activity against coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger (Miguel et al., 2006).

## Hypoglycemic and lipolytic activity

In some Chondrus species, a genus related with Gigartina, a series of sterols have been found, all of which have hypocholesterolemic activity. These sterols can also depress blood pressure in human atherosclerosis as well as low cholesterol levels in rabbits and rats. A polysaccharide extracted from Fucus vesiculosus was evaluated for hypolipidemic activity in normal and hyperlipiemic rats. The alga signifi cantly lowered total cholesterol and low-density-lipoprotein- cholesterol levels, and signifi cantly increased the antiatherogenic index. Compounds obtained from extracts of Cystoseira barbata have shown hypoglycemic and lipolytic activity. A new phloroglucinol derivative isolated from brown alga Eisenia bicyclis (Kjellman) Setchell (Phaeophyceae) from Japan has been reported to be effective in the treatment of diabetic complications.

## Conclusion

One of the reasons for exploring biological compounds in algae is the potential for medical use. Algae contain numerous bioactive constituents as shown in investigational studies. However, much work remains to link medical effects with specifi c algae species. Traditional medical claims need to be justifi ed by pre-clinical and clinical research.

## Ethnopharmacology of Lichens

<!-- chunk -->

## 10.1 Introduction

The Lichen division is comprised of at least 8 orders, 45 families, and 6,000 species. Information on the edible and medicinal uses of lichens is scattered. Many lichens are known to have potent antibiotic properties, and many are edible. However, some lichens do contain toxic substances, so one should not graze randomly on them.

## 10.2 Lichens in folk and traditional medicine

‘Doctrine of Signatures’ written in the 15th century stated “A plant could treat a disease it most looked like”. This formed the basis of phytotherapeutics in traditional systems of medicines like Traditional Indian Medicine (TIM) or Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and Western Medical Herbalism. Interestingly , the word lichen is derived from the Greek word ‘Leprous’ and refers to use of lichens in treating skin diseases due to their peeling-skin appearance. Lichen like Lobaria pulmonaria (L.) Hoffm. (Stictacea) and Parmelia sulcata Taylor (Parmeliaceae) have been used in the treatment of pulmonary and cranial diseases, respectively. Similarly, Xanthoria parietina (L.) Th. Fries (Lobariaceae), being yellow, was used to cure jaundice. Medicinal uses of lichens are linked with folklore. The medicinal use of lichens can be traced back to the 18th dynasty (1700–1800 BC) when Evernia furfuracea (L.) Mann or (Parmeliaceae) was fi rst used as a drug. Some lichens were claimed to be good for coughs, jaundice, rabies and restoring loss of hair. Herbal medicinal texts included an account of several species of lichens including Cladonia, Evernia, Lobaria, Parmelia, Peltigera, Pertusaria, Physica, Rocella, Usnea and Xanthoria . During the Middle Ages, lichens fi gured prominently in herbals used by practitioners. 278 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology Peltigera sp., mixed with 2 drachms of black pepper, for 4-d, in half- pint of warm milk, was used for rabies or hydrophobia. Linnaeus named Peltigera, in 1753 as Lichen caninus (the Dog Lichen) as it has rhizines on the lower surface that resembles teeth, hence a specifi c epithet of canina. In traditional medicine, Peltigera canina (L.) Willd is used as liver tonic and laxative. In Ireland, Peltigera aphthosa (L.) Wiild. was used as a vermifuge. People of northern California used Letharia vulpina (L.) Hue. (Parmeliaceae) in stomach diseases. A novel species of Dictyonema was used by the Waorani as a hallucinogen. In Arabian medicine, Alectoria usneoides was used in the treatment of splenomegaly (enlarged spleen). In China, Usnea diffracta Vain (Parmeliaceae) was used in medicine around 500 A.D. (Strickmann,). Hippocrates prescribed Usnea barbata for uterine ailments. In Sweden, Parmelia saxatilis (L.) Ach. is used to treat warts. In China, Lethariella cashmeriana Krog-Wei, L. sernanderi (Motyka) Obermayer, L. sinensis J. C. Wei & Jiang (Parmeliaceae) and Thamnolia vermicularis Hytter i Norden Danske (Icmadophilaceae) are used as medicated teas. Usnea sp. are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), homeopathic system of medicine and traditional medicine in Pacifi c Islands and New Zealand. Usnea sp. are valued for demulcent properties and fi nds use for mild infl ammation of the oral and pharyngeal mucosa. Usnea fi lipendula Stirt was used in the former Soviet Union for cuts and wounds. Spanish folk medicine has documented the use of lichens in various medical aliments. Decoction of Pseudoevernia furfuracea (L.) Zopf. (Parmeliaceae) is used in Alfacar and Viznar in respiratory ailments. Ramalina bourgeana Mont. ex Nyl. (Ramalinaceae) is consumed for diuretic and stone–dissolving (lithontriptic) properties (González -Tejero, 1995). Xanthoparmelia scabrosa (Taylor) Hale (Parmeliaceae) is an ingredient for

prepared from Flavocetraria nivalis (L.) Kärnefelt & Thell (Parmeliaceae) is used in the treatment of motion-sickness and heart attacks by the natives of Qollahuaya Andeans in Poland. Cetraria islandica (L.) Ach. (Parmeliaceae) commonly known as Irish moss, is a valued folk remedy for lung diseases, kidney and bladder complaints as well as externally for poorly healed wounds (Bown, 2001). Traditionally it is used for mild infl ammation of oral and pharyngeal mucosa. It is also valued in dyspepsia and loss of appetite. In European folk medicine, it is used in the treatment of cancer. Reindeer lichens are important medicinal agents. Cladonia rangiferina (L.) F. H. Wigg. syn. Cladina rangiferina (L.) Nyl. (Cladoniaceae) is the commonly studied reindeer lichen. Northern native people used reindeer lichen in medicinal teas to treat colds, arthritis, fevers and other problems. Reindeer lichens were also used as a poultice to relieve the ache of Ethnopharmacology of Lichens arthritic joints. Reindeer lichens have been taken to treat fever, jaundice constipation, convulsions, coughs, and tuberculosis. Cladonia pyxidata (L.) Hoffm. is a useful remedy for whooping cough. Three Parmelia sp. (Parmelia chinense (Osbeck) Hale & Ahti., syn P. perlata (Huds.) Ach. P. sancti-angeli (Lynge) Hale and P. peforatum (Jacq.) A. Massal. are used for the Indian drug chharila, which is used as an aphrodisiac. In India Parmelia chinense is used as a diuretic and as a liniment for headaches and powder to help wounds heal. Parmelia sancti- angeli is used in Central India to treat Tinea (ringworm) disease. Ash of the lichen, mixed with mustard or linseed oil, is applied to the affected area. Parmelia peforatum is medically recognized in Afghanistan. Parmelia nepalense (Talyor) Hale ex Sipman is used in Nepal in the treatment of toothache and sore throat. In the western Himalayas Thamnolia vermicularis (Schwartz) Ach. (Icmadophilaceae) is used as an antiseptic. In Sikkim, Heterodermia diademata (Talyor) D.D. Awas. (Physciaceae) is used for cuts and wounds.

## 10.3 Phytochemical and pharmacological investigations

Lichen metabolites exert a wide variety of biological actions including antibiotic, antimycobacterial, antiviral, anti-infl ammatory, analgesic, antipyretic, antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects. Even though these manifold activities of lichen metabolites have now been recognized, their therapeutic potential has not yet been fully explored and thus remains pharmaceutically unexploited. The utility of lichens is due to the of range of secondary compounds produced by them.

## Antimicrobial activity

Antibacterial Antibiotic properties of lichens are of special interest to scientists. According to one estimate, 50% of all lichens have antibiotic properties. Burkholder and co workers (1944) were pioneers initiating research on lichens as antibacterial agents. They tested 42 lichens for antibiotic properties and were reported to inhibit growth of bacteria. Parmelia physodes (L.) Ach. was reported to be an antibiotic. Usnic acid is a wide-spectrum antibiotic characterized from lichens. Vulpinic acid has mild antibiotic property. Atranorin has been found to be much less biologically active than usnic and vulpinic acids. Usnic , evernic and vulpinic acids inhibited the growth of gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium, but the acids had no effect on the gram negative bacteria Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Usnic acid isolated from lichens from the south of Spain has high activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Acetone, diethyl ether and ethanol 280 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology extracts of the lichen Cetraria aculeata (Schreber) Fr. and its active constituent protolichesterinic acid were tested positive against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes. Alectosarmentin, (-)-usnic acid, physodic acid and 8’-O-ethyl-beta- alectoronic acid isolated from the alcoholic extract of the lichen Alectoria sarmentosa (Ach.) Ach. (Alectoriaceae) showed antimicrobial activity. Hypogymnia apinnata (atranorin), Letharia columbiana (vulpinic acid), Lobaria pulmonaria (Stictic acid, constictic acid, and norstictic acid) and Usnea fi lipendula (Usnic acid and salazinic acid) have been reported to have signifi cant antibiotic activity against Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella gallinarum and Serratia marcescens respectively. The acetone and methanol extracts of Lasallia pustulata (L.) Méret. (Umbilicariaceae), Parmelia sulcata Taylor, and Umbilicaria crustulosa (Ach.) Frey (Umbilicariaceae), manifested antibacterial activity against the majority of species of bacteria tested, in addition to selective antifungal activity. Acetone, chloroform, diethyl ether, methanol, and petroleum ether extracts of Parmelia sulcata and its constituent (salazinic acid) demonstrated antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Penicillium notatum. 3-hydroxyphysodic acid isolated from Hypogymnia tubulosa (Schaerer) Havaas (Parmeliaceae) showed antimicrobial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans. Extracts of Xanthoparmelia pokornyi (Vainio) Hale (Parmeliaceae) and its constituents (gyrophoric and stenosporic acid) have been reported to be potential antimicrobials. Extracts of Pseudevernia furfuracea and its constituents (physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid) have signifi cant antimicrobial activity. Hirtusneanoside isolated from

against Gram-positive bacteria. Antifungal Parietin, anthraquinone isolated from methanol extract of Caloplaca cerina (Ehrh. ex Hedwig) Th.Fr. (Teloschistaceae) has been reported to have signifi cant antifungal activity. Extracts of Andean lichens Protousnea poeppigii (Nees & Flot.) Vain. (Parmeliaceae) and Usnea fl orida var. rigida Acharius demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the pathogenic Ethnopharmacology of Lichens fungi Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and T. rubrum. Isodivaricatic acid, 5-propylresorcinol, divaricatinic acid and usnic acid were identifi ed as antifungal agents. Antiviral Usnic acid isolated from Teloschistes chrysophthalmus (L.) Th. Fr. (Teloschistaceae) and parietin isolated from Ramalina celastri demonstrated antiviral activity against the arena viruses Junin and Tacaribe.

## Antioxidant activity

Phenolic constituents from the lichen Parmotrema stuppeum (Nyl.) Hale (Parmeliaceae) including methyl orsenillate, orsenillic acid, atranorin and lecanoric acid showed moderate antioxidant activity. An animal study reported antioxidant activity of the lichen Cetraria islandica. Stictic acid derivatives from the lichen Usnea articulata (Ach.) Motyka were reported to have signifi cant antioxidant activity.

## Antitumor activity

Pannarin inhibited cell growth and induces cell death in human prostate carcinoma DU-145 cells.The orcinol derivatives tenuiorin and methyl orsellinate present in the extract of Peltigera leucophlebia (Nyl.) Gyeln. (Peltigeraceae) exhibited in vitro inhibitory activity against 15- lipoxygenase from soybeans. A correlation has been observed between 5-lipoxygenase inhibition and antiproliferative effects for related lichen metabolites. On this account, tenuiorin and methyl orsellinate were further tested for antiproliferative activity on cultured human breast, pancreatic and colon cancer cell lines. Methyl orsellinate lacked antiproliferative activity but tenuiorin depicted moderate activity. Bianthraquinone glycosides, collefl accinosides isolated from Collema fl accidum (Ach.) Ach.

## Ethnopharmacology of Bryophytes

<!-- chunk -->

## 11.1 Introduction

Liverworts and mosses are small, low-growing plants, which constitute the phylum bryophyta. Bryophytes, which are phylogenetically placed between vascular plants and algae, form a unique division in the plant kingdom. There are more than 22,000 members of mosses (Bryophyta) in the world. About 2850 bryophytes are reported to have medicinal value. They are now increasingly used for diverse purposes including pollution control and as new sources of pharmaceuticals.

<!-- chunk -->

## 11.2 Bryophytes in traditional systems of medicine

There is no historical record, explaining the use of liverworts and mosses in Ayurveda, the Indian system of medicine. One research claims that mosses from the species of Barbula, Fissidenc, Minium, Thuidium and species of liverworts like Asterella, Dumortiera, Marchantia, Pellia, Plagiochasma and Stephenrencella-Anthoceros were present in the vicinity of Shilajit (Asphaltum punjabianum) exuding rocks and these bryophytes are responsible for the formation of Shilajit. Bryophytes reveal the occurrence of minerals and metals in their tissue such as copper, silver, zinc, iron, lead etc., which are similar to the elements present in Shilajit. Chinese Traditional Medicine named 40 kinds of bryophytes used to treat cardiovascular diseases, tonsillitis, bronchitis, cystitis, and skin infections. Some species of Fissidens and Polytrichum were utilized as diuretic and hair growth stimulating drugs in China more than 400 years ago. Marchantia polymorpha is used in the treatment of liver diseases like jaundice and hepatitis. In China, Rhodobryum giganteum (Schwaegr.) Par and R. roseum (Hedw) Limpr are used in the treatment of heart ailments. North American Indians used Bryum, Mnium, Philonotis spp., and Polytrichum juniperinum to heal burns, bruises, and wounds. The Seminole people in North America were reported to use Barbula unguiculata Ethnopharmacology of Bryophytes Hedwig, Bryum capillare T. Bickley and Octoblepharum albidum (L.) Hedw as a febrifuge and anodyne. Willow moss, Fontinalis antipyretica Hedw was once reputed as a febrifuge (documented in the Journal of Linnaeus). Dried Sphagnum was used extensively as a surgical dressing during the First World War. In France, Marchantia polymorpha was used to promote diuresis. In the Himalayas, Riccia sp. was used in the treatment of Tinea (ringworm) infestations. The use of bryophytes as antibacterial or disinfectant agents deserves special mention. Sphagnum teres (Schimp.) Ångstr is used in ophthalmologic diseases. In China and Bolivia, Fissidens osmundoides Hedwig is used an antibacterial agent to treat infl ammatory conditions of the pharynx and larynx. Haplocladium microphyllum (Hedw) Broth is used as a demulcent medicine in infl ammatory conditions like bronchitis, cystitis, tonsillitis and tympanitis. Philonotis fontana (Hedw) Brid is used by Go suite native people as a soothing preparation for healing burns.

## 11.3 Phyochemistry of bryophytes

Extracts of many species of bryophytes are known to contain phenolic compounds. Sterols, isofl avonoids, fl avonoids, and biofl avonoids have been reported. Terpenoids, phenolics and volatile constituents have also been investigated in some bryophytes. Rhodobryum giganteum is reported to contain volatile oil, lactone and amino acid. Essential oil of Plagiomnium undulatum (Hedw) T Kop is reported to contain butenolides. Quercetin, luteolin and apigenin have been identifi ed as major fl avonoids in Marchantia convoluta Gao et KC Zhang. Marchantia polymorpha Linn from Japan has been reported to accumulate eicosapentaenoic acid. Diterpenoids have been reported from the New Zealand liverwort Jungermannia species. Isotachis japonica Steph is reported to contain aromatic esters. Anoectangium bicolor Renauld & Cardot has been reported to contain the highest amount of neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, among bryophytes.

## 11.4 Pharmacological investigations

The antifungal and antifeedant activity of bryophytes is widely known, but mainly from in vitro studies. Recent exploratory studies done in Germany, Peru and Bolivia have demonstrated that extracts derived from native bryophyte species have signifi cant effects on human pathogenic fungi and may cure skin diseases. Several Indian bryophytes have been identifi ed as a potential source of antimycobacterial agents. As pointed out, Anoectangium bicolor is a rare bryophyte with anti cholinesterase activity. A brief account of pharmacological investigations carried out on bryophytes is summarized below: 288 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology

## Antifungal activity

Fractionation of the ethanolic extract of Homalia trichomanoides (Hedw) B.S.G. lead to isolation of 3 β-methoxyserrat-14-en-21 β-ol, atranorin (Fig. 10.1), and methyl 2, 4-dihydroxy-3, 6-dimethylbenzoate as antifungal compounds active against Candida albicans. Pallavicinia lyellii (Hook) Carruth is known to have antifungal activity against Aspergillus fumigatus under in vitro conditions. Further investigations led to the discovery of steroid as the antifungal compound from P. lyellii. The compound was found to be effective against aspergillosis- induced mortality in immuno-compromised mice. Hypnum cupressiforme Hedwig has signifi cant antifungal effects. Herbertus aduncus subsp. hutchinsiae (Gottsche) R.M.Schust. has antifungal activity against Botrytis cinerea, Pythium debaryanum and Rhizooctonia solani. (-) α-herbertenol, (-) β-herbertenol, and (-) α-formylherbertenol were identifi ed as antifungal constituents (Fig. 11.1).

## Antibacterial activity

An acetone extract of the Chinese moss, Pleurochaete squarrosa (Brid.) Lindb. was reported to be active against some gram-negative strains. The acetone and methanol extracts of Palustriella commutata (Hedw.) Ochyra (native to Turkey) were studied for antibacterial activity. The acetone extract had a potential activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Acetone extracts of the moss, Rhynchostegium riparioides (Hedw) C Jens has signifi cant antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria. Sanionins A and B isolated from the moss Sanionia georgico-uncinata Ochyra, (collected on the Antarctic Livingston Island) showed activity against important Gram-positive pathogens, such as mycobacteria, multiresistant staphylococci, and vancomycin resistant enterococci. Sanionins A and B showed anti-infl ammatory activity and low cytotoxicity along with antibacterial activity. The extract of Stringy Moss, Leptodictyum riparium (Hedw.) Warnst. inhibited activity against conventional antibiotic- resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Dicranum scoparium Hedw. has strong antibacterial activity against gram negative bacteria.

## Miscellaneous activity

In Britain, sphagnol, a derivative of Sphagum is used to relieve the itch of insect bites. Sphagnol is recognized as a useful application in eczema, psoriasis, pruritus, hemorrhoids, chilblains, scabies and acne. One of the reasons for exploring biological compounds in bryophytes is the potential for medical use. Bryophytes contain numerous bioactive constituents as shown in investigational studies. However, much work remains to link medical effects with specifi c bryophyte species. Traditional medical claims need to be justifi ed by pre-clinical and clinical research. 292 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology

about 305 genera, comprising more than 10,000 species all over the world. The medicinal value of pteridophytes is known to man for more than years.

<!-- chunk -->

## 12.2 Ferns in traditional medicine

About 300 B.C., Theophrastus recommended oil extracted from ferns to expel internal parasites. Rhizomes of various shield fern species (Polystichum and Dryopteris) have been used since the 18th century as a cure for intestinal worms. Cyathea manniana Hook. (Cyatheaceae) from East Africa has been used by the Chagga and by German troops in the First World War as an anthelmintic. Pteridophytes fi nd use in Homoeopathic, Ayurvedic, Tribal and Unani prescriptions for worm infestation. Aromatic compounds, glycosides and α- and γ-pyrones are responsible for the anthelmintic, antibacterial, mutagenic and antifeedant effects of ferns.

## Dryopteris Filix-mas (L.) Schott (Dryopteridaceae)

It is grown as an ornamental fern in gardens. The oldest known anthelmintic now in use, as established historically, appears to be a male fern. It is sometimes referred to in ancient literature as Worm Fern. Many fern constituents display various types of bioactivities. The early physician, Theophrastus, recognized the value of the fern for treating tinea (ringworm) infections. Classical use of the plant as an anthelmintic included 5 to 8 g doses of the oleoresin extract. The fern has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of worm infections. The chemical composition of oleoresin of the rhizome of D. fi lix mas composition was ascribed to a group of related compounds commonly known as ‘phenol fraction of the oleoresin’ which were derivatives of 2-acylcyclol~exane-1, 3-dione. Böhm showed the medical world that phloroglucinol group of compounds were responsible for anthelmintic activity of D. Filix-mas. Major pholoroglucinol of D. Filix-mas is fi licin or fi licic acid (1.5%) and is considered to be the active principle. According to pharmacopoeia, the rhizome of D. Filix-mas should not contain less than 1.5% of fi licin. Liquid extract of D. Filix-mas contains 25% w/w of fi licin. Other pholoroglucinols present in the rhizome of D.Filix-mas includes aspidin, desaspidin, paraspidin, margaspidin,aspidine, fi lixic acid, fl avaspidic acid and fi lmarone.

## Fig. 12.2 Other hloroglucinols of Dryopteris Filix-mas.

Filicin and fi lmarone are active vermifuges and are particularly toxic to tapeworms. Following ingestion of the drugs, tinea are expelled within hours; however, a purgative typically is ingested concomitantly with the vermifuge to aid expulsion. The oleoresin paralyzes intestinal voluntary muscle and the analogous muscles of the tapeworm, which is then readily eliminated by the action of the purgative. Preliminary preparation of D. Filix-mas with a milk diet and alba mixture for 2 d is followed by the drug in 3 divided doses in succession on an empty stomach in the morning followed by magnesium sulfate purgative. The head of the tapeworm is searched for in the stools that are passed. Castor oil must not be used because the oil aids the absorption 298 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology of fi licic acid which is toxic.D. Filix-mas is contraindicated in alcoholism, pregnancy and in advanced diseases of the heart, liver and kidneys. The rhizome of D. Filix-mas is strongly cytotoxic against band worms and liver fl ukes, although round worm (Ascaris lumricoides) and pin worm (Oxyuris vermicalulis) are resistant. In combination with other anthelmintics, male fern extract has been reported to be effective against Hymenolepis nana, a small intestinal tapeworm. The components of the plant have been used as veterinary vermifuges. D. Filix-mas should be used with caution as in large doses it is poisonous. It is reported to be hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic. The rhizomes of Asplenium Filix-foemina (Bernh.), Aspidium oreopteris (Sw.), and A. spinulosum (Sw.) resemble those of the male fern and have often been found mixed with it when imported. D. juxtaposita Christ is used as a substitute for the European male fern.

## Medicinal Orchids

<!-- chunk -->

## 13.1 Introduction

Orchidaceae is one of the largest families among angiosperms. According to one estimate the family includes 800 genera and 25,000 species. Orchids are well known for their economic importance and are widely cultivated for ornamental purposes. Orchids are cosmopolitan in distribution. Vanilla planifolia is a commercially important orchid as it is source of vanillin used as a foodstuff fl avoring.

<!-- chunk -->

## 13.2 Historical aspects

The term orchid was coined by Theophrastus as the anatomy of the plants resembled testicles. The Greek word ‘orchid’ literally means testicles. This may account for the use of orchids as aphrodisiacs in ancient civilizations. Among the history of ancient alternative systems of medicine—Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) are on the forefront. Asthavarga is an important ingredient of various classical Ayurvedic formulations like Chavyanprasa. Out of eight constituents of Ashtavarga, four have been reported to be orchids (see Table 7.1). Traditional Chinese medicine widely utilizes orchids in medicines. A few of them have been subjected to phytochemical and pharmacological studies. In India work has been carried out on the chemical analysis of some medicinally useful orchids. Eulophia campestris, Orchis latifolia, Vanda roxburgii are among some of the important plants. Dendrobium macraei is another orchid of value from the Ayurvedic point of view as it is reported to be source of Jivanti. Cypripedium parvifl ora is widely used as an aphrodisiac and nervine tonic in Western Herbalism. Many medicinal orchids are reported to contain alkaloids. Antimicrobial activities of some orchids have been suggested although Ethnopharmacology of Medicinal Orchids detailed investigations are still warranted. Recent studies have reported isolation of anthocyanins, stilebnoids and triterpenoids from orchids. Orchinol, hircinol, cypripedin, jibantine, nidemin and loroglossin are some important phytochemicals reported from orchids. Some of the phytochemicals isolated from orchids along with their biological source have been tabulated below:

## 14.2 Salacia chinensis Linn. Syn: S. prinoides DC.

S. chinensis is commonly studied among plants of the genus Salacia. It is an erect or straggling tree or a woody climbing shrub found along seashores and river banks as well as in forests. The plants bear fl owers in clusters and small single seeded, red fruits having an edible pulp. Proanthocyanidins has been reported from S. chinensis. Two new friedelane-type triterpenes: salasones D and E (Fig. 14.1), a new norfriedelane- type triterpene: salaquinone B (Fig. 14.2), and a new polyacylated eudesmane-type sesquiterpene: salasol B (Fig. 14.3), were isolated from the stems of S. chinensis. Some norfriedelane-type triterpene, lignan, and catechin constituents were found to show an antioxidant activity. Three new friedelane-type triterpenes called salasones A, B, and C (Fig. 14.4), a new norfriedelane-type triterpene, salaquinone A (Fig. 14.5), and a new acylated eudesmane-type sesquiterpene, salasol A (Fig. 14.6), were reported from 80% aqueous methanolic extract of the stems of S.

Salacia sp. Potential Hypoglycemic Plants Recently megastigmane glycosides have been reported from the leaves of S. chinensis. Seven new megastigmane glycosides: foliasalaciosides E 1-3, F, G, H, and I, were recently isolated from the leaves of S. chinensis Linn. collected from Thailand. New triterpene constituents, foliasalacins A (1)-A (4), B (1)-B (3), and C, have been isolated from the leaves of S. chinensis. In Ayurveda, the plant is known as Saptchakra. In addition to Ayurveda, the plant is used as a remedy for type 2 diabetes in the Siddha system of medicine. A clinical study in 1984 reported the usefulness of S. chinensis based formulation in diabetes mellitus. Kadal, a proprietary Siddha medicine comprising of roots and bark of S. chinensis and Triphala were given to 25 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Kadal was administered in a dose of 500 mg twice a day and Triphala was administered at 2.5 g thrice a day with water for a period of 4 mon. They reported a hypoglycemic effect of the formulation. An animal study reported potent anti-hyperglycemic effect of methanolic extract from the stems of S. chinensis, in oral sucrose or maltose- loaded rats. The extract also demonstrated inhibition of alpha-glucosidase and rat lens aldose reductase, as well as nitric oxide production from lipopolysaccharide-activated mouse peritoneal macrophage, and radical scavenging activities. Salacinol was identifi ed as the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory principle of the extracts.

## 14.3 Salacia reticulata Wight

S. reticulata is a climbing perennial woody plant growing wild in South India and in North Sri Lanka. Its roots and stems are been used in Ayurveda to relieve dry mouth. Mangiferin has been isolated from the root bark of S. reticulata. A novel nortriterpenoid aldehyde called salacenonal (Fig. 14.7) has been reported from S. reticulate. Kotalanol having potential natural alpha-glucosidase inhibiting activity was isolated from the roots and stems of S. reticulata through bioassay-guided separation. Kotalanol was found to show more potent inhibitory activity against sucrose than salacinol and acarbose. O HO HH H CHO

316 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology A study reported that lipase inhibitory and lipolytic activities have mild antiobesity effects of hot water-soluble extract from the roots of S. reticulata and its polyphenolic constituents in rats. A randomized single center double blind crossover trial, studied the effi cacy of an herbal tea containing S. reticulata (Kothala Himbutu tea) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Fifty-one patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for longer than 6 mon and with evidence of stable glycemic control over the preceding 6 mon (as assessed by HbA1C) participated in the study. They were randomized to receive a standard preparation of Kothala Himbutu tea for 3 mon followed by placebo in similar tea bags for a further 3 mon (n = 28) or in reverse order (n = 23). All patients received detailed advice on diet, exercise and lifestyle modifi cation. HbA1C was measured at recruitment, at 3 mon and on completion of the study at 6 mon. Liver and renal functions were assessed biochemically at baseline, at 3 and 6 mon and adverse events were recorded. There were no signifi cant differences between the two groups in age, body mass index, male/female ratio, and glycemic control and baseline laboratory tests. All patients completed both arms of the trial. The HbA1C at the end of drug treatment was signifi cantly lower than after treatment with placebo. A mixture of the aqueous extract of S. reticulata and cyclodextrin has been reported to reduce the accumulation of visceral fat mass in mice and male Sprague-Dawley rats with high-fat diet-induced obesity. Recently a polyhydroxylated cyclic 13-membered sulfoxide (Fig. 14.8) was isolated from an aqueous extract of S. reticulata. The alpha- glucosidase inhibitory activity was much greater than the inhibitory activity of salacinol and kotalanol, previously isolated from S. reticulata. The same authors reported isolation and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of a novel 13-membered ring thiocyclitol from an aqueous extract of S. reticulata. The inhibitory activity was investigated by maltose- and sucrose-loading on Wistar rats. OH OH OH S HO OH HO OH O OH

## 14.4 Salacia oblonga Wall.

In Japan S. oblonga has been sold as a food supplement for several years. S. oblonga plants grow in limited regions of India and Sri Lanka, and it is not yet well known in the U.S. A study reported two biologically active principles from petroleum ether extract of the root bark of S. oblonga. Two principles demonstrated about 60% and 76% hypoglycemic potency of an equal dose of tolbutamide (250 mg/kg) in albino rats. It was demonstrated that the aqueous methanolic extract of the roots of S. oblonga inhibited the increase in serum glucose level in sucrose- and maltose-loaded rats. The water-soluble and ethyl acetate-soluble portions from the aqueous methanolic extract showed inhibitory activities on alpha- glucosidase and aldose reductase, respectively. From the water-soluble portion, potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, salacinol and kotalanol, were isolated, together with nine sugar related components, while a new friedelane-type triterpene, kotalagenin 16-acetate, was isolated from the ethyl acetate-soluble portion along with known diterpenes and triterpenes. The structure of kotalagenin 16-acetate was elucidated on the basis of physicochemical evidence. The principal components from this natural medicine were examined in terms of inhibitory activity on aldose reductase, and the diterpene and triterpene constituents, including the new kotalagenin 16-acetate, were found to be responsible components for the inhibitory activity on aldose reductase.

A clinical study evaluated the effect of an herbal extract of S. oblonga on postprandial glycemia and insulinemia in patients with type 2 diabetes after ingestion of a high-carbohydrate meal. Sixty-six patients with diabetes were studied in this randomized, double-blinded crossover study. During a fasting stage, subjects consumed 1 of the following 3 meals: a standard liquid control meal, a control meal + 240 mg S. oblonga extract, and a control meal + 480 mg S. oblonga extract. Both doses of the Salacia extract signifi cantly lowered the postprandial positive area under the glucose curve (14% for the 240 mg extract and 22% for the 480 mg extract) and the adjusted peak glucose response (19% for the lower dose and 27% for the higher dose of extract) to the control meal. In addition, both doses of the salacia extract signifi cantly decreased the postprandial insulin response, lowering both the positive area under the insulin curve and the adjusted peak insulin response (14% and 9%, respectively, for the 240 mg extract; 19% and 12%, respectively, for the 480 mg extract) in comparison with the control meal. Scientists investigated the effect of the water extract of S. oblonga on obesity and diabetes-associated cardiac hypertrophy and discussed the role of modulation of cardiac angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)) expression in the effect. S. oblonga 100 mg/kg) was given orally to male Zucker diabetic fatty rats for 7 wk. At the end-point of the treatment, the hearts and left ventricles were weighed, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas were measured, and cardiac gene profi les were analyzed. On the other hand, angiotensin II-stimulated embryonic rat heart-derived H9c2 cells and neonatal rat cardiac fi broblasts were pretreated with water extract of S. oblonga and one of its prominent components mangiferin, respectively. Atrial natriuretic peptide, mRNA expression and protein synthesis and [(3) H] thymidine incorporation were determined. S. oblonga treated Zucker diabetic fatty rats showed less cardiac hypertrophy (decrease in weights of the hearts and left ventricles and reduced cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas). S. oblonga treatment Salacia sp. Potential Hypoglycemic Plants suppressed cardiac over expression of Atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide and AT (1) mRNAs and AT (1) protein in Zucker diabetic fatty rats. Aqueous extract of S. oblonga (50–100 microg/ml) and mangiferin (25 micromol) suppressed angiotensin II-induced ANP mRNA over expression and protein synthesis in H9c2 cells. They also inhibited angiotensin II-stimulated [(3) H] thymidine incorporation by cardiac fi broblasts. The fi ndings demonstrate that S. oblonga decreases cardiac hypertrophy in Zucker diabetic fatty rats, at least in part by inhibiting cardiac AT(1) over expression.

## 14.5 Salacia as peroxisome proliferator-activated

<!-- chunk -->

## receptor-alpha activator

In a present study, water extract of S. oblonga (100, 300 and 900mg/kg/ day/p.o., over a 28 d period) elicited dose-related increases in liver weight (LW) by 1.6%, 13.4% and 42.5%, respectively, and in the ratio of LW to body weight by 8.8%, 16.7% and 40.2%, respectively, in male rats. These effects were less pronounced in females. Water extract of S. oblonga selectively increased liver mass in male rats but Sudan red staining was not different, which indicates that hepatic lipid accumulation was similar in both genders. However, water extract of S. oblonga even at the highest dosage did not infl uence serum ALT and AST activities in male or female rats. Moreover, water extract of S. oblonga was found to activate peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor-alpha and acylCoA oxidase mRNA expression. Thus, water extract of S. oblonga dependent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha activation may precede the development of the gender difference in hepatic hypertrophy.

## 14.6 Toxicity

Reproductive toxicity A study determined the effects of the S. reticulata root extract on the reproductive outcome of normal Wistar rats (250–260 g) when administered orally (10 g/kg) during early (d 1–7) and mid- (d 7–14) pregnancy. The root extract signifi cantly (P<0.05) enhanced post-implantation losses (control vs treatment: early pregnancy, 4.7 ± 2.4 vs 49.3 ± 13%; mid-pregnancy, 4.7 ± 2.4 vs 41.7 ± 16.1%). Gestational length was unaltered but the pups born had a low birth weight (P<0.05) (early pregnancy, 6.8 ± 0.1 vs 5.3 ± 0.1 g; mid-pregnancy, 6.8 ± 0.1 vs 5.0 ± 0.1 g) and low birth index (P<0.05) (early pregnancy, 95.2 ± 2.4 vs 50.7 ± 12.9%; mid-pregnancy, 95.2 ± 2.4 vs 58.3 ± 16.1%), fetal survival ratio (P<0.05) (early pregnancy, 95.2 ± 2.4 vs 50.7 ± 12.9; mid-pregnancy, 95.2 ± 2.4 vs 58.3 ± 16.1), and viability index (P<0.05) 320 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology (early pregnancy, 94.9 ± 2.6 vs 49.5 ± 12.5%; mid-pregnancy, 94.9 ± 2.6 vs 57.1 ± 16.1%). However, the root extract was non-teratogenic. Genotoxicity and subchronic toxicity Another study investigated the genotoxicity of a S. oblonga root extract using the standard battery of tests (reverse mutation assay; chromosomal aberrations assay; mouse micronucleus assay) recommended by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for food ingredients. S. oblonga was determined not to be genotoxic under the conditions of the reverse mutation assay and mouse micronucleus assay, and weakly positive for the chromosomal aberrations assay. Continuing further studies, Flammang et al., 2007, investigated the toxicity of a S. oblonga root extract in a subchronic 90-d feeding study in rats. An in vivo-in vitro rat peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosomal aberrations assay was added at termination of the subchronic rat study to examine cultured lymphocytes for possible chromosomal aberration induction. The present study results indicate that aqueous extract of S. oblonga was negative for the induction of chromosomal aberrations in cultured rat peripheral blood lymphocytes after 90 consecutive days of treatment. The no observable adverse effect level was determined to be 2,500 mg/kg/day, p.o. following subchronic administrations to rats.

## 14.7 Doses of Salacia based preparations

Although no authentic information is available regarding the dosage, a typical dose of Salacia based preparations is 2.5 to 5.0 grams daily of the whole herb, or a comparable amount as extract. All the three species of Salacia have demonstrated alpha-glucosidase inhibiting activity like acarbose, with salacinol and kotalanol, as possible active principles. These studies have provided insights into potential protective and anti-obesity roles of Salacia species also. Some animal studies have demonstrated that Salacia might have antidiabetic action like conventional PPAR-gamma activators. Clinical trials have also reported effi cacy of Salacia species in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Toxicity data shows this herb is devoid of genotoxic and teratogenic effect but it should be avoided during pregnancy.

## 15.1 Introduction

Complementary and Alternative Systems of Medicine (CAM) viz. Ayurveda, Siddha, and Traditional Chinese Medicine, have become more popular in recent years. Medicinal herbs and extracts prepared from them are widely used in the treatment of liver diseases like hepatitis, cirrhosis, and loss of appetite. A number of reviews have focused on the therapeutic utility and adverse effects of herbal products, particularly hepatotoxicity. Silymarin (fl avanolignan mixture from Silybum marianum Linn.), daphnoretin (coumarin from Wilkstroemia indica), kutkin or picrosides and kutkosides (iridoid glycosides from Picrrorhiza kurroa Royle), glycyrrhizin (triterpene saponin from Glycyrrhiza glabra Linn.), schizandrins (lignans from Schizandra chinensis), andrographolide (diterpene lactone from Andrographis paniculata Nees), and lignans (phyllanthin from Phyllanthus niruri), are proven hepatoprotective phyto-constituents, as they have shown genuine utility in experimental and clinical studies. More than 700 mono and polyherbal preparations in the form of decoction, tincture, tablets and capsules from more than 100 plants are in clinical use. Keeping in mind the non-availability of a standard hepatoprotective agent in synthetic medicine and the discovery of silymarin as hepatoprotective agent from natural source, we need to initiate screening for herbals with documented effect on the liver. Among several plants used for liver diseases, T. ofi icinale is well recognized in Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). The folk medicines of China, India and Russia have recognized T.offi cinale as a liver tonic. Traditional Chinese Medicine combines T.offi cinale with other herbs to treat hepatitis. 324 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology O HO O CH 3 O O O O

## 15.2 Dandelion and traditional medicine

The genus name Taraxacum is derived from the Greek word ‘taraxos’, meaning ‘disorder’ and ‘akos’ meaning ‘remedy’. As a medicinal plant, T.offi cinale has been considered to be an aperient or mild laxative, diuretic, stimulant, stomachic, tonic, and detoxicant. Tea prepared from T.offi cinale has been used against fever, insomnia, jaundice, rheumatism, eczema and other skin diseases, and constipation. T.offi cinale and other Taraxacum species have also been used against warts, cancers, and tumors.

## Sesquiterpene lactones: The plant is a rich source of sesquiterpene lactones

or bitter principles. Taraxacin or taraxinic acid or lactucopicrin (Fig. 15.15), lactucin (Fig. 15.16) and cichorin (Fig. 15.17) are chief bitter principles and belong to the guaianolide class. Taraxacin in concentrated solutions, forms precipitates with a number of alkaloidal reagents. The plant contains a crystalline substance, taraxacerine or taraxaceron, which is reported to be bitter resin. Taraxacoside, a type of acylated gamma-butyrolactone glycoside has been reported from the plant. Other sesquiterpene lactones are of the germacranolide type including 11β, 13-dihydrolactucin (Fig. 15.18), ixerin D (Fig. 15.19), ainslioside taraxinic acid β-glucopyranosyl, taraxinic acid 1 ‘-glucosyl ester, and 11, 13-dihydrotaraxinic acid l’- glucoside. Eudesmanolides including tetrahydroridentin-B (Fig. 15.20) and taraxacolide-O-β-glucopyranoside are reported. Recently, a cyanogenic glycoside, prunasin has been reported from the extract of the plant. Phenylpropanoid glycosides: dihydroconiferin (Fig. 15.21), syringin (Fig. 15.22) dihydrosyningin (Fig. 15.23) have been reported. O O HO O H A O O HO OH O H O O OH OH OHOH

## 15.4 Pharmacology

The bitter compounds in the leaves and root help stimulate digestion and are mild laxatives. These bitter principles also increase bile production in the gallbladder and bile fl ow from the liver. Oral administration of extracts from the roots of T. offi cinale has been shown to act as a cholagogue, increasing the fl ow of bile. In German studies, dandelion leaf extracts increased bile secretion by 40% in rats. In French studies, giving dogs a decoction of fresh dandelion root doubled their bile output. In two Chinese studies of animals with gastric ulcers, gastric metaplasia and hyperplasia, dandelion-containing herbal combinations led to signifi cant histologic improvement. Ethnopharmacology of Taraxacum offi cinale Weber This chapter reviews the effect of T. offi cinale on the hepatobiliary apparatus and gastrointestinal system. The extracts of T. offi cinale have demonstrated antitumor, hypoglycemic, diuretic, antibacterial and nitric oxide regeneration activity. We need to focus on other pharmacological investigations particularly antioxidant activity and anti-infl ammatory activities, which might explain the use of T.offi cinale in liver diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

## In vivo

Anti-infl ammatory activity Extracts of T. offi cinale have an inhibitory effect on tumor necrosis factor- alpha production from rat astrocytes. Sesquiterpene glucosides isolated from fractionation of the extract of T. offi cinale have anti-leukotriene activity. Luteolin and luteolin-7-O-glucoside from the fl ower of T. offi cinale has a suppressive effect on iNOS and COX-2 in RAW264.7 cells. T. offi cinale has been reported to have a protective effect against cholecystokinin-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Antioxidant Hydro-alcoholic acid of T. offi cinale roots demonstrated antioxidant activity in rats. Extract of T. offi cinale, in the dose of 100 mg/kg, p.o., improved the superoxide dimutase, catalase, glutathione, and peroxidase levels decreased by CCl4 treatment. Cholretic Bile secretion was doubled in dogs by a decoction of fresh roots (equivalent to 5 g dried plant); a similar activity has been observed for rats.

## In vitro

Antioxidant Water and ethyl acetate fractions of T.offi cinale fl ower extract showed antioxidant activities in a stable 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical model and reduced the breakage of super coiled DNA strand induced by both non-site-specifi c and site-specifi c hydroxyl radical. Oxidation of structured phosphatidylcholine liposome induced by peroxyl radical was reduced in the presence of both water and ethyl acetate fractions of the extract. Luteolin and luteolin 7-glucoside were identifi ed as potential antioxidant agents. Flower extract of T. offi cinale resulted in oxidation of linoleic acid emulsion and suppressed superoxide and hydroxyl radical. The antioxidant activity of fl ower extract of T. offi cinale against Diphenylpicryl-hydrazyl and a synergistic effect with α-tocopherol were attributed to the reducing activity of fl avonoids and coumaric acid derivatives present in the 332 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology extract. The extract further inhibited peroxyl-radical-induced intracellular oxidation of RAW264.7 cells with range of concentrations.

## 15.5 Clinical studies

Chronic colitis A study reported the effi cacy of polyherbal formulation containing T.offi cinale in chronic pain associated with colitis. As multiple herbs were used, and this study was not well-designed or reported, the effects of dandelion are not clear. Hepatitis B One human study, reported improved liver function in people with hepatitis B after taking a combination herbal preparation containing T.offi cinale, Artemisia capillaries Thunb (Asteraceae), Taraxacum mongolicum Hand- Mazz. (Asteraceae), Plantago ovata Forssk. (Plantaginaceae), Cephalanoplos segetum (Bunge) Kitam (Asteraceae), Hedyotis diffusa Willd. (Rubiaceae), Chrysanthemum indicum Linn. (Asteraceae), Smilax glabra Roxb. (Smilaceae), Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.ex Link.) Bunge (Fabaceae), Salvia miltiorrhizae Bunge. (Lamiaceae), Polygonum orientalis L. (Polygalaceae), Paeonia alba L. (Ranunculaceae), and Polygonatum sibiricum F. Daelaroche. (Convallariaceae). Since polyherbal preparation was used in the study, the possible benefi ts of T.offi cinale need to be explored. Studies have indicated that chicoric acid inhibits the penetration of viruses in cells. Chicoric acid also acts as an antioxidant by preventing the oxidation of collagen and cells. Chlorogenic acid is cholagogue; its regular ingestion helps the fl ow of bile and thus reduces the adverse effects of bile stagnation. While chlorogenic acids are not the only compounds that serve well as cholagogues, the evidence for their effectiveness is by far the strongest. Both chicoric and chlorogenic have an action on the heaptobiliary apparatus and therefore the role in extracts of T. offi cinale needs further exploration.

## 16.3 Traditional Medicinal Uses

Malaysia: The leaves of A. ilicifolius are used to treat rheumatism, neuralgia and poison arrow wounds. It is widely believed by mangrove dwellers that chewing the leaves protects against snake bite. Malay: The pounded seeds of A. ilicifolius and A. ebracteatus are used to treat boils, and the juice of the leaves to prevent alopecia. Both species are also used to treat urolithiasis. India: In Ayurveda, the plant is known as Sahachara. In India the drug is considered to be astringent and makes a good nervine tonic, expectorant, and stimulant. He says that the root is expectorant, and is used in coughs and asthma. The root, boiled in milk, is largely used in leucorrhoea and general debility. The Siamese and Indo-Chinese consider the roots to be cordial and attenuant, and useful in paralysis and asthma. The tender shoots and leaves are used in India for bites. In Goa, the leaves, which abound in mucilage, are used as an emollient fomentation in rheumatism and neuralgia. Thailand: Water extracted from the bark is used to treat colds and dermatitis. Ground fresh bark is used as an antiseptic. Tea brewed from the leaves relieves pain and purifi es the blood.

## Anti-infl ammatory

The methanolic fraction of A. ilicifolius leaf extract produced signifi cant inhibition of rat paw oedema, when administered both prior to and after carrageenan administration, in a manner similar to BW755C a synthetic cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitor. The extract decreased protein exudation and leukocyte migration in the peritoneal fl uid, thereby indicating its effectiveness towards inhibiting peritoneal infl ammation. It also produced signifi cant inhibition of cyclooxygenase (1 and 2) and 338 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology lipoxygenase activity. Preincubation of the extract inhibited the production of proinfl ammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The methanolic fraction of the extract was also found to possess signifi cant free radical scavenging activity. The extract on intraperitoneal administration augmented the endogenous antioxidant status, as evident from the signifi cant increase of ferric reducing ability of plasma and total peroxyl radical trapping activity of plasma.

## Chemo preventive

A. To investigate the chemo preventive effi cacy of A. ilicifolius in a transplantable Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC)-bearing murine model, male Swiss albino mice were divided into four groups: Group A was the untreated normal control; Group B was the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma control mice group that received serial, intraperitoneal (ip) inoculations of rapidly proliferating 2 x 10(5) viable Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells in 0.2 mL of sterile phosfate buffered saline; Group C was the plant extract- treated group that received the aqueous leaf extract of A. ilicifolius at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg body weight by single ip injections, once daily for 10, 20 and 30 consecutive days following tumor inoculation (aqueous leaf extract of A. ilicifolius); and Group D was the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma + aqueous leaf extract of A. ilicifolius treatment group. Ethnopharmacology of Acanthus ilicifolius Linn. The chemo preventive potential of the aqueous leaf extract of A. ilicifolius was evaluated in a murine model by studying various biological parameters and genotoxic markers, such as tumor cell count, mean survival of the animals, haematological indices, hepatocellular histology, and immuno-histochemical expression of liver metallothionein protein, sister-chromatid exchanges, and DNA alterations. Treatment of the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma -bearing mice with the aqueous leaf extract of A. ilicifolius signifi cantly (P < 0.001) reduced viable tumor cell count by 68.34% (228.7 x 10(6) +/–0.53) when compared to Ehrlich ascites carcinoma control mice (72.4 x 10(6) +/–0.49), and restored body and organ weights almost to the normal values. Aqueous leaf extract of A. ilicifolius administration also increased (P < 0.001) mean survival of the hosts from 35 +/–3.46 d in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma control mice to 83 +/–2.69 d in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma + aqueous leaf extract of A. ilicifolius treated mice. B. Alcoholic extract of A. ilicifolius (250, 500 mg/kg b wt) was found to be effective against tumor progression and carcinogen induced skin papilloma formation in mice. The extract was found to be cytotoxic towards lung fi broblast (L-929) cells in 72 h MTT assay and the concentration required for 50% cell death was 18 µg/ml. Oral administration of the extract (500 mg/kg b wt) reduced the tumor volume and administration of the same concentration increased the life span by 75% in ascites tumor harboring animals. The extract also signifi cantly delayed the onset of dimethylbenzanthrazene/Croton oil induced skin papilloma in mice in a dose dependent manner.

## macrophylla ex A. DC

<!-- chunk -->

## Introduction

Alstonia is a widespread genus of evergreen trees and shrubs from Apocynaceae (dogbane family). Alstonia (devil tree) consisting of about 40–60 species, native to tropical and subtropical Africa, Central America, Southeast Asia and Australia (Sidiyasa, 1998). About 200 alkaloids have been reported from the genus, many of which are pharmacologically active. Alstonia macrophylla Wall. ex A. DC. is native of Malaysia and frequently planted as an ornamental. The decoctions of A. macrophylla leaves and stem bark are widely used by the Onge and Nicobarese of Little Andaman Islands, India, to treat stomachache, skin diseases and urinary infections. Leaves are reported to have anticholeretic and vulnerary effect, and are greased with hot coconut oil for sprains, bruises and dislocated joints as poultice and used as a febrifuge.

<!-- chunk -->

## Phytochemistry: A. macrophylla is a rich source of monomeric and dimeric

indole alkaloids. The total alkaloid content is the highest in the stem bark and lowest in leaves. Alstophylline, macralstonine, macralstonidine, macrocasalhine, macrosalhine, macrocapamine (Fig. 17.1) and villalstonine (Fig. 17.2) have been reported from the stem bark. Stem bark of the Indian plant yields villalstonine (0.8–1.0%) and macralstonine (0.06%). 11-methoxy-geissaschizine (Fig. 17.3), 10-11-dimethoxy- geissaschizine (Fig. 17.4) and 16-hydroxy-Nb—demethylalstophylline (Fig. 17.5) have been reported from plants growing in Sri Lanka. 342 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology OH CH 3 O H CH 3 OOC N H H N

## Antimicrobial activity: The methanolic crude and methanol-aqueous

extract of A. macrophylla leaves and n-butanol part of the crude extract showed antimicrobial activity against various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. mentagrophytes and Microsporum gypseum. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranges from 64 to 1000 microg/ml for bacteria and 32–128 mg/ml for dermatophytes. The stem- bark extract prepared similarly was found to be less active when compared to the leaves.

<!-- chunk -->

## Anti-infl ammatory activity: Methanolic extract of dried leaves of A.

macrophylla and its fractions were investigated for its anti-infl ammatory activity. The extract at a concentration of 200 mg [kg.sup.-1] and 400 mg [kg.sup.-1], p.o. and its fractions at 25 mg [kg.sup.-1] and 50 mg [kg.sup.-1], p.o. showed the signifi cant dose dependent anti-infl ammatory activity in carrageenan and dextran-induced rats hind paw edema (acute models) as well as in cotton pellet-induced granuloma (chronic model) in rats.

## Antipyretic activity: The methanol extract of A. macrophylla and its

fractions were tested on normal body temperature and yeast-induced pyrexia in Wistar Albino rats. The leaf extract at oral doses of 200 and mg/kg, and the n-butanol fractions of the extract at 50 mg/kg showed signifi cant reduction in normal body temperature and yeast-provoked elevated temperature in a dose-dependent manner comparable to that of standard antipyretic drug paracetamol. The antipyretic effect was started at 1h and extended for at least 5h after the drug administration.

<!-- chunk -->

## CNS activity: Methanol extract at 100–200 mg/kg p.o. and major non-

polar fraction B at 50 mg/kg of A. macrophylla leaves caused a signifi cant reduction in spontaneous activity, remarkable decrease in exploratory behavioral pattern, a reduction in muscle relaxant activity and also signifi cantly potentiated phenobarbitone sodium-induced sleeping time. 348 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology

## Cytotoxic activity: Signifi cant cytotoxic activity was exhibited by

the extract of A. macrophylla on two human lung cancer cell lines, MOR-P (adenocarcinoma) and COR-L23 (large cell carcinoma). Activity-directed fractionation led to the isolation of O-methylmacralstonine, talcarpine, villalstonine, pleiocarpamine, and macraistonine. Villalstonine was found to possess pronounced activity on both cell lines with an IC 50 value less than 5 µM. Thirteen indole alkaloids isolated from the root bark of A. macrophylla and a semisynthetic bisindole O-acetylmacralstonine were assessed for cytotoxic activity against two human lung cancer cell lines, MOR-P (adenocarcinoma) and COR-L23 (large cell carcinoma), using the SRB assay. Pronounced cytotoxic activity was exhibited by the bisindoles on both cell lines. Ethnopharmacology of Alstonia macrophylla ex A. DC The potent alkaloids were further tested against a human normal cell line (breast fi broblasts) and other human cancer cell lines including StMl1 la (melanoma), Caki-2 (renal cell carcinoma), MCF7 (breast adenocarcinoma), and LS174T (colon adenocarcinoma). O-acetylmacralstonine, villalstonine and macrocarpamine were found to possess pronounced activity against cancer cell lines with IC 50 values in the range of 2–10 µM, with no discernible cell-type selectivity. However, O-acetylmacralstonine displayed discernibly less toxicity against the normal breast fi broblasts.

## integrifolia Planch.

<!-- chunk -->

## 19.1 Introduction

The plant is found throughout India at the height of 2000 feet. In the Ayurvedic system of medicine, the plant is reputed as an anti- obesity agent. In addition, it is considered to be carminative, cholagouge, alterative and anti-diuretic. The leaves and stem bark of H. integrifolia are used for skin diseases, obesity, and cancer. The leaves decoction is used in the management of diarrhea.

<!-- chunk -->

## 19.2 Phytochemistry

2α, 3α-dihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid has been reported from heartwood of H. integrifolia. The seeds yield 37.4% yellow colored oil. The oil from the seeds of H. integrifolia is reported to contain the following acids: lauric 0.2%, myristic 3.5%, palmitic 35.1%, stearic 4.5%, arachidic 1.1%, behenic 0.4%, hexadecenoic 1.9% and oleic 53.3%. Recently, 1, 4-Naphthalenedione has been isolated from the plant.

## 19.3 Pharmacological investigations

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Anti-infl ammatory activity: The objective of the present study was to

investigate the anti-infl ammatory property of the aqueous extract of the leaves of H. integrifolia. The hind-paw edema was produced in rats by the sub-planter injection of carageenan. The aqueous extract of H. integrifolia at dose (250 and 500 mg/kg p+.o) was given to observe % inhibition of paw edema which were comparable with indomethacin 354 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology (10 mg/kg p.o) used as a reference drug. The extract administered orally at doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg p.o produced a signifi cant (P < 0.05) dose dependent inhibition of edema formation.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Anti-nausea activity: In a rat model, anti-emetic activity of ethanolic

extract of leaves of H. integrifolia on cisplatin-induced nausea was investigated. Rats react to emetic/nausea-producing stimuli, such as cisplatin, with altered feeding habits, manifested by pica or increased consumption of kaolin. The authors measured pica in rats to quantify cisplatin-induced nausea, and to evaluate the anti nausea effect of pretreatment with ethanolic extract of H. integrifolia, which was given orally. Cisplatin at 3 mg/kg (i.p) induced signifi cant pica accompanied by reduced food intake, suggesting the presence of nausea. Hence, this cisplatin dose was selected for testing the anti nausea activity of H. integrifolia. Cisplatin-induced pica decreased signifi cantly when animals were pretreated with H. integrifolia at doses of 250 mg/kg p.o and 500 mg/kg p.o (P<0.01). H. integrifolia pretreatment decreased cisplatin induced kaolin intake in the rat model of simulated nausea. The fi ndings suggest that H. integrifolia and its active constituent(s) may offer a therapeutic role in chemotherapy-induced emesis.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Antimicrobial, antioxidant and wound-healing activity: A. The

methanolic extracts of H. integrifolia leaves and stem bark were studied for its wound-healing potential. Since wound healing is severely hampered by microbial infection and reactive oxygen species (ROS), this study was undertaken to evaluate antimicrobial and antioxidant activity apart from wound-healing activity. The antimicrobial property of the H. integrifolia was studied against six bacterial and fi ve fungal strains using the agar well diffusion method and minimum microbicidal concentration and minimum inhibitory concentration were determined for each strain. Methanolic extract of stem bark showed a larger zone of inhibition (11.3–20.4 mm) than methanolic extract of leaves (9.6–14.9 mm). The anti-oxidant activity was evaluated by DPPH free radical scavenging activity using HPLC method. The IC 50 values obtained for methanolic extract of stem bark (TPC: 78.53 ± 1.26 mg/g) and methanolic extract of leaves (TPC: 57.71 ± 1.45 mg/g) were 37.66 ± 0.48 and 50.36 ± 0.59 µg/well, respectively. In excision wound model, more than 90% wound healing was recorded in treated groups by 14 d of post surgery, where as only 62.99% was observed in the control group. In incision model, higher breaking strengths and higher hydroxyproline content in Ethnopharmacology of Holoptelea integrifolia Planch. treated groups suggested higher collagen re-deposition than the control group. Further, histopathology studies conformed wound-healing activity of H. integrifolia. B. In another study, the ethanolic crude extract of stem bark of H. integrifolia was screened for its antioxidant activity using α-tocopherol as standard antioxidant. The free radical scavenging potential of the extract was evaluated by two different antioxidant methods; ferric thiocyanate and thiobarbituric acid method. The ethanol extract was found to exhibit good antioxidant property. C. The inhibitory effect of a phytochemical, 1, 4-naphthalenedione, isolated from H. integrifolia on β-lactamase is reported here. This compound was found to have a synergistic effect with the antibiotic amoxicillin against a resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus. The enzyme was purifi ed from the organism and incubated with the compound. An assay showed that the compound can inhibit the enzymatic activity of β-lactamase. Modeling and molecular docking studies indicated that the compound can fi t into the active site of α-lactamase. Hence, the compound can serve as a potential lead compound for the development of effective β-lactamase inhibitor that can be used against β-lactam-resistant microbial strains.

## 4. Antidiarrheal activity: The ethanolic extract of leaves of H. integrifolia

was studied for its antidiarrheal properties in experimental diarrhea, induced by castor oil and magnesium sulfate in mice. At the doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg per oral, the ethanolic extract showed signifi cant and dose-dependent antidiarrheal activity in both models. The extracts also signifi cantly reduced the intestinal transit in charcoal meal test when compared to atropine sulate (5 mg/kg; i.m.). The results showed that the ethanolic extract of leaves of H. integrifolia have a signifi cant antidiarrheal activity and supports its traditional uses in herbal medicine.

## Hepatoprotective: 1. The effects of an orally administered fraction from

the fruits of T. belerica in experimental liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride were studied. Hexobarbitone-induced sleep, zoxazolamine- induced paralysis, transaminases, bilirubin, total protein in serum and microsomal lipid peroxidation and triglycerides in liver were used as indices of liver injury. Pre- and post-treatment with fraction from the fruits of T. belerica reduced, in a dose- dependent manner, the elevated levels of serum tranaminases and bilirubin in rats. 2. Another study investigated the protective effect of T. belerica fruit extract and gallic acid, at different doses against carbon tetrachloride intoxication. Toxicant caused signifi cant increase in the activities 360 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology of serum transaminases and serum alkaline phosphatase. Hepatic lipid peroxidation level increased signifi cantly whereas signifi cant depletion was observed in reduced glutathione level after carbon tetrachloride administration. Treatment with T. belerica extract (200, 400 and 800mg/kg, p.o.) and gallic acid (50, 100 and 200mg/kg, p.o.) showed dose-dependent, recovery in all biochemical parameters. Gallic acid was found to be most effective against carbon tetrachloride induced liver and kidney damage. 3. Gallic acid isolated from fraction of the fruits of T. belerica was evaluated for its hepatoprotective activity against carbon tetrachloride-induced physiological and biochemical alterations in the liver. The main parameters studied were hexobarbitone-induced sleep, zoxazolamine induced paralysis, serum levels of transaminases and bilirubin. The hepatic markers assessed were lipid peroxidation, drug metabolizing enzymes, glucose-6-phosphatase and triglycerides. Administration of gallic acid led to signifi cant reversal of majority of the altered parameters.

## 21.2 Phytochemistry

The roots of the plant contain essential oil, rich in sesquiterpenes and coumarins. Jatamansone or valeranone (Fig. 5.240) is the principal sesquiterpene. Other sesquiterpenes include nardostachone (Fig. 5.241), dihydrojatamansin, jatamansinol, jatamansic acid, jatamansinone, jatamansinol, oroseolol, oroselone, seselin, valeranal, nardostachyin, nardosinone, spirojatamol, jatamol A and B, calarenol, seychellene, seychelane, coumarin: jatamansin or xanthogalin. A new sesquiterpene acid, nardin and new pyranocoumarin: 2’, 2’-dimethyl-3’-methoxy-3’, 4’- dihydropyranocoumarin have been reported. An alkaloid, actinidine has been reported (Fig. 21.1).

## Hepatoprotective activity: Pretreatment of rats with 800 mg/kg body

wt of the 50% ethanolic extract of N. jatamansi demonstrated signifi cant hepatoprotective activity against thioacetamide induced hepatotoxicity. Marked reduction in raised levels of serum transaminase and alkaline phosphatase was observed. Pretreatment of the animals with the extract further resulted in an increase in survival of rats intoxicated with LD90 dose of the hepatotoxic drug.

## Cardio protective and hypolipidemic activity: Rats administered

doxorubicin (15 mg/kg, i.p.) showed myocardial damage that was manifested by the elevation of serum marker enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, aspartate aminotransaminase and alanine aminotransaminase). The animals showed signifi cant changes in the antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase) and lipid peroxidation levels. Pretreatment with N. jatamansi extract signifi cantly prevented these alterations and restored the enzyme activity and lipid peroxides to near normal levels. Restoration of cellular normality accredits the N. jatamansi with a cytoprotective role in doxorubicin-induced cardiac damage. In a study, ethanolic extract of N. jatamansi was studied in Wistar albino rats for cardio protective activity against doxorubicin induced myocardial injury. Doxorubicin is inhibitor of fatty oxidation in the heart and results in cardio toxicity. The rats treated with a single dose of doxorubicin (15 mg/kg) intraperitoneally showed an increase in serum and cardiac lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids and phospholipids), along with a signifi cant rise in serum low density lipoproteins, very low density lipoproteins and a drop in high density lipoproteins levels, resulting in alteration of serum and cardiac lipid metabolizing enzymes. Pretreatment with an extract of N.jatamansi (500 mg/kg) orally for 7 d to doxorubicin induced rats showed a signifi cant prevention in the lipid status with the activities of the lipid metabolizing enzymes. Histopathological 364 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology observations were also in correlation with the biochemical parameters. These fi ndings suggest that the protective and hypolipidemic effect of N. jatamansi against doxorubicin induced myocardial injury in rats could possibly be mediated through its anti lipid peroxidative properties. A 50% ethanolic extract of Curcuma longa (tuber) and N. jatamansi (whole plant) elevated the HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio in triton-induced hyperlipidemic rats. There also was a reduction in the ratio of total cholesterol/phospholipids.

## Nootropic activity: Acetyl cholinesterase inhibitory activity of methanolic

and successive water extracts of N.jatamansi (rhizome), were investigated for acetyl cholinesterase inhibitory activity in vitro. Results indicated that methanolic extracts to be more active than water extracts. The IC (50) values obtained for methanolic and successive water extracts of N.jatamansi was 47.21mug/ml. These results partly substantiate the traditional use of N.jatamansi for improvement of cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

## Anticonvulsant activity: Ethanol extract of the roots of N. jatamansi

was studied for its anticonvulsant activity and neurotoxicity, alone and in combination with phenytoin in rats. The results demonstrated a signifi cant increase in the seizure threshold by N. jatamansi root extract against maximal electroshock seizure model as indicated by a decrease in the extension/fl exion ratio. However, the extract was ineffective against pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures. N. jatamansi root extract also showed minimal neurotoxicity against rotarod test at doses that increased the seizure threshold. Further, pretreatment of rats with phenytoin at a dose of 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg in combination with 50mg/kg of N. jatamansi root extract resulted in a signifi cant increase in the protective index of phenytoin from 3.63 to 13.18. The dose response studies of phenytoin alone and in combination with N. jatamansi extract on the serum levels of phenytoin clearly demonstrated the synergistic action of both the drugs.

## Antidepressant activity: A 15-d treatment with an alcoholic root extract of

N. jatamansi caused an overall increase in the levels of central monoamines and inhibitory amino acids, including a change in the levels of serotonin, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, gamma-amino butyric acid, and taurine in rat brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Antiparkinson’s activity: Rats were treated with 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg

body weight of N. jatamansi for 3 wk. On day 21, 2 microl of 6-OHDA (12 microg in 0.01% in ascorbic acid-saline) was infused into the right striatum, while the sham-operated group received 2 microl of vehicle. Three weeks after the 6-OHDA injection, the rats were tested for neurobehavioral activity and were scarifi ed after 6 wk for the estimation of lipid peroxidation. The increase in drug-induced rotations and defi cits in locomotor activity and muscular coordination due to 6-OHDA injections were signifi cantly and Ethnopharmacology of Nardostachys jatamansi DC. dose-dependently restored by N. jatamansi. A signifi cant decrease in the level of dopamine and its metabolites and an increase in the number of dopaminergic D2 receptors in striatum were observed after 6-OHDA injection, and both were signifi cantly recovered following N. jatamansi treatment.

## Neuroprotective activity: Pretreatment with an alcoholic extract of N.

jatamansi dosed at 250 mg/kg of for 15 d protected rats against focal ischemia caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion. The protective effect may be associated with improving glutathione content, inhibiting lipid peroxidation, and activity on the Na+/K+ ATPase and catalase enzyme systems.

## Nootropic activity: 1. Acetyl cholinesterase inhibitory activity of

methanolic and successive water extracts of N.jatamansi (rhizome), were investigated for acetyl cholinesterase inhibitory activity in vitro. Results indicated that methanolic extracts to be more active than water extracts. The IC (50) values obtained for methanolic and successive water extracts of N.jatamansi was 47.21mug/ml. These results partly substantiate the traditional use of N.jatamansi for improvement of cognition. 2. The elevated plus maze and the passive avoidance paradigm were employed to evaluate learning and memory parameters. Three doses (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) of an ethanolic extract of N. jatamansi were administered for 8 successive days to both young and aged mice. The 200 mg/kg dose of N. jatmansi ethanolic extract signifi cantly improved learning and memory in young mice and also reversed the amnesia induced by diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.). Furthermore, it also reversed aging-induced amnesia due to natural aging of mice. As scopolamine-induced amnesia was reversed, it is possible that the memory improvement may be because of facilitation of cholinergic transmission in the brain. Hence, N. jatamansi might prove to be a useful memory restorative agent in the treatment of dementia seen in elderly persons. The underlying mechanism of action can be attributed to its antioxidant property.

In toxicological studies on rats and mice an oral LD50 of greater than 3160 mg/kg was found, which suggests the possibility of a therapeutically useful dose ratio. Preliminary clinical studies with jatamansone reported reduced incidence of aggressiveness, restlessness, stubbornness and insomnia. In a study conducted on hyperkinetic children, jatamasnone, D-amphetamine and chlorpromazine were compared for effi cacy. Jatamasnone and amphetamine signifi cantly improved behavior but amphetamine was better in reducing aggressiveness and restlessness. Children with mental retardation showed little response to any of the drugs. Jatamansone has fewer side effects than D-amphetamine and chlorpromazine.

## 23.3 Ethnopharmacology

<!-- chunk -->

## Purgative effects: The present study investigated the purgative effects of

barakol on the longitudinal smooth muscle contractions of the rat ileum. The extract increased the force of spontaneous muscle contractions in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 = 0.3 mM). Saxitoxin (0.3 mM) abolished the stimulatory effects of barakol. In addition, atropine (10 mM), partially inhibited barakol-induced smooth muscle contractions suggestive of involvement of cholinergic nerves. The motor effects of barakol were further examined in muscle strips treated with catecholamines to suppress spontaneous contractile activity and decrease muscle tone. Norepinephrine or dopamine (10 mM) decreased the amplitude of spontaneous contractions by 72% and 18%, respectively. The fi ndings suggested the possible role of barakol in gut motility disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

## Anxiolytic effects: The behavioral effects of an extract of Cassia siamea,

and barakol, on an elevated plus-maze compared with diazepam were investigated. An aqueous extract of C. siamea (1, 6, and 12 g/kg body wt., orally) 380 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology produced a small increase in the percentage of the open : total number of arm entries and time, time spent on the end of the open arms, total number of arm entries, and number of rears/min. Barakol [10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally] signifi cantly increased all the behavioral parameters in a manner similar to diazepam (I mg/kg, IP, 30 or 60 min before testing), except that barakol and not diazepam increased both the number of rears and total arm entries. Barakol at 25 and 50 mg/kg increased the percentage of the open: total number of arm entries and time and number of rears. The results are suggestive of anxiolytic properties of barakol similar to diazepam. However barakol differed from diazepam in that it increases exploratory and locomotor behavior.

<!-- chunk -->

## CNS inhibitory effects: Barakol reduced spontaneous locomotor activity,

increased the number of sleeping animals and prolonged the thiopental- induced sleeping time, demonstrating a sedative effect. As regards interactions between barakol and standard convulsants, only a high dose (100 mg/kg, i.p.) of barakol slightly prolonged the latency of clonic convulsion induced by picrotoxin. Barakol (25–100 mg/kg, i.p.) suppressed methamphetamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced hyper-locomotor activity in a dose-dependent manner, indicating an effect on the dopaminergic system. The fi ndings are suggestive of the inhibitory effect of barakol on dopamine release.

## Antioxidant effects: 1. The antioxidant activity of alcoholic extract of C.

siamea rich in polyphenols was investigated. At a concentration of 250 µg/ ml, 96% of DPPH radicals and at 500 µg/ml, 42.7, 32.7 and 64.5% of O2−, H2O2 and NO respectively could be scavenged by C. siamea fl ower extract. The extract also inhibited OH radical induced oxidation of protein (BSA) and LPO in murine hepatic microsomes. C. siamea fl ower extract also exhibited a signifi cant antioxidant activity in acute oxidative tissue injury animal model constituted by CCl4 induced hepatotoxicity. The extract also protected against histopathological changes produced by CCl 4 . 2. The antioxidant potential of hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, methanol, and water extract of bark and leaves of C. siamea was explored by superoxide anion radical scavenging assay. The different extracts showed signifi cant inhibition of superoxide radicals in a dose-dependant manner. Among all the bark extracts of C. siamea, the methanol extract showed the maximum inhibition of 60.5% at 800 µg/ ml concentration and water extract also showed strong antioxidant potential of 51.3% at 1000 µg/ml concentration. The various leaf extracts of C. siamea showed moderate antioxidant potential of 25– 50% at 1000 µg/ml. This preliminary study indicates the antioxidant activity of the bark and leaves of C. siamea. Ethnopharmacology of Cassia siamea Lam.

## Antiplasmodial effects: The ethnobotanical use of C. siamea as a

febrifuge led to the bioassay-guided fractionation of stem bark of the plant extract, using the parasite lactate dehydrogenase assay and multi- resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum (K1) for assessing the in vitro antimalarial activity. Emodin and lupeol were isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction. Both compounds were found to be the active principles responsible for the antiplasmodial property with IC 50 values of 5 µg/ mL, respectively. Three alkaloids, cassiarins C−E, and a new chromone, 10,11-dihydroanhydrobarakol, isolated from fl owers of C. siamea showed moderate antiplasmodial activity against Plasmodium falciparum 3D7.

## Analgesic and anti-infl ammatory effects

Analgesic, anti-infl ammatory and antipyretic activities of the petroleum ether, chloroform, ethanol and water extracts of C. siamea stem-bark were assessed in rats with the hot plate test, paw pressure and carrageenan induced paw oedema, respectively. Cytotoxicity was assessed against KB and Vero cells. At the doses used (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) ethanol and water extracts showed signifi cant and dose-dependent analgesic and anti-infl ammatory effects. None of the extracts had cytotoxic activity on KB and Vero cell lines and the most active extracts (ethanol and water extracts) had no acute toxicity.

## Cardio protective effects

Barakol, isolated from leaves of C. siamea, was investigated on aconitine- induced cardiac arrhyihmias in anesthetized rats. The bolus intravenous injection of aconitine induced ventricular fi brillation and ventricular tachycardia. Pretreatment with barakol (10 mg/kg i.v.) reduced the incidence of aconitine-induced ventricular fi brillation and ventricular tachycardia, as well as mortality. The fi ndings suggest that the mechanisms of the protective effects of barakol on aconitine-induced cardiac toxicity were related to the prevention of intracellular Na + accumulation.

## Toxicity

<!-- chunk -->

## Acute: Acute toxicity study of the ethanol extract of C. siamea in rats was

conducted following intraperitoneal administration of graded doses. LD50 of C. siamea extract was found to be 9600 mg kg-1 body weight. Mortality occurred in rats treated with high doses of 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000 and 16000 mg kg-1 and appears to be dose dependent.

<!-- chunk -->

## Subacute: The LD

50 of barakol after oral administration was 2.33 g/kg. In an acute hepatotoxicity study, single-oral administration of various doses of barakol (60, 100 and 200 mg/kg) were given to rats and the animals were scarifi ed at 24 h after the administration. Liver biopsy revealed no 382 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology sign of liver damage when compared to those from a paracetamol treated positive control group. In a subacute toxicity test, barakol at doses of 60, 120 and 240 mg/kg were orally administered daily for a period of 4 wk. A half of 240 mg/kg group, called a recovery group, was maintained for a further 2 wk without barakol administration. No mortality was observed in the controlled and barakol-treated animals. From the histological examination, the barakol-treated group showed only fatty changes in the liver. From blood chemistry determination, bilirubin was increased (p<0.05) in a dose- dependent manner and the value returned to normal values within 2 wk. The fi ndings suggested regular monitoring of serum bilirubin with clinical use of barakol .

<!-- chunk -->

## Chronic: A six-month toxicity study of C. siamea powdered leaves

(containing 0.17% barakol) was performed in fi ve groups of 15 Wistar rats of each sex. The control group received 5 ml of distilled water/kg BW/day orally, while three of the four experimental groups were given C. siamea powdered leaves at the doses of 20, 200 and 2,000 mg/kg BW/day. For the recovery study, the fourth treatment group received the powdered leaves at the dose of 2,000 mg/kg BW/day for 6 mon and was later kept without C. siamea administration for 14 more days before being scarifi ed. The levels of bilirubin of the animals receiving the powdered leaf at the doses of 200 and 2,000 mg/kg BW/day were signifi cantly higher than those of their controls. The hepatic damage was more pronounced in male rats. The results showed that long-term consumption of the leaf from C. siamea is linked to dose-dependent hepatotoxic effect in rats even at the therapeutic dose.

## Anti asthmatic and anti allergic effects: The total alkaloids of T. asthmatica

were tested for mast cell stabilizing effect in comparison with disodium cromoglycate by challenging against three different mast cell degranulators, diazoxide, carbachol and polymixin B, in vitro. Both tylophora alkaloids and disodium cromoglycate prevented in similar concentrations, the mast cell degranulation occurring with diazoxide alone. Tylophora alkaloids may have similar mechanism of action as disodium cromoglycate through cyclic AMP. The effect of the alcoholic extract of T. asthmatica on weight of the adrenal glands and its functional activities and pituitary adrenal axis was studied on normal, unilaterally adrenalectomised, dexamethasone treated and hypophysectomised male albino rats. The extracts showed stimulation of adrenals as indicated by increase in weight and decrease in cholesterol and vitamin C. It was concluded that probably, T. asthmatica acts by direct stimulation of adrenal cortex.

## Cytotoxic effect: A study reported cytotoxicity of alkaloids derived from

T. asthmatica by Ali et al., (2001). Tylophora alkaloids induced apoptosis in K562 cells with characteristic apoptotic features like nuclear condensation, apoptotic body formation, fl ipping of membrane phosphatidylserine, activation of caspase 3 and release of mitochondrial cytochrome c. These studies suggest that the Tylophora alkaloids, in addition to their antiproliferative effects also induce apoptosis in erythroleukemic cells. These observations imply that Tylophora alkaloids could be useful molecules for their antiproliferative activity and for induction of apoptosis in tumor cells. Ethnopharmacology of Tylophora asthmatica Wight & Arn. Four tylophorine analogs, designated DCB-3500, DCB-3501, DCB- 3502, and DCB-3503. All four tylophorine analogs exerted potent growth- inhibitory effects against HepG2, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, and KB, a human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line. HepG2 cells. Unlike conventional antitumor drugs, 3 micro M DCB-3503 did not cause DNA breaks or apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Tylophorine analogs had an inhibitory effect on cyclic AMP response elements, activator protein-1 sites, or nuclear factor-kappaB binding site-mediated transcriptions.

## Hepatoprotective effect: The methanolic extract of T. asthmatica leaves was

screened for hepatoprotective activity in carbon tetrachloride induced hepatotoxicity in albino rats. Hepatoprotective activity of methanolic extract at a dose of 200 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg body weight, i.p., was compared with Silymarin (25 mg/kg, i.p.) treated animals. Tylophora indica leaves (200 and 300 mg/kg) exhibited signifi cant reduction in serum hepatic enzymes when compared to rats treated with carbon tetrachloride alone. Furthermore, histopathological studies were also done to support the study.

## Immunosuppressive effect: Crude extract of the leaves of T. asthmatica

inhibited delayed hypersensitivity reaction to sheep red blood cells in rats when the alkaloid mixture was administered before and after immunization with these cells. The alkaloid mixture also inhibited contact sensitivity to dinitro-fl uorobenzene in mice when given prior to or after contact sensitization. Lymphocytes taken from contact sensitized mice, when treated with tylophora alkaloid in vitro and transferred into naive syngeneic hosts, could suppress the transfer of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response.

## Imuunomodulator effect: Con A induced proliferation of splenocytes was

used as a model system to study the effect of the alkaloids on cellular immune responses. The alkaloid mixture was found to inhibit proliferation of splenocytes at higher concentrations and augment the same at lower concentrations. Both macrophages and T cells were found to be vulnerable to tylophora alkaloids. Inhibition of proliferation at higher concentrations of the alkaloid is due to inhibition of IL-2 production and activation of macrophages, which have a cytostatic effect.

## Clinical studies: One such study randomly assigned 110 bronchial asthma

patients to receive one Tylophora asthmatica leaf (150 mg of the leaf by weight) or a comparable placebo to be chewed and swallowed daily in the early morning for 6 d. At the end of 1 wk, 62% of the patients consuming the tylophora reported experiencing moderate to complete relief of their asthma symptoms compared to 28% in the placebo group. In a follow-up study, the alcoholic extract of crude tylophora leaves in 1 gram of glucose 388 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology had comparable effects to that of chewing the crude leaf, with 56% of the patients reporting moderate to complete improvement in asthmatic symptoms compared to 32% in the placebo group. In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study of 195 individuals with asthma, participants showed signifi cant improvement when given 40 mg of a T.asthmatica alcohol extract daily for 6 d as compared to the placebo. Surprisingly, the difference was even more marked months after use of the herb had been stopped. Similar long-lasting results were seen in two double-blind placebo-controlled studies involving over individuals with asthma. In another clinical trial, 30 patients with a diagnosis of bronchial asthma for at least 2 yr were assigned at random to one of two treatment groups consisting of 15 individuals each. One group received either 350 mg of tylophora leaf powder or placebo daily in the fi rst week. In comparison, a second group of asthmatics were given a similar amount of the leaf for d followed by an anti-asthmatic drug combination. Overall, the results of the study showed that the amount of oxygen in the lung increased in those using the leaf, but decreased in those using the placebo. However, the designs of most of these studies are a bit convoluted, and various pieces of information are missing from the reports, making it diffi cult to evaluate the validity of these trials. A higher quality double- blind study that enrolled 135 individuals found no benefi t from T. asthmatica in asthma. In another double-blind placebo-controlled study, Tylophora asthmatica produced a signifi cant reduction in sneezing and nasal obstruction, and the improvement noted in ventilatory capacity lasted for nearly 10 d.

## Toxicology: One report described dermatitis as toxic effect of the alkaloids

from T.asthmatica. The alkaloids tylophorine and tylophorinine, are described as vesicant but no formal skin testing appears to have been reported in the literature. Administration of pure alkaloid of T. asthamatica, suspended in peanut oil and given in single doses (12–100 mg/kg) by gavage, to male rats caused inactivity, respiratory distress, salivation, nasal discharge and diarrhea. The oral LD50 value of the alkaloid was 35.32 mg/kg.

## 25.1 Introduction

Discoroides in his book, De Materia Medica, described the use of the extract of genus Colchicum for the treatment of gout. In modern clinical practice, colchicine is prescribed in cases of gout and rheumatism not responding to standard medications. Gout is a clinical condition characterized by high- levels of uric acid in the blood resulting in arthritis. Colchicine containing medicinal herbs is widely used in traditional systems of medicine including Ayurveda and Unani. In Ayurveda, Indian colchicum (Colchicum autumnale Linn. is used in anti-gout prescriptions, suranjana vati (tablet preparation) and suranjanavelha (confection preparation). Colchicine was offi cial in the London Pharmacopoeia until 1639 and was reintroduced in 1778. Cochicine (Fig. 5.5) is basically a water-soluble alkaloid, initially isolated from corms of Meadow saffron (Colchicum luteum Baker). In addition, colchicine has analgesic and anti-infl ammatory activity which makes it ideal for anti-rheumatic therapy. Colchicine has been also studied as an anticancer agent. Colchicine inhibits polymerization of microtubules by binding to tubulin. In addition to gout, colchicine is used in the treatment of psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, Becket’s syndrome, penile condylomata acuminata, cardiomyopathy, familial Mediterranean fever, secondary amlydosis and scleroderma. Colchicine is toxic and a typical poisoning case mimics arsenic toxicity. Colchicine is known to cause leucopenia, dermatitis and alopecia and reported to be teratogenic in animal studies.

## 25.2 Medicinal herbs and colchicine

<!-- chunk -->

## Table 25.1 Chief medicinal herbs containing colchicine.

Colchicum autumnale Linn., commonly known as Autumn Crocus or Meadow Saffron, is native to Central and southeastern Europe and Africa. It has been introduced to Canada and the U.S. Colchicum autumnale is a small herbaceous perennial plant 10 to 40 cm high, fl owering typically in the autumn after the leaves have disappeared. Leaves are lanceolate, dark green, shiny. They appear in the spring, and then die back before the fl owers appear. Flowers: pink, purple or white fl owers in groups of 1 to are produced from an underground bulb. All parts of the plant contain toxins. The greatest concentration of toxins is found in the seeds and the bulb. Colchicine is present in the fl owers (0.1 to 0.8% in fresh fl owers; up to 1.8% in dried fl owers), in the seeds (0.2 to 0.8%) in the bulb (0.4 to 0.6%). The leaves contain very low amounts of colchicine. The other toxins present, which are closely related to colchicine, includes desacetylmethylcolchicine, desacetylthiocolchicine, colchicoside, demethyl desacetylcolchicine.

<!-- chunk -->

## In traditional medicine, C. autumnale is classifi ed as an alterative,

aphrodisiac, carminative and laxative and used in gout, rheumatism and disorders of the liver and spleen. Colchicum luteum Baker., commonly known as Yellow Autumn Crocus, Bitter Colchicum and Golden Collyrium, is found in East Asia-China to the Himalayas. It is an annual herb with stem-base below the ground, Flowers golden yellow, 1–2, on a very short stalk or scape among leaf- sheaths; fruits 2.5–3.8 cm long capsules with long recurved beaks, having numerous seeds; seeds brownish-white, globose or irregularly globular, 2–3 mm in diameter.

<!-- chunk -->

## The herb contains alkaloids, including, colchicine, colchiceine,

demecoicine or colchamine, cornigerine, lutiene, luteidine and collutine N-oxide. Corm contains 0.25% and seeds contain 0.4% of colchicine. Colchicine is readily soluble in water and decomposes into colchiceine. The corm also contains gallic acid, tannic acid, gum and starch. The poisoning of the plant is not unusual and comes through the confusion of the tuber 392 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology with an onion or preparation of the leaves as a salad. Poisoning has been reported even by the milk of goats and sheep who have eaten the plant. Gloriosa superba Linn., commonly known as Glory Lily, is another source of the alkaloid. It is a beautiful, herbaceous, tall, glabrous, branching leaf tip climber, about 1–3 m tall. Leaves alternate, opposite or tenately whorled, lanceolate, strongly nerved, nerves parallel, leaf-tip ending in tendril like spiral. Flowers large, showy, axillary, solitary on long pedicels, and nodding.

<!-- chunk -->

## The plant contains alkaloids: colchicine corresponding to 1.3% (10),

superbine and gloriosine. Superbine is toxic and allied to bitter principle of squill. 3-demethyl-N-formyl-N-deacetyl-b-lumicolchicine, 3-demethyl- g-lumicolchicine and 3-demethyl colchicines have been reported. Recently a glycoside (3-O-demethylcolchicine-3-O-alpha-D-glucopyranoside) has been isolated from the seeds. Four fractions of Gloriosa superba L., i.e. hexane fraction, dichloromethane fraction 1, dichloromethane fraction 2, and methanol fraction, were investigated for colchicine-like activity using a mosquito cytogenetic assay. The results revealed that the latter three fractions yielded promisingly high colchicine-like activity, whereas the hexane fraction yielded very low activity compared with 1% colchicine in a 0.85% sodium chloride solution. The clinical manifestations of colchicine toxicity include gastroenteritis, acute renal failure, cardio toxicity and hematological abnormalities In one case, a young woman ingested 125 g of tubers containing 0.3% colchicine which is equivalent of 350 mg of colchicine. Within 2 h the patient was vomiting and became unconscious on the next day. Acute ascending polyneuropathy and dermatitis have been reported following ingestion of tubers of the plant. Massive generalized alopecia has been reported. Anti- spermatogenic activity of extracts has been reported. In traditional medicine, G. superba is classifi ed as acrid, anthelmintic, laxative and abortifaceint. It is used in the treatment of chronic ulcers, leprosy, infl ammation, hemorrhoids, skin diseases and intestinal worms. G. rothchildiana O Brien, G.planti, G. lutea, G. casuariana and G. vuchuria are also known to contain colchicine. Iphigenia indica (L.) Kunth is found in the Himalayas, Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Malaysia and Australia. It is an herb 20–40 cm high; stem simple or sparsely branched. Leaves mostly crowded along steam, linear or gradually tapering, fl at or channeled, 5–20 cm long, 1.5–4.5

## 25.3 Ginkgo biloba Linn. and colchicine

Ginkgo biloba Linn. (Ginkgoaceae), has been used as peripheral vasodilator in traditional medicine. It is used in the treatment of tinnitus, dementia and intermittent claudication. Researchers identifi ed a compound similar to colchicine in pooled placental blood. While tracing the origin of the compound, they examined blood samples of 24 women . Only fi ve women showed the presence of colchicine and were consuming some herbal product (these were identifi ed as Ginkgo and Echinacea products from local retail outlets). The ginkgo-based herbal products were found to contain signifi cant amounts of colchicine. The authors of the study warned that consumption of ginkgo supplements by pregnant women may pose dangers to developing fetuses. The fi ndings about ginkgo were strongly criticized by several herbal experts and scientists. Some experts were of the view that the investigators misidentifi ed a non-toxic ginkgo compound as colchicine. The ginkgo compound reportedly has a structure similar to that of colchicine and the researchers were not able to differentiate between the two. Further, a comprehensive review of the scientifi c data available on ginkgo never revealed the presence of colchicine in Ginkgo biloba.

## Proper identifi cation of ancient drug lakśmanā is a debatable topic. The

drug has been mentioned as a cure for female infertility in ancient texts. Further, it is considered to be a type of kantkārī. Disogenin has been reported from various Solanum species like S. xanthocarpum Schrad et Wendl. and Solanum khasianum C.B. Clarke. Fruits of these species are in high demand for production of progesterones of natural origin. These are prized drugs for curing conditions like infertility and habitual abortions (coherence with the ancient texts). S. khasianum has white fl owers. Ancient texts have not mentoined the detailed morphology of lakshmana, but presence of white fl owers have been mentoined. Work on S. khasianum as a possible representative of lakshmana is warranted.

## 27.1 Introduction

P. marsupium, or the Indian Kino Tree is a medium to large, deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall. It is native to India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. In India it is found in parts of the Western Ghats in the Karnataka-Kerala region. Pterocarpus marsupium is one of the most highly valued trees of Eastern herbal medicine, renowned for its blood sugar-lowering effect. It is commonly known as vijaysar and was recommended as early as 1000 BC by Sushruta for the treatment of diabetes. In traditional practice, diabetic patients were given water which had been allowed to sit overnight in a goblet made from P. marsupium heartwood.

The phenolics, marsupsin, pterosupin, and, pterostilbene have been Antidiabetic Potential of Pterocarpus marsupium identifi ed as the blood sugar lowering components of heartwood, while (-)-epicatechin has been identifi ed as the blood sugar lowering compound in the bark. From the petrol extract of P. marsupium, a new sesquiterpene alcohol; elin-4(15)-en-1β,11-diol, β-eudesmol, erythrodiol-3-monoacetate and pterostilbene have been reported. A novel isofl avonoid glycol, marsupol has been characterized from heartwood. 2-hydroxy-2-benzylcoumaranone, carpusin, has been an extractive of heartwood. Pterocarposide, an isoaurone C-glucoside has been reported from aqueous extract of heartwood.

## 27.3 Ethnopharmacology

1. A fl avonoid fraction extracted from the bark of P. marsupium was studied for the hypoglycemic activity on normal and alloxanized albino rats. The fl avonoid fraction did not show a consistent effect on normal blood sugar levels but it effectively reversed the alloxan- induced changes in the blood sugar level and the beta-cell population in the pancreas. The fl avonoid fraction also showed a protective effect when it was given prior to alloxan administration. 2. Glucose levels in rats with hyperglycemia induced by streptozotocin were determined after i.p. administration of marsupsin, pterosupin, and pterostilbene. Marsupsin and pterostilbene signifi cantly lowered the blood glucose level of hyperglycemic rats, and the effect was comparable to that of metformin. 3. Protective effects of the methanolic extract of P. marsupium heartwood were evaluated on NIDDM-induced rat gastric ulceration and mucosal offensive and defensive factors. NIDDM was produced in 5-d-old rat puppies by administering streptozotocin (70 mg/kg, i.p). The animals showing blood glucose level > 140 mg/dl after 12 wk of STZ administration were considered as NIDDM positive rats. P. marsupium (750 mg/kg) decreased the blood sugar level both in normal and NIDDM rats. 4. A study investigated the infl uence of methanolic extract of P. marsupium and isolated 7-O-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl oxy-4′-methoxy-5-hydroxy isofl avone on a battery of cellular targets Glut-4, PPARγ and PI3 kinase. The signifi cant glucose uptake showed by P. marsupium crude and pure was comparable with insulin and rosiglitazone. Elevation of Glut-4 and PPARγ gene expression in parallel with glucose uptake supported the in vitro glucose uptake activity of P. marsupium methanolic extract and isofl avone. PI3 kinase plays an important role in glucose transport and activated by Pterocarpus marsupium methanolic extract but not the isolated pure isofl avone. 402 Herbalism, Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology 5. The antidiabetic activity of various subfractions of the alcohol extract of the bark of P. marsupium was evaluated in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. The results indicated that P. marsupium can control the diabetes related metabolic alterations apart from controlling the glucose levels. Among the fractions tested the butanol subfraction was found to be more active in comparison with other subfractions.

## 27.4 Clinical trials

1. A small clinical trial was carried out with 10 patients, who were given 200 ml of water, which was stored in a glass overnight, twice a day for one month, taken after lunch, whereas water stored for the whole day was drunk after dinner. There was an encouraging reduction of blood sugar from the second week of treatment and this hypo-glycemic activity continued as long as heartwood was given. 2. In clinical trials with human subjects, P. marsupium has shown remarkable anti-diabetic action. In two clinical trials, diabetic patients were given no treatment other than administration of an extract of P. marsupium. The fi rst study evaluated both newly-diagnozed and untreated type diabetics. Ninety seven patients were given varying doses of an extract of P. marsupium ranging from 2 to 4 gms a day over a period of 12 wk. At the end of the study period, parameters were evaluated for all the patients. The results showed that 67% of the patients were able to reduce and maintain glucose levels by using various amounts of P. marsupium extract. Of this group, 73% showed stabilized glucose levels at a daily dose of 2 gms of Pterocarpus extract, whereas 16% required 3 gms a day and 10% stabilized at 4 gms per day. 3. In another study using human subjects, 22 diabetics, mostly with type 2 diabetes, ranging in age from 29 to 70 yr were given a decoction of either 2 or 4 ounces three times daily made from 36 or 72 gms of dry bark of Pterocarpus marsupium respectively for 7 d. Four parameters were monitored during this study: 1) fasting blood sugar, 2) glucose tolerance, 3) urine sugar content and 4) diabetic symptoms. The subjects were separated into two groups; Group A with 10 participants and Group B with 12. Group A received a decoction of ounces 3 times a day, while Group B received 4 ounces 3 times a day. Among the subjects in Group A, 3 out of 10 patients showed improvement in only one area of testing; glucose tolerance. In contrast, of the 12 patients in Group B experienced benefi ts in all tested areas. These patients showed signifi cant improvement in glucose tolerance and glucose uremia, and also a decrease in fasting blood sugar and amelioration of some diabetic symptoms. No undesirable side effects were noted during the course of the study. Antidiabetic Potential of Pterocarpus marsupium
