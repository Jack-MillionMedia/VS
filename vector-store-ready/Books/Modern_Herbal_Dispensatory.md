# The Modern Herbal Dispensatory

# Praise for The Modern Herbal Dispensatory

<!-- chunk -->

### “The Modern Herbal Dispensatory relies on the solid foundation that comes

<!-- chunk -->

### from direct interaction with living, breathing botanicals. To this it adds a

<!-- chunk -->

### specificity gleaned from twenty-first century science: clear guidelines rooted in

<!-- chunk -->

### chemistry and physiology provide definitive answers to questions of extraction

<!-- chunk -->

### method, solvent, timing, and formulation. If you’ve ever wondered which

<!-- chunk -->

### extraction method to use for a given plant, or felt reluctant to try advanced

<!-- chunk -->

### techniques like percolation, this clear and concise reference guide will become a

<!-- chunk -->

### trusted companion. A must-have for herbal educators, clinicians, and

<!-- chunk -->

### manufacturers alike!”

<!-- chunk -->

### —Guido Masé, cofounder and codirector, Vermont Center for Integrative

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbalism

<!-- chunk -->

### “Thomas Easley and Steven Horne have done it once again. In the Modern

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal Dispensatory, historic traditions of medicine making have been captured

<!-- chunk -->

### and shared in a way that empowers the modern lay herbalist to capture the

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits of botanical medicine in the most accessible and potent form. Weaving

<!-- chunk -->

### together folk teachings and scientific perspectives, this book bridges the

<!-- chunk -->

### spectrum of herbal medicine to provide an inspiring, detailed, and practical

<!-- chunk -->

### handbook for herbalists at all levels of experience. This guide should be on the

<!-- chunk -->

### bookshelves of every herbal school, home apothecary, and herbal production

## INTRODUCTION

# On Herbal Medicine

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal medicine is one of the most ancient of the healing arts. It is, and always

<!-- chunk -->

### will be, the medicine of the people. No matter which political party is in power,

<!-- chunk -->

### no matter what is deemed legal versus illegal, not even the FDA in all of its

<!-- chunk -->

### regulatory glory can prevent someone from stepping out their door and using

<!-- chunk -->

### nature’s free medicine. Herbal medicine exists, and always has, because we live

<!-- chunk -->

### in symbiosis with plants. As herbalist Sam Coffman says, with every breath we

<!-- chunk -->

### take we perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation with nature. Plants have been

<!-- chunk -->

### here longer than we have. They have learned their lessons and adapted to their

<!-- chunk -->

### environment, and they have produced a beautiful language to communicate those

<!-- chunk -->

### lessons with other plants, animals, and fungi. The chemical compounds that

<!-- chunk -->

### plants produce, their biochemical language, is so complicated that we haven’t

<!-- chunk -->

### even scratched the surface in the thousand or so plants that have been

<!-- chunk -->

### researched, let alone the remaining tens of thousands of plants around the world

<!-- chunk -->

### that are used as medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Although we may not understand how plants act chemically in our body, we

<!-- chunk -->

### have a long and well-documented history of their use as food and medicine. As

<!-- chunk -->

### we move toward a more sustainable world with clean energy production, locally

<!-- chunk -->

### grown organic foods, and nature conservation, we must look at our current

<!-- chunk -->

### model of medicine through the same filter of sustainability. A world that remains

<!-- chunk -->

### totally dependent on high-cost chemical medicines, controlled by multinational

<!-- chunk -->

### pharmaceutical companies whose main purpose is profit, is dependent upon the

<!-- chunk -->

### very institutions that created the environmental problems that are poisoning this

<!-- chunk -->

### world.

<!-- chunk -->

### Modern medicine and the judicious use of pharmaceuticals are essential for

<!-- chunk -->

### treating many serious illnesses. But although it is a great disease-care system,

<!-- chunk -->

### modern medical care is not a health care system. Any system of medicine that is

<!-- chunk -->

### separated from the greater whole of health, including food production, ecological

<!-- chunk -->

### health, social health, and emotional health, can only put a bandage on a bullet

<!-- chunk -->

### wound, conveniently masking the real issues that are slowly bleeding us to

<!-- chunk -->

### death. Rising costs for disease care and lack of access to care are taking a toll on

<!-- chunk -->

### everyone, and minorities and underprivileged groups bear the brunt of that

<!-- chunk -->

### burden. In America, disease care is the primary cause of financial ruin: Nearly

<!-- chunk -->

### two million people file bankruptcy every year because of medical bills.

# USING HERBS AS MEDICINE

<!-- chunk -->

### Medicinal plants grow everywhere and are easily available for harvest or

<!-- chunk -->

### purchase for a fraction of the cost of modern pharmaceuticals. Learning how to

<!-- chunk -->

### make your own herbal medicines is as easy as learning how to cook. The goal of

<!-- chunk -->

### this book is to empower you to use herbs to help yourself, your family, and

<!-- chunk -->

### others.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mastering herbalism involves a lot of work. Different herbs with entirely

<!-- chunk -->

### different medicinal actions can have the same common name. Conversely, the

<!-- chunk -->

### same herb can be called many different names depending on what book you are

<!-- chunk -->

### looking at. Learning the Latin (botanical) name of a plant is a good place to start

<!-- chunk -->

### to identify the correct herb, but identifying the right plant is just the first step.

<!-- chunk -->

### Different parts of a single plant can have different actions on the body. The

<!-- chunk -->

### root of dandelion is a wonderful digestive tonic and gently stimulates phase one

<!-- chunk -->

### liver detoxification. Dandelion leaves, on the other hand, are a strong diuretic;

<!-- chunk -->

### and the flowers, prepared as a flower essence or a wine, are specific for helping

<!-- chunk -->

### overachievers who are tense and stressed to learn to go with the flow.

<!-- chunk -->

### How you use an herb makes a difference in how it affects the body. Different

<!-- chunk -->

### constituents are soluble in different mediums. Some constituents of plants are

<!-- chunk -->

### exclusively alcohol soluble, whereas others only come out in water. Yarrow is a

<!-- chunk -->

### great herb for fevers when it is prepared as a hot infusion (tea) of the flowers. A

<!-- chunk -->

### hot infusion draws out the aromatic qualities of yarrow that stimulate circulation

<!-- chunk -->

### and promote perspiration, whereas a decoction extracts more of the bitter and

<!-- chunk -->

### astringent principles. Many Native Americans used a cooled decoction of the

<!-- chunk -->

### whole herb (flowers and leaves) as a digestive tonic for weak digestion. The

<!-- chunk -->

### dried leaves make an excellent styptic for cuts and wounds, and encapsulated

<!-- chunk -->

### yarrow clears the lymphatics, stimulates innate immunity, and helps relieve

<!-- chunk -->

### urinary tract infections. Yarrow essential oil is anti-inflammatory, but most of

<!-- chunk -->

### this oil is lost when the herb is dried. Yarrow flower essence is used to help

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitive individuals who overidentify with other people’s problems (a

<!-- chunk -->

### characteristic that comes naturally to many herbalists).

<!-- chunk -->

### Some books list yarrow as being good for toothache; the Diné (Navajo) and

<!-- chunk -->

### other Native Americans use yarrow for this purpose. But swallowing a capsule

<!-- chunk -->

### or tincture won’t do anything for a toothache, nor will chewing on dried mature

<!-- chunk -->

### leaves. The part of the plant that is used for toothache is the purplish part of the

<!-- chunk -->

### young leaves, which contain a topical analgesic. The fresh young leaves are

<!-- chunk -->

### chewed to relieve tooth pain. As you can see, knowing how a plant is prepared

<!-- chunk -->

### and how that changes its usage is an important part of effective herbalism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Much of the information about how to properly prepare and administer herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### is being lost as people increasingly rely on commercial herbal preparations.

<!-- chunk -->

### Traditional herbalists keep the knowledge of how to make and use herbs alive.

<!-- chunk -->

### This book aims to present different methods for preparing and administering

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs to help you choose not only the appropriate remedy but the preparation

<!-- chunk -->

### method that brings forth the actions you want. We hope it will help you learn to

<!-- chunk -->

### use herbs in new and creative ways.

## CHAPTER ONE

# Getting Started

<!-- chunk -->

## BASIC CONCEPTS IN HERBAL MEDICINE

<!-- chunk -->

### his book is about making herbal medicines, and if you’re going to make

<!-- chunk -->

### effective herbal medicines, you need to be familiar with some basic

<!-- chunk -->

### concepts.

# HERBAL ENERGETICS

<!-- chunk -->

### The major constituents that give herbs their various actions can be detected using

<!-- chunk -->

### human senses. The effects of these basic constituents can be felt and observed in

<!-- chunk -->

### one’s own body. This observation and detection are what modern Western

<!-- chunk -->

### herbalists call energetics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbs can be divided into broad energetic categories based on their taste,

<!-- chunk -->

### constituents, and basic effects on the body. Learning these basic categories is

<!-- chunk -->

### like learning the alphabet or musical notes: They form the basis for

<!-- chunk -->

### understanding the language of herbalism. Just as musical notes are arranged

<!-- chunk -->

### together to create an infinite array of music, the energetic properties of herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### blend together to create thousands of unique herbal profiles.

<!-- chunk -->

### The twelve basic categories of herbs we’re about to introduce you to have

<!-- chunk -->

### some basic qualities in common. We refer to these in energetic terms, using three

<!-- chunk -->

### sets of qualities.

# HOW HERBS AFFECT ENERGY PRODUCTION

<!-- chunk -->

## ▪ Warming refers to herbs that stimulate or speed up metabolism, increase

<!-- chunk -->

### energy production and warmth, and bring blood flow and vitality to tissues that

<!-- chunk -->

### are pale and cool.

<!-- chunk -->

## ▪ Cooling refers to herbs that sedate or slow down metabolism to decrease

<!-- chunk -->

### energy production while cooling or soothing irritation and redness.

<!-- chunk -->

## ▪ Neutral describes herbs that are neither warm nor cool. Neutral herbs do not

<!-- chunk -->

### have a strong effect on circulation or cellular metabolism.

# HOW HERBS AFFECT THE DENSITY OF TISSUES

<!-- chunk -->

## ▪ Moistening refers to herbs that increase the moisture content of tissues, which

<!-- chunk -->

### means they lubricate and soften dry, brittle, or hardened tissues.

<!-- chunk -->

## ▪ Drying refers to herbs that remove excess fluid from tissue, causing it to

<!-- chunk -->

### become more firm and dense, relieving conditions of dampness and swelling.

<!-- chunk -->

## ▪ Balancing is the term we use for herbs that normalize tissues that are either

<!-- chunk -->

### damp or dry, helping to balance the amount of moisture and solids (minerals)

<!-- chunk -->

### within the tissues.

# HOW HERBS AFFECT MUSCLE TONE, FLOW, AND

# SECRETION

<!-- chunk -->

## ▪ Constricting refers to herbs that increase the tone or tension within muscles

<!-- chunk -->

### and other tissues, which stops excess flow and secretion. These herbs tone up

<!-- chunk -->

### tissues that have become overly relaxed or weak and that are leaking or

<!-- chunk -->

### secreting fluids such as blood or mucus.

<!-- chunk -->

## ▪ Relaxing refers to herbs that relax muscle cramps and spasms, relieving excess

<!-- chunk -->

### tension in the tissues. This promotes easier flow and movement and can help to

<!-- chunk -->

### increase deficient secretion.

<!-- chunk -->

## ▪ Nourishing is the term we use for herbs that provide essential nutrients that aid

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue healing, improving tissue structure and function.

# THE TWELVE CATEGORIES OF HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### With this basic understanding of energetic terms, let’s look at the twelve

<!-- chunk -->

### categories of herbs referred to in this book. Keep in mind that any individual

<!-- chunk -->

### herb may fit into more than one category.

# PUNGENT HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### Pungent herbs have a spicy or hot taste and typically have a very sharp aroma.

<!-- chunk -->

### These are plants that are used to add spiciness to dishes, such as capsicum

<!-- chunk -->

### (cayenne pepper), ginger, mustard, and onions. The pungent flavor of these herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### is due to the presence of resins, alkamides, allyl sulfides, or monoterpene

<!-- chunk -->

### essential oils.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbs with a pungent taste are warming and drying. They move blood and

<!-- chunk -->

### energy upward toward the head and outward from the interior of the body to the

<!-- chunk -->

### skin and mucous membranes. This means they help to dispel stagnation, induce

<!-- chunk -->

### perspiration, and stimulate blood circulation. They stimulate production of

<!-- chunk -->

### digestive secretions, which enhances appetite, expels gas, and increases

<!-- chunk -->

### intestinal peristalsis.

<!-- chunk -->

### Overuse of pungent herbs depletes the body’s energy reserves and cools the

<!-- chunk -->

### body. Some people find these herbs irritating to their digestive tract. Pungent

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs are contraindicated for people who tend to be hot, flushed, and irritable

<!-- chunk -->

### and who have a reddish complexion.

# AROMATIC HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### Aromatic herbs contain volatile oils (also called essential oils). Volatile oils

<!-- chunk -->

### evaporate when they are exposed to heat and light. Like pungent herbs, many

<!-- chunk -->

### aromatics are used as seasonings in food. The mint and carrot families contain

<!-- chunk -->

### many aromatic herbs, including dill, peppermint, and lemon balm.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aromatic herbs are also normally warming and drying, but they have a milder

<!-- chunk -->

### action than pungent herbs. They tend to have strong effects on the nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### system, either calming or stimulating. Many essential oils are antimicrobial,

<!-- chunk -->

### which makes aromatic herbs helpful in fighting infections. Aromatics can induce

<!-- chunk -->

### perspiration when taken as hot tea, and they stimulate blood circulation and

<!-- chunk -->

### expel intestinal gas.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aromatic herbs are very safe. However, pure essential oils should be used

<!-- chunk -->

### almost exclusively in topical applications; even then, they need to be well

<!-- chunk -->

### diluted. Essential oils are highly concentrated extracts, and they are far more

<!-- chunk -->

### likely than whole herbs to create bad reactions.

# SIMPLE (NONALKALOIDAL) BITTERS

<!-- chunk -->

### Simple bitters are herbs that are bitter due to what old herbal textbooks called

<!-- chunk -->

### bitter principles. Today we know these compounds as diterpenes and various

<!-- chunk -->

### glycosides. Anthraquinone glycosides are responsible for the action of stimulant

<!-- chunk -->

### laxatives, which are a subcategory of simple bitters. Nonalkaloidal bitters

<!-- chunk -->

### include artichoke leaf, gentian, wild lettuce, kale, and hops. Stimulant laxatives

<!-- chunk -->

### include cascara sagrada, Turkey rhubarb, buckthorn, butternut bark, and aloe leaf

<!-- chunk -->

### (not the gel).

<!-- chunk -->

### Most nonalkaloidal bitters are cooling and drying. A few contain aromatic

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds that make them warming and drying, including dong quai and

<!-- chunk -->

### turmeric.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bitters cause energy to move downward (toward the eliminative organs) and

<!-- chunk -->

### inward (toward the digestive organs). Nonalkaloidal bitters tend to be

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxifying. Some have sedative or calming effects and a few are anodynes,

<!-- chunk -->

### which means they help to relieve pain. One of their primary uses is to stimulate

<!-- chunk -->

### the production of hydrochloric acid, bile, and pancreatic enzymes. This happens

<!-- chunk -->

### only when the bitters are tasted; bitter herbs that are sweetened or swallowed in

<!-- chunk -->

### capsules do not stimulate digestive secretions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cooling bitters can deplete digestion over time. Traditional digestive tonics

<!-- chunk -->

### include warming bitters, aromatic or pungent herbs to modulate the depleting

<!-- chunk -->

### effects of cooling bitters. Bitters should be avoided by thin, weak, emaciated,

<!-- chunk -->

### and dry people.

# ALKALOIDAL BITTERS

<!-- chunk -->

### Alkaloidal bitters taste bitter due to the presence of alkaloids. These compounds

<!-- chunk -->

### have names ending in -ine, such as caffeine, nicotine, and berberine. Coffee and

<!-- chunk -->

### chocolate are alkaloidal bitters. Herbs that contain alkaloids include goldenseal,

<!-- chunk -->

### Oregon grape, and California poppy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Like nonalkaloidal bitters, alkaloidal bitters tend to be cooling and drying.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many are detoxifying and used to stimulate the digestive system and liver.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alkaloidal bitters that contain berberine, such as goldenseal and Oregon grape,

<!-- chunk -->

### are used to fight infections. Alkaloids have very specific effects on the nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### and glandular systems and can mimic hormones and neurotransmitters,

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulating or sedating specific body processes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alkaloidal bitters have the same general contraindications that nonalkaloidal

<!-- chunk -->

### bitters do. They should be avoided by thin, weak, emaciated, and dry people, and

<!-- chunk -->

### can be drying and depleting when excessively used. Pay attention to the specific

<!-- chunk -->

### indications and contraindications for each herb in this category.

# FRAGRANT BITTERS

<!-- chunk -->

### Fragrant bitters are a cross between simple bitters and aromatics. Their primary

<!-- chunk -->

### constituents are sesquiterpene lactones and triterpenes. Examples of fragrant

<!-- chunk -->

### bitters include elecampane, black walnut hulls, wormwood, tansy, and

<!-- chunk -->

### wormseed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fragrant bitters are warming and drying. They are used in small amounts to

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulate appetite and digestion. Many are used to expel parasites. Most fragrant

<!-- chunk -->

### bitters are contraindicated in pregnancy, and many are not suitable for long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### use. They also have the same general contraindications as the other two classes

<!-- chunk -->

### of bitters.

# ACRID HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### Acrid herbs are characterized by a bitter, nasty, burning taste that is much like

<!-- chunk -->

### the taste of throwing up bile. These herbs contain resins (like pungent herbs) and

<!-- chunk -->

### alkaloids (like alkaloidal bitters). The best examples of this taste are lobelia and

<!-- chunk -->

### kava-kava, but this characteristic is found to a lesser degree in black cohosh,

<!-- chunk -->

### skunk cabbage, and blue vervain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Acrid herbs tend to be relaxing, which means they are diffusive, opening up

<!-- chunk -->

### the flow of blood, lymph, and energy. They may also be cooling and drying.

<!-- chunk -->

### Their primary action tends to be antispasmodic, which means they relax cramps.

<!-- chunk -->

### They are used to relieve what are known as wind disorders in some traditional

<!-- chunk -->

### systems of medicine. These are disorders that involve alternating symptoms like

<!-- chunk -->

### fever and chills or diarrhea and constipation. Pains that migrate from one part of

<!-- chunk -->

### the body to another are also part of the pattern of wind disorders. Acrid herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### will often induce vomiting in large doses, and large doses or long-term use may

<!-- chunk -->

### adversely affect the nerves.

# ASTRINGENT HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### Astringent herbs are herbs that contain tannins. Tannic acid gives plants a

<!-- chunk -->

### slightly bitter taste and produces a drying, slightly puckering sensation in the

<!-- chunk -->

### mouth. Green tea is astringent. Other astringent herbs include white oak bark,

<!-- chunk -->

### uva ursi, and sage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Astringent herbs constrict and dry tissues. They are used to arrest excessive

<!-- chunk -->

### secretions, tighten loose tissue, reduce swelling, and help blood coagulate. They

<!-- chunk -->

### are antivenomous when applied topically to bites and stings. Internally, they

<!-- chunk -->

### slow intestinal peristalsis (counteracting loose, watery stool) and tone up

<!-- chunk -->

### intestinal membranes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because they tend to inhibit digestive secretions, and may interfere with

<!-- chunk -->

### mineral absorption, astringents are best taken between meals. Large doses can

<!-- chunk -->

### cause constipation, and long-term use can be irritating to the skin and mucous

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes.

# SOUR HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### Many berries and fruits have a sour taste due to the presence of various fruit

<!-- chunk -->

### acids (citric, malic, and ascorbic acid), which are accompanied by flavonoids.

<!-- chunk -->

### Flavonoids are antioxidant and fever reducing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sour herbs are cooling and nourishing. They may be balancing, slightly

<!-- chunk -->

### moistening, or slightly drying. They are used to reduce tissue inflammation and

<!-- chunk -->

### irritation and reduce free radical damage (thought to cause aging and

<!-- chunk -->

### degenerative disease). They can strengthen capillary integrity and tone weak

<!-- chunk -->

### tissues. Sour herbs are considered good for the liver and eyes, two organs that

<!-- chunk -->

### use more antioxidants than any other organs. They are safe foods and have no

<!-- chunk -->

### contraindications.

# SALTY HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### The salty taste in plants isn’t like the taste of table salt. It’s a more subtle flavor

<!-- chunk -->

### that is sort of a grassy or green taste. Think of the flavor of celery or spinach.

<!-- chunk -->

### The subtle salty flavor in these foods is due to the presence of mineral salts:

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium, potassium, sodium, and calcium. Salty herbs are green herbs like

<!-- chunk -->

### alfalfa, mullein, and seaweeds.

<!-- chunk -->

### Salty herbs are balancing and nourishing. They can moisten dry tissues and

<!-- chunk -->

### can dry damp tissues. They are nutritive because they supply minerals that help

<!-- chunk -->

### to tone and heal tissues. They clear the lymphatics, promote lymph flow, loosen

<!-- chunk -->

### mucus, and soften swollen lymph nodes. Many salty herbs are nonirritating

<!-- chunk -->

### diuretics that nourish and support kidney function. They are generally mild in

<!-- chunk -->

### action and have no contraindications.

# SWEET HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### Sweet herbs aren’t sweet in the same way that sugar or honey is sweet. It’s more

<!-- chunk -->

### like the sweetness of a bar of dark chocolate. This sweetness is due to the

<!-- chunk -->

### presence of polysaccharides or saponins. Obvious examples of sweet herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### include licorice and stevia, and many tonic and adaptogenic remedies such as

<!-- chunk -->

### American or Korean ginseng, codonopsis, and astragalus are sweet as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sweet herbs tend to be moistening and neutral, but they may be slightly

<!-- chunk -->

### warming or cooling. Sweet herbs are used to build up weakened conditions,

<!-- chunk -->

### counteract wasting, strengthen glands, and replenish energy reserves. They

<!-- chunk -->

### counteract dryness and aging in tissues and often act as immune tonics to either

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulate or balance immune functions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most sweet herbs are very benign and suitable for long-term use in small

<!-- chunk -->

### doses. Larger doses can overstimulate the body and are abused in the same way

<!-- chunk -->

### as stimulants like coffee, especially when used by younger people. They often

<!-- chunk -->

### work better as part of a formula than taken as single remedies.

# MUCILANT HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### Most books call these herbs mucilaginous or demulcent herbs, but we use the

<!-- chunk -->

### word “mucilant.” Mucilants have a bland or slightly sweet taste, but their most

<!-- chunk -->

### important distinguishing feature is their texture. When moistened, they have a

<!-- chunk -->

### slippery, slimy texture. This is due to water-loving polysaccharides or

<!-- chunk -->

### mucopolysaccharides, such as gums, mucilage, or pectin. They may also contain

<!-- chunk -->

### glycosaminoglycans.

<!-- chunk -->

### Okra is a mucilant. Herbal examples include aloe vera, slippery elm, and kelp.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mucilants are moistening, cooling, and nourishing. They are used to soothe

<!-- chunk -->

### tissues that are hot, red, dry, and irritated. Taken internally, they add water-

<!-- chunk -->

### soluble fiber to the stool; they are bulk laxatives when they are taken with plenty

<!-- chunk -->

### of water. They can help to arrest diarrhea, too. Mucilants feed and support

<!-- chunk -->

### friendly gut bacteria and promote general intestinal health. They absorb bile

<!-- chunk -->

### from the gallbladder and liver to help reduce cholesterol and remove toxins from

<!-- chunk -->

### the body. Mucilants protect mucous membranes and are applied topically as

<!-- chunk -->

### poultices to soothe irritated or damaged skin and promote healing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because they are absorbent, mucilants should be taken apart from nutrients

<!-- chunk -->

### and medications. Excessive use can slow down and cool gastrointestinal

<!-- chunk -->

### function, but this can easily be counteracted by adding a small amount of an

<!-- chunk -->

### aromatic or pungent herb. Mucilants must be taken with plenty of water in order

<!-- chunk -->

### to work properly.

# OILY HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### Oily herbs, mostly seeds, have an oily taste and texture due to the presence of

<!-- chunk -->

### fatty acids. Oily herbs include flaxseed, evening primrose seed, and coconut.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oily herbs are nourishing and cooling. They provide the body with fatty acids

<!-- chunk -->

### that are used for energy production and immune, nerve and glandular function.

<!-- chunk -->

### (Borage and evening primrose oils are marketed as remedies to influence

<!-- chunk -->

### prostaglandin function.) Oily herbs moisten dry tissues and promote tissue

<!-- chunk -->

### flexibility. Some are mild laxatives, lubricating the stool for easier elimination.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oily herbs have no real contraindications.

# THE SIX TISSUE STATES

<!-- chunk -->

### The six tissue states model originated with clinical herbalist Matthew Wood. The

<!-- chunk -->

### six tissue terrains refer to the tissues of the body and complement the basic

<!-- chunk -->

### energetics of herbs we introduced in the beginning of this chapter. Tissue terrain

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalances may be systemic or tissue- or organ-specific. Identifying terrain

<!-- chunk -->

### states and using remedies that restore balance to the tissues will achieve far

<!-- chunk -->

### better results than trying to match herbs with diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

### The tissue states include three basic tissue qualities that are divided into

<!-- chunk -->

### opposing imbalances. The first of these tissue factors is the metabolic rate, which

<!-- chunk -->

### is how fast or slow the tissues generate energy. Tissues can be overactive

<!-- chunk -->

### (hyperactive or hyperfunctioning) or they can be underactive (hypoactive or

<!-- chunk -->

### hypofunctioning). These correspond to the qualities of heat (overactive) and cold

<!-- chunk -->

### (underactive). We call the hyperactive state irritation, and the hypoactive state

<!-- chunk -->

### depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### The second tissue quality is density, which relates to the ratio of solid

<!-- chunk -->

### (mineral) elements to fluid elements (water and fats). When fluids exceed solids,

<!-- chunk -->

### the tissues are in a state of stagnation, as in a swamp. When solids outbalance

<!-- chunk -->

### fluids, the tissues get hard and dry, a state that is referred to as atrophy. These

<!-- chunk -->

### two tissue states are also called dampness (stagnation) and dryness (atrophy).

<!-- chunk -->

### The third tissue quality is tension. This has to do with the tone of the tissues in

<!-- chunk -->

### general, and specifically with muscle tone. Excess tone results in constriction,

<!-- chunk -->

### and a lack of tone results in an atonic state of excess relaxation.

<!-- chunk -->

### These six basic imbalances—irritation (heat), depression (cold), stagnation

<!-- chunk -->

### (dampness), atrophy (dryness), constriction (tension), and relaxation (atony)—

<!-- chunk -->

### can occur in isolation or in combination (such as irritation and constriction or

<!-- chunk -->

### dampness and depression). Start with the basic imbalances and eventually you

<!-- chunk -->

### will be able to identify the more complex mixtures of imbalance.

# ENERGY PRODUCTION

<!-- chunk -->

## Irritation and depression have to do with metabolism and energy generation. In

<!-- chunk -->

### irritation energy production is excessive; in depression it is deficient.

<!-- chunk -->

## Irritation has a strong correlation to oxidation, inflammation, and fever,

<!-- chunk -->

### which is why it is often referred to as “heat” in traditional herbalism. Tissues that

<!-- chunk -->

### are irritated are red and warm to the touch. Irritation is often accompanied by

<!-- chunk -->

### sharp pains. A red tongue, a rapid pulse, a ruddy (or reddish) complexion, and

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperactivity are also signs of heat or irritation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Irritation can be caused by chemical, infectious, or metabolic irritants. Tissues

<!-- chunk -->

### in the body increase their production of energy to try to overpower the irritant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Irritation is the mechanism by which cells initiate the healing process through

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation. Part of the job of the inflammatory response is to destroy

<!-- chunk -->

### damaged cells and draw immune and stem cells to the area for tissue repair.

<!-- chunk -->

### Acute irritation isn’t a bad thing; it’s when that irritation becomes chronic that

<!-- chunk -->

### problems arise.

<!-- chunk -->

### Irritation is balanced with cooling and moistening herbs. Sour herbs are the

<!-- chunk -->

### primary remedy for reducing irritation, but mucilants, oily herbs, sweet tonics,

<!-- chunk -->

### and some bitters are also cooling to irritated tissues.

<!-- chunk -->

## Depression is the opposite of irritation. Tissues that are depressed are cool to

<!-- chunk -->

### the touch and pale, which is why depression is often referred to in traditional

<!-- chunk -->

### herbalism as “cold.” If pain is present, it tends to be dull and achy. Other signs of

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue depression are hypoactive function, a pale complexion, a pale tongue, and

<!-- chunk -->

### a slow pulse rate.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tissue depression is tricky to treat because it can be mimicked by false cold

<!-- chunk -->

### caused by low thyroid function and anemia. Infection in depressed tissues can

<!-- chunk -->

### also give rise to false heat. True tissue depression presents with a general feeling

<!-- chunk -->

### of fatigue, a pale or dark-purple tongue, and a slow pulse rate.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tissue depression is balanced herbally with warming remedies. Aromatic and

<!-- chunk -->

### pungent herbs are the primary category used here, but warming fragrant bitters

<!-- chunk -->

### may also be helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pay attention to the energetics of the condition and use remedies with the

<!-- chunk -->

### appropriate properties. Treating hot (irritated) conditions with warming herbs, or

<!-- chunk -->

### cold (depressed) conditions with cooling herbs, will not balance the body.

# MINERALS AND FLUIDS

<!-- chunk -->

## Stagnation and atrophy have to do with the balance between the solid (mineral)

<!-- chunk -->

### components of the body and the fluid (water and fat) components in the body. In

<!-- chunk -->

### stagnation, there is too much fluid with insufficient minerals to move it. In

<!-- chunk -->

### atrophy, the mineral content is too high and there is not enough fluid to keep it in

<!-- chunk -->

### solution.

<!-- chunk -->

## In stagnation, fluid accumulates in tissues. This can take the form of edema,

<!-- chunk -->

### swollen lymph nodes, and sluggish flow of body fluids. In traditional herbalism,

<!-- chunk -->

### stagnation is often called “dampness.” Tissues that have stagnation are soft and

<!-- chunk -->

### spongy or hard and swollen to the touch. The tongue is pale and damp and the

<!-- chunk -->

### pulse feels congested or slippery.

<!-- chunk -->

### Stagnation was called torpor by the Eclectic physicians of the mid-1800s and

<!-- chunk -->

### early 1900s. Herbs that relieved torpor were called alteratives or blood purifiers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alteratives alter the extracellular fluid around the cells by stimulating immunity

<!-- chunk -->

### or improving blood and lymph flow. Bitter herbs break up stagnation. Aromatic,

<!-- chunk -->

### pungent, and astringent herbs help to dry up the dampness of stagnation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Atrophy is seen when tissues become hard and brittle. When tissues are

<!-- chunk -->

### deficient in good fats and water, they become hard and inflexible or brittle.

<!-- chunk -->

### Traditional herbalism refers to this tissue state as “dryness.” Many of the

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases of aging are dry, including bone spurs, arterial plaque, the stiffness of

<!-- chunk -->

### arthritis, and the loss of elasticity in the lungs in emphysema. Dry, wrinkled skin

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with aging and the brittle bones of osteoporosis are examples of

<!-- chunk -->

### atrophy. The tongue tends to be dry and withered, and the pulse becomes thin

<!-- chunk -->

### and weak.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbs used to treat conditions of atrophy are sometimes called tonics, and

<!-- chunk -->

### they help to revitalize people when they become weak or sickly. Sweet,

<!-- chunk -->

### mucilant, and oily herbs help to balance atrophy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Drying herbs will not help atrophy, and moistening herbs will not help

<!-- chunk -->

### stagnation. There are neutral remedies that can be used in atrophy or stagnation

<!-- chunk -->

### to balance the solids and liquids within the body. We refer to them as balancing.

# TISSUE TONE

<!-- chunk -->

### The final pair of opposing imbalances has to do with muscle tension or tone.

<!-- chunk -->

### Muscles control the flow of energy and fluids in the body. When muscles tense,

<!-- chunk -->

### flow is reduced or obstructed. When muscle tone becomes too relaxed or tissues

<!-- chunk -->

### are damaged, fluids can drain or leak from tissues. In constriction, muscles are

<!-- chunk -->

### tight, and relaxation occurs when muscles are relaxed or tissues are damaged and

<!-- chunk -->

### leaking.

<!-- chunk -->

## Constriction typically happens because muscles get tired from overuse.

<!-- chunk -->

### Muscles expend energy when they contract, and rebuild energy when they relax.

<!-- chunk -->

### When muscles fatigue, either due to excessive use or to nutritional deficiencies,

<!-- chunk -->

### they spasm. This can cause sharp pain and constricted movement. Constriction

<!-- chunk -->

### occurs in some cases of high blood pressure, tension headaches, asthma attacks,

<!-- chunk -->

### and a spastic colon.

<!-- chunk -->

### Constriction can periodically relax, causing the dam to break and excessive

<!-- chunk -->

### flow or secretion to occur. Alternating diarrhea and constipation, alternating

<!-- chunk -->

### fever and chills, and migrating pains are examples of this. These are called wind

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders in some traditional systems of medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Antispasmodic herbs are used in conditions of constriction. Antispasmodics

<!-- chunk -->

### are primarily acrid in nature, but some are aromatic, relaxing nervines.

<!-- chunk -->

## Relaxation occurs when tissues are unable to hold fluids due to damage or

<!-- chunk -->

### loss of muscle tone. Relaxation occurs in diarrhea, leaky gut, excessive mucus

<!-- chunk -->

### production, bleeding, urinary incontinence, and excessive sweating. Astringent

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs counteract relaxation.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can learn more about the tissue states in Matthew Wood’s The Practice of

<!-- chunk -->

### Traditional Western Herbalism and in his two-volume work The Earthwise

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal.

# GETTING THE RESULTS YOU WANT

<!-- chunk -->

### To get good results with any health care, you need a correct diagnosis or

<!-- chunk -->

### assessment, and you need to select the right remedy, which includes

<!-- chunk -->

### administering it in the correct way and at an effective dose.

# STEP ONE: GET A CORRECT ASSESSMENT

<!-- chunk -->

### The rising interest in holistic health has led to a huge increase in the number of

<!-- chunk -->

### people using herbal medicine. This use is divorced from traditional systems of

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosis. Western medical diagnosis is useful, but it is often centered around

<!-- chunk -->

### symptomatic relief rather than addressing the root cause for true healing.

<!-- chunk -->

### People who use herbs as symptom-relieving remedies will often find

<!-- chunk -->

### themselves disappointed with the results. Herbs are not isolated chemical

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds or magic bullets, and most herbs don’t target specific biochemical

<!-- chunk -->

### reactions to create rapid changes in symptoms like pharmaceuticals do. Herbs,

<!-- chunk -->

### like foods, contain thousands of chemical compounds that interact with the body

<!-- chunk -->

### in extremely complex ways. There are herbs that do act in the body in strong

<!-- chunk -->

### ways, including some toxic botanicals, but even these remedies have more

<!-- chunk -->

### complex actions than the singular chemical compounds used in modern

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is that this makes them relatively free of side effects. The bad

<!-- chunk -->

### news is that herbs aren’t very good at relieving symptoms, which actually isn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### so bad when you think about it. Herbs bring about balance in the body, as we’ve

<!-- chunk -->

### just explained in our discussion of basic herbal categories and biological terrain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbs are best used in conjunction with diet and lifestyle changes that address

<!-- chunk -->

### underlying causes of disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### This leads us to more good news. All traditional systems of medicine, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Ayurvedic medicine from India, indigenous

<!-- chunk -->

### traditions of medicine, and even traditional Western herbalism, have assessment

<!-- chunk -->

### systems that were designed to identify broad, underlying patterns of imbalance.

<!-- chunk -->

### This means that their diagnostic systems were matched to the way herbs work. A

<!-- chunk -->

### well-trained herbalist will understand these concepts and can help you figure out

<!-- chunk -->

### what herbal remedies will work best for your situation.

<!-- chunk -->

### The primary goal of an herbalist (or any other well-trained natural healer) is to

<!-- chunk -->

### look at each person’s health problems through a wide lens. Herbalists usually

<!-- chunk -->

### spend more than an hour talking with each client, looking at their overall health

<!-- chunk -->

### and health history, and examining their diet and lifestyle and their mental and

<!-- chunk -->

### emotional state. Identifying the underlying imbalances that are causing a

<!-- chunk -->

### person’s health problems is a complicated and time-consuming process, but it is

<!-- chunk -->

### essential to getting good results.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is no specific herbal remedy for chronic fatigue. This is because fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

### has many causes, which could include problems like stress, emotional

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, nutrient deficiencies, or mitochondrial dysfunction. The same

<!-- chunk -->

### principle applies to all complex health problems, including depression, anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### and autoimmune disorders. In order to provide anything other than symptomatic

<!-- chunk -->

### relief, the underlying causes must be determined.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many people learn to use herbs as first aid remedies or to speed recovery from

<!-- chunk -->

### ordinary self-limiting diseases. If you have a serious health issue, we

<!-- chunk -->

### recommend you consult with a professional herbalist for assistance. One way to

<!-- chunk -->

### find a good herbalist is to look for a professional member of the American

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbalists Guild (AHG). Herbalists who are registered with the AHG have

<!-- chunk -->

### passed a peer-review process to ensure their competency and character. Go to

<!-- chunk -->

### www.americanherbalistsguild.com to learn more. Findanherbalist.com lists

<!-- chunk -->

### herbalists who are registered with the AHG in addition to competent herbalists

<!-- chunk -->

### who are not registered. You can also find herbalists listed at herbrally.com.

<!-- chunk -->

### Find an herbalist you trust. The relationship between healer and patient is an

<!-- chunk -->

### important part of the healing process. Herbalists don’t have to worry about huge

<!-- chunk -->

### overheads or how many clients they see in an hour, and they devote a lot of time

<!-- chunk -->

### to developing a relationship with each client.

<!-- chunk -->

### All of this is not to suggest that you avoid medical doctors. We work with, not

<!-- chunk -->

### against, modern medicine. Although the medical system forces most doctors into

<!-- chunk -->

### a model of practice that doesn’t give them enough time to explore the root

<!-- chunk -->

### causes of a person’s health problems, medical doctors have advanced diagnostic

<!-- chunk -->

### tools and other equipment at their disposal. Serious health problems should be

<!-- chunk -->

### monitored by a competent medical practitioner.

# STEP TWO: SELECT THE PROPER REMEDY

<!-- chunk -->

### Once you have a correct assessment, it’s time to select the appropriate remedy.

<!-- chunk -->

### The right remedy may not be an herb. Herbs aren’t going to make up for a lack

<!-- chunk -->

### of sleep, dehydration, or a diet filled with processed and refined foods. Blue

<!-- chunk -->

### vervain isn’t the right remedy for anxiety caused by a deficiency of magnesium.

<!-- chunk -->

### Find the gentlest approach that will get the results you desire. Modern

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine is focused on strong, fast-acting remedies. These produce rapid

<!-- chunk -->

### changes in symptoms, but negatively impact health in the long term. People who

<!-- chunk -->

### are used to rapid results may choose a strong herb over a mild one, or may think

<!-- chunk -->

### that if a little is good, more will be better.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is not the way traditional herbalism works. Physicians in ancient

<!-- chunk -->

### Baghdad had their market license revoked if they used a strong medicine when a

<!-- chunk -->

### gentle one would suffice, a gentle medicine when food would suffice, or food

<!-- chunk -->

### when simple advice about lifestyle would suffice.

<!-- chunk -->

### The correct remedy must be administered in the right way. Many books about

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs do not provide information about dosage forms or methods of application.

<!-- chunk -->

### Swallowing a capsule of licorice root won’t help a sore throat. Licorice must

<!-- chunk -->

### coat the throat, which means consuming the powder, sipping the tea, or taking

<!-- chunk -->

### small, frequent doses of an extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dosage is a controversial topic among herbalists. Some herbalists use drop

<!-- chunk -->

### doses. In contrast, practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine usually

<!-- chunk -->

### administer herbs in large doses. Some people react quickly to small doses, and

<!-- chunk -->

### others need larger amounts to effect a change. Finding the dose that works for

<!-- chunk -->

### you may require some experimentation. Consult Chapter Eleven for more

<!-- chunk -->

### information about formulas and dosages.

# Herbal Preparations

<!-- chunk -->

## UNDERSTANDING THE MANY WAYS TO PREPARE AND USE

<!-- chunk -->

## HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### hether you decide to make your own herbal medicines, or to purchase

<!-- chunk -->

### ready-made herbal products, it helps to understand the many ways herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### can be prepared and administered. Each of the following methods are

<!-- chunk -->

### appropriate for certain herbs and situations. Each has its advantages and

<!-- chunk -->

### disadvantages. So, let’s start with an overview of the subject.

# FRESH HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### The most basic way to use herbs is to use the fresh plant material. Herbs can be

<!-- chunk -->

### harvested from the wild or grown in a garden. Some fresh herbs, like garlic,

<!-- chunk -->

### ginger, basil, and other culinary herbs, can even be purchased fresh from the

<!-- chunk -->

### grocery store. Using herbs in this manner is not unlike using fresh fruits and

<!-- chunk -->

### vegetables. We know that the fresher the produce, the more nutritional value it

<!-- chunk -->

### tends to have. The same thing is usually, but not always, true for medicinal

<!-- chunk -->

### plants. The fresher the plant material, the more medicinally potent it tends to be.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are exceptions to this. Some herbs can be too potent, or even mildly

<!-- chunk -->

### toxic, when fresh, but mellow in action with drying or aging. The laxative herb

<!-- chunk -->

### Cascara sagrada is a good example of this. It is violently emetic and cathartic

<!-- chunk -->

### when fresh, meaning the fresh bark will make a person throw up and get severe

<!-- chunk -->

### diarrhea. Cascara must be dried and aged for at least a year to mellow its action.

<!-- chunk -->

### The general rule, however, is that fresh plant material is always better.

<!-- chunk -->

### The problem is that very few herbs are available fresh all year round. So, to be

<!-- chunk -->

### able to have year-round availability, fresh plant material must be processed in

<!-- chunk -->

### some way to preserve it, either by drying the plant material, or by extracting it in

<!-- chunk -->

### some kind of medium to preserve it.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can learn more about using fresh herbs in Chapter Three.

<!-- chunk -->

### Drying is the oldest and easiest method of preparing herbs for storage. It

<!-- chunk -->

### preserves most plant constituents well, so most medicinal qualities of plants are

<!-- chunk -->

### still retained. Dried herbs can be easily stored by placing them in an airtight

<!-- chunk -->

### container and keeping them away from light, heat, and moisture, all of which

<!-- chunk -->

### break down plant material. Most dried herbs will retain their potency for at least

<!-- chunk -->

### 1–2 years, some longer than that.

<!-- chunk -->

### Generally speaking, flowers, leaves, and other delicate plant parts deteriorate

<!-- chunk -->

### faster after drying than do harder plant parts like barks and roots. Aromatic herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### deteriorate the most, as essential oils evaporate over time and are lost, so it is

<!-- chunk -->

### best to use aromatics within about 1 year. On the other hand, astringent barks

<!-- chunk -->

### and roots may be potent for 10 years or longer.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dried herbs can be used in a variety of ways. As explained below, they can be

<!-- chunk -->

### used in bulk form or made into capsules or tablets. You can learn more about

<!-- chunk -->

### drying herbs and using them in dried form in the “Harvesting and Drying Herbs”

<!-- chunk -->

### section of Chapter Three.

# DRIED HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### Bulk dried herbs are easily obtained from a variety of suppliers in packages

<!-- chunk -->

### ranging from a couple of ounces to a pound or more. Depending on the herb, you

<!-- chunk -->

### may be able to get the dried herb in several forms, the most common being

<!-- chunk -->

### powdered, cut and sifted, and whole. The term “cut and sifted” means that the

<!-- chunk -->

### plant material has been cut into small pieces and sifted to keep the pieces at a

<!-- chunk -->

### relatively uniform size.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are going to store the herb for a while, we recommend you get cut and

<!-- chunk -->

### sifted or whole herbs rather than powders. The more surface area that is exposed

<!-- chunk -->

### to the air, the faster the plant material tends to degrade. This is especially true for

<!-- chunk -->

### aromatic herbs, as essential oils dissipate more rapidly from powders. If you

<!-- chunk -->

### need to powder the herb later, you can do so with a good grinder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dried herbs can be used in numerous ways. Various powdered herbs can be

<!-- chunk -->

### mixed into food and consumed or made into topical preparations like poultices.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal powders can also be made into capsules or tablets. Dried herbs can also

<!-- chunk -->

### be used for teas or for making various herbal extracts.

# CAPSULES

<!-- chunk -->

### Capsules have become a very popular way of taking herbs because they are an

<!-- chunk -->

### easy and convenient dosage form. Dried herbal powders are placed in gelatin

<!-- chunk -->

### capsules, so the herbal powders can be swallowed. One of the major advantages

<!-- chunk -->

### of capsules is that they are tasteless. This makes them particularly valuable for

<!-- chunk -->

### nasty-tasting, bitter or acrid, herbs. You are also getting the whole plant material,

<!-- chunk -->

### complete with the plant fibers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most gelatin capsules are made from animal by-products, which may be an

<!-- chunk -->

### issue for vegetarians or vegans, but all-plant vegetarian capsules can be

<!-- chunk -->

### purchased, too. If you’re willing to put a little effort into it, you can even

<!-- chunk -->

### purchase the capsules and the powders and fill your own capsules.

<!-- chunk -->

### Capsules do have some drawbacks, however. First, capsules make it harder to

<!-- chunk -->

### regulate dosages, especially with stronger botanicals. When taking an alcohol

<!-- chunk -->

### tincture you can adjust the dose by drops, but it’s hard to take ¼ or ½ of a

<!-- chunk -->

### capsule. So, herbs like lobelia, black cohosh, and other strong-acting or mildly

<!-- chunk -->

### toxic botanicals are best taken in a liquid dosage form to allow more precise

<!-- chunk -->

### dosing. Conversely, if you need several teaspoons of an herbal powder (such as

<!-- chunk -->

### psyllium hulls or slippery elm) for an effective dose, that’s a lot of capsules to

<!-- chunk -->

### swallow.

<!-- chunk -->

### The inability to taste and smell the herb also makes regulating dosage more

<!-- chunk -->

### difficult. Your sense of taste and sense of smell are sentinels that are designed to

<!-- chunk -->

### help you regulate what you put into your body. Although refined foods trick

<!-- chunk -->

### these sentinels with flavoring agents, sugar, salt, and processed fats,

<!-- chunk -->

### consumption of all-natural foods is well regulated by your senses. Once you’ve

<!-- chunk -->

### eaten a certain amount of a natural food like apples or carrots, you suddenly find

<!-- chunk -->

### it’s very difficult to eat more. Your body says enough is enough.

<!-- chunk -->

### The same is true of taking an herbal tea or extract. Even if the taste is

<!-- chunk -->

### unpleasant you’ll be able to make yourself take a certain amount, but once you

<!-- chunk -->

### have enough in your system, the body resists and it’s tough to make yourself

<!-- chunk -->

### take any more. Thus, taste and smell help you regulate the precise dose your

<!-- chunk -->

### body needs, something you can’t do with capsules.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is one other fairly unknown disadvantage to using capsules (and

<!-- chunk -->

### tablets). Herbs have a primary action that works via the senses to have an

<!-- chunk -->

### immediate effect on the body via the nervous system. For instance, as soon as

<!-- chunk -->

### spicy food or pungent herbs like capsicum are detected by your taste buds, there

<!-- chunk -->

### is an almost immediate warming sensation in the body. There may be a flushing

<!-- chunk -->

### of the face and perspiration forming on your forehead. You may also notice some

<!-- chunk -->

### increased sinus drainage or mucus clearing from the lungs.

<!-- chunk -->

### These are not reactions based on digesting, absorbing, and utilizing

<!-- chunk -->

### constituents in the plant. They are nervous system reactions that occur because

<!-- chunk -->

### of the input from your senses. If you swallow those same pungent herbs in a

<!-- chunk -->

### capsule, these primary effects will not occur. You will only get the secondary

<!-- chunk -->

### effects that come after the body has absorbed the plant constituents. Secondary

<!-- chunk -->

### effects occur anywhere from 15 minutes to many hours after you take the herb.

<!-- chunk -->

### Certain benefits of herbs depend almost entirely on primary effects. For

<!-- chunk -->

### example, the taste of bitter stimulates digestive secretions, such as hydrochloric

<!-- chunk -->

### acid in the stomach. Because of this, simple bitters, like gentian, have been used

<!-- chunk -->

### as digestive tonics to improve digestive function when taken in liquid form 15–

<!-- chunk -->

### 20 minutes prior to eating. You cannot get the same response by taking gentian

<!-- chunk -->

### in a capsule.

<!-- chunk -->

### Likewise, in order to induce perspiration, diaphoretics like yarrow work best

<!-- chunk -->

### when taken as hot infusions, or by taking extracts with ample amounts of warm

<!-- chunk -->

### water. Swallowing yarrow in a capsule will not have the same effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### Primary effects are one of the reasons many herbs seem to work faster when

<!-- chunk -->

### taken in a liquid form. Another reason is that it takes time for the body to break

<!-- chunk -->

### down a capsule, rehydrate the dried powders, and absorb the plant constituents.

<!-- chunk -->

### Liquid herbs are available for immediate absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

### One way to maintain the primary effects of an herb, while still taking them in

<!-- chunk -->

### capsules, is to break open several capsules of herb powder, then dump the

<!-- chunk -->

### contents into the container with the capsules. Put the lid on the container, and

<!-- chunk -->

### rotate the container slowly in several different directions to coat the capsules

<!-- chunk -->

### with the powder. This way, when you take a capsule, you will taste a little of the

<!-- chunk -->

### herb powder so you can activate the taste receptors on your tongue and gain the

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits of the primary effects, while the majority of the herb is ingested without

<!-- chunk -->

### having to taste it.

# TABLETS

<!-- chunk -->

### Although tablets are more frequently used for nutritional supplements than they

<!-- chunk -->

### are for herbs, some herbs are available in tablet form. It is still the preferred

<!-- chunk -->

### dosage form for many patent Chinese herbal products. To make tablets, herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### powders are mixed with a substance that acts as a binder. They are then rolled or

<!-- chunk -->

### pressed to form the tablets.

<!-- chunk -->

### In China, they make round herbal tablets by putting herbal powders into a

<!-- chunk -->

### rotating drum. A syrup is then drizzled into the drum, which causes the herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### powders to stick together, forming small round “tablets.” These are then sorted

<!-- chunk -->

### by size and dried. In the United States, the powders are generally mixed together

<!-- chunk -->

### and then pressed to form oblong-shaped tablets.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pressed tablets are often coated with something to help protect them from

<!-- chunk -->

### moisture and preserve them. The coating is often a clear vegetable shellac.

<!-- chunk -->

### Capsules and tablets have pretty much the same advantages and

<!-- chunk -->

### disadvantages. Again, you can avoid the nasty tastes, but it’s harder to regulate

<!-- chunk -->

### dose. Depending on the binders and coatings used, tablets can be harder to digest

<!-- chunk -->

### than capsules. People have been known to pass tablets largely intact.

<!-- chunk -->

### Furthermore, fillers, binding agents, and coatings may not be listed on the label.

# LIQUID HERBS (EXTRACTIONS)

<!-- chunk -->

### As soon as you harvest a plant, some of its components start to break down.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because humans lack the enzyme cellulase necessary to break down the cell wall

<!-- chunk -->

### structure of plants, it could be argued that even if you are munching on a freshly

<!-- chunk -->

### picked plant you’re not getting the full medicinal activity. This is why we

<!-- chunk -->

### typically extract herbs into some form of liquid for medicine, traditionally using

<!-- chunk -->

### water to make infusions (teas) and decoctions.

<!-- chunk -->

### The liquid you use to extract the herb is called the solvent or menstruum.

<!-- chunk -->

### Menstruum is an old alchemical term for a substance that dissolves a solid. The

<!-- chunk -->

### solvents or menstruums we will discuss in this book are water, syrup (water and

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar), alcohol, glycerin, vinegar, and oil. Industrial processes used to make

<!-- chunk -->

### standardized extracts may also make use of chemical solvents like acetone.

<!-- chunk -->

### Every menstruum has particular constituents it is very effective at extracting

<!-- chunk -->

### and other constituents that it doesn’t extract well. Water is a poor solvent of

<!-- chunk -->

### resins, but a great solvent for carbohydrates; alcohol is a great solvent for many

<!-- chunk -->

### medicinal constituents, but is a poor solvent of mucilage; and glycerin by itself

<!-- chunk -->

### (without heat and water) is a poor solvent of most constituents except volatile

<!-- chunk -->

### oils.

<!-- chunk -->

### What follows is an introduction to preparations made with the solvents we’ll

<!-- chunk -->

### discuss in this book. More information about solvents and solubility can be

<!-- chunk -->

### found in Chapter Five, and instructions on how to make these various extractions

<!-- chunk -->

### can be found in Chapter Six.

# WATER EXTRACTIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### Water is the oldest extraction medium for herbs and is still one of the simplest

<!-- chunk -->

### and easiest ways to convert herbs into liquid form. There are two basic water

<!-- chunk -->

### extractions—infusions and decoctions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Infusions are also known as herbal teas or tisanes (a French term). They are

<!-- chunk -->

### usually made by pouring boiling water over an herb and allowing it to steep for a

<!-- chunk -->

### determined length of time before straining. There are also cold infusions, where

<!-- chunk -->

### you just soak the herb in water, as in making a sun tea. Infusions are generally

<!-- chunk -->

### used on more delicate plant parts like flowers and leaves. They are primarily

<!-- chunk -->

### used for aromatic and more pleasant-tasting herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Decoctions are different from infusions, because the herb is simmered in the

<!-- chunk -->

### water. They are made by bringing water to a boil, adding the herbs, then

<!-- chunk -->

### reducing the heat and simmering them for a determined period of time.

<!-- chunk -->

### Decoctions draw out constituents that do not release from the plant material as

<!-- chunk -->

### readily. Decoctions extract more minerals, tannins, and bitter principles than

<!-- chunk -->

### infusions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Both infusions and decoctions are inexpensive and easy to make. They are

<!-- chunk -->

### also an effective way to take most herbs. They can be stored in the refrigerator

<!-- chunk -->

### for several days and consumed as needed, and because one is sipping and

<!-- chunk -->

### actually tasting the plant, it is easy for the body’s senses to help regulate the

<!-- chunk -->

### appropriate dosage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Teas and decoctions do not work well for nasty-tasting herbs, and some

<!-- chunk -->

### constituents are not water soluble. So, they don’t work great in every situation,

<!-- chunk -->

### but they are one of the most basic of all herbal extractions.

# SYRUPS

<!-- chunk -->

### A syrup is a water-based extraction, made in the same way as a decoction, but is

<!-- chunk -->

### done with a mixture of water and a sweetener, typically raw sugar or honey. The

<!-- chunk -->

### ratio is usually 50% sugar or honey and 50% water. Syrups are a good way to

<!-- chunk -->

### cover up the taste of bitter herbs and are usually used as cold and cough

<!-- chunk -->

### remedies. They are nourishing and moistening and are an excellent dosage form

<!-- chunk -->

### for sore throats, coughs, and digestive upset.

<!-- chunk -->

### Honey has healing properties of its own and adds to the medicinal value of the

<!-- chunk -->

### syrup. However, honey should not be used for children under the age of one.

<!-- chunk -->

### Syrups are an excellent dosage form for children and the elderly, but their high

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar content is problematic with diabetes or other situations where sugar needs

<!-- chunk -->

### to be avoided. Syrups also have a short shelf life. Refrigerated, they can last for

<!-- chunk -->

### about one month. However, the shelf life of a syrup can be extended by adding

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol.

# ALCOHOL EXTRACTIONS (TINCTURES)

<!-- chunk -->

### Alcohol is an excellent medium for extracting herbs, and alcohol extracts or

<!-- chunk -->

### tinctures are the most popular dosage form used by professional herbalists.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alcohol is an excellent solvent for most herb constituents and can be used to

<!-- chunk -->

### make tinctures from either fresh or dried plants. Alcohol preparations have the

<!-- chunk -->

### longest shelf life of any herbal extract, so they can be stored for years, in most

<!-- chunk -->

### cases, without losing potency.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alcohol extracts are great for more potent or potentially toxic botanicals, as

<!-- chunk -->

### dosages can be regulated by the drop. Taking herbs as liquids allows the senses

<!-- chunk -->

### to regulate the dose via the taste. It also rapidly delivers herbal constituents into

<!-- chunk -->

### the bloodstream, making tinctures a fast-acting dosage form. Alcohol tinctures

<!-- chunk -->

### are also a great dosage form for applying herbs topically.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are a few drawbacks to alcohol extracts. In large doses, alcohol is a

<!-- chunk -->

### toxin to the body. However, the amount of alcohol in a dose of tincture is fairly

<!-- chunk -->

### small. If you assume a dose of 1 milliliter with an average alcohol content of

<!-- chunk -->

### 50%, that’s only ½ milliliter of alcohol per dose. In one glass of commercial

<!-- chunk -->

### orange juice there is as much as 1½ milliliters of naturally occurring alcohol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because we are exposed to small amounts of alcohol in foods, the liver has

<!-- chunk -->

### pathways to detoxify alcohol and turn it into sugar. We also recommend avoiding

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol preparations with children under two. In acute situations or emergencies,

<!-- chunk -->

### we have used alcohol preparations with young children, but it is best to remove

<!-- chunk -->

### some of the alcohol before administering the herb. You can do this by bringing

<!-- chunk -->

### an ounce of water to a boil. Remove it from the heat and add the alcohol extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### Letting this stand for about 5 minutes allows the heat to evaporate about 15% of

<!-- chunk -->

### the alcohol. It takes almost 4 hours of simmering alcohol in water to remove all

<!-- chunk -->

### of the alcohol. Adding hot water, or simply diluting tinctures in water, makes

<!-- chunk -->

### them more appropriate for use with young children.

<!-- chunk -->

### For many herbs, tinctures are the preferred preparation. However, some

<!-- chunk -->

### people’s religious beliefs prohibit the use of water, and tinctures aren’t

<!-- chunk -->

### recommended for children, or for recovering alcoholics or people with liver

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alcohol doesn’t extract all constituents, and some herbs are much better in

<!-- chunk -->

### other menstruums.

# GLYCERIN EXTRACTIONS (GLYCERITES)

<!-- chunk -->

### Glycerin is used less frequently than alcohol as an extraction medium, but it is

<!-- chunk -->

### gaining in popularity. Glycerin is a semiclear, nontoxic, sweet-tasting liquid

<!-- chunk -->

### produced from vegetable or animal fats. Fats are composed of fatty acids and

<!-- chunk -->

### glycerin (also known as glycerol), and our digestive process breaks fats down

<!-- chunk -->

### into these two components. This means glycerin is something our body

<!-- chunk -->

### processes every time we eat fats.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are both advantages and disadvantages to using glycerin instead of

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol to make herbal extracts. One advantage is that glycerin is nontoxic and

<!-- chunk -->

### may be used by young children, alcoholics, and other people who can’t use

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol. A disadvantage is that glycerites are generally not as potent as tinctures,

<!-- chunk -->

### so larger doses are required.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another advantage of glycerin is that it tastes sweet, so it can be used to mask

<!-- chunk -->

### the bitter taste of many herbs. In this sense, a glycerite is similar to a syrup;

<!-- chunk -->

### however, unlike syrups, glycerites do not spike blood sugar levels in most

<!-- chunk -->

### people. Glycerin is not a sugar and is metabolized via different pathways, so it

<!-- chunk -->

### doesn’t appear to raise blood sugar levels in healthy people. Some research

<!-- chunk -->

### indicated that diabetics, however, may still need to be cautious when using

<!-- chunk -->

### glycerites.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alcohol is a better preservative than glycerin and is also less expensive.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, glycerites have a reasonably long shelf life. We have extensive

<!-- chunk -->

### experience in making glycerites and have found that properly made glycerites

<!-- chunk -->

### have a shelf life of at least 3 years. We’ve even had glycerites that were still

<!-- chunk -->

### effective after 10 years or more.

<!-- chunk -->

### A disadvantage of glycerin over alcohol is that heat must be used in making

<!-- chunk -->

### glycerites. Without heat, glycerin is a poor solvent. It is also more difficult to

<!-- chunk -->

### make fresh plant glycerites. So, plant compounds damaged by heat or drying will

<!-- chunk -->

### not be effectively extracted using glycerin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glycerin has some therapeutic properties of its own. It is antifungal and

<!-- chunk -->

### antimicrobial. It is also soothing and emollient, so glycerites are very good for

<!-- chunk -->

### applications where tissues need to be soothed and moisturized. Glycerin will not

<!-- chunk -->

### extract resins or oils, so use alcohol to extract resinous or oily herbs. It is also

<!-- chunk -->

### difficult, if not impossible, to make a glycerite preparation of most mucilaginous

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs, but these don’t extract in alcohol either.

# HERBAL VINEGARS OR ACID TINCTURES

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinegar is not widely used as an extraction medium, but it is useful in some

<!-- chunk -->

### applications. An herbal extract made with vinegar is usually known as an herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### vinegar or acid tincture. This method is most commonly used with culinary

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs for use in cooking or as a salad dressing, although some medicinal plants

<!-- chunk -->

### have also been made into acid tinctures.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinegar preparations are generally not as therapeutically strong as alcohol or

<!-- chunk -->

### glycerin preparations, as vinegar is not a great solvent for many herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### constituents. It also has a shorter shelf life, and the flavor of vinegar extracts is

<!-- chunk -->

### very disagreeable to some people. Others love the taste of vinegar and may find

<!-- chunk -->

### this a very appealing extraction medium.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are two applications where vinegar is very good. The first is in

<!-- chunk -->

### extracting minerals from herbs that contain calcium and other alkaline minerals.

<!-- chunk -->

### The second is for extracting aromatic and pungent herbs, as in making Fire

<!-- chunk -->

### Cider.

# OIL EXTRACTIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### Some herbs may be extracted in some kind of oil or fat, such as olive oil,

<!-- chunk -->

### coconut oil, or lard. Oil extraction is done to create remedies for topical

<!-- chunk -->

### application or to be used as a base for making salves and ointments.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oil is a very poor solvent for most herbal constituents, which is why some

<!-- chunk -->

### formulas for making ointments and salves begin with a water- or alcohol-based

<!-- chunk -->

### extraction to which oil is later added. There are, however, some plants that

<!-- chunk -->

### extract well in oil, such as St. John’s wort flowers and mullein flowers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal oils are very soothing, softening, and emollient, making them good for

<!-- chunk -->

### minor skin problems such as abrasions, burns, rashes, and dry skin. They should

<!-- chunk -->

### not be used on new cuts or wounds, however, because the oil can trap bacteria in

<!-- chunk -->

### the wound and help the infection to spread.

# SPECIALIZED PREPARATIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to the basic methods for preparing herbs that we’ve listed above,

<!-- chunk -->

### there are some additional, more specialized preparations of which you should be

<!-- chunk -->

### aware. Most of these preparations are industrial applications beyond what the

<!-- chunk -->

### average person could make at home. Nevertheless, you should be aware of these

<!-- chunk -->

### preparations and their uses.

# LIQUID CAPSULES

<!-- chunk -->

### An interesting new technology in making herbal products is to put herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### extracts into softgel capsules. This dosage form provides some of the benefits of

<!-- chunk -->

### capsules combined with some of the benefits of liquid extracts. These products

<!-- chunk -->

### can be very effective, but they are more costly than capsules or extracts. At this

<!-- chunk -->

### point, only a few herbs are available in this form, and it is not a dosage form you

<!-- chunk -->

### can make at home.

# STANDARDIZED EXTRACTS

<!-- chunk -->

### Quality herbal products have always been standardized, meaning that the way

<!-- chunk -->

### they were produced was consistent; that is, made according to some standard

<!-- chunk -->

### manufacturing process. Herbal products that were part of the United States

<!-- chunk -->

### Pharmacopoeia in times past were manufactured to USP standards. This

<!-- chunk -->

### designation still appears on some over-the-counter products at the drugstore.

<!-- chunk -->

### Standardization meant that the material was harvested correctly and verified

<!-- chunk -->

### as being the correct plant part. The raw material also met specific quality control

<!-- chunk -->

### standards. The material was then extracted using the same proportions of herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### material and menstruum each time. The tincturing or processing time was also

<!-- chunk -->

### standardized to a specific period of time.

<!-- chunk -->

### Today, the term “standardized” usually has a very different meaning. Modern

<!-- chunk -->

### standardization started in 1992 as a result of laws in Germany that required

<!-- chunk -->

### manufacturers to standardize their products to create a guaranteed potency of a

<!-- chunk -->

### particular constituent. This form of standardization grows out of the orthodox

<!-- chunk -->

### scientific view that herbs owe their efficacy to specific chemical compounds,

<!-- chunk -->

### usually referred to as “active constituents.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Many people think that the standardization movement is a step forward for

<!-- chunk -->

### herbal medicine, but the people who tend to be most resistant to it are

<!-- chunk -->

### professional clinical herbalists. These people, who have the most practical

<!-- chunk -->

### experience with herbs, often find that these standardized extracts don’t work as

<!-- chunk -->

### well as whole herbs. In fact, standardization flies in the face of traditional herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### wisdom, which says that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

<!-- chunk -->

### Whole plants contain thousands of chemical compounds put together in

<!-- chunk -->

### extremely complex ways. Most herbalists believe that the synergy of these

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds often creates a better effect than any single compound or group of

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds in the plants. In contrast, a standardized extract uses various solvents

<!-- chunk -->

### to isolate or at least concentrate specific compounds considered to be “active,”

<!-- chunk -->

### leaving other compounds, which may have synergistic effects, behind.

<!-- chunk -->

### So, standardized extracts are more like modern pharmaceutical drugs than

<!-- chunk -->

### whole herbal products. This does not mean they are not useful; it just means they

<!-- chunk -->

### should not be viewed as the equivalent of the actual herb. One cannot extrapolate

<!-- chunk -->

### that a single compound or group of compounds found in a plant will have all of

<!-- chunk -->

### the actions of the original herb.

<!-- chunk -->

### Examples of this type of extract include curcumin, a compound from turmeric,

<!-- chunk -->

### and berberine, an antimicrobial compound found in plants like goldenseal or

<!-- chunk -->

### Oregon grape. These types of extracts have the same relationship to medicinal

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs that vitamin and mineral supplements have to food. They are not

<!-- chunk -->

### equivalent.

<!-- chunk -->

### Standardized extracts have their place. In fact, some botanicals need to be

<!-- chunk -->

### used in this manner for proper safety and dosage. For example, all the research

<!-- chunk -->

### done on the benefits of ginkgo biloba was done on a standardized extract. The

<!-- chunk -->

### whole leaf was not used in traditional herbal medicine and does not have the

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits of the standardized extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### Standardization can be used to reduce toxicity in botanicals that may have

<!-- chunk -->

### other compounds that are undesirable. It can also make dosing of strong

<!-- chunk -->

### botanical compounds more precise, such as using the acetogenins from paw paw

<!-- chunk -->

### as an anticancer remedy.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are a number of problems with these products that the consumer should

<!-- chunk -->

### consider. First, standardization increases the cost of herbal products to the

<!-- chunk -->

### consumer, without necessarily resulting in a more effective product.

<!-- chunk -->

### Second, there is not always agreement as to which compounds should be

<!-- chunk -->

### standardized, and compounds left behind may also be therapeutically valuable.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, a curcumin-free extract of turmeric was found to still have anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory properties, demonstrating that it isn’t just the curcumin in the

<!-- chunk -->

### turmeric that is anti-inflammatory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Furthermore, modern standards are not created by an objective third party like

<!-- chunk -->

### the United States Pharmacopoeia, nor are they based on clinical experience from

<!-- chunk -->

### practicing herbalists. The standards are created by the pharmaceutical and

<!-- chunk -->

### nutraceutical companies, often reflecting research done on the constituents rather

<!-- chunk -->

### than the whole herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is also the issue of the chemical solvents that are used to selectively

<!-- chunk -->

### extract and concentrate active constituents at the expense of others. Are traces of

<!-- chunk -->

### these compounds still present in the product?

<!-- chunk -->

### In summary, standardized extracts create a more specific, more medicine-like

<!-- chunk -->

### action by providing a standardized level of specific plant constituents. Although

<!-- chunk -->

### this may help with dosage regulation and consistency, the product is no longer an

<!-- chunk -->

### herb. Just as an orange and a vitamin C pill are very different, a whole herb is

<!-- chunk -->

### very different from a standardized extract. The synergy of ingredients found in

<!-- chunk -->

### the original plant is lost, which in many cases means the product may not be as

<!-- chunk -->

### effective as the less-expensive whole herb.

# ESSENTIAL OILS

<!-- chunk -->

### An essential oil, also known as a volatile oil, is a concentrated extract of the

<!-- chunk -->

### volatile constituents in herbs. These are the compounds that evaporate from a

<!-- chunk -->

### plant to give it its characteristic aroma. We discuss aromatherapy in more detail

<!-- chunk -->

### in Chapter Ten, but here we will just introduce them.

<!-- chunk -->

### Like a standardized extract, an essential oil is not the same as the herb from

<!-- chunk -->

### which it comes. It is a concentrated component of the herb, but does not contain

<!-- chunk -->

### all of the other compounds found in the plant. Again, this is important to

<!-- chunk -->

### understand, as many people will attribute therapeutic properties to an essential

<!-- chunk -->

### oil that are found only in the actual herb.

<!-- chunk -->

### Essential oils are highly concentrated substances, which means they do not

<!-- chunk -->

### have the same degree of safety that a whole plant has. Essential oils can irritate

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitive skin or mucous membranes. Many are toxic and should never be used

<!-- chunk -->

### internally, and even oils that are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) may have

<!-- chunk -->

### toxic properties when ingested in larger quantities (with an essential oil, one

<!-- chunk -->

### drop is a fairly large dose).

<!-- chunk -->

### Like the taste of a plant, the aroma of essential oils has a very direct and

<!-- chunk -->

### immediate impact on body functions via the nervous system. This means that it

<!-- chunk -->

### is usually not necessary to ingest an essential oil to obtain its benefits. The safest

<!-- chunk -->

### way to use them is to smell them or dilute them and use them topically. These

<!-- chunk -->

### highly concentrated substances have a fairly long shelf life, tend to be antiseptic

<!-- chunk -->

### and healing, and are useful for emotional healing and mood alteration. Their

<!-- chunk -->

### growing popularity attests to their benefits, and to the marketing of companies

<!-- chunk -->

### selling them. Making essential oils at home requires specialized equipment, with

<!-- chunk -->

### basic setups starting at $500 or more. Many people find that the art of distilling

<!-- chunk -->

### essential oils is a fun and worthwhile investment. Some oils in the marketplace

<!-- chunk -->

### may be extracted or adulterated with chemical solvents, so it is very important to

<!-- chunk -->

### seek out both quality oils and education on how to use them safely.

# SELECTING THE BEST DOSAGE FORMS

### ature freely provides medicines that can help you solve your health

<!-- chunk -->

### problems and stay healthy. You don’t need to go to the wilderness to find

<!-- chunk -->

### these healing plants. Most common lawn and garden weeds have medicinal

<!-- chunk -->

### value. Many medicinal herbs can be found at garden nurseries, and you can plant

### them in your yard or grow them in pots as houseplants. There are even a few

<!-- chunk -->

### fresh medicinal herbs at your local grocery store.

<!-- chunk -->

### It isn’t necessary to harvest your own herbs in order to make your own herbal

### medicines, but it is fun and empowering. It deepens your connection with nature

<!-- chunk -->

### so that you start to see it as an ally, filled with living things ready to share their

### This book isn’t a gardening book or a plant identification guide, but we want

<!-- chunk -->

### to acquaint you with some of the basics you’ll need to know to obtain your own

### medicinal plants. We’ll start with growing them yourself, discuss harvesting

<!-- chunk -->

### them from the wild, and finish with talking about some of the ways you can use

<!-- chunk -->

# GROWING HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### Throughout history, it was common to have a few medicinal herbs in the kitchen

<!-- chunk -->

### garden. Many herbs, especially culinary herbs, are easy to grow. If you have

<!-- chunk -->

### limited space, you can grow your herbs in a planter box or another small

<!-- chunk -->

### container.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can find basic culinary herb plants at most local nurseries, and some

<!-- chunk -->

### plants that are sold as flowers or vegetables are also medicinal. Start by looking

<!-- chunk -->

### for basil, cilantro, dill, fennel, garlic, oregano, parsley, rosemary, sage, and

<!-- chunk -->

### thyme. Mints, such as spearmint or peppermint, are usually easy to grow and

<!-- chunk -->

### spread like weeds if you don’t contain them. You can be exotic and grow orange

<!-- chunk -->

### mint, pineapple mint, chocolate mint, and ginger mint.

<!-- chunk -->

### Medicinal flowers like yarrow, roses, calendula, or chamomile can easily be

<!-- chunk -->

### planted in a garden. Herbs like borage, bee balm, catnip, and horehound are easy

<!-- chunk -->

### to grow. Searching online for herb plants and seeds will yield even more

<!-- chunk -->

### possibilities. If you have the space, get a good book on growing herbs and plant

<!-- chunk -->

### a medicinal garden for yourself.

# WILDCRAFTING HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### Ralph Waldo Emerson said that weeds are plants “whose virtues have yet to be

<!-- chunk -->

### discovered.” If you have a yard, there are probably many medicinal plants

<!-- chunk -->

### already growing on your property, and if they are not on your property, they are

<!-- chunk -->

### probably growing around the neighborhood.

<!-- chunk -->

### Before heading out into the wilds to learn to identify medicinal plants, start by

<!-- chunk -->

### becoming acquainted with the medicinal weeds growing in your own backyard.

<!-- chunk -->

### Common medicinal weeds that may grow nearby include burdock, dandelion,

<!-- chunk -->

### red clover, plantain, mullein, and wild lettuce.

<!-- chunk -->

### Before you start harvesting anything, you need to make sure you have

<!-- chunk -->

### properly identified the plant. It is easy to get some plants confused with other

<!-- chunk -->

### plants, especially in plant families such as the carrot family. Plants should be

<!-- chunk -->

### identified by their Latin names rather than their common names, as the same

<!-- chunk -->

### common name is often given to more than one species of plant.

<!-- chunk -->

### On rare occasions, people have consumed toxic plants by accident and died

<!-- chunk -->

### from it (although usually you’ll just get very sick). If you are not absolutely sure

<!-- chunk -->

### of the plant, don’t harvest it. Look for books on local plants at your local

<!-- chunk -->

### bookstore. Most plant identification books do not contain information about how

<!-- chunk -->

### to gather and use the plant, and most herbal guides don’t have good information

<!-- chunk -->

### on identification, so you’ll want to consult both herb texts and field guides. Have

<!-- chunk -->

### several of each on hand when identifying new plants.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you want to gather any herbs other than common garden weeds or those you

<!-- chunk -->

### have grown yourself, take a series of herb walks with a skilled herbalist or take a

<!-- chunk -->

### few classes in field botany. Learn to identify the poisonous plants in your area so

<!-- chunk -->

### you do not confuse any other plant with them.

# ETHICAL WILDCRAFTING

<!-- chunk -->

### The overharvesting of certain medicinal plants has resulted in some plants

<!-- chunk -->

### becoming rare or endangered. Check with United Plant Savers

<!-- chunk -->

### (www.unitedplantsavers.org) for a list of plants that are at-risk, overharvested,

<!-- chunk -->

### and suffering from habitat loss, and do not harvest those plants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even if the plant you want is not endangered or at-risk, it’s important to

<!-- chunk -->

### follow some simple guidelines to ensure that these plants will be there for

<!-- chunk -->

### generations to come: Gather medicinal plants only where the plants are

<!-- chunk -->

### abundant. Never take more than 10% of the plants in a given area. Always leave

<!-- chunk -->

### plenty of plants so that nature can replenish the supply.

<!-- chunk -->

### It helps to know the plant’s reproductive habits before you harvest it. A plant

<!-- chunk -->

### that reproduces from underground rhizomes should be thinned, whereas a plant

<!-- chunk -->

### that reproduces from seeds should be gathered sporadically, with flowers left to

<!-- chunk -->

### turn to seed. When possible, gather leaves, seeds, and flowers, which grow back

<!-- chunk -->

### easily, rather than barks and roots, the loss of which may kill the plant. Harvest

<!-- chunk -->

### bark with respect for the needs of the tree, and preferably from recently downed

<!-- chunk -->

### branches or prunings.

<!-- chunk -->

### When harvesting roots and bulbs, replant the crown portion of the root or

<!-- chunk -->

### rhizomes and fill in holes so you don’t leave gaping holes in the earth. When you

<!-- chunk -->

### harvest plants on a hill, leave the plants at the top of the hill untouched to help

<!-- chunk -->

### replenish the downhill slope.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many indigenous traditions teach that you should ask the plants for

<!-- chunk -->

### permission before gathering them and leave an offering in exchange for the

<!-- chunk -->

### plant. Sit with the plant in a quiet, meditative state for at least 15 minutes before

<!-- chunk -->

### harvesting it. Think about what use you want to make of the plant material, and

<!-- chunk -->

### ask the plant for permission to gather it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Native people often looked for what appeared to be the “eldest” plant in the

<!-- chunk -->

### area or plant “tribe.” They would make an offering of cornmeal or tobacco to

<!-- chunk -->

### this “grandfather” plant, asking permission to harvest some of the tribe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even if you choose not to gather plants in these traditional ways, gather the

<!-- chunk -->

### plants in a reverent, thankful manner. Honor the fact that these living plants are

<!-- chunk -->

### giving their lives or part of themselves to help you and others heal.

# HARVESTING AND DRYING HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### Make sure the plants you gather have not been sprayed with chemicals, and that

<!-- chunk -->

### they are not growing next to busy streets where they are exposed to exhaust

<!-- chunk -->

### fumes. Don’t harvest plants from other people’s property without their

<!-- chunk -->

### permission. If you are harvesting from government land, make sure you know

<!-- chunk -->

### what the laws and regulations are (it’s illegal to harvest plants from national

<!-- chunk -->

### parks in the United States).

<!-- chunk -->

### Harvest only one species of plant at a time to avoid confusion. Individual

<!-- chunk -->

### plant parts like leaves are easy to get mixed up. Label everything carefully as

<!-- chunk -->

### soon as you get it home.

<!-- chunk -->

### Know what you will be using the plant for before you gather it. Harvest only

<!-- chunk -->

### the part of the plant that you intend to use medicinally, and gather only as much

<!-- chunk -->

### as you need. Try not to gather from wet ground, where your footprints can

<!-- chunk -->

### damage the soil and make future growth more challenging; wait for a stretch of

<!-- chunk -->

### good weather before collecting in wetland areas. Leave the area in better shape

<!-- chunk -->

### than it was when you found it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dry or process herbs into an extract as quickly as possible. If you have to

<!-- chunk -->

### wait, keep the plant material cool until you’re ready to dry or process it.

# HARVESTING AT THE RIGHT TIME

<!-- chunk -->

### Like fruits and vegetables, herbs have a season and time of day when they ripen

<!-- chunk -->

### and are at peak strength. Harvest herbs when they are at the peak of maturity and

<!-- chunk -->

### the concentration of active ingredients is highest.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here are some general guidelines; consult other herbal texts for more specific

<!-- chunk -->

### information. Barks are usually harvested in the spring (and in the morning)

<!-- chunk -->

### because that is when the sap is rising and the bark is most active. This is also the

<!-- chunk -->

### time to harvest young stems, buds, and leaves.

<!-- chunk -->

### Flowers are usually harvested during the day when the energy of the plant is

<!-- chunk -->

### the most yang, or outward. Flowers are best harvested shortly after they open.

<!-- chunk -->

### (Flowers that open at night should be gathered in the evening when they start to

<!-- chunk -->

### open.) Essential oils rise up the stems and concentrate in flowers in the early

<!-- chunk -->

### morning hours, then dissipate as the day wears on.

<!-- chunk -->

### As the plant dies back in the fall, the energy and nutrient stores are returned to

<!-- chunk -->

### the root. Roots, therefore, are usually gathered in the fall, and are often more

<!-- chunk -->

### potent when gathered in the evening hours when the plant is pulling its energies

<!-- chunk -->

### downward again.

# HARVESTING THE RIGHT PARTS OF AN HERB

<!-- chunk -->

### Many plants have different uses depending on the plant part. It is important to

<!-- chunk -->

### know which part of the plant you want. Although one part of the plant may be

<!-- chunk -->

### completely safe, other parts may be toxic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Elder flowers and elder berries are both antiviral. Elder flowers are used to

<!-- chunk -->

### treat topical irritations of the skin, and are used internally as a mild refrigerant to

<!-- chunk -->

### relieve fevers and reduce inflammation. Elder berries are used as a potassium-

<!-- chunk -->

### rich food, and can be added to slippery elm gruel to treat wasting conditions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Elder berries are also used to enhance tonic cardiovascular herbal blends, and

<!-- chunk -->

### have a mild decongestant effect. Elder leaves are astringent and are used

<!-- chunk -->

### primarily as a topical preparation, whereas the bark is bitter, astringent, and

<!-- chunk -->

### mildly toxic, suitable for use only by experienced practitioners.

<!-- chunk -->

### Using the wrong part of a plant can cause toxic reactions, from simple

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach upset to coma and even death. The fruit of the tomato and the tuber of

<!-- chunk -->

### the potato are edible and nutritionally dense, but the leaves and stems of these

<!-- chunk -->

### plants are toxic. The reverse can also hold true: Leafy parts of some plants are

<!-- chunk -->

### edible, whereas the fruit or seeds are toxic.

# SPECIFIC HARVESTING DIRECTIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### Here are some more detailed guidelines for harvesting various plant parts.

<!-- chunk -->

### Again, these are general guidelines. Each herb has its own unique characteristics.

<!-- chunk -->

### As you learn more about each plant, you will also discover the best time to

<!-- chunk -->

### harvest it.

<!-- chunk -->

## Flowers

<!-- chunk -->

### Harvesting flowers varies from plant to plant, because different plants flower at

<!-- chunk -->

### different times of the year. Sometimes the part used is the bud; in this case,

<!-- chunk -->

### collect the flowers just before they open. Blossoms should be harvested when

<!-- chunk -->

### they are fully open, just as they reach the peak of their strength, but before they

<!-- chunk -->

### start to turn (wilt, waste, or dry out). Shortly after this, the blossom will begin to

<!-- chunk -->

### wilt at the edges and go limp, and the vibrancy of the color will start to fade.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is usually best to harvest flowers in mid- to late morning after the dew has

<!-- chunk -->

### dried. Cut or pick them carefully. If the stems are woody, like lavender, it is

<!-- chunk -->

### easiest to use clippers and harvest the stem along with the flowers. If the stem is

<!-- chunk -->

### large or fleshy, remove the flowers from the stems before drying. Keep fresh

<!-- chunk -->

### flowers loose and in open containers so they do not congeal and mold. Remove

<!-- chunk -->

### obvious dirt, soil, and insects, and spread the flowers on a paper-lined tray or

<!-- chunk -->

### newspaper to dry. Flowers should be dried in a well-ventilated area away from

<!-- chunk -->

### sunlight and excessive heat; paper sacks suspended from the ceiling make great

<!-- chunk -->

### drying units. When the flowers are dry (when they crumble when rubbed

<!-- chunk -->

### between your fingers), store them whole in dark, airtight containers.

<!-- chunk -->

### When the plant part used is the flowering herb, leaves and stems are gathered

<!-- chunk -->

### along with the flowers. Tie bunches of stems together with string or twine, and

<!-- chunk -->

### hang them upside down to dry. Dry them away from direct sunlight and

<!-- chunk -->

### excessive heat.

<!-- chunk -->

## Leaves and Aerial Parts

<!-- chunk -->

### Leaves are usually best when harvested in the early and mid-summer when their

<!-- chunk -->

### chlorophyll and their aromatic and medicinal constituents are at their peak.

<!-- chunk -->

### Collect leaves in the morning after the dew has evaporated. As the day warms up

<!-- chunk -->

### and photosynthesis gets under way, essential oils are concentrated in the leaves

<!-- chunk -->

### and evaporate in midday heat. Harvest the leaves after some warmth has drawn

<!-- chunk -->

### up the oils but before they have been released in the heat.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gather leaves when they are tender and showing new growth, either before the

<!-- chunk -->

### flower buds appear or after seeding when new fall growth appears. Treat all

<!-- chunk -->

### leaves gently, taking care not to bruise or crush them. Pick only healthy whole

<!-- chunk -->

### leaves that are not torn, discolored, or insect infested.

<!-- chunk -->

### According to Nicholas Culpeper’s English Physician and Complete Herbal,

<!-- chunk -->

### “The leaves of such herbs as run up to seed are not so good when they are in

<!-- chunk -->

### flower as before” (p. 200). Upon flowering, the plant’s priorities change and its

<!-- chunk -->

### energy goes into reproduction. At this point the leaves can become bitter and

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes astringent. Whether you gather the leaves before the plant flowers or

<!-- chunk -->

### after will depend on what components you are looking for.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pick the succulent leaves of sorrel, bistort, good King Henry, angelica, and all

<!-- chunk -->

### salad herbs when young. Succulent herbs are not typically harvested for drying

<!-- chunk -->

### and should be frozen in cooked food or preserved in oil or vinegar.

<!-- chunk -->

### Large leaves such as burdock and mullein can be harvested and dried

<!-- chunk -->

### individually; smaller leaves, such as mints, are best left on the stem. Gather the

<!-- chunk -->

### leaves of deciduous herbs just before flowering, and gather evergreen herbs,

<!-- chunk -->

### such as rosemary, throughout the year. If you are using all of the aerial parts,

<!-- chunk -->

### harvest when there are both flowers and seed heads on the plant. Treat all leaves

<!-- chunk -->

### gently, taking care not to bruise or crush them. Pick only healthy whole leaves

<!-- chunk -->

### that are not torn, discolored, or insect infested.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are several ways to dry leaves. Tie them in small bunches of about 8–12

<!-- chunk -->

### stems, depending on the size of the stems, and hang them upside down to dry.

<!-- chunk -->

### When the leaves are brittle to the touch, but not so dry that they turn to powder,

<!-- chunk -->

### rub them from the stem onto paper to dry, and discard the stem, if the stem is not

<!-- chunk -->

### required. Leaves can also be spread on screens or placed loosely in small paper

<!-- chunk -->

### bags and hung to dry. Dry leaves away from sunlight. Store in airtight containers

<!-- chunk -->

### when dry.

<!-- chunk -->

## Seeds

<!-- chunk -->

### Seeds should be harvested late in fall before the weather turns wet or the snow

<!-- chunk -->

### starts to fall. The plant should be thoroughly dead and dried up when you harvest

<!-- chunk -->

### the seeds. Some seeds, such as poppy and oat, are harvested when they are green

<!-- chunk -->

### due to the concentration of certain medicinal alkaloids. (Note that the use of

<!-- chunk -->

### green poppy seed is illegal.)

<!-- chunk -->

### The best time of day to harvest the seeds of a plant is midmorning. Pick seeds

<!-- chunk -->

### on a warm, dry day when the seeds are fully ripe but before they have fallen off

<!-- chunk -->

### the plant. The seeds should be tan, brown, or black, not green at all, and they

<!-- chunk -->

### should be hard, with paper-dry pods.

<!-- chunk -->

### Harvest the entire seed head with about 15–25 centimeters (6–10 inches) of

<!-- chunk -->

### stalk. Hang seed heads upside down over a paper-lined tray or in a paper bag

<!-- chunk -->

### away from direct sunlight. Seeds will usually dry within 2 weeks. Keep all seeds

<!-- chunk -->

### separate and remember to label and date everything.

<!-- chunk -->

## Roots and Rhizomes

<!-- chunk -->

### Most roots are gathered in the late fall when the aerial parts of the plant have

<!-- chunk -->

### wilted and before the ground becomes too hard to dig easily. In the fall, the

<!-- chunk -->

### fluids and vitality of the plant drop into the roots or rhizomes. There are

<!-- chunk -->

### exceptions to this rule: Dandelion root, for example, should be gathered in the

<!-- chunk -->

### spring before it becomes too bitter and woody.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dig up annuals when their growing cycle has been completed at the end of the

<!-- chunk -->

### year. Pick perennial roots in their second or third year of growth or later, when

<!-- chunk -->

### the active components have developed. Because sap rises and falls with the sun,

<!-- chunk -->

### gather roots in the early morning or late afternoon while most of the potency of

<!-- chunk -->

### the plant is in the root.

<!-- chunk -->

### In most cases you should wash the roots thoroughly to remove soil and dirt.

<!-- chunk -->

### Use an old toothbrush to scrub small roots. Most roots, such as horseradish and

<!-- chunk -->

### comfrey, can be scrubbed clean and have their fibrous hairs removed. Others,

<!-- chunk -->

### such as valerian, should not be stripped of their tiny root hairs, as their precious

<!-- chunk -->

### constituents are contained in the epidermal (surface) cells. For these roots, brush

<!-- chunk -->

### the dirt off with a dry toothbrush or wash very gently.

<!-- chunk -->

### Roots can be difficult or even impossible to cut when dry, so chop large roots

<!-- chunk -->

### into small pieces while still fresh. Spread the pieces of root on a screen or a tray

<!-- chunk -->

### lined with paper, and dry in a warm place away from direct sunlight. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### succulent roots like dandelion and burdock need a bit more heat than normal to

<!-- chunk -->

### kill off small insect eggs; these do best cut into small pieces when fresh, and

<!-- chunk -->

### then dried at 150° in a food dehydrator, or in the oven on the lowest setting with

<!-- chunk -->

### the door propped open. Some roots reabsorb moisture from the air, so discard

<!-- chunk -->

### them if they become soft.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sap and Resin

<!-- chunk -->

### The best time to harvest resin from a tree is in autumn when the sap is falling.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sap is usually harvested in the spring when it is rising. In either case, make a

<!-- chunk -->

### deep incision in the bark and wait for the resin or sap to leak out. Sap can be

<!-- chunk -->

### collected by drilling a hole and collecting the sap in a cup or bucket tied to the

<!-- chunk -->

### tree. Sometimes a sizable bucket is needed: a large amount of birch sap, for

<!-- chunk -->

### example, can be collected overnight at certain times of year. If you tap (drill) a

<!-- chunk -->

### tree, place a wood cork in the hole after you’re done to prevent insects from

<!-- chunk -->

### invading the tree.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can squeeze sap from latex plants like wild lettuce or desert poppy into a

<!-- chunk -->

### container. Some saps are corrosive (including celandine and fig sap), so wear

<!-- chunk -->

### protective gloves before squeezing. To harvest aloe, slice along the center of the

<!-- chunk -->

### leaf and peel back the edges, then use the blunt edge of a knife to scrape the gel

<!-- chunk -->

### from the leaf.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fruits

<!-- chunk -->

### Harvest fruits only when they are completely ripened. This can be anywhere

<!-- chunk -->

### from summer to late fall, depending on the plant. One of the best indicators that

<!-- chunk -->

### a fruit has ripened is how easily it can be harvested from the plant. The fruit

<!-- chunk -->

### should almost fall off as it is touched, and should not have to be pulled with

<!-- chunk -->

### force from the stem that attaches it to the plant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Harvest berries and other fruits just as they become ripe, before the fruit

<!-- chunk -->

### becomes too soft to dry. Lay them out on covered screens to dry. Turn fleshy

<!-- chunk -->

### fruits frequently to help them dry evenly, and get rid of fruit that show signs of

<!-- chunk -->

### mold. A dehydrator is an excellent way to dry medicinal fruits.

<!-- chunk -->

## Bark

<!-- chunk -->

### Both outer and inner bark should be harvested in the late fall, winter, or early

<!-- chunk -->

### spring. This is when they are the most potent, and, depending on where you live,

<!-- chunk -->

### there should be no bug or pest invasion during that time of year. To minimize the

<!-- chunk -->

### damage to the tree, harvest in the autumn when the sap is falling back into the

<!-- chunk -->

### roots. As spring approaches and the fluids rise in the plant, the tree will heal any

<!-- chunk -->

### damage (including the stripped bark). For most plants this is the only time they

<!-- chunk -->

### can heal without environmental complications.

<!-- chunk -->

### Outer bark is the part of the bark that people cut into when they carve their

<!-- chunk -->

### initials in a tree. The inner bark is the thin layer underneath the hard outer bark

<!-- chunk -->

### that still adheres to the tree. Collect bark from young branches or trunks. Look

<!-- chunk -->

### for recently downed trees before harvesting bark from live ones. When working

<!-- chunk -->

### with live trees, it is best to saw off a branch and then strip it. Bark will peel off

<!-- chunk -->

### easily in wet weather. Be careful to cut carefully so the bark does not tear down

<!-- chunk -->

### the trunk, exposing the tree to insect invasion. If you are harvesting a small

<!-- chunk -->

### amount of bark, take small, lengthwise strips from one of the branches; if you

<!-- chunk -->

### cut around the circumference of the tree you will kill it. Brush off the bark to

<!-- chunk -->

### remove moss or insects, and break or cut the bark into small pieces (1–2 inches

<!-- chunk -->

### square), lay them out on a tray, and let dry.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes twigs can be used instead of bark. The pruned branches of fruit

<!-- chunk -->

### trees such as peach and apple can be put to good use as herbal medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Bulbs

<!-- chunk -->

### Harvest bulbs after the aerial parts have wilted. Collect garlic bulbs quickly; they

<!-- chunk -->

### tend to sink downward once the leaves have wilted and may be difficult to find.

<!-- chunk -->

### Garlic and onions are examples of medicinal bulbs.

# USING FRESH PLANTS

<!-- chunk -->

### Fresh plants can be used in a number of ways. You can chew the fresh herb and

<!-- chunk -->

### eat it, or add it to soups, stews, or other dishes. You can also extract fresh herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### in water (infusions and decoctions), alcohol, glycerin, or vinegar. Here are some

<!-- chunk -->

### specific preparations that can be made from fresh herbs.

# FRESH PLANT POULTICES

<!-- chunk -->

### Fresh herbs can be mashed and applied directly to the skin for burns, insect bites,

<!-- chunk -->

### bee stings, cuts, and other minor injuries. You can also chew the plant material a

<!-- chunk -->

### little, crushing it with the teeth and mixing it with saliva, to form a fresh plant

<!-- chunk -->

### poultice. (Spit poultices contain lots of unhealthy bacteria from the mouth and

<!-- chunk -->

### shouldn’t be used on broken skin.) Examples of fresh herbs that can be used as

<!-- chunk -->

### poultices include the following:

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Plantain (bee stings, insect bites, snake bites, burns, minor cuts and abrasions;

<!-- chunk -->

### dirty wounds containing sand, dirt, grit, or other impurities)

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Lily of the valley (draws out slivers and pus)

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Yarrow (cuts, bruises, crushed tissues, insect bites)

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Grindelia (bee stings and insect bites, cuts, infected wounds)

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Jewelweed (poison ivy)

# INSTANT PASTES AND OINTMENTS

<!-- chunk -->

### Fresh herbs can be made into pastes and ointments. Make a paste by mixing

<!-- chunk -->

### crushed fresh herbs with a little honey or glycerin. These can be eaten or used as

<!-- chunk -->

### a base for a poultice. You can make an instant ointment by mashing fresh herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### into butter, ghee, or oil.

# GREEN DRINKS

<!-- chunk -->

### Green drinks are prepared with a blender. Pour fruit juice (pineapple juice is

<!-- chunk -->

### delicious) into a blender, add fresh herbs, and blend the mixture. Strain and

<!-- chunk -->

### drink. Drink green drinks within a couple of minutes to guarantee the full

<!-- chunk -->

### potency of all of the plant’s nutrients and constituents. Plants that can be used to

<!-- chunk -->

### make green drinks include dandelion greens, plantain, parsley, wheat grass, and

<!-- chunk -->

### barley grass.

# JUICING

<!-- chunk -->

### Herb juices are commonly made with parsley, garlic, and onions, and fruits such

<!-- chunk -->

### as lemons and limes. Juicing fresh herbs separates the plant fiber from the plant

<!-- chunk -->

### fluids. Herb juices can be made with a food processor or a juicer. The most

<!-- chunk -->

### antiquated method for juicing, still used by the more adventurous among us, is

<!-- chunk -->

### the mortar and pestle. Filter the mashed plant material through a muslin cloth

<!-- chunk -->

### and squeeze through a nylon sieve or jelly bag to obtain the juice.

<!-- chunk -->

### Juicing requires large quantities of fresh herb: A 10-liter bucket of fresh herb

<!-- chunk -->

### may yield only 100 milliliters of juice.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dehydrated Herb Juice

<!-- chunk -->

### After the juice has been expressed from the plant fiber it can be dehydrated.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dehydrating must be done with care and cleanliness to avoid microbial

<!-- chunk -->

### contamination. Dry the juice quickly, but not at such a high temperature that the

<!-- chunk -->

### nutritional factors or therapeutic constituents are degraded. Dry juices in a

<!-- chunk -->

### standard food dehydrator using fruit leather trays. If you do not use heat, you can

<!-- chunk -->

### dry juice on waxed paper or glass as well: Spread a thin layer of juice on the

<!-- chunk -->

### waxed paper or glass container and cover with a muslin cloth to prevent mold

<!-- chunk -->

### and keep flies and pests off. Place in a warm place to dry. Once the juice is

<!-- chunk -->

### thoroughly dried, scrape it off, powder it, and package. If kept in a cool, dark,

<!-- chunk -->

### dry place, this type of preparation will keep for about 3–4 months.

# RAW GARLIC

While most herbs work well when dried, there are some herbs that are best used fresh. Garlic is one of them. Garlic bulbs are available at any grocery store, and raw garlic is a good remedy to keep around the house. Garlic is often sold in capsules and extracted in oil, but allicin, an antimicrobial constituent found in raw garlic, degrades rapidly into inactive compounds, so fresh is best. There are many ways to use fresh garlic. For ear infections and earaches, cut a slice of a garlic clove and place it on the outer ear covering the ear canal. Do not put the garlic into the ear canal. If the raw garlic irritates the skin, coat it with a little olive oil before applying. For an abscessed tooth, cut a slice of garlic, coat it in olive oil, and place it next to the affected tooth to fight the infection. This will temporarily ease the pain and infection; you still need to see a dentist. Raw garlic works internally against infections in the intestines and lungs, but it has little effect on systemic infections. To get it down, chop raw garlic into small pieces and take it in a spoonful of honey. There is a formula for Garlic Lemon Aid in Chapter Twelve, as well as a formula for Fire Cider, which includes raw garlic. Photo by Steven Horne

# Dried Herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## BULK HERBS, CAPSULES, AND TABLETS

<!-- chunk -->

### rying is one of the oldest methods of preparing herbs for storage and use,

<!-- chunk -->

### and is easy to do at home. Most herbs maintain a reasonable potency when

<!-- chunk -->

### dried, whereas some lose potency, and the strength of a few others is enhanced

<!-- chunk -->

### by drying. Dried herbs are often powdered. As they are powdered, plant material

<!-- chunk -->

### is exposed to the air, which causes more constituents to be lost. This means that

<!-- chunk -->

### powdered herbs lose potency faster than herbs that are cut and sifted or whole.

<!-- chunk -->

### Powders may be encapsulated or tableted, and both powders and bulk dried

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs can be used to make extracts and various topical preparations.

# PURCHASING DRIED HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### When you purchase bulk herbs you depend upon the supplier to ensure that the

<!-- chunk -->

### herb was properly identified and harvested. Be discerning when you choose an

<!-- chunk -->

### herb vendor.

<!-- chunk -->

### We favor organically grown or wildcrafted herbs. Organically grown herbs are

<!-- chunk -->

### grown without chemical pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. Wildcrafted herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### have been gathered from the wild, so unless they are harvested near roadways or

<!-- chunk -->

### farms, they won’t have chemical pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Using cultivated herbs contributes to plant conservation because doing so does

<!-- chunk -->

### not deplete wild stands of plants. On the other hand, plants that grow in their

<!-- chunk -->

### native habitat may be more potent than herbs that are cultivated. Many of the

<!-- chunk -->

### medicinal compounds in plants are produced in response to environmental stress,

<!-- chunk -->

### so a wild-grown plant may have higher concentrations of medicinal compounds

<!-- chunk -->

### than a cultivated plant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dried herbs may be whole, sliced, cut and sifted, or powdered. As mentioned

<!-- chunk -->

### above, the more surface area that is exposed to light and air, the quicker plants

<!-- chunk -->

### deteriorate. Keep your herbs whole or cut and sifted until ready for use. A small

<!-- chunk -->

### coffee grinder will reduce most cut and sifted herbs (with the exception of very

<!-- chunk -->

### hard roots and barks) to powder, or you can use a Vitamix, as discussed in

<!-- chunk -->

### Chapter Five.

# QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES

<!-- chunk -->

### When purchasing herbs, here are the quality control issues of which you should

<!-- chunk -->

### be aware. Cheaper brands are not necessarily a good buy. Even today there is

<!-- chunk -->

### adulteration in herbal products. Some products contain the wrong plant species.

<!-- chunk -->

### Others include plant parts that are not considered medicinally valuable.

<!-- chunk -->

### Therefore, purchase from companies that ensure they use the right species and

<!-- chunk -->

### parts of the plant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Make sure that plants are being harvested at the right time of the year. Potency

<!-- chunk -->

### may also vary with the location where the plant was grown.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is also important that herbs be harvested sustainably. Avoid companies that

<!-- chunk -->

### are supporting wildcrafters who are endangering species of medicinal plants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cleanliness of the plant material is also important. Is the herb free of dirt and

<!-- chunk -->

### insect parts? Is it also free of pesticides and herbicides, heavy metals, and other

<!-- chunk -->

### chemical contaminants? This is especially important for herbs coming from

<!-- chunk -->

### heavily polluted countries like China. Remember that just because an herb is

<!-- chunk -->

### organic doesn’t mean that it’s free of dirt or insect parts.

<!-- chunk -->

### These are all reasons why we recommend you stick to purchasing herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### products, including bulk herbs, only from reputable manufacturers. See

<!-- chunk -->

### Appendix Two for a list of suppliers we recommend.

# USING DRIED HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### Bulk dried herbs can be used in a variety of ways. They can be extracted as

<!-- chunk -->

### discussed in Chapter Five or used in topical applications as described in Chapter

<!-- chunk -->

### Eight. They can also be encapsulated or tableted or made into herbal nut butter

<!-- chunk -->

### balls. The following are some of the dosage forms you can make using bulk

<!-- chunk -->

### dried herbs.

# CAPSULES

<!-- chunk -->

### The herb industry received a huge boon when herbs began to be put into

<!-- chunk -->

### capsules. Encapsulated herbs are easy to consume, and they are one of the most

<!-- chunk -->

### popular ways of taking herbs in the United States today. Encapsulated herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### rarely act as quickly or effectively as traditional teas and tinctures, but for some

<!-- chunk -->

### unpalatable herbs needed in high doses they are very convenient.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many capsules are made from animal by-products (gelatin) and may not be

<!-- chunk -->

### suitable for people on strict vegetarian diets, but there are an increasing number

<!-- chunk -->

### of products being made with all-vegetable capsules. Most companies that

<!-- chunk -->

### encapsulate herbs add materials like magnesium stearate to lubricate their

<!-- chunk -->

### machinery. For most people the addition of minute amounts of magnesium

<!-- chunk -->

### stearate doesn’t cause any problems, but some people with sensitive digestive

<!-- chunk -->

### tracts should avoid it. Several companies, including Pure Encapsulations and

<!-- chunk -->

### Thorne, don’t use magnesium stearate.

<!-- chunk -->

### Home capsule filling machines can be bought for around $30, or you can fill

<!-- chunk -->

### capsules by hand. To do this manually, you need a saucer or flat dish, empty

<!-- chunk -->

### capsules, and the powdered herb you want to encapsulate. Pour the powdered

<!-- chunk -->

### herb into the saucer. Separate the two halves of the capsule case and scoop the

<!-- chunk -->

### powder into both sides of the capsule. Fit the two halves of the capsule together.

<!-- chunk -->

### Store the finished capsules in a cool place in a dark glass jar or container.

<!-- chunk -->

### Different capsule sizes hold different amounts of herb powder, and machines

<!-- chunk -->

### are more efficient than hand filling. Hand filling a size 00 capsule will result in

<!-- chunk -->

### 200–250 milligrams of powdered herb per capsule. Machine-filled capsules

<!-- chunk -->

### usually hold 45 milligrams of herb powder per a standard size 00 capsule.

# TABLETS

<!-- chunk -->

### Before capsules became popular, many herbs were sold in tablet form. Herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### tablets can still be found in the marketplace. Tablets have the same advantages as

<!-- chunk -->

### capsules, but they can be harder to digest. Some tablets are made with fillers to

<!-- chunk -->

### bind the herbs together, and these ingredients aren’t always disclosed on the

<!-- chunk -->

### label.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tablets contain powdered herbs mixed with filling agents, binding agents,

<!-- chunk -->

### flowing agents, and disintegration agents. Filling agents are designed to make

<!-- chunk -->

### each tablet the exact same size. A binding agent is an ingredient that holds the

<!-- chunk -->

### tablet together. Sticky botanicals such as slippery elm and acacia gum are

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes used as binding agents. Flowing agents are added to help the herbs go

<!-- chunk -->

### through the numerous manufacturing processes smoothly. Compounds such as

<!-- chunk -->

### magnesium stearate are often used as flowing agents. Most people won’t have

<!-- chunk -->

### issues with magnesium stearate, but some people do seem sensitive to it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Disintegration agents make the tablet dissolve once it is in the digestive

<!-- chunk -->

### system. Corn and potato starch are commonly used as disintegration agents.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cellulose compounds will make the tablet disintegrate after around 15 minutes

<!-- chunk -->

### in a digestive tract. Some mechanisms rely on the pH of the stomach and are

<!-- chunk -->

### therefore dependent on adequate stomach acid for breakdown.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because of the shape, smell, and taste, tablets are often coated with a thin

<!-- chunk -->

### clear vegetable shellac, a color-coded dye substance, or a sugar coating.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tablets are made with high-speed machinery. They are not practical to make at

<!-- chunk -->

### home, but you can mix herbal powders together in the same way you would to

<!-- chunk -->

### form a bolus (see Chapter Eight) and form the mixture into small round balls.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lay the balls on a flat surface and allow them to dry for a few days so that they

<!-- chunk -->

### harden slightly. These herbal pills can be swallowed like tablets. If allowed to

<!-- chunk -->

### thoroughly dry, they will store for a few weeks in an airtight container.

# HERBAL NUT BUTTER BALLS

Herbal nut butter balls, popularized by herbalist Rosemary Gladstar, are a fun way to prepare tonic and nutritive herbs for consumption. Herb balls allow a higher dosage than what you can get from a few capsules or tablets. It’s also a delicious way to prepare herbs for children. 16 ounces (1 pint) almond butter, peanut butter, or other nut butter 1½ cups maple syrup or honey 6–8 ounces powdered herbs ½ cup cocoa powder Chopped nuts, raisins, or shredded coconut (optional) Mix the ingredients together and roll them into balls. Roll the balls in coconut or in cocoa powder to coat them so they are less sticky. Tonic and adaptogenic herbs like maca, astragalus, ashwagandha, ginseng, eleuthero, licorice, ginkgo, hawthorn, reishi, shiitake, and codonopsis all work well in this formula. You can also use herbal spices like cardamom or ginger for flavoring. For even more ideas, look up “Rosemary Gladstar’s Zoom Balls” online, or get her great book Rosemary Gladstar’s Herbal Recipes for Vibrant Health.

# TOPICAL USE OF BULK HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### Always apply herbs as close as possible to the problem. If you have a problem

<!-- chunk -->

### with your toe, put comfrey right on the toe. This simple concept forms the basis

<!-- chunk -->

### for treating many problems, and is often more effective than ingesting an herb

<!-- chunk -->

### and expecting it to act systemically. When herbs don’t work, it is often as much

<!-- chunk -->

### the fault of improper application as it is poor choice of herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are a number of ways to apply herbs to the tissues that need them.

<!-- chunk -->

### Poultices, plasters, suppositories, and more are discussed in Chapter Eight.

# USING MUCILAGINOUS HERBS

Highly mucilaginous herbs are best used in bulk. They do not work well as any form of extract. The water-soluble fibers they contain are known as mucilage, which does not extract in alcohol, vinegar, or oil. Mucilage is water soluble, but it absorbs the water, turning it into a slippery, slimy, unpalatable mass. So, although small amounts can be made into teas, syrups, and glycerites, the herbs simply work better when taken in bulk form. Three popular herbs that fall into this category are slippery elm, marshmallow, and psyllium hulls. Slippery elm is on the United Plant Savers at-risk list, and marshmallow is a fully interchangeable and inexpensive alternative. Taking the bulk powder is the best way to obtain the benefits of marshmallow, because an effective dose is about a heaping teaspoon or more, which is difficult to obtain by taking capsules. Fortunately, its bland, slightly sweet taste is not unpleasant. Marshmallow does not readily mix with water, so it’s easiest to mix it with juice in the blender. For example, add a heaping teaspoon of marshmallow to a cup of apple or orange juice and blend them together. You can drink it right away before the mucilage absorbs the water and turns the liquid slimy. However, if you’re trying to coat an irritated esophagus, let the mixture turn gelatinous before drinking it. Marshmallow may also be mixed with applesauce or a hot cereal such as oatmeal. Another herb that is best used in bulk is psyllium hulls, a bulk laxative. A therapeutic dose can be anywhere from ¼ teaspoon to 2 heaping teaspoons. This makes taking it in capsules impractical. It also is impossible to make an extract of it, again because the mucilage in it is not soluble in alcohol, vinegar, oil, or glycerin. Psyllium rapidly absorbs water, turning into a slimy, gelatinous mass that is not very appealing. The best way to take psyllium is to mix it into a cup of water or juice (apple is the best). Stir it until it becomes suspended, then drink it before it has a chance to gel. When taking psyllium, start with a small amount (¼–½ teaspoon) and then work up to 1–2 teaspoons daily. Psyllium can also be blended with other herbs. See the Gentle Fiber Blend in Chapter Twelve for directions on making your own. Photo by Thinkstock

## CHAPTER FIVE

# Introduction to Extractions

<!-- chunk -->

## TERMS, EQUIPMENT, SOLVENTS, AND CALCULATIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### his chapter covers the basic terms associated with extracting herbs, the

<!-- chunk -->

### equipment you’ll need, how to determine which solvent you should use, and

<!-- chunk -->

### how to determine potency.

# EXTRACTION TERMS

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbalism has its own unique language. It is the language of our art, and like

<!-- chunk -->

### many professions that use jargon, it invokes a bit of nostalgia and appreciation

<!-- chunk -->

### for the rich history of herbalism. Many of the terms we use in herbal medicine

<!-- chunk -->

### making date back to ancient times and are part of a rich heritage that teaches us

<!-- chunk -->

### how to turn crude plant material into effective herbal medicines. Here are some

<!-- chunk -->

### of the important terms to know.

<!-- chunk -->

## Garbling is the process of removing stems, diseased plant parts, and critters

<!-- chunk -->

### from freshly harvested plant material. This improves the quality of the medicine

<!-- chunk -->

### being made. Try it by yourself with good music playing in the background and

<!-- chunk -->

### you might find that magical Zen-like state that just seems to make everything

<!-- chunk -->

### better.

<!-- chunk -->

## Menstruum or solvent: Menstruum is an old alchemical term for a substance

<!-- chunk -->

### that dissolves a solid or holds it in suspension. The modern scientific term is

<!-- chunk -->

### solvent. Although many herbalists confine the term “menstruum” to alcohol

<!-- chunk -->

### extractions, technically anything that you use as a solution to extract the herbs is

<!-- chunk -->

### a menstruum, including water, alcohol, glycerin, vinegar, and simple syrups.

<!-- chunk -->

### Menstruums are measured in fluid volume. The choice to use metric units (liters,

<!-- chunk -->

### milliliters), fluid ounces, or the more standard US measures (cups, pints, quarts)

<!-- chunk -->

### is a personal one. Choose one and stick with it.

<!-- chunk -->

## Marc is the solid matter (plant material) in your preparation. This marc is mixed

<!-- chunk -->

### with the menstruum for extraction. After the extraction process, the plant

<!-- chunk -->

### material is called the exhausted marc. Marc is measured by weight. Again, you

<!-- chunk -->

### can use metric or US measures; just make sure you use the same standard of

<!-- chunk -->

### measurement for the marc that you’re using for the menstruum.

<!-- chunk -->

## Solubility is the ability of the menstruum to extract various constituents from a

<!-- chunk -->

### plant into a liquid form. Solubility depends on many factors, including the

<!-- chunk -->

### polarity (electrical charge) of the substance, pH, temperature, and the presence

<!-- chunk -->

### of other constituents or compounds in the plant. Solubility is difficult to

<!-- chunk -->

### determine, but herbalists have the cumulative experience of other herbalists as

<!-- chunk -->

### well as some science to determine the best solvents for particular plants. We’ll

<!-- chunk -->

### cover this in greater detail later in this chapter.

<!-- chunk -->

## Maceration is a way to make tinctures. Macerating herbs means you soak the

<!-- chunk -->

### marc in the menstruum for a set period of time that varies from process to

<!-- chunk -->

### process. Maceration allows the menstruum to become saturated with constituents

<!-- chunk -->

### from the marc.

<!-- chunk -->

## The maceration container is a leak-proof container, usually glass but

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes stainless steel, that is used in the maceration process. Glass canning

<!-- chunk -->

### jars are commonly used by home medicine makers. They come in a wide

<!-- chunk -->

### assortment of sizes (half pints, pints, quarts, and even half gallons) and are

<!-- chunk -->

### relatively inexpensive. When using mason jars place a single layer of parchment

<!-- chunk -->

### paper between the lid and jar to keep your extract from interacting with the metal

<!-- chunk -->

### in the lid. Many solvents can cause metal corrosion, which will adversely affect

<!-- chunk -->

### your extract.

<!-- chunk -->

## Succussion is an old word for shaking. Maceration extracts are succussed to

<!-- chunk -->

### ensure complete contact between the marc and the menstruum. In dry herb

<!-- chunk -->

### macerations, succussion is an essential part of the process. Agitation moves

<!-- chunk -->

### particles that clump at the bottom of the container back into contact with the

<!-- chunk -->

### menstruum. Succussion isn’t normally required for fresh herb macerations; the

<!-- chunk -->

### high-proof alcohol used in fresh plant preparations dehydrates the plant cells,

<!-- chunk -->

### pulling all of the constituents out of the plant and into solution.

<!-- chunk -->

## Decanting is the process of pouring off the menstruum from one container to

<!-- chunk -->

### another, often through a filtering cloth or paper, without disturbing the sediment

<!-- chunk -->

### at the bottom of the container.

<!-- chunk -->

## Precipitation occurs when solid particles fall out of solution in a tincture or

<!-- chunk -->

### extract. This most commonly occurs when a tincture hasn’t been filtered

<!-- chunk -->

### properly, or when the extract is exposed to light or drastic temperature changes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Precipitation will occur in most tinctures as they age, but if you’ve made the

<!-- chunk -->

### tincture or extract properly, it should not occur for many years. Mild

<!-- chunk -->

### precipitation can be fixed by decanting the tincture into a clean container. If

<!-- chunk -->

### massive precipitation occurs along with a change in color or taste, it’s time to

<!-- chunk -->

### discard the tincture and start again.

# MEDICINE-MAKING EQUIPMENT

<!-- chunk -->

### In order to make herbal medicines, you’ll need some equipment. Here are the

<!-- chunk -->

### items we recommend.

<!-- chunk -->

## Jars. You will need jars—lots of them—if you get into medicine making. An

<!-- chunk -->

### assortment of mason jars is helpful: half pint, pint, and quart jars are all most

<!-- chunk -->

### home medicine makers need. If you’re making medicine for an herbal practice,

<!-- chunk -->

### invest in half-gallon mason jars. One-gallon pickle jars work nicely for larger

<!-- chunk -->

### batches of tinctures. Gallon mason jars are no longer manufactured but can be

<!-- chunk -->

### found occasionally on eBay.

<!-- chunk -->

## Rubber spatulas in an assortment of sizes will help get every last bit of

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine out of your jars.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mortar and pestle. Although this seems like an antiquated tool, a mortar and

<!-- chunk -->

### pestle still comes in handy in medicine making. Most of the small marble sets

<!-- chunk -->

### are appropriate for displays and powdering small amounts of resins like myrrh.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can use larger sets to powder small batches of tea concentrates. (They are

<!-- chunk -->

### also good for powdering small amounts of whole spices for cooking.) If you

<!-- chunk -->

### have to powder roots and barks by hand, a tall cylindrical mortar and pestle is

<!-- chunk -->

### best.

<!-- chunk -->

### Every herbalist should powder a pound of burdock root with a mortar and

<!-- chunk -->

### pestle at least once in their life, just for the experience. Okay, maybe not a whole

<!-- chunk -->

### pound, but it’s well worth it to learn how to use a mortar and pestle to powder

<!-- chunk -->

### small batches of herbs as part of the experience of making your own medicines.

<!-- chunk -->

## Coffee grinders are the home herbalist’s best friend when it comes to powdering

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs. Buy them new or get them cheaply at thrift stores. They have to be

<!-- chunk -->

### babysat while you use them, and even then they don’t last for a long time, but

<!-- chunk -->

### that’s better than spending thousands of dollars on a commercia l herb grinder.

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamix. A Vitamix with a dry blade is even better than a coffee grinder. The

<!-- chunk -->

### adjustable-speed Vitamix has been around since about 1995, and although the

<!-- chunk -->

### look changes every few years, the motor stays the same. The dry blade container

<!-- chunk -->

### makes quick work of all but the hardest roots. The old-school Vitamix 3600 with

<!-- chunk -->

### the metal containers can grind hard roots, but can’t powder as well as the models

<!-- chunk -->

### that support a dry blade container. The 3600 model is wonderful for making

<!-- chunk -->

### fresh plant extracts. In a pinch you can put your plant material and alcohol into a

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamix, leave it running for an hour, and produce a passable tincture. (The

<!-- chunk -->

### constant agitation speeds up the maceration process, and the heat from the motor

<!-- chunk -->

### produces a hot ethanol extract.) The new Vitamix models have polycarbonate

<!-- chunk -->

### containers, which tend to get scratched by hard herbs. Keep one container

<!-- chunk -->

### dedicated to herb grinding and another for food.

<!-- chunk -->

### Both the newer and older models can be found on eBay for $60–$150. At one

<!-- chunk -->

### time, Vitamix 3600 metal containers were produced without the juice spout, but

<!-- chunk -->

### they are impossible to find now. Disassemble and clean the juice spout after each

<!-- chunk -->

### use to prevent cross-contamination of herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

## Strainers and filters in a variety of sizes are essential to good medicine making.

<!-- chunk -->

### Winco makes a stainless steel 8-inch bouillon strainer that can be found on

<!-- chunk -->

### Amazon for $23. After an initial straining with a fine mesh strainer, pour the

<!-- chunk -->

### tincture through an unbleached paper coffee filter or two. Don’t get cone filters

<!-- chunk -->

### with glued bottoms; the glue might be soluble in high-proof alcohol. Place the

<!-- chunk -->

### coffee filters, or lab filter paper if you must, into the cone strainer to filter.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can also filter with paint strainer bags, available at most hardware stores,

<!-- chunk -->

### or with muslin tea bags. In either case, suspend the bag from the mouth of a jar.

<!-- chunk -->

### The lid band for the canning jar will fit snugly over the bags to hold them in

<!-- chunk -->

### place. Extra-fine gold mesh coffee filters are also nice, and can be reused much

<!-- chunk -->

### longer than cotton bag filters. Extracts made with cut and sifted herbs can be

<!-- chunk -->

### strained using several layers of unbleached, natural cheesecloth or organic cotton

<!-- chunk -->

### or flannel cloth. Don’t use stainless or gold mesh filters to strain resinous herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is exceedingly difficult to clean a metal mesh filter that was used to filter

<!-- chunk -->

### boswellia gum.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mixing bowls. A dedicated set of stainless steel or glass bowls in a variety of

<!-- chunk -->

### sizes is essential. We prefer the stainless steel bowls with a pour spout, but even

<!-- chunk -->

### plastic bowls will work in a pinch.

<!-- chunk -->

## Herb press. An herb press isn’t necessary for the beginning herbalist or home

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine maker, but if you make medicines long enough you’ll tire of squeezing

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs by hand, which is time-consuming and inefficient, and leaves a lot of good

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine behind in the marc.

<!-- chunk -->

### A potato ricer is a nice starting herb press, and is much cheaper than most herb

<!-- chunk -->

### presses. Keep the batch size fairly small to avoid overexertion and cursing. The

<!-- chunk -->

### Norpro 469 Deluxe Cast Aluminum Jumbo Potato Ricer is the one we use.

<!-- chunk -->

### We’ve only broken one between us, and that took years of use. It is well worth

<!-- chunk -->

### the $30.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are pressing batches of herbs larger than a quart, and you can afford it,

<!-- chunk -->

### upgrade to a good hydraulic or screw press. One of the best herb presses is an

<!-- chunk -->

### 1890s Enterprise sausage stuffer, wine press, and cider press. It’s more effective

<!-- chunk -->

### than most of the herb presses available on the market, and it looks really cool.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Enterprise name has changed to Chop-Rite and they still make replacement

<!-- chunk -->

### parts for the old models, which can be found on eBay for $150–$300, and you

<!-- chunk -->

### can find them at garage sales and flea markets for a lot less.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you know how to weld, you can modify a 1-ton hydraulic ball bearing press

<!-- chunk -->

### into an herb press for less than $200. That’s a lot cheaper than the thousands-of-

<!-- chunk -->

### dollars hydraulic herb presses that are sold commercially. Large hydraulic

<!-- chunk -->

### presses are not efficient for batches that are smaller than 5 gallons.

<!-- chunk -->

## Scale. Buy a scale that measures in grams in addition to ounces and pounds. For

<!-- chunk -->

### the average herbalist a $20 kitchen scale from a big box store is as accurate as

<!-- chunk -->

### you need. To be more precise, buy a triple beam scale with a big basket, or buy a

<!-- chunk -->

### 100-gram tester weight to make sure your scale is balanced.

<!-- chunk -->

## A digital thermometer helps manage temperatures for oil extracts or when

<!-- chunk -->

### cooking off alcohol from glycerin extracts. If you have the budget, get an

<!-- chunk -->

### infrared thermometer; if not, a digital candy thermometer works well.

<!-- chunk -->

## Measuring cups are helpful when making weight-to-volume extracts. Graduated

<!-- chunk -->

### cylinders are great when you need precise measurements. Glass graduated

<!-- chunk -->

### cylinders look good on shelves, but the first time you break a $40 Pyrex cylinder

<!-- chunk -->

### you’ll invest in a few cheap polypropylene ones (the solvent only comes into

<!-- chunk -->

### contact with the plastic momentarily). You can get a seven-piece polypropylene

<!-- chunk -->

### set with cylinders ranging from 10 to 1,000 milliliters for less than $35 from

<!-- chunk -->

### Amazon or a lab supply store.

<!-- chunk -->

## Funnels in a variety of sizes are helpful in pouring liquid extracts and powders

<!-- chunk -->

### from container to container. Canning funnels are great, and you can check out

<!-- chunk -->

### your local automotive or kitchen supply store for a bigger variety of sizes.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dehydrator. Although not essential, a dehydrator is a useful tool for an

<!-- chunk -->

### herbalist. Dehydrators dry small batches of herbs quickly, and can be used to

<!-- chunk -->

### dehydrate herbal extracts to make tea concentrates and fluid extracts. It’s also a

<!-- chunk -->

### wonderful investment if you want to dehydrate food like flaxseed crackers, fruit

<!-- chunk -->

### leathers, kale chips, or jerky.

<!-- chunk -->

### A horizontal dehydrator, like the one pictured here, is a good addition to your

<!-- chunk -->

### apothecary, but even a cheap vertical dehydrator is better than no dehydrator. (A

<!-- chunk -->

### space heater and a fan are not quite as efficient.)

# PICKING A SOLVENT AND EXTRACTION METHOD

<!-- chunk -->

### Throughout history, and especially since the 1600s, herbalists, alchemists, and

<!-- chunk -->

### physicians have been experimenting with various methods of extracting herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the great pioneers of this science was John Uri Lloyd (1849–1936), who

<!-- chunk -->

### was widely regarded as the best pharmacist of his time and the maker of the

<!-- chunk -->

### highest-quality herbal extracts in history. Lloyd approached every plant

<!-- chunk -->

### differently, using up to eight solvents on one plant to extract what he considered

<!-- chunk -->

### the essence of the plant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Every menstruum has particular constituents that it extracts effectively and

<!-- chunk -->

### other constituents that it doesn’t extract well. Water is a poor solvent of resins,

<!-- chunk -->

### but a great solvent for carbohydrates; alcohol is a great solvent for many

<!-- chunk -->

### medicinal constituents, but is a poor solvent of mucilage; and glycerin by itself

<!-- chunk -->

### (without heat and water) is a poor solvent of most constituents except volatile

<!-- chunk -->

### oils. Oil and fat can be used as menstruums to make extracts, but these are

<!-- chunk -->

### normally only used externally. Steam and carbon dioxide are used to extract

<!-- chunk -->

### essential oils.

<!-- chunk -->

### Commercial manufacturing and home extractions often use mixtures of

<!-- chunk -->

### menstruums (water, alcohol, glycerin, or vinegar). Standardized extracts may

<!-- chunk -->

### involve the use of chemical solvents to concentrate specific constituents, but that

<!-- chunk -->

### is not necessary for herbal products made at home.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some molecules, like water, are polar. That means that, just as a magnet has a

<!-- chunk -->

### north pole and a south pole, the molecule has a positively charged region and a

<!-- chunk -->

### negatively charged region. This means that polar molecules can attach to both

<!-- chunk -->

### positively charged elements and negatively charged elements. Water is highly

<!-- chunk -->

### polar, which is why it is a nearly universal solvent. On the other hand, a nonpolar

<!-- chunk -->

### molecule will be more electrically neutral and therefore a less-effective solvent.

<!-- chunk -->

### Water and glycerin are polar molecules; water is the most polar of the two.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alcohol is also polar and can be used to extract polar constituents when the

<!-- chunk -->

### percentage of alcohol in water is low. A higher alcohol content is better for

<!-- chunk -->

### extracting nonpolar constituents. Fats and oils are nonpolar solvents.

<!-- chunk -->

### Constituents that are best extracted using water, glycerin, or lower percentages

<!-- chunk -->

### of alcohol include carbohydrates (sugars and starches), mucilage and gums, most

<!-- chunk -->

### glycosides, and water-soluble vitamins. Some alkaloids can be extracted with

<!-- chunk -->

### polar substances. Oil and higher percentages of alcohol are better at extracting

<!-- chunk -->

### essential oils, terpenoids, carotenoids, fat-soluble vitamins, lipids, resins, and

<!-- chunk -->

### most alkaloids.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chapter Thirteen lists numerous single herbs and suggests a number of ways

<!-- chunk -->

### to prepare them. Table 2 provides a basic guide to the best extraction medium for

<!-- chunk -->

### the major categories of herbs. The primary constituents of each category of herb

<!-- chunk -->

### are listed in parentheses.

# POTENCIES

<!-- chunk -->

### A critical consideration when extracting any herb is how much liquid to use in

<!-- chunk -->

### proportion to herbs. This ratio depends on how potent you want your

<!-- chunk -->

### preparation. The commonly accepted way to standardize the potency of a

<!-- chunk -->

### formula is to calculate the ratio of the amount of herb to the amount of solvent.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is written with the amount of herb first and the amount of liquid second

<!-- chunk -->

### (1:5).

<!-- chunk -->

## TABLE 2. Basic Categories of Herbs and the Best Solvents

<!-- chunk -->

### Amounts are always measured by weight, not by volume, as the weight of

<!-- chunk -->

### various solvents is different. When measuring water, weight and volume are

<!-- chunk -->

### closely related. One fluid ounce of water weighs about 1 ounce. Sixteen fluid

<!-- chunk -->

### ounces of water (which is 1 pint or 2 cups by volume) weighs about 1 pound (16

<!-- chunk -->

### ounces by weight). The same applies in metrics. One liter of water weighs

<!-- chunk -->

### kilogram, and 100 milliliters of water weighs about 100 kilograms. The exact

<!-- chunk -->

### weight of the water depends on its temperature and other factors, but for home

<!-- chunk -->

### preparations these differences are not critical.

<!-- chunk -->

### As shown in Table 3, alcohol has the same weight-to-volume relationship as

<!-- chunk -->

### water, but other extraction mediums, such as vinegar, glycerin, and oil, do not.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once again, these differences are not so critical that you can’t measure the

<!-- chunk -->

### liquids by volume.

<!-- chunk -->

## TABLE 4. 1:8 Weight-to-Volume Extraction Ratio

<!-- chunk -->

### Most home preparations are between 1:2 and 1:10 in potency. Table 4 shows

<!-- chunk -->

### the amount of menstruum needed to make a 1:8 potency with various amounts of

<!-- chunk -->

### herb.

<!-- chunk -->

### The strength of the extract depends partially on the density of the herb you are

<!-- chunk -->

### extracting. It is usually easy to make a 1:4 or 1:5 extract of heavy pieces of bark

<!-- chunk -->

### or roots at home. When making a Simpler’s maceration with lighter fresh plant

<!-- chunk -->

### materials like dill weed or chamomile flowers, you’re more likely to end up with

<!-- chunk -->

### a 1:8 or even 1:10 extract, unless you really pack the plant material into your jar.

<!-- chunk -->

### Table 5 shows some standard potencies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ratios are important in determining dosage. A 1:2 extract will be four times

<!-- chunk -->

### stronger than a 1:8 extract, which means you’ll need to take four times more of

<!-- chunk -->

### the 1:8 extract to get the same results as you would taking a 1:2 extract. You can

<!-- chunk -->

### read more about dosages in Chapter Eleven.

<!-- chunk -->

### These guidelines are based on the assumption that you are extracting all of the

<!-- chunk -->

### available constituents from the plant material, but plants vary greatly in their

<!-- chunk -->

### chemical composition. Plants that are wild and plants that are harvested when

<!-- chunk -->

### they are under environmental stress tend to be more chemically active than

<!-- chunk -->

### cultivated plants. Some plant constituents in the same plant can vary by up to

<!-- chunk -->

### 10,000% within a 2-week period. While we advocate using weight-to-volume

<!-- chunk -->

### ratios to help determine potency, we also suggest tasting tinctures and extracts

<!-- chunk -->

### and comparing them to previous batches. You might also compare them to

<!-- chunk -->

### commercial extracts or to the extracts of other herbalists. Assess the taste, smell,

<!-- chunk -->

### texture, and visual appearance of each preparation to determine its potency.

# WORKING WITH ALCOHOL

<!-- chunk -->

### Different herbs extract better in different percentages of alcohol. Proof is a

<!-- chunk -->

### measurement of the percentage of alcohol in an alcoholic solution and is double

<!-- chunk -->

### the percentage of alcohol: 80 proof is 40% alcohol, and 160 proof is 80%

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most home tinctures are made with a weak solution of 40% alcohol like

<!-- chunk -->

### brandy. Some herbs need to be extracted with a higher alcohol content. A

<!-- chunk -->

### moderate-strength solution can be made with 60% alcohol, and a strong solution

<!-- chunk -->

### with 80% alcohol.

<!-- chunk -->

### The strongest alcohol solution commonly available is grain alcohol (the brand

<!-- chunk -->

### Everclear is the most widely available), which is usually 190 proof or 95%

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol. You can purchase large quantities (55 gallons) of organic cane or grape

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol for about the same price as Everclear. Consider going in with other

<!-- chunk -->

### herbalists and splitting an order. Organic cane or grape alcohol has a smoother

<!-- chunk -->

### taste and a more pleasant action than grain alcohol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unless you are making a fresh plant extract, 95% alcohol needs to be diluted

<!-- chunk -->

### to reach the desired concentration. If you have 95% alcohol and need 40%

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol, put 40 parts of alcohol in a container and add enough water to make

<!-- chunk -->

### parts. (A part is any volume of liquid measurement that you choose, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### fluid ounce.) To dilute 95% alcohol to 60%, put 60 parts of alcohol in a container

<!-- chunk -->

### and add enough water to make 95 parts. Tables 6, 7, and 8 will help you with

<!-- chunk -->

### these conversions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now that we’ve gotten all the technical stuff out of the way, we can get to the

<!-- chunk -->

### fun part: Making your own herbal extracts.

<!-- chunk -->

### aking your own herbal extracts is enjoyable and educational. The process

<!-- chunk -->

### of extracting herbs will teach you a lot about different kinds of herbs and

<!-- chunk -->

### help you understand how to use them better. You’ll learn how to use your own

<!-- chunk -->

### senses to understand the effects herbs have on the body, especially if you taste

<!-- chunk -->

### what you make during the process (like a good chef does with her food).

<!-- chunk -->

### The key to making good extracts is to start with high-quality plant material.

<!-- chunk -->

### You don’t have to start with fresh plants to make high-quality extracts, but you

<!-- chunk -->

### can’t make good extracts out of a bag of 5-year-old, dried-out, cheap, imported

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs either. Use only reputable suppliers, or look for independent herbalists

<!-- chunk -->

### who sell or barter cultivated or wildcrafted plants from their region. Check out

<!-- chunk -->

### Appendix Two for companies that sell high-quality herbs and for groups that

<!-- chunk -->

### facilitate the swapping or selling of herbs from independent bioregional

<!-- chunk -->

### herbalists.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once you have the plant material you need, you can turn it into liquid extracts

<!-- chunk -->

### using a variety of solvents and extraction methods.

# WATER-BASED EXTRACTIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### Water extraction is the oldest and most basic method for making herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine.

# INFUSIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal teas are easy to make and are a good start to learning to use herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### remedies. A hot or cold infusion can be made from fresh, dried, or powdered

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs. An infusion is sometimes called a tisane, which is a French word for tea.

<!-- chunk -->

### Teas are cheap, simple, and effective, and require only a short time to prepare.

<!-- chunk -->

### Infusions are a pleasant way to take some herbs, but are less palatable when

<!-- chunk -->

### the herb has a disagreeable flavor. Many constituents, especially the more bitter

<!-- chunk -->

### and astringent principles, are not released into the water in a simple tea but need

<!-- chunk -->

### to be extracted by more potent infusions or decoctions. Aromatic principles are

<!-- chunk -->

### lost if the container is left uncovered while the herbs are steeping.

<!-- chunk -->

### Infusions are used for topical applications as rinses, compresses, and foot

<!-- chunk -->

### soaks. An infusion may have a single ingredient or many. It may be taken hot or

<!-- chunk -->

### cold, inhaled as a vapor, used to perfume a pillow, or enjoyed in a bath.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hot Infusion

<!-- chunk -->

### Hot infusions are best for leaves and flowers whose medicinal properties,

<!-- chunk -->

### including vitamins and volatile oils, are easily released into water. To make a hot

<!-- chunk -->

### infusion, pour boiled water (boil water, take off the heat, and wait 30 seconds)

<!-- chunk -->

### over the herb. Cover the container. Use a canning jar, a covered pan, or a china,

<!-- chunk -->

### glass, or enamel teapot, and the purest water you can get. Let the infusion steep

<!-- chunk -->

### for at least 15 minutes, depending on the desired strength (see below), then strain

<!-- chunk -->

### the infusion into a cup. Drink it lukewarm or cool, but take it hot to break up a

<!-- chunk -->

### cold or cough. Teas can be sweetened with honey or raw sugar, or flavored with

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs such as lemon verbena or spearmint. Make infusions fresh each day, or

<!-- chunk -->

### refrigerate unused tea for up to three days.

<!-- chunk -->

### Water with a high lime content (very hard water) can impede the extraction of

<!-- chunk -->

### active constituents. Adding a little vinegar or lemon juice will help with the

<!-- chunk -->

### extraction of alkaloidal bitters, such as plants with berberine, or minerals like

<!-- chunk -->

### calcium.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some herbs take up more space than others and have to be packed down into

<!-- chunk -->

### the steeping container. The more surface area that is exposed, the more potent

<!-- chunk -->

### the tea, so don’t be afraid to chop the herb finely or even powder it before

<!-- chunk -->

### making tea.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most people steep tea a few minutes. This isn’t enough time when using

<!-- chunk -->

### plants for medicines. Here are the different steeping times depending on what

<!-- chunk -->

### strength you need.

<!-- chunk -->

## Weak Infusion Use 15 grams of herb per liter of water, or ½ ounce per quart.

<!-- chunk -->

### The steeping time varies depending on what part of the plant is used. Steep

<!-- chunk -->

### leaves for 1 hour, flowers for 30 minutes, crushed seeds for 15 minutes, and bark

<!-- chunk -->

### and roots for 4 hours.

<!-- chunk -->

## Standard Infusion Steep 30 grams of herb in 1 liter of hot water, or 1 ounce per

<!-- chunk -->

### quart, for 30–60 minutes. Strain well, pressing as much water out of the herb as

<!-- chunk -->

### possible, and drink the tea. Use within a day. Cut the formula down if you are

<!-- chunk -->

### drinking less than a liter of tea daily; use 15 grams of herb to 500 milliliters of

<!-- chunk -->

### water (½ ounce per pint).

<!-- chunk -->

### This medicinal infusion represents about 1 gram of herb for every ounce of tea

<!-- chunk -->

### and is much stronger than normal tea. In most cases, the required dose is

<!-- chunk -->

### significantly less than a whole cup, which is wonderful for those not-so-pleasant-

<!-- chunk -->

### tasting teas.

<!-- chunk -->

## Strong Infusion Make as a standard infusion and steep for 8 hours.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cold Infusion

<!-- chunk -->

### A cold infusion is best for herbs with highly volatile constituents, or constituents

<!-- chunk -->

### that are damaged by heat. Soak 15 grams of herb in 1 liter of cold water (½

<!-- chunk -->

### ounce per quart) for 8–12 hours. Strain and drink. Make a fresh infusion daily.

# DECOCTIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### When your medicinal plant is tough, as in the bark, roots, rhizomes, seeds, nuts,

<!-- chunk -->

### or woody stems, you need to use the decoction method to extract the plant

<!-- chunk -->

### constituents. Decoct green plant parts if you are trying to extract mineral salts. A

<!-- chunk -->

### decoction is like a tea, except that the herb is simmered in water until some of

<!-- chunk -->

### the liquid has evaporated. Simmering evaporates volatile principles, so the

<!-- chunk -->

### decoction method is not a good technique for aromatic herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Like infusions, decoctions may contain one ingredient or many. They may be

<!-- chunk -->

### ingested hot or cold or applied externally. Make decoctions fresh daily and

<!-- chunk -->

### refrigerate unused tea. A decoction should keep for up to 3 days in the

<!-- chunk -->

### refrigerator.

<!-- chunk -->

## Standard Decoction

<!-- chunk -->

### Put 30 grams of herb and 1 liter of water (1 ounce per quart) in a pot, cover, and

<!-- chunk -->

### bring to a low simmer for 10–20 minutes. Turn off the heat and steep for an

<!-- chunk -->

### additional hour.

<!-- chunk -->

## Strong Decoction

<!-- chunk -->

### Place 30 grams of herb and 1 liter of water (1 ounce per quart) in a pot, cover,

<!-- chunk -->

### and bring to a low simmer until the water is reduced by half.

<!-- chunk -->

## Southern Decoction

<!-- chunk -->

### Place 30 grams of herb and 2 liters of water (1 ounce per 2 quarts) in a pot.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bring to a low simmer for 4 or more hours, until there is about 500 milliliters

<!-- chunk -->

### (about 1 pint) of fluid remaining.

<!-- chunk -->

### This process allows most volatile oils to escape while extracting more mineral

<!-- chunk -->

### salts, creating a tea with a different medicinal action than standard teas.

# SYRUPS (ELECTUARIES)

<!-- chunk -->

### A syrup is a water extract that is preserved with a sweetener, typically honey or

<!-- chunk -->

### raw sugar. Most syrups are made by simmering the herbs in a mixture of 50%

<!-- chunk -->

### water and 50% sweetener and straining the syrup for use.

<!-- chunk -->

### Syrups keep longer than water extracts, because the sugar preserves the

<!-- chunk -->

### extraction. The sweet taste covers the nasty flavor of many herbs, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### dandelion, white pine bark, poplar bark, or raw garlic. Try medicinal syrups for

<!-- chunk -->

### anyone who cannot or will not tolerate bitter or strong flavors.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sweeteners

<!-- chunk -->

## Honey is a natural sweetener with proven antibiotic and antiseptic properties.

<!-- chunk -->

### Honey is a combination of sugars produced from nectar by the enzyme invertase,

<!-- chunk -->

### which is found in the bodies of bees. Honey contains about 40% fructose, 31%

<!-- chunk -->

### glucose, 18% water, 9% other sugars, and 2% sucrose. The flavor varies

<!-- chunk -->

### depending on the flower source. Honey contains all the vitamins and enzymes

<!-- chunk -->

### necessary for the proper metabolism and digestion of glucose and other sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### molecules. Honey is about 50% sweeter than table sugar, which means that ¾

<!-- chunk -->

### cup honey adds the same sweetness to a formula as 1 cup sugar. Do not give

<!-- chunk -->

### syrups made with honey to children under the age of one.

<!-- chunk -->

## Maple syrup is a natural sweetener made by boiling the sap of maple trees. It

<!-- chunk -->

### contains primarily sucrose, the same type of sugar as raw sugar. Maple syrup

<!-- chunk -->

### contains significant amounts of manganese and moderate but notable amounts of

<!-- chunk -->

### zinc. Pure maple syrup is expensive, but makes an excellent medicinal syrup

<!-- chunk -->

### base.

<!-- chunk -->

## Raw sugar. Syrups can be made using natural sugars like raw sugar, yellow D

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar, or freeze-dried sugarcane juice (Sucanat). These sugars are not as sweet as

<!-- chunk -->

### honey and do not have the same medicinal benefits, but they add their own

<!-- chunk -->

### flavor to the syrup, which may improve the taste of some preparations. Refined

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar is the ultimate naked carbohydrate, stripped of all nutritional benefits, and

<!-- chunk -->

### should be avoided when making syrups if raw sugar, honey, or maple syrup is

<!-- chunk -->

### available.

<!-- chunk -->

## Making a Syrup

<!-- chunk -->

## Standard Method Mix sweetener and water in equal parts by heating the mixture

<!-- chunk -->

### slightly. Add the plant material at a ratio of 1:5, or 20% of the volume of liquid

<!-- chunk -->

### by weight. To make 1 pint syrup (16 fluid ounces), mix 1 cup water (8 fluid

<!-- chunk -->

### ounces) and 1 cup raw sugar or honey (8 fluid ounces). Add about 3.2 ounces

<!-- chunk -->

### (20% of 16 ounces) of herbs. Bring the mixture to a boil, then turn the heat down

<!-- chunk -->

### low and simmer, covered, for 20–30 minutes. Strain the herbs and bottle the

<!-- chunk -->

### syrup.

<!-- chunk -->

## Simple Method Make a strong infusion or decoction of the herbs. Measure the

<!-- chunk -->

### volume of the decoction or infusion and add an equal amount of honey or raw

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar.

# FRESH BERRY SYRUP

Heat fresh berries (such as elder berries, bilberries, hawthorn berries, or rose hips) in just enough water to soften the berries, then press the berries and water through a jelly bag to express the juice, as you would do for making jelly. Measure the amount of berry juice and add an equal amount of honey or raw sugar. This syrup can be bottled or canned like jelly.

<!-- chunk -->

## Using Syrups

<!-- chunk -->

### Syrups are great for soothing sore throats, coughs, and most digestive upsets.

<!-- chunk -->

### The high sugar content makes them unsuitable for treating chronic fatigue,

<!-- chunk -->

### nutritive imbalances, or deep-seated chronic disorders like diabetes. Avoid

<!-- chunk -->

### syrups with people who have severe intestinal dysbiosis (an imbalance of gut

<!-- chunk -->

### bacteria that causes gas, bloating, and digestive upset), and use cautiously with

<!-- chunk -->

### hypoglycemia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Doses for syrups are relatively large (from 1 teaspoon to 2 tablespoons). Syrup

<!-- chunk -->

### stores in the refrigerator for up to a month. If the syrup develops an off taste, or

<!-- chunk -->

### if mold appears on the top of the syrup, discard it. To preserve the syrup for a

<!-- chunk -->

### longer period, add 20% of an 80-proof alcohol like brandy or rum. Syrups with

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol added will last for a year or more when refrigerated or canned.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are several formulas for syrups in Chapter Twelve.

# ALCOHOL EXTRACTIONS (TINCTURES)

<!-- chunk -->

### Water preparations have limited shelf life. To make liquid preparations with a

<!-- chunk -->

### longer shelf life, you need to use a menstruum that has preservative actions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alcohol has been used to make herbal extracts for thousands of years. The

<!-- chunk -->

### chemical analysis of residue found in clay pots in China confirms that a

<!-- chunk -->

### fermented drink made of honey, hawthorn berry, and grape was being produced

<!-- chunk -->

### between 7000 and 5600 BCE. At around the same time, barley beer and grape

<!-- chunk -->

### wine were being made in the Middle East. There is evidence of alcoholic

<!-- chunk -->

### beverages being consumed as far back as 3000 BCE in Egypt and 2000 BCE in

<!-- chunk -->

### the Americas. Research dating back to ancient Mesopotamia suggests that beer

<!-- chunk -->

### preceded bread as a caloric staple and as a way to preserve grains throughout the

<!-- chunk -->

### winter. There is even literature from the Babylonians and Egyptians warning

<!-- chunk -->

### about the ill effects of the overconsumption of alcohol. Ayurvedic texts from

<!-- chunk -->

### India describe the medicinal effects of alcohol and warn of alcohol-induced

<!-- chunk -->

### disease and intoxication.

<!-- chunk -->

### The medicinal effects of alcohol are cataloged in many of the oldest written

<!-- chunk -->

### works. The Bible talked about the medicinal use of wine. The Catholic Church

<!-- chunk -->

### and early Protestant leaders taught that alcohol was a gift from God to be used in

<!-- chunk -->

### moderation for enjoyment and health.

<!-- chunk -->

### In medieval Europe small beer was made and consumed by most households.

<!-- chunk -->

### Water and barley, boiled and then fermented, made a much safer drink than plain

<!-- chunk -->

### water. There are reports of people drinking more than a gallon of small beer

<!-- chunk -->

### daily, which clocks in at around 1% alcohol by volume.

<!-- chunk -->

### The use of wine as medicine was mentioned in Sima Qian’s biography of Bian

<!-- chunk -->

### Que, a Chinese doctor in the fifth century BCE. It is not known if Bian Que used

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs in the making of wine, or if he assigned energetics to different varieties of

<!-- chunk -->

### wine in a manner similar to that of traditional Chinese food theory. According to

<!-- chunk -->

### the Yellow Emperor’s Classic, written between 475 and 221 BCE, medicinal

<!-- chunk -->

### wines were made by fermenting herbs along with the fruit. It wasn’t until the

<!-- chunk -->

### Qing dynasty in the 1600s that tincturing and infusing wines with medicinal

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs became commonplace.

# HERBAL BEERS AND WINES

<!-- chunk -->

### Historically, bittering agents and flavorings (gruit) used in beers varied

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout the world. Households and geographic areas had favorite

<!-- chunk -->

### combinations of herbs that provided taste and helped with the preservation of the

<!-- chunk -->

### drink. Gruit typically consisted of a number of medicinal herbs, including sweet

<!-- chunk -->

### gale, yarrow, mugwort, ground ivy, and spruce tips.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herb-infused wines have been used in the Western world at least since

<!-- chunk -->

### Hippocrates. They played a big role in materia medicas prior to the seventeenth

<!-- chunk -->

### century, when distillation became more common. In our opinion, medicinal

<!-- chunk -->

### wines should play a bigger role in modern herbalism than they currently do.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is a wine formula under wild cherry in Chapter Thirteen.

# DISTILLATION

<!-- chunk -->

### Distillation vessels have been found dating back to the first century CE, but most

<!-- chunk -->

### experts think that they were used in the distillation experiments of alchemy

<!-- chunk -->

### rather than to distill alcohol or volatile oils. The discovery of alcohol distillation

<!-- chunk -->

### is a topic of contention. There is some evidence that the Chinese invented it, and

<!-- chunk -->

### other evidence that it was the Italians or Greeks. Most experts believe that the

<!-- chunk -->

### Arabians invented alcohol distillation. The Persian alchemist Jābir ibn Hayyān is

<!-- chunk -->

### credited with inventing the alembic, the precursor to the pot still; and the great

<!-- chunk -->

### physician Ibn Sīnā (Avicenna) refined distillation by adding the cooling coil. It

<!-- chunk -->

### was the German Albertus Magnus (1193–1280) who first clearly described the

<!-- chunk -->

### process for manufacturing distilled spirits.

<!-- chunk -->

### Distillation and the concentrated alcohol it produced spread slowly in

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine. Herbalists administered herbs as decoctions and wine infusions until

<!-- chunk -->

### the thirteenth century, when Spanish alchemists Arnold of Villanova and

<!-- chunk -->

### Raymond Lully introduced aqua vitae (water of life, otherwise known as brandy)

<!-- chunk -->

### as a solvent in European medicine. In the sixteenth century, Paracelsus

<!-- chunk -->

### popularized the use of distilled alcohol as a solvent to prepare tinctures. At this

<!-- chunk -->

### point brandy contained at most 70% alcohol. In the early nineteenth century,

<!-- chunk -->

### Aeneas Coffey invented the continuous column still, which led to the production

<!-- chunk -->

### of 94–96% ethanol.

# DRIED HERB TINCTURES (MACERATIONS)

<!-- chunk -->

### The most common way of making a tincture is by soaking an herb in a solution

<!-- chunk -->

### of alcohol and water for 14 days or more. This process is called maceration.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most maceration extracts are done as a cold process, meaning they do not

<!-- chunk -->

### require heat.

<!-- chunk -->

### Standard tinctures are made using a weight-to-volume ratio of 1:5 with dried

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs. A quart jar will hold about 150 grams of plant material with 750 milliliters

<!-- chunk -->

### of menstruum. The percentage of alcohol used depends on the plant and the

<!-- chunk -->

### constituents you are trying to extract. For most dry plants an alcohol content of

<!-- chunk -->

### 40–60% is best. The two most common choices for home medicine making are

<!-- chunk -->

### 40% alcohol vodka and brandy and 50% alcohol vodka. Note that the proof is

<!-- chunk -->

### double the percentage of alcohol, so 40% alcohol is 80 proof. In many cases it is

<!-- chunk -->

### more cost effective to buy 190-proof alcohol (95% EtOH) such as Everclear and

<!-- chunk -->

### dilute it with water to the appropriate percentage, as described in Chapter Five.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some herbs require a higher alcohol percentage than others. Resins and gums

<!-- chunk -->

### should be macerated in 90% alcohol to extract constituents, whereas glycoside-

<!-- chunk -->

### containing herbs like soapwort, mullein, or licorice, or a tannin-containing herb

<!-- chunk -->

### such as witch hazel, might require only 25% alcohol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Keep the maceration in a dark place. Shake the jar daily for 2 weeks or more.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pour the liquid out through a muslin cloth and squeeze the marc (herbs) until you

<!-- chunk -->

### have removed as much of the extract as possible. Put the finished tincture in an

<!-- chunk -->

### amber bottle or other dark container to protect it from degradation by light.

# FRESH PLANT TINCTURES (MACERATIONS)

<!-- chunk -->

### Fresh plants usually contain significant water content, so most fresh plant

<!-- chunk -->

### tinctures are made with 95% alcohol. High-proof alcohol ruptures the cell walls

<!-- chunk -->

### of plants, bringing the constituents into solution with the alcohol. It is easiest to

<!-- chunk -->

### make a fresh plant tincture by blending the plant material with alcohol in a

<!-- chunk -->

### blender, or you can chop the herb by hand and mix it with alcohol in a jar. Allow

<!-- chunk -->

### the maceration to sit for at least 14 days, then strain and bottle. We have found

<!-- chunk -->

### jars of fresh plant macerations, forgotten in the back of a cabinet for more than

<!-- chunk -->

### years, to be effective medicine. So while 14 days is the minimum time necessary

<!-- chunk -->

### to let a fresh plant maceration sit, the maximum time is whenever you remember

<!-- chunk -->

### to strain the tincture.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you want to make a fresh plant tincture using a lower percentage of alcohol,

<!-- chunk -->

### you will need to figure out the moisture content of the fresh plant material. This

<!-- chunk -->

### is not necessary for home herbalists unless they are making products for

<!-- chunk -->

### commercial sale.

<!-- chunk -->

### To determine the percentage of water in a plant, dry 100 grams of the fresh

<!-- chunk -->

### plant in a dehydrator or oven. Weigh the dried plant material. The difference

<!-- chunk -->

### between the fresh weight and dried weight is the percentage of water content: If

<!-- chunk -->

### the herb weighs 70 grams after drying, the plant material was 30% water.

# USING ALCOHOL WITH OTHER SOLVENTS

<!-- chunk -->

### To get a better extract, you can blend alcohol with other solvents. Adding 10%

<!-- chunk -->

### glycerin to an alcohol tincture helps extract volatile oils and stabilizes tannins. It

<!-- chunk -->

### gives the tincture a more pleasant taste, especially when using high-proof

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol. In plants where the dominant constituents are alkaloids or minerals, add

<!-- chunk -->

### 5% vinegar to extract the constituents more effectively. Add 10% raw sugar or

<!-- chunk -->

### honey to a finished alcohol extract to create an elixir.

# GLYCERIN EXTRACTS (GLYCERITES)

<!-- chunk -->

### Glycerin is an underused menstruum in the herbal world. The sweet taste of

<!-- chunk -->

### glycerin helps to mask bitterness and other disagreeable flavors. Glycerin is a tri-

<!-- chunk -->

### atomic alcohol, not a sugar. This means glycerin does not affect blood sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### levels in healthy people, nor does it cause problems with yeast.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glycerin is a natural component of triglycerides. Fats and oils are composed

<!-- chunk -->

### of three (tri-) fatty acids attached to a molecule of glycerin (-glyceride). The

<!-- chunk -->

### body breaks down fats and oils to fatty acids and glycerin. It reassembles them

<!-- chunk -->

### to make the body’s own fats, or it can metabolize the glycerin and fatty acids for

<!-- chunk -->

### fuel. The conversion of glycerin to glucose produces only carbon dioxide and

<!-- chunk -->

### water.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glycerin is moisturizing, and it is frequently used in soaps, lotions, and

<!-- chunk -->

### creams. It is also a preservative, inhibiting the growth of bacteria and fungi.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because it is sweet, nourishing, and nontoxic, glycerin is the best menstruum to

<!-- chunk -->

### use in herbal extracts for children or adults who cannot use alcohol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glycerin is a polar solvent, but not as polar as water. It does not extract

<!-- chunk -->

### constituents very well unless heat is used during the extraction process, so it is

<!-- chunk -->

### not a good menstruum to use for heat-sensitive herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glycerin is sticky, so it’s not as easy to work with as alcohol. When using it as

<!-- chunk -->

### a menstruum, purchase pure vegetable glycerin that is intended for food use.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glycerin is available from a number of companies that sell bulk herbs and can

<!-- chunk -->

### easily be found on the internet.

# HOW GLYCERITES ARE MADE

<!-- chunk -->

### There are a number of ways to make an herbal glycerite. Here are four methods:

<!-- chunk -->

## Traditional Method

<!-- chunk -->

### Edward Shook, author of Advanced Treatise in Herbology, was a big advocate of

<!-- chunk -->

### glycerites. He made a strong decoction or infusion and added an equal amount of

<!-- chunk -->

### glycerin as a preservative. The resulting mixture is 50% water and 50% glycerin.

<!-- chunk -->

### In our experience, 10% of extracts made this way develop mold on the top.

<!-- chunk -->

### Increasing the glycerin content to 60% prevents mold growth. You can also add

<!-- chunk -->

### 20% of an 80-proof alcohol to a finished glycerite to improve shelf life of a 50%

<!-- chunk -->

### water/50% glycerin preparation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Standard Method

<!-- chunk -->

### Another method for making glycerites is to use the standard method for making

<!-- chunk -->

### syrups, as described earlier in this chapter. Some of the water will simmer off in

<!-- chunk -->

### this process, so start with 55% glycerin and 45% water. Add the herbs to the

<!-- chunk -->

### glycerin–water mixture at a 1:5 ratio. Simmer the herbs for 20–30 minutes, then

<!-- chunk -->

### strain and bottle.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sealed Simmer Glycerites

<!-- chunk -->

### Simmering herbs in a pot, even with the lid on, allows many of the volatile oils

<!-- chunk -->

### in the herbs to escape. To make a sealed simmer glycerite, start with a mixture of

<!-- chunk -->

### 60% glycerin and 40% water. Put the herbs and menstruum into canning jars at

<!-- chunk -->

### the standard 1:5 ratio. For pint jars add 3.33 ounces of herbs, and for quart jars

<!-- chunk -->

### add 6.66 ounces of herbs. If the plant material is dense, round these figures up to

<!-- chunk -->

### 4 ounces of herb for a pint jar and 8 ounces for a quart jar. If the plant material is

<!-- chunk -->

### extremely light and you can’t get the full amount of herb into the jar, pack it no

<!-- chunk -->

### more than three-quarters full.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cover the plant material with the glycerin–water mixture, leaving at least ¼

<!-- chunk -->

### inch of headspace in the jar. Put the canning lid on the jar and put it into a

<!-- chunk -->

### boiling water bath or steam canner. When the water starts to boil (or the steam

<!-- chunk -->

### starts to stream out of the steam canner), start timing the extract. Extract the

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs for a minimum of 15 minutes for leaves and flowers and 30 minutes for

<!-- chunk -->

### denser plant materials like barks and roots. Let the jars cool until they can be

<!-- chunk -->

### safely handled, then strain the contents and bottle them. To use a pressure canner

<!-- chunk -->

### to make glycerites, process the jars at 5 pounds of pressure for 10 minutes for

<!-- chunk -->

### leaves and flowers, and for 15 minutes for barks and roots.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fresh Plant Glycerites

<!-- chunk -->

### Glycerin will extract essential oils in fresh aromatic herbs such as peppermint

<!-- chunk -->

### and lemon balm. Stuff a canning jar completely full of the fresh plant material,

<!-- chunk -->

### leaving about 1 inch of headspace. Fill the jar with a mixture of 70% glycerin

<!-- chunk -->

### and 30% water. Put the canning lid on the jar and seal tightly to prevent the

<!-- chunk -->

### essential oils from escaping. Put the jar in the canner or a boiling-water bath and

<!-- chunk -->

### process in boiling water for about 15 minutes. Allow the jar to become cool to

<!-- chunk -->

### the touch before opening and straining out the herbs. The fragrance and aroma of

<!-- chunk -->

### such extracts are absolutely incredible.

# NOTES ABOUT COMMERCIAL GLYCERITES

<!-- chunk -->

### Alcohol can be used as an intermediate if the active constituents are not water

<!-- chunk -->

### soluble. Some glycerites are made commercially by making standard alcohol

<!-- chunk -->

### tinctures, then drawing off the alcohol using a vacuum and gentle heat. Glycerin

<!-- chunk -->

### is added to make a very strong glycerite preparation. Most of the aromatic

<!-- chunk -->

### qualities of the extract are lost during this process.

# USES AND APPLICATIONS OF GLYCERITES

<!-- chunk -->

### Glycerites are great for children, alcoholics, people whose religious beliefs

<!-- chunk -->

### prohibit the use of alcohol, and people who dislike the taste of alcohol tinctures.

<!-- chunk -->

### We have never seen a glycerite go bad as long as the glycerin content was well

<!-- chunk -->

### above 50% and the product was stored in a cool, dark place. Done properly,

<!-- chunk -->

### glycerites have a shelf life of at least 3 years. Some people refrigerate glycerites

<!-- chunk -->

### just to be safe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glycerin isn’t as strong of a solvent as alcohol. Whereas the dose of tinctures

<!-- chunk -->

### is usually measured in drops, glycerites are taken in teaspoons. Glycerin is more

<!-- chunk -->

### expensive than alcohol, and the large dose makes glycerites more expensive per

<!-- chunk -->

### dose than alcohol tinctures.

# HERBAL VINEGARS

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinegars have been used for five thousand years as flavor enhancers and food

<!-- chunk -->

### preservers. Vinegars help digest heavy foods and high-protein meals and can be

<!-- chunk -->

### used in condiments, relishes, or dressings. The most nutritious vinegars still

<!-- chunk -->

### contain the mother (a mixture of beneficial bacteria and enzymes) in the bottle;

<!-- chunk -->

### they look slightly cloudy.

# HOW VINEGARS ARE MADE

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal vinegars are made with apple cider or wine vinegar as a base. To make

<!-- chunk -->

### culinary vinegars, bruise freshly picked herbs and pack loosely in a jar. Cover

<!-- chunk -->

### with vinegar and cap with an acid-proof lid, or place parchment paper between

<!-- chunk -->

### the mouth of the jar and the metal lid. Set the vinegar in a sunny window and

<!-- chunk -->

### shake daily for 2 weeks. Test for flavor. If it is not strong enough, strain the

<!-- chunk -->

### vinegar and repeat the process with fresh herbs. Store as is or strain through

<!-- chunk -->

### cheesecloth and rebottle. (Add a fresh sprig of the herb to the bottle for

<!-- chunk -->

### identification and visual appeal.) Use culinary vinegars in salad dressings,

<!-- chunk -->

### marinades, gravies, and sauces.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can also make vinegars with fresh berries or flowers. To make a raspberry

<!-- chunk -->

### vinegar, steep 500 grams of raspberries in 1 liter of wine vinegar for 2 weeks,

<!-- chunk -->

### then strain. Berry vinegar can be added to cough remedies or used in gargles for

<!-- chunk -->

### sore throats, and the delightful flavor masks the taste of bitter herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### expectorants. To make floral vinegars, remove the stems and any green or white

<!-- chunk -->

### heels from the petals before steeping. Carnations, clover, elder flowers, lavender,

<!-- chunk -->

### and sweet violets make good vinegars.

<!-- chunk -->

### Medicinal vinegars are made with high-mineral herbs like horsetail, oat straw,

<!-- chunk -->

### alfalfa, nettles, and even eggshells. Vinegar leaches the minerals out of herbs and

<!-- chunk -->

### eggshells, and can be a great addition to a program for bone building.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fire Cider, a traditional remedy for cold and flu, is made using vinegar. See

<!-- chunk -->

### Chapter Twelve for a formula.

# USES AND APPLICATIONS OF VINEGARS

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal vinegars are good for bone building and for use in salads and cooking

<!-- chunk -->

### applications. They help to regulate gut flora and improve function in the

<!-- chunk -->

### digestive tract. Vinegar extracts are generally not as strong as alcohol or glycerin

<!-- chunk -->

### preparations, so they require larger doses. However, they are inexpensive to

<!-- chunk -->

### make and are a great way to incorporate herbs into the diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinegar is used as an addition to some tinctures to acidify the solution, and is

<!-- chunk -->

### particularly useful if you use hard water or if you are trying to extract alkaloids

<!-- chunk -->

### from the herb.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because herbal oils are nearly always intended for topical use, we explain

<!-- chunk -->

### how to extract herbs in fat and oil in Chapter Eight, “Topical Preparations.”


<!-- chunk -->

## CHAPTER SEVEN

# Advanced Extraction Techniques

<!-- chunk -->

## PERCOLATION EXTRACTS, FLUID EXTRACTS, AND

<!-- chunk -->

## SOXHLET EXTRACTS

<!-- chunk -->

### he techniques described in Chapter Six produce reasonably good herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### extracts. In this chapter we’ll cover making more potent extracts, including

<!-- chunk -->

### percolation extracts, fluid extracts, and Soxhlet extracts. All of these techniques

<!-- chunk -->

### require more equipment and setup than macerations and teas, but they are not so

<!-- chunk -->

### technical that you can’t do them at home.

# PERCOLATION EXTRACTS

<!-- chunk -->

### Percolation is the process of passing a solvent (such as alcohol) through plant

<!-- chunk -->

### material. As the solvent drips through coarsely powdered plant material, active

<!-- chunk -->

### constituents of the herb are extracted while inert components of the plant are left

<!-- chunk -->

### behind. Drip coffeemakers are a great example of a percolation extraction. The

<!-- chunk -->

### coffeemaker slowly drips hot water (the solvent) through coffee grounds to

<!-- chunk -->

### produce coffee. Making herbal percolation extracts is a very similar process,

<!-- chunk -->

### usually using a combination of water and alcohol as a solvent.

<!-- chunk -->

### Percolation extracts became popular in the mid-nineteenth century, and

<!-- chunk -->

### directions for making them can be found in older pharmaceutical texts.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbalists favor percolation extracts over regular tinctures for a number of

<!-- chunk -->

### reasons:

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Experience suggests that for many herbs percolation results in a more complete

<!-- chunk -->

### and potent extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Percolation extracts are usually ready in 2 days. Macerations take a minimum

<!-- chunk -->

### of 2 weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Percolations don’t require pressing or straining to extract the liquid.

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Percolations allow greater flexibility in deciding the strength of the extract. If

<!-- chunk -->

### you make a 1:3 percolation and decide that you want more tincture, you can

<!-- chunk -->

### pour fresh menstruum through the herb and turn it into a 1:4 or 1:5 extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are some drawbacks to making percolation extracts. You can’t use this

<!-- chunk -->

### technique to extract gums, resins, or herbs that contain a lot of mucilage; nor can

<!-- chunk -->

### you percolate fresh plant material. Making a percolation extract requires more

<!-- chunk -->

### hands-on time than a regular maceration or tincture.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is difficult to describe the process of percolation in words. In addition to the

<!-- chunk -->

### instructions below, you can watch a video demonstration at our website,

<!-- chunk -->

### modernherbalmedicine.com.

# EQUIPMENT NEEDED

<!-- chunk -->

### To make a percolation extract you will need the following equipment:

<!-- chunk -->

## Percolation cone. Search for “percolation cone” online to find retailers who sell

<!-- chunk -->

### them, or you can make your own. To make a percolation cone, use a glass cutter

<!-- chunk -->

### to cut off the bottom of a thick glass water bottle such as Perrier or San

<!-- chunk -->

### Pelligrino. Keep the screw-top lid so you can control the drip rate of the

<!-- chunk -->

### percolation. You can also use a wine bottle with a silicon stopper and a brass

<!-- chunk -->

### needle valve to control drip rate (instead of the bottle cap).

<!-- chunk -->

## Wide-mouth, half-gallon mason jar. This jar is used to hold the percolation

<!-- chunk -->

### cone and to collect the finished extract.

<!-- chunk -->

## Packing rod. You will need a long instrument with a broad end to tamp down

<!-- chunk -->

### the powdered herbs inside the percolation cone. Wooden dowels (muddlers) and

<!-- chunk -->

### large granite pestles work well.

<!-- chunk -->

## Filter. Use an unbleached coffee filter or cotton balls. These are used on the

<!-- chunk -->

### bottom of the percolation cone to hold the powder inside the cone, and coffee

<!-- chunk -->

### filters are also placed on top of the powdered herbs. Don’t use funnel-style

<!-- chunk -->

### coffee filters, which are glued together at the bottom. If you do, the alcohol will

<!-- chunk -->

### dissolve some of the glue and you’ll wind up with glue in your extract. Cotton

<!-- chunk -->

### balls can be inserted into the neck of the bottle and are the easiest filters to use.

<!-- chunk -->

## Weight. A small weight is needed to hold down the top filter. Marbles work very

<!-- chunk -->

### well for this purpose. Early texts called for washed sand, but we don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### recommend that. Whatever you use for a weight needs to be clean and

<!-- chunk -->

### nonporous.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lid. You will need a lid to cover the top of the percolation cone to prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### evaporation and contamination. A wide-mouth mason jar lid will fit most glass

<!-- chunk -->

### bottles, or you can use a plastic bag secured with rubber bands.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once you have all of these items, assemble the percolation cone as shown.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now it’s time to percolate.

# PREPARING THE PLANT MATERIAL

<!-- chunk -->

### You will need coarsely ground (powdered) dried herb for your percolation. A

<!-- chunk -->

### uniform powder allows the solvent to flow through evenly. If you grind the plant

<!-- chunk -->

### material yourself, pass it through a sieve with at least 30 holes per inch (#30

<!-- chunk -->

### sieve) to get an even powder.

<!-- chunk -->

### In any tincture or extract using dried herbs, some of the solvent will remain in

<!-- chunk -->

### the plant material when you are finished. If you put 1,000 milliliters of solvent

<!-- chunk -->

### into a percolation cone without premoistening, less than 900 milliliters will come

<!-- chunk -->

### out. This throws the weight-to-volume ratio off considerably. Before starting the

<!-- chunk -->

### percolation, you need to moisten the powdered herb with a small amount of

<!-- chunk -->

### menstruum.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are two ways to calculate the amount of solvent needed to moisten the

<!-- chunk -->

### plant material. The first method is to weigh the plant material and add 75% of

<!-- chunk -->

### that weight in solvent. For example, 100 grams of plant material requires

<!-- chunk -->

### milliliters of solvent to moisten it, and 100 ounces of plant material requires

<!-- chunk -->

### fluid ounces of solvent.

<!-- chunk -->

### The second calculation method is more accurate. Pack the powdered plant

<!-- chunk -->

### material into a liquid measuring container to determine its volume, adding a little

<!-- chunk -->

### bit of the herb at a time and tamping it down to ensure it is evenly packed. For

<!-- chunk -->

### instance, 100 grams (or ounces) by weight of plant material might take up

<!-- chunk -->

### milliliters (or fluid ounces) of volume. Add the amount of solvent the herb

<!-- chunk -->

### displaces by volume: In this example, add 120 milliliters or 120 fluid ounces of

<!-- chunk -->

### solvent.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mix all of the menstruum at once. This includes the desired final volume of

<!-- chunk -->

### the tincture plus the amount you calculated to moisten the herb. If you are

<!-- chunk -->

### preparing a 1:5 percolation with 100 ounces of herb, and the herb takes up

<!-- chunk -->

### ounces by volume, you need 500 ounce s plus 120 ounces of total menstruum.

<!-- chunk -->

### Slowly add menstruum to the plant material to moisten it. When the powder is

<!-- chunk -->

### properly moistened, it should be damp enough that it sticks together when you

<!-- chunk -->

### pinch it between your fingers, like wet sand. You can always add more liquid,

<!-- chunk -->

### but if you add too much you’ll have to add more powdered herbs, which will

<!-- chunk -->

### really throw off your calculations. You may end up with menstruum left over

<!-- chunk -->

### from the amount that you calculated; add this to the rest of the menstruum. If

<!-- chunk -->

### you calculated 120 ounces to moisten the herb and only used 100 ounces, add

<!-- chunk -->

### the remaining 20 ounces to the 500 ounces of menstruum that you are using for

<!-- chunk -->

### the percolation. Once the powdered herb is properly moistened, set it aside in an

<!-- chunk -->

### airtight container for 1–12 hours.

# PACKING THE PERCOLATION CONE

<!-- chunk -->

### Once the powdered herb has had time to properly absorb the menstruum, it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### time to prepare the percolation cone.

<!-- chunk -->

### Learning to pack a percolation cone requires practice. Use the cheapest herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### you can find for your first few tries. Licorice root is a good herb to practice with;

<!-- chunk -->

### not only is it inexpensive, but it packs well, and it’s always nice to have on hand.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step one: Put a filter at the bottom of the percolation cone. Many people use a

<!-- chunk -->

### coffee filter cut to size. Putting two organic cotton balls in the neck of the bottle

<!-- chunk -->

### works just as well and it’s a lot easier. After you put the cotton balls in, put your

<!-- chunk -->

### cap on loosely or put your stopper in, leaving your valve open.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step two: Fill the cone with the moistened herb powder. Divide the

<!-- chunk -->

### premoistened plant material into three equal parts. Put the first third of the

<!-- chunk -->

### powder in the cone and tamp it down evenly with the packing rod. Add the

<!-- chunk -->

### second third of the plant material and pack it down, and then add the remaining

<!-- chunk -->

### powder and tamp it down too. This is another skill that you will get better at with

<!-- chunk -->

### practice and experience. Don’t pack the plant material too tight or too loose: too

<!-- chunk -->

### tight and the menstruum won’t be able to get through; too loose and the

<!-- chunk -->

### menstruum won’t flow evenly through the powder.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step three: Cut a coffee filter so that it is slightly larger than the opening to the

<!-- chunk -->

### percolation cone. Set the coffee filter on top of the herb powder to prevent the

<!-- chunk -->

### packed plant material from being disturbed as you pour your menstruum on it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Put the washed weight on top of the filter to hold it in place.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step four: Set the percolation cone in the mason jar or in the stand, and add the

<!-- chunk -->

### menstruum to the cone. Cover the top of the percolation cone with a lid. Allow

<!-- chunk -->

### the menstruum to seep through the plant material and cotton balls so that it drips

<!-- chunk -->

### a few times. Then tighten your cap or close your valve. Letting the menstruum

<!-- chunk -->

### flow all the way through forces out air, and prevents an air bubble from burping

<!-- chunk -->

### up through your packed herb powders. Let this sit (macerate/digest) for 24 hours.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step five: After 24 hours, slightly loosen the cap of the percolation cone to

<!-- chunk -->

### allow a slow, steady drip of menstruum. About 1 drip every 3–5 seconds is ideal.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let the menstruum percolate through the marc until the menstruum stops

<!-- chunk -->

### flowing out of the percolation cone.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step six: Let the extracted liquid sit for 24 hours to allow precipitates to settle to

<!-- chunk -->

### the bottom. Decant the liquid, leaving the precipitates behind, and bottle the

<!-- chunk -->

### finished tincture.

# RE-PERCOLATION AND DUAL PERCOLATIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### Some of the old pharmacy texts recommend running the finished tincture back

<!-- chunk -->

### through the plant material a second time. This dual extract throws the weight-to-

<!-- chunk -->

### volume ratio off slightly and there isn’t a good formula to account for the

<!-- chunk -->

### difference. Dual extraction seems to increase the potency of the extract for many

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs, but doesn’t make a difference with others. Experiment and decide for

<!-- chunk -->

### yourself if these extra steps are worth it.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step seven: Once all of the menstruum has run through the percolation cone, set

<!-- chunk -->

### the extracted liquid aside in a covered container and put the percolation cone

<!-- chunk -->

### into a fresh mason jar. Remove the cap at the bottom of the cone and slowly pour

<!-- chunk -->

### boiled water through the cone. When the liquid dripping out of the cone is clear

<!-- chunk -->

### and tasteless, remove the cone and set it aside.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step eight: Put the water extract that percolated through the cone into a stainless

<!-- chunk -->

### steel or enamel pot. Simmer over low heat until the liquid is reduced by 90% of

<!-- chunk -->

### its original volume (1,000 milliliters of water extract would be reduced to

<!-- chunk -->

### milliliters, or 100 fluid ounces to 10 fluid ounces).

<!-- chunk -->

## Step nine: Add the concentrated water extract back to the original percolation

<!-- chunk -->

### extract and mix them together. Let the mixture sit for 24 hours, then decant the

<!-- chunk -->

### liquid, leaving the precipitates behind. Bottle the finished tincture.

# FLUID EXTRACTS

<!-- chunk -->

### Fluid extracts are tinctures that are concentrated to a ratio of 1:1. They are made

<!-- chunk -->

### by percolation, with some added steps.

<!-- chunk -->

### To make a fluid extract, use the standard 1:5 weight-to-volume ratio but

<!-- chunk -->

### increase the volume of alcohol by 20%. If the herb is normally extracted using

<!-- chunk -->

### 50% alcohol, this means increasing the percentage of alcohol to 70%. The added

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol makes up for the water that will be added later during the process.

<!-- chunk -->

### Set up the percolation and allow the equivalent of 75% of the weight of the

<!-- chunk -->

### herb to percolate through. If you used 100 grams of herb, you would allow

<!-- chunk -->

### milliliters to percolate through; if you used 10 ounces of herb, that would be 7.5

<!-- chunk -->

### fluid ounces. Set this liquid aside.

<!-- chunk -->

### Continue percolating the remaining menstruum, then loosen the cap on the

<!-- chunk -->

### percolation cone and flush the marc with boiling hot water. Transfer the

<!-- chunk -->

### remaining percolated menstruum and the water to a shallow pan and evaporate in

<!-- chunk -->

### a food dehydrator or in an oven on low heat until the liquid is reduced to 25% of

<!-- chunk -->

### the volume of herb. Using the above examples, that’s 25 milliliters or 2.5 fluid

<!-- chunk -->

### ounces. Combine this 25% reduction with the 75% percolated menstruum that

<!-- chunk -->

### you set aside earlier. You now have a 1:1 fluid extract.

# FLUID EXTRACTS STEP-BY-STEP

<!-- chunk -->

### Here’s a step-by-step guide to making a 1:1 fluid extract of calendula.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step one: Calendula is normally tinctured using 70% alcohol. Add 20 to 70% to

<!-- chunk -->

### get 90%. Prepare a menstruum that is 90% alcohol and 10% water.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step two: Calculate the amount of menstruum based on a 1:5 ratio. For example,

<!-- chunk -->

### 5 ounces of calendula would need 25 fluid ounces of menstruum. (The final

<!-- chunk -->

### product will yield 5 fluid ounces of a 1:1 fluid extract of calendula.)

<!-- chunk -->

## Step three: Calculate 75% (by volume) of the weight of the herb. For instance,

<!-- chunk -->

### 75% of 5 fluid ounces is 3.75 ounces. Measure out 3.75 ounces of water and

<!-- chunk -->

### pour it into the jar you will be using to catch the percolated menstruum. Use a

<!-- chunk -->

### permanent marker to mark the water level on the outside of the jar, then empty

<!-- chunk -->

### the water from the jar. (We’ll call the marked jar Container A.)

<!-- chunk -->

## Step four: Set up the percolation cone and start the percolation process, using

<!-- chunk -->

### Container A to catch the percolated liquid. When the liquid in Container A

<!-- chunk -->

### reaches the line that you marked in step three, tighten the cap on the percolation

<!-- chunk -->

### cone to stop the flow. Transfer the 3.75 ounces of liquid into another container

<!-- chunk -->

### (Container B) and set aside.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step five: Return Container A to its place under the percolation cone and

<!-- chunk -->

### continue the percolation. When the menstruum has finished dripping through,

<!-- chunk -->

### loosen the cap on the cone. Flush water-soluble constituents out of the marc by

<!-- chunk -->

### pouring boiling hot water through the percolation cone until the water runs clear.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step six: Calculate 25% of the desired final volume of the fluid extract. In our

<!-- chunk -->

### example, 25% of 5 ounces is 1.25 ounces. Follow the instructions in step three to

<!-- chunk -->

### mark this volume on a shallow container (Container C).

<!-- chunk -->

## Step seven: Transfer the liquid from Container A to Container C. Put Container

<!-- chunk -->

### C in a food dehydrator or an oven set on the lowest temperature. Check the

<!-- chunk -->

### liquid frequently until it has evaporated to the mark you made, leaving you with

<!-- chunk -->

### 1.25 fluid ounces of extract.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step eight: Combine the liquids from Container B (3.75 fluid ounces) and

<!-- chunk -->

### Container C (1.25 fluid ounces). You now have 5 fluid ounces of an extract made

<!-- chunk -->

### from 5 ounces of calendula, which means you have a 1:1 extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### Congratulations! You have made a fluid extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### Only a few herbs respond well to concentration without changing the relative

<!-- chunk -->

### ratio of constituents, and most herbs are not given in such a big dose that

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration is necessary. Some herbs that do work well as fluid extracts

<!-- chunk -->

### include Corydalis yanhusuo, calendula, turmeric, Echinacea angustifolia root,

<!-- chunk -->

### eleuthero, licorice, black walnut, passionflower, Jamaican dogwood, willow

<!-- chunk -->

### bark, prickly ash, kava kava, dandelion, and barberry.

# SOXHLET EXTRACTION

<!-- chunk -->

### The Soxhlet extractor is a piece of lab equipment that was developed in 1879 to

<!-- chunk -->

### facilitate the continual extraction of plant material and create very concentrated

<!-- chunk -->

### extracts. In a Soxhlet extractor, the menstruum is boiled, evaporated, and

<!-- chunk -->

### allowed to condense. As it condenses, it drips through the plant material to

<!-- chunk -->

### extract constituents. This extract returns to the heated container, where it is

<!-- chunk -->

### boiled, evaporated, and condensed again to drip through the plant material and

<!-- chunk -->

### extract more constituents.

<!-- chunk -->

### A Soxhlet extractor with a 500 milliliter boiling flask will hold about

<!-- chunk -->

### grams of plant material. One run through the extractor will produce a standard

<!-- chunk -->

### 1:5 tincture. If you replace the exhausted marc with 100 grams of fresh plant

<!-- chunk -->

### material and extract that using the original menstruum, you get a 1:2.5 extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### Repeat the process a third time to get a 1:1.25 extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### It takes a day or two for a Soxhlet extractor to make such a concentrated

<!-- chunk -->

### extract, but once you’ve set it up it requires only occasional monitoring.

# MATERIALS FOR MAKING SOXHLET EXTRACTS

<!-- chunk -->

### A high-quality, American-made Soxhlet extractor can set you back $500. You

<!-- chunk -->

### can sometimes find cheaper, Chinese-made Soxhlet extractors on eBay for less

<!-- chunk -->

### than $100. Cheaper glassware means thinner glass, which means you’ll have to

<!-- chunk -->

### be more careful when handling it. With the less-expensive glassware, you can set

<!-- chunk -->

### up a complete Soxhlet extractor for around $200. You should be able to find all

<!-- chunk -->

### of the components on the internet. Here’s what you’ll need.

<!-- chunk -->

## ▪ A lab stand to hold the Soxhlet extractor, with a heavy base for stability. Look

<!-- chunk -->

### for a cast iron support ring stand.

<!-- chunk -->

## ▪ Lab clamps to secure the Soxhlet extractor to the lab stand. Get the kind with

<!-- chunk -->

### three prongs.

<!-- chunk -->

## ▪ A submersible recirculating pump is used to pump ice water into the

<!-- chunk -->

### condenser at the top of the Soxhlet extractor. A submersible pump like a fish

<!-- chunk -->

### tank pump that can pump 3.8 liters is sufficient.

<!-- chunk -->

## ▪ A DC power supply to run the pump (unless you get a 110-volt pump).

<!-- chunk -->

## ▪ Plastic tubing to connect the pump to the condenser on the Soxhlet extractor.

<!-- chunk -->

## You can get tubing from any hardware store. Make sure to get hose clamps as

<!-- chunk -->

### well.

<!-- chunk -->

## ▪ An insul ated container to fill with ice water and connect to the tubing.

<!-- chunk -->

## ▪ A heat source to put under the Soxhlet extractor to boil the menstruum. The

<!-- chunk -->

### safest (and most expensive) option is a heating mantle with a magnetic stirrer.

<!-- chunk -->

### Prices start at $200. A $20 fondue cooker filled with vegetable oil will hold the

<!-- chunk -->

### temperature within a few degrees of where you want it.

<!-- chunk -->

## ▪ Boiling stones ensure an even boil of the menstruum. They go in the boiling

<!-- chunk -->

### flask that holds the menstruum. Look for stones that are 4–6 millimeters in

<!-- chunk -->

### diameter.

<!-- chunk -->

## ▪ A digital or laser thermometer to monitor the temperature of the oil bath in the

<!-- chunk -->

### fondue cooker.

# SOXHLET EXTRACTION STEP-BY-STEP

<!-- chunk -->

## Step one: Prepare the heat source. If you are using a fondue cooker, fill it with

<!-- chunk -->

### vegetable oil. (Oil doesn’t evaporate, so it requires less watching than a water

<!-- chunk -->

### bath.) The oil can be reused to make multiple batches of extracts. It will start to

<!-- chunk -->

### smell rancid after a few uses, but you can add 1 drop rosemary essential oil to

<!-- chunk -->

### mask the smell.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step two: Moisten the plant material using the same method described for

<!-- chunk -->

### percolations earlier in this chapter. Allow the moistened powder to sit for at least

<!-- chunk -->

### 4 hours before beginning the extraction.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step three: The plant material goes in the middle section of the Soxhlet

<!-- chunk -->

### extractor. Put a filter at the bottom of this middle piece. Try different types of

<!-- chunk -->

### filters: Some options include lab filter paper, organic unbleached cotton balls,

<!-- chunk -->

### and organic unbleached facial cleansing pads.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step four: Spoon the moistened plant material on top of the filter in the middle

<!-- chunk -->

### piece of the Soxhlet extractor. Clamp the middle piece of the Soxhlet extractor to

<!-- chunk -->

### the lab stand.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step five: Fill the flat-bottomed boiling flask 80% full with the menstruum. This

<!-- chunk -->

### can be straight alcohol or a mixture of alcohol and water. Add a teaspoon of

<!-- chunk -->

### boiling stones to the flask.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step six: Grease all of the joints on the Soxhlet extractor with a thin layer of

<!-- chunk -->

### shea butter, cocoa butter, or a natural oil. Lubricate both of the pieces that are

<!-- chunk -->

### joined together to prevent the pieces of glass from getting irreversibly stuck

<!-- chunk -->

### together.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step seven: Slide the boiling flask into place below the Soxhlet extractor, and fit

<!-- chunk -->

### the joints together. Lower the Soxhlet extractor into the oil bath or heating

<!-- chunk -->

### mantle. Attach the condenser to the top of the extraction chamber. (Make sure

<!-- chunk -->

### the joints are greased!)

<!-- chunk -->

## Step eight: Connect the plastic tubing to the condenser. The input line attaches

<!-- chunk -->

### at the bottom of the condenser, and the output line attaches at the top. Use hose

<!-- chunk -->

### clamps to secure the tubing connections.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step nine: Put the loose end of the output line from the condenser in an

<!-- chunk -->

### insulated container filled with ice water. Run a line from the insulated container

<!-- chunk -->

### to the input line of the water pump. Connect the input line from the condenser to

<!-- chunk -->

### the output line of the pump. Turn the pump on to start circulating ice water

<!-- chunk -->

### through the condenser.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step ten: Turn the heat source on. If you are extracting alcohol-soluble

<!-- chunk -->

### constituents, set the temperature at 195°. To extract both alcohol- and water-

<!-- chunk -->

### soluble constituents, set the temperature at 220°. Check the temperature

<!-- chunk -->

### occasionally while the Soxhlet extractor is running, adjusting as needed to keep

<!-- chunk -->

### it within 5° on either side of the optimal temperature.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step eleven: Check the ice water bath every few hours, adding ice packs as

<!-- chunk -->

### needed to keep the temperature below 45°.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step twelve: Once the menstruum runs clear through the reflux tube, turn the

<!-- chunk -->

### heat source off and let everything cool down. Disassemble the Soxhlet extractor

<!-- chunk -->

### and replace the exhausted plant material with fresh material. Set the exhausted

<!-- chunk -->

### marc aside in a separate container and keep it covered in the refrigerator until the

<!-- chunk -->

### extraction is complete.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step thirteen: Put the Soxhlet back together and start the oil bath again. Repeat

<!-- chunk -->

### the process. You can do this as many times as you need to until you reach the

<!-- chunk -->

### desired concentration.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step fourteen: To extract water-soluble constituents, put all of the exhausted

<!-- chunk -->

### marc into a pot and decoct it. Strain the decoction and then simmer it to

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrate it down to about 2 ounces. Add this back to the alcohol extract to

<!-- chunk -->

### produce the finished Soxhlet extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### Soxhlet extraction in some cases doesn’t produce better tinctures than

<!-- chunk -->

### percolation or maceration. It seems to work best when a plant has difficult-to-

<!-- chunk -->

### extract alcohol-soluble compounds and lipids. Calamus, angelica, lemon balm,

<!-- chunk -->

### spearmint, and blue vervain all make exceptional Soxhlet extracts.

<!-- chunk -->

### Making percolation extracts, fluid extracts, and Soxhlet extracts is more

<!-- chunk -->

### complicated than making a standard alcohol tincture, but these techniques

<!-- chunk -->

### produce more potent extracts, so you get more value from the same amount of

<!-- chunk -->

### plant material and you can use smaller doses. Don’t be afraid to experiment.

## CHAPTER EIGHT

# Topical Preparations

<!-- chunk -->

## OIL-BASED EXTRACTIONS, TOPICAL APPLICATIONS, AND

<!-- chunk -->

## LOCAL APPLICATIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### here are many topical (local) applications of herbs. In this chapter we

<!-- chunk -->

### discuss how to make oil- or fat-based extractions and turn them into salves,

<!-- chunk -->

### ointments, lotions, and other topical preparations. In the second half of the

<!-- chunk -->

### chapter, we discuss techniques for applying bulk herbs and various extracts

<!-- chunk -->

### topically.

# OIL-BASED HERBAL PREPARATIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### Oil-based preparations of herbs are suited for minor skin problems like

<!-- chunk -->

### abrasions, burns, rashes, and dry skin. Be careful with new cuts or wounds,

<!-- chunk -->

### especially if the wound is deep; oil can trap bacteria and help them spread. For

<!-- chunk -->

### active infections, direct application of herbs in a poultice or indirect applications

<!-- chunk -->

### like compresses and soaks work best.

<!-- chunk -->

### Compresses are made by soaking a cloth in an herbal tea or decoction and

<!-- chunk -->

### applying the cloth to the affected area; soaks are done by submersing an area in

<!-- chunk -->

### an herbal tea or decoction (compresses are covered later in this chapter, and

<!-- chunk -->

### soaks are discussed in Appendix One). After a couple of days of healing, if the

<!-- chunk -->

### wound shows no sign of infection, salves are more convenient than poultices and

<!-- chunk -->

### compresses. Salves work really well for the proliferative and remodeling phases

<!-- chunk -->

### of tissue healing.

# EXTRACTING HERBS IN OIL OR FAT

<!-- chunk -->

### In an oil extract (olea medicata in Latin), herbs are macerated in a fixed oil to

<!-- chunk -->

### extract constituents that are soluble in fats. Olive oil, grape seed oil, almond oil,

<!-- chunk -->

### peanut oil, and apricot oil are commonly used to make herbal oils. In the past,

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs were frequently extracted in saturated fats such as lard or butter. Oil isn’t a

<!-- chunk -->

### great solvent on its own. Using gentle heat or an intermediate solvent like

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol produces a better oil. Making an herbal oil is the first step to making an

<!-- chunk -->

### oil-based salve, as described later in this chapter.

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbal Oils (Oil Extractions)

<!-- chunk -->

### There are three primary methods for creating an herbal oil. The first is similar to

<!-- chunk -->

### making a tincture, the second is like making a low-temperature decoction, and

<!-- chunk -->

### the final method uses intermediate solvents to produce the oil.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cold Extraction Pack herbs loosely in a glass jar. Add enough oil to barely

<!-- chunk -->

### cover the plant material. Put the jar in a warm, dark area for 14 days, shaking or

<!-- chunk -->

### stirring daily, then strain and bottle the oil.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most oils made with fresh plants will grow mold due to the water content of

<!-- chunk -->

### the plants. Two herbs that can be used fresh to make herbal oils are mullein

<!-- chunk -->

### flowers and St. John’s wort flowers. Gather the flowers and place them loosely

<!-- chunk -->

### into a jar. Cover them with oil and macerate for 14 days as described above.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some herbs commonly infused in oil after drying include garlic, lobelia seeds,

<!-- chunk -->

### and poke root. Other plant materials should be dried for about 48 hours and

<!-- chunk -->

### extracted using the hot extraction method.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hot Extraction The 1898 King’s American Dispensatory recommends

<!-- chunk -->

### maintaining heat between 122° and 140° to produce medicinal oils. You can use

<!-- chunk -->

### the lowest setting on a slow cooker or oven, which will hold the temperature at

<!-- chunk -->

### about 150°. Extracting at 150° rather than between 122° and 140° won’t damage

<!-- chunk -->

### the plant compounds, but oils that are heated above 150° tend to go rancid faster

<!-- chunk -->

### than otherwise. To keep the temperature within the range given by King’s

<!-- chunk -->

### American Dispensatory, prop a wooden spoon against the door of the oven to

<!-- chunk -->

### keep it slightly ajar. If you are using a slow cooker, you can have an electrician

<!-- chunk -->

### wire a light dimmer into the power cord to control the temperature more

<!-- chunk -->

### precisely. Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature.

<!-- chunk -->

### To extract herbs in a slow cooker, put them in the crock and add enough oil to

<!-- chunk -->

### barely cover the herbs (approximately 1 gallon of oil to 1 pound of herbs). Turn

<!-- chunk -->

### the slow cooker on low and let the herbs steep overnight, or for 8–12 hours. Let

<!-- chunk -->

### the oil cool, then strain and bottle it.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are using an oven, use a large enamel pan to hold the herbs. Cover them

<!-- chunk -->

### in oil. Set the oven to the lowest temperature and prop the oven door open with a

<!-- chunk -->

### wooden spoon for ventilation. Keep the herbs in the oven for 8–12 hours, allow

<!-- chunk -->

### the oil to cool, then strain and bottle.

<!-- chunk -->

### To make a hot extract using fresh plants, keep the plant material in the oven or

<!-- chunk -->

### crock until all the liquid is cooked out of the fresh plant material and the herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### are crispy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Using Intermediate Solvents To make a more potent oil, you can use high-proof

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol as an intermediate solvent. Measure the amount of plant material by

<!-- chunk -->

### weight and add 75% of that weight in 95% alcohol to the plant material. For

<!-- chunk -->

### grams of plant material, use 150 milliliters of 95% alcohol, and for 16 ounces of

<!-- chunk -->

### herb add 12 fluid ounces of 95% alcohol. Let this sit for 24 hours, then add the

<!-- chunk -->

### oil at a 1:5 ratio and apply gentle heat for 8–12 hours as described above. All of

<!-- chunk -->

### the alcohol will evaporate. For a 1:5 oil extraction of 200 grams of plant

<!-- chunk -->

### material, you need 1,000 grams by weight of oil, or 5 pounds of oil to 1 pound of

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs. This kind of precise measurement is not necessary for making herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### products for use by family and friends.

# SALVES, OINTMENTS, AND BALMS

<!-- chunk -->

### Salves are semi-solid medicinal preparations made of an herbal oil base that is

<!-- chunk -->

### solidified with beeswax or candelilla wax (a vegan alternative). Salves can also

<!-- chunk -->

### be called ointments. Herbal salves are used for scrapes, burns, skin irritations,

<!-- chunk -->

### and other skin conditions. They are used to carry herbs directly to the tissues that

<!-- chunk -->

### need them, or to deliver compounds like volatile oils to a referred site (like

<!-- chunk -->

### massaging a salve into the upper back and chest to affect the lungs). Some salves

<!-- chunk -->

### act as drawing agents to pull splinters and glass out of skin.

<!-- chunk -->

### To make a salve, make an herbal oil as described above. Use a 6:1–8:1 ratio of

<!-- chunk -->

### oil to beeswax, depending on how hard you want your salve. For softer salves

<!-- chunk -->

### use less wax, and for harder salves use more. That’s around 30 grams (1 ounce)

<!-- chunk -->

### of wax by weight for every 170–220 milliliters (6–8 ounces) by volume of oil.

<!-- chunk -->

### Wax pellets and grated wax are easier to melt than chunks of wax. (Use hot

<!-- chunk -->

### water to melt the wax off the grater.) Melt the beeswax in a jar or can that is

<!-- chunk -->

### dedicated to melting wax so you don’t have to deal with getting wax off the sides

<!-- chunk -->

### of a pot. Fill a large pot halfway with water and set a few canning jar rings on

<!-- chunk -->

### the bottom of the pot. Set the container full of beeswax on the canning rings so

<!-- chunk -->

### that it does not touch the bottom of the pot. Simmer the water over medium-high

<!-- chunk -->

### heat to melt the wax. While the beeswax is melting, warm up the oil in a

<!-- chunk -->

### nonreactive stainless steel or enamel pot. When the wax is completely melted,

<!-- chunk -->

### pour the hot wax into the warm oil.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another way to make salves is to pour beeswax pellets or grated beeswax

<!-- chunk -->

### directly into the hot oil. Stir regularly for about 20 minutes until the wax is

<!-- chunk -->

### completely melted. Keep an eye on the wax to keep it from bursting into flames.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once the oil and wax are blended together, remove them from the heat. Stir

<!-- chunk -->

### the liquid salve as it cools to make sure that the wax and oil do not separate. As

<!-- chunk -->

### the mixture cools, it will begin to turn translucent, at which point it is ready to

<!-- chunk -->

### put into jars. Add heat-sensitive ingredients like essential oils, vitamin E, and

<!-- chunk -->

### lanolin at this point, if desired.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cleaning up equipment that was used to make salve is tedious. Wipe down the

<!-- chunk -->

### equipment with paper towels while the salve is still liquid, and be prepared to

<!-- chunk -->

### wash everything in very hot soapy water a few times to get the equipment

<!-- chunk -->

### completely clean.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is a basic salve formula in Chapter Twelve to get you started.

<!-- chunk -->

### Balms are made with more beeswax than salves are: 30 grams (1 ounce) by

<!-- chunk -->

### weight to 80–110 milliliters (3–4 ounces) by volume of oil. The beeswax creates

<!-- chunk -->

### a protective barrier on the skin.

# LOTIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### Lotions are mixtures of oil and water that are used to moisturize dry skin. Water

<!-- chunk -->

### and oil do not naturally mix and must be emulsified. Emulsifiers are also known

<!-- chunk -->

### as surface active agents or surfactants, which will cause oil and water to stay

<!-- chunk -->

### mixed. For example, when blended with oil, the lecithin in egg yolk creates the

<!-- chunk -->

### stabilized emulsion known as mayonnaise.

<!-- chunk -->

### Commercial lotions usually contain highly processed chemical emulsifiers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Emulsifying wax is a reasonably safe chemical emulsifier, or you can make an

<!-- chunk -->

### emulsifier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lotions need to include a preservative to prevent mold and bacteria growth.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary essential oil and vitamin E oil are both antibacterial, and can be added

<!-- chunk -->

### to extend the shelf life of your lotions to well beyond 6 months.

<!-- chunk -->

### To make a lotion, melt the following ingredients together in a pan:

<!-- chunk -->

### 2 parts of a liquid fixed oil (grape seed oil, olive oil, or almond oil)

<!-- chunk -->

### 1 part of a solid fixed oil (cocoa butter, coconut oil, mango butter, or shea

<!-- chunk -->

### butter)

<!-- chunk -->

### 1 part emulsifier

<!-- chunk -->

### Stir in 4–6 parts of one of the following: an herbal infusion, aloe vera juice, or

<!-- chunk -->

### a hydrosol like rose water. Add 1 drop rosemary essential oil for every

<!-- chunk -->

### milliliters (4 ounces) of liquid, and add 1 milliliter of vitamin E oil per

<!-- chunk -->

### milliliters (8 ounces) of liquid. You can blend the mixture by hand with a whisk

<!-- chunk -->

### if you happen to be an Olympic level athlete. For us mere mortals, a stick

<!-- chunk -->

### blender or a strong countertop blender works a lot better.

# HOMEMADE EMULSIFIER

80% beeswax 10% borax 10% liquid lecithin This emulsifier will not keep for long and needs to be made fresh with each batch of lotion.

# BUTTERS

<!-- chunk -->

### Body butters are a whipped blend of saturated oils (solid at room temperature)

<!-- chunk -->

### and monounsaturated or polyunsaturated oils (liquid at room temperature). Body

<!-- chunk -->

### butters aren’t usually made with water (although they can be), so they last longer

<!-- chunk -->

### than lotions and have a creamy-smooth feel without the hassle of adding an

<!-- chunk -->

### emulsifier. (If you use a hydrosol or aloe vera gel to make body butter, you will

<!-- chunk -->

### need to add an emulsifier.)

<!-- chunk -->

### To make a butter, use:

<!-- chunk -->

### 7 parts by weight of a solid fixed oil

<!-- chunk -->

### 3 parts by weight of a liquid fixed oil

<!-- chunk -->

### Slowly melt the oils together in a double boiler. Remove the oil from the heat,

<!-- chunk -->

### add essential oils, and let the oil cool to room temperature. Whip the mixture

<!-- chunk -->

### into a buttery consistency with a hand or stand mixer. Refrigerate for 30 minutes

<!-- chunk -->

### and whip again. See Chapter Twelve for a sample formula.

# MASSAGE OILS

<!-- chunk -->

### Massage oils are made with carrier oils with essential oils added for fragrance

<!-- chunk -->

### and therapeutic action. Depending on the person and the oils used, massage oil

<!-- chunk -->

### can have a relaxing or stimulating effect on the mind and spirit. Massage oils

<!-- chunk -->

### help to relieve stress and tension by their effect on nerve endings, the mind, and

<!-- chunk -->

### muscles. Oils and massage can improve skin cell growth and accelerate the

<!-- chunk -->

### elimination of wastes through the body’s lymphatic system. See Chapter Ten for

<!-- chunk -->

### more information on using essential oils.

# OTHER TOPICAL APPLICATIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### Alcohol tinctures, glycerites, teas, and decoctions can be used topically.

# LINIMENTS

<!-- chunk -->

### Liniments are made in the same way as macerated tinctures, but with rubbing

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol instead of drinkable ethanol. This cuts down on cost. It also makes the

<!-- chunk -->

### liniment toxic for internal use; many use regular alcohol tinctures topically as

<!-- chunk -->

### liniments to avoid the risk of poisoning. Label liniments that are made with

<!-- chunk -->

### rubbing alcohol to prevent accidental ingestion. Menthol crystals or wintergreen

<!-- chunk -->

### add a nice smell, increase the anti-inflammatory properties of the liniment, and

<!-- chunk -->

### help prevent accidental ingestion. The Antispasmodic Tincture in Chapter

<!-- chunk -->

### Twelve makes a good liniment.

# COMPRESSES AND FOMENTATIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### A compress is a cloth pad soaked in an herbal extract and applied to the skin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most compresses are applied warm, but cold compresses have their applications.

<!-- chunk -->

### Compresses are used to ease pain or accelerate the healing of wounds or muscle

<!-- chunk -->

### injuries. Cold compresses are used for headaches, burns, bites, and stings.

<!-- chunk -->

### Infusions, decoctions, and tinctures or glycerites diluted with water may be used

<!-- chunk -->

### for a compress. The pad may be soft cotton or linen, a cotton ball, or woven

<!-- chunk -->

### gauze.

<!-- chunk -->

### To prepare a compress:

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Submerge a clean piece of soft cloth in a warm infusion or other herbal extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Squeeze out the excess liquid.

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Place the pad against the affected area.

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ When the pad cools or dries, repeat the process.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fomentations are compresses that cover a larger area of the body. Soak a cloth

<!-- chunk -->

### in hot tea and apply it to the affected area. Herbs that make good compresses and

<!-- chunk -->

### fomentations include chamomile, elder flowers and leaves, yarrow, and

<!-- chunk -->

### calendula.

# POULTICES AND PLASTERS

<!-- chunk -->

### A plaster or poultice (also known as a cataplasm) is a mixture of dried or fresh

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs moistened with water or oil and applied externally. It is similar to a

<!-- chunk -->

### compress, but plant parts are used rather than a liquid extraction. Generally a

<!-- chunk -->

### poultice implies a hot treatment, whereas a plaster is applied at room

<!-- chunk -->

### temperature. Smash or chop fresh herbs and apply them directly to the affected

<!-- chunk -->

### area. If you’re using dried herbs, boil them for up to 5 minutes or mix them with

<!-- chunk -->

### a small amount of boiling water. Apply the poultice or plaster in between layers

<!-- chunk -->

### of gauze to prevent messes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Poultices should be applied as hot as can be tolerated. Use a gauze bandage

<!-- chunk -->

### covered with a warm cloth over the poultice.

<!-- chunk -->

### Good herbs for making plasters and poultices include slippery elm, comfrey

<!-- chunk -->

### leaf and root, marshmallow, flaxseed, white oak bark, psyllium seeds, plantain,

<!-- chunk -->

### lily of the valley, pine gum, lobelia, calendula, yarrow, goldenseal, and aloe vera.

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to herbs, you can use fine clay and activated charcoal in plasters and

<!-- chunk -->

### poultices. There is a basic poultice formula in Chapter Twelve.

<!-- chunk -->

### Prickly pear cactus (nopal, Opuntia ficus-indica) is a great herb to use as a

<!-- chunk -->

### poultice. Its actions are similar to those of aloe vera gel. Most ethnic grocery

<!-- chunk -->

### stores sell nopal pads with the spines removed; if you harvest a fresh prickly

<!-- chunk -->

### pear pad, you will have to remove the spines yourself. Prickly pear cacti have

<!-- chunk -->

### two types of spines: large fixed spines and small, hair-like glochids that can

<!-- chunk -->

### work their way into the skin, causing general irritation and misery. Remove the

<!-- chunk -->

### glochids from the pads by scraping them off with a knife; if you roast the pads

<!-- chunk -->

### over an open flame first, it becomes much easier. Cut the pads in half vertically

<!-- chunk -->

### to expose the gooey inside, warm the pads, and apply them directly over wounds

<!-- chunk -->

### and burns. The goo can be scraped out, dehydrated on a fruit leather tray, then

<!-- chunk -->

### powdered and reconstituted as needed.

# LOCAL APPLICATIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### These are applications made to specific parts of the body, such as the rectum,

<!-- chunk -->

### vagina, mouth, nose, eyes, and ears.

# SUPPOSITORY, PESSARY, OR BOLUS

<!-- chunk -->

### A suppository is used to insert herbs rectally or vaginally. A pessary is another

<!-- chunk -->

### word for a vaginal suppository. A bolus is administered orally.

<!-- chunk -->

### To prepare a suppository or pessary, melt cocoa butter on low heat, preferably

<!-- chunk -->

### in a double boiler, and stir in finely powdered herbs. The last thing you want to

<!-- chunk -->

### do is insert rough, scratchy plant material in a sensitive area, so make sure the

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs are very finely powdered.

<!-- chunk -->

### Add essential oils, if desired, and pour the herb-infused cocoa butter into a

<!-- chunk -->

### suppository mold and let it cool. Wrap each suppository individually with waxed

<!-- chunk -->

### paper and store it in the refrigerator. Insert rectally or vaginally depending on

<!-- chunk -->

### need. Use suppositories within 7–10 days, or keep in the freezer for up to

<!-- chunk -->

### months.

<!-- chunk -->

### To make a bolus, mix a binding herb like marshmallow or comfrey root with

<!-- chunk -->

### other herbs to form a stiff paste. Shape the paste into pieces the size of large pills

<!-- chunk -->

### and wrap with waxed paper. Boluses must be used immediately.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbs for suppositories and boluses include comfrey root, marshmallow,

<!-- chunk -->

### Oregon grape, and cranesbill (geranium).

<!-- chunk -->

## Making a Suppository Mold

<!-- chunk -->

### To make a suppository mold, wrap a pencil, a slim marker, or the handle of a

<!-- chunk -->

### wooden spoon in several layers of aluminum foil. Slide the foil off and seal one

<!-- chunk -->

### end of the foil mold. Make several of these and stand them together in a can or

<!-- chunk -->

### jar. When the suppository mixture is ready, fill each tube and freeze for

<!-- chunk -->

### minutes. Remove the foil and slice the suppositories into pieces 2 centimeters (¾

<!-- chunk -->

### inch) long.

# GARGLES AND MOUTHWASHES

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal gargles and mouthwashes are used for sore throats, laryngitis, tonsillitis,

<!-- chunk -->

### irritated throats, dry coughs, and bad breath. Make a decoction or mix tinctures

<!-- chunk -->

### or glycerites with water.

<!-- chunk -->

## Suggested Ingredients for Herbal Mouthwashes and Gargles

<!-- chunk -->

## Antiseptics and disinfectants: Myrrh, barberry, thyme, clove

<!-- chunk -->

## Astringents: Bayberry, white oak bark, sage, calendula

<!-- chunk -->

## Demulcents (for dry, irritated throats): Licorice, slippery elm, marshmallow

<!-- chunk -->

## Flavoring agents: Spearmint, peppermint, anise, fennel, licorice, clove,

<!-- chunk -->

### cinnamon

<!-- chunk -->

## Stimulants: Capsicum (used in very small amounts), ginger, thyme

# HERBAL SNUFF

<!-- chunk -->

### A snuff is used to dry up excess mucus in the sinuses or to shrink nasal polyps.

<!-- chunk -->

### Take a pinch of powdered herb in the palm of your hand. Use your other hand to

<!-- chunk -->

### hold one nostril closed while you inhale the powder through the other nostril.

<!-- chunk -->

### Repeat with the other side. Be prepared for a few sneezes and copious drainage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbs that are used for sinus snuffs include bayberry bark, goldenseal, and

<!-- chunk -->

### yarrow.

# TOOTH POWDER

<!-- chunk -->

### Tooth powders can tone bleeding gums and strengthen tooth enamel. Use tooth

<!-- chunk -->

### powders with a toothbrush or with short sticks made from rosemary stems.

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbs for Tooth Powder

<!-- chunk -->

### Horsetail (strengthens tooth enamel)

<!-- chunk -->

### White oak bark (tones bleeding gums)

<!-- chunk -->

### Black walnut (tones bleeding gums)

<!-- chunk -->

### Calendula (tones bleeding gums)

<!-- chunk -->

### Myrrh gum (antiseptic)

<!-- chunk -->

### Elecampane (antiseptic)

# EYEWASH

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal infusions can be applied as drops, as eyewashes, in eyecups, or in a

<!-- chunk -->

### compress for sore, red, tired eyes or for eye infections. Use only freshly made

<!-- chunk -->

### teas to avoid the risk of infection. Herbs for eyewashes include agrimony,

<!-- chunk -->

### chamomile, eyebright, and red raspberry.

# EAR DROPS

<!-- chunk -->

### Earaches and ear infections can be very painful. Herbal ear drops reduce

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation, fight infection, and reduce pain in the ear. Make sure the eardrum

<!-- chunk -->

### is intact before putting anything into the ear.

<!-- chunk -->

### Warm a bottle of oil or tincture in a pan of hot water until the oil or tincture

<!-- chunk -->

### feels warm, but not hot, on the inside of your wrist. Drop 5–10 drops in the ear

<!-- chunk -->

### and use a cotton ball to prevent the oil or tincture from leaking out. Herbs that

<!-- chunk -->

### are used for ear drops include garlic, mullein, and St. John’s wort. Tea tree,

<!-- chunk -->

### lavender, or lemon essential oils can be diluted 1:20 in olive oil and applied as

<!-- chunk -->

### above.

## CHAPTER NINE

# Other Preparations

<!-- chunk -->

## CONCENTRATES, LOZENGES, AND TRADITIONAL CHINESE

<!-- chunk -->

## METHODS

<!-- chunk -->

### his chapter covers some interesting techniques for preparing herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### medicines. These include powdered concentrates, lozenges, and hot alcohol

<!-- chunk -->

### extraction. We also discuss some of the Asian techniques used to prepare herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

### As you become more skilled at making your own herbal medicines, these are

<!-- chunk -->

### some techniques you can use to expand your skills.

# POWDERED CONCENTRATES

<!-- chunk -->

### These are techniques for taking herbs that have been extracted using water or

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol and turning them back into powders. These powders are very potent and

<!-- chunk -->

### require much lower doses than bulk herb powders or regular capsules.

# TEA CONCENTRATES

<!-- chunk -->

### Tea powder concentrates are a great way to concentrate the water-soluble

<!-- chunk -->

### constituents from a plant extract. The idea, in a nutshell, is to make a strong

<!-- chunk -->

### decoction, reduce the decoction (concentrating it), then dry the decoction into a

<!-- chunk -->

### powder that can be easily administered in a beverage, as a capsule, or as a

<!-- chunk -->

### powder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Concentrated powders are great for children or adults who are unlikely to

<!-- chunk -->

### drink a cup of bad-tasting tea, and for those who can’t take tinctures. Any herb

<!-- chunk -->

### that can be decocted works well as a tea concentrate.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here’s the step-by-step way to make a tea powder concentrate.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step one: Slightly moisten ground herb powder (if dry) or freshly minced herb

<!-- chunk -->

### (if fresh) with 95% alcohol. If alkaloids are the primary constituent you are

<!-- chunk -->

### trying to extract, use a mixture of equal parts alcohol and apple cider vinegar to

<!-- chunk -->

### moisten the plant material. Let the marc soak for 1 hour.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step two: Add 1 part herb to 32 parts water. So, 1 ounce of herb would be added

<!-- chunk -->

### to 32 ounces (1 quart) of water. Simmer the herbs and water for 2–4 hours on

<!-- chunk -->

### very low heat.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step three: Strain the decoction to remove the marc (plant material). Then

<!-- chunk -->

### return the liquid to the pot.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step four: Simmer the remaining liquid down to about 20% of its original

<!-- chunk -->

### volume. So, 20 ounces would be reduced to 4 ounces.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step five: Remove the liquid from the heat and measure the amount of

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrated liquid. You are going to add a powder to this mixture before drying.

<!-- chunk -->

### Two possibilities are arrowroot starch or some of the herb powder. For example,

<!-- chunk -->

### if you just made a decoction of licorice root, you’d use some fresh licorice root

<!-- chunk -->

### powder.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are using arrowroot starch, add 5 grams (⅙ ounce) for every

<!-- chunk -->

### milliliters (1 ounce) of liquid. If using herb powders, add 10 grams (⅓ ounce) of

<!-- chunk -->

### powdered herb for every 30 milliliters (1 ounce) of liquid. Blend the powder and

<!-- chunk -->

### liquid well.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step six: Thinly spread the mixture of the decoction and powder onto a fruit

<!-- chunk -->

### leather tray and place in a dehydrator. Set the temperature to 120°. Allow the

<!-- chunk -->

### mixture to dry until it is dry and brittle.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step seven: Remove the dried concentrate from the tray. Grind it into a powder

<!-- chunk -->

### using a coffee grinder or a mortar and pestle. Store the powder in an airtight

<!-- chunk -->

### container away from heat and light.

<!-- chunk -->

### You now have a concentrated herbal extract in powdered form. You can

<!-- chunk -->

### encapsulate the powder or mix it into water, juice, or honey to consume.

# TINCTURE POWDER CONCENTRATES

<!-- chunk -->

### Tincture powder concentrates are similar to tea concentrates, but are appropriate

<!-- chunk -->

### for herbs with alcohol-soluble constituents. They don’t work well for plants

<!-- chunk -->

### whose primary constituents are aromatic oils. Here are the steps for producing

<!-- chunk -->

### tincture powder concentrates.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step one: Add 5 grams (⅙ ounce) of arrowroot starch or 10 grams (⅓ ounce) of

<!-- chunk -->

### dried powdered herb for every 30 milliliters (1 ounce) of tincture and blend well.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step two: Spread the mixture thinly on a fruit leather tray. Place in a dehydrator

<!-- chunk -->

### set at 140°. Allow it to dry until it becomes dry and brittle.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step three: Remove the dried concentrate from the tray and grind using a coffee

<!-- chunk -->

### grinder or mortar and pestle. Store in an airtight container away from heat and

<!-- chunk -->

### light.

<!-- chunk -->

### Due to the alcohol content, dehydrate tincture powder concentrates in a well-

<!-- chunk -->

### ventilated area away from any sources of flame or spark.

# LOZENGES OR COUGH DROPS

<!-- chunk -->

### You can make lozenges or cough drops out of herbal extracts to ease sore throats

<!-- chunk -->

### and respiratory problems. This is actually a form of candy making and follows

<!-- chunk -->

### the same procedures for making hard candy. Although not completely necessary,

<!-- chunk -->

### candy molds are helpful for making uniform lozenges. It’s also helpful to have a

<!-- chunk -->

### good thermometer for checking the temperature. Here are the procedures to

<!-- chunk -->

### follow.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step one: Make a decoction of the herb or herbs you want to use in your cough

<!-- chunk -->

### drops. Good choices include horehound, wild cherry, white pine, coltsfoot, elder

<!-- chunk -->

### berry, or cinnamon.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step two: Measure 1 cup of the decoction and add either 2 cups organic raw

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar or freeze-dried sugarcane juice or 1½ cups honey and ⅛ teaspoon cream of

<!-- chunk -->

### tartar. The cream of tartar helps offset the excess moisture in the honey so the

<!-- chunk -->

### candy will harden.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step three: Heat the mixture in a saucepan on low heat until the syrup reaches

<!-- chunk -->

### the hard-crack stage (about 290°–300°). You can check this by dropping a small

<!-- chunk -->

### amount of the syrup into ice water. If it hardens properly, it is ready.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step four (optional): Just as the mixture reaches the proper temperature, you can

<!-- chunk -->

### add some essential oils to make the drops more potent. Good oils to consider are

<!-- chunk -->

### eucalyptus, thyme, rosemary, and peppermint. Add about 10–20 drops of

<!-- chunk -->

### essential oils.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step five: Being very careful not to get any of the syrup onto your skin (it will

<!-- chunk -->

### burn you very badly), pour the hot mixture into your greased candy molds. If

<!-- chunk -->

### you do not have candy molds, you can pour it onto a greased dish. If using the

<!-- chunk -->

### dish method, wait until the candy is halfway hardened, then score the mixture

<!-- chunk -->

### with a knife to create drop-sized pieces. You’ll be able to break the candy along

<!-- chunk -->

### the scores after it has hardened completely.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another option if you don’t have candy molds is to fill a pan with powdered

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar. (If you don’t want to use refined sugar, powder freeze-dried sugarcane

<!-- chunk -->

### juice in the blender.) Drop little bits of the candy mixture into the powdered

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar. They will form small drops. You can roll the drops in the sugar when they

<!-- chunk -->

### cool to coat them with sugar.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step six: When the lozenges have cooled, store them in a sealed container. You

<!-- chunk -->

### now have your own homemade lozenges.

# HOT ALCOHOL EXTRACT

<!-- chunk -->

### Certain herbs, such as usnea, can be extracted using alcohol and heat. This is a

<!-- chunk -->

### potentially dangerous method of extraction, because alcohol has a lower boiling

<!-- chunk -->

### point (173°) than water (212°). Alcohol is also very flammable, so keep the

<!-- chunk -->

### extract away from any open flame and keep the temperature well below the

<!-- chunk -->

### boiling point of alcohol (173°) during the extraction process.

<!-- chunk -->

### The safest way to do this is using a mason jar and a crock pot. Put the herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### along with the appropriate mixture of water and alcohol into the mason jar(s).

<!-- chunk -->

### Put lids on them, but do not tighten them completely. Allow a little space for

<!-- chunk -->

### ventilation so that pressure does not build up inside the jar and cause it to break

<!-- chunk -->

### or explode.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fill the crock pot with water and place the jar(s) into the water. Turn the crock

<!-- chunk -->

### pot on low for 8 hours. Wait until the jar has cooled before opening the jar and

<!-- chunk -->

### straining the extract.

# TRADITIONAL CHINESE METHODS

<!-- chunk -->

### Both Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicine developed methods for

<!-- chunk -->

### processing herbs that reduce toxicity, increase their effectiveness, alter their

<!-- chunk -->

### properties, or remove offensive odors. Western herbalism is not as sophisticated

<!-- chunk -->

### in its processing methods. Here are some of the methods used in traditional

<!-- chunk -->

### Chinese medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Steaming and drying: A glutinous and demulcent root such as Rehmannia

<!-- chunk -->

### glutinosa (which has a cooling energy) is repeatedly steamed with wine and sun-

<!-- chunk -->

### dried by the Chinese. Korean red ginseng is made by steaming the ginseng roots

<!-- chunk -->

### and then drying them. These processes make the herbs have a more warming

<!-- chunk -->

### energy. Western herbs such as marshmallow and comfrey may be prepared in

<!-- chunk -->

### this manner.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dry-roasting and stir-frying: Dry-roasting certain herbs will enhance their fire

<!-- chunk -->

### or yang characteristics. Herbs like bupleurum are prepared in this way. Western

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs that are dry-roasted for added flavor include dandelion, chicory, and

<!-- chunk -->

### comfrey roots. In the raw state these herbs have a cooling energy, but when

<!-- chunk -->

### roasted they develop a slightly warmer energy. When a little honey is added to

<!-- chunk -->

### the herb as it is stirred and dry-roasted in a wok, it adds a tonic effect through its

<!-- chunk -->

### sweetness. In traditional Chinese medicine, licorice and astragalus are often dry-

<!-- chunk -->

### roasted with honey.

<!-- chunk -->

## Soaking in spirits or wine: Herbs that are soaked in grain spirits or wine enter

<!-- chunk -->

### the blood with optimum efficiency and have an escalating energy. The alcohol

<!-- chunk -->

### acts as an usher as well as an energizer to blood circulation. Such preparations

<!-- chunk -->

### are used in traditional Chinese medicine as tonics to treat circulatory disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### such as arthritic and rheumatic complaints.

<!-- chunk -->

## Processing with salt: In traditional Chinese medicine, a pinch of salt is added to

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs intended to tonify the urinary tract. Salt acts as a carrier for the other herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### in the formula, bringing their action to the kidneys. It also adds a moisture-

<!-- chunk -->

### retaining effect. Salt enhances the descending energy of a formula.

<!-- chunk -->

## Processing with vinegar: The sour taste generally, and vinegar in particular, has

<!-- chunk -->

### a descending and astringent energy and targets the liver.

<!-- chunk -->

## Leaching with water: This is done mainly to remove tannic acid and certain

<!-- chunk -->

### toxic substances. Acorns were prepared in this manner by Native Americans.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sand heating: Certain herbs are roasted by mixing them in sand and heating

<!-- chunk -->

### them in a wok while stirring frequently. This allows a much higher temperature

<!-- chunk -->

### than stir-frying without sand, and the roots will heat more evenly.

<!-- chunk -->

## Baking: Herbs can be baked with honey, ginger, or other carriers to enhance

<!-- chunk -->

### certain effects. Honey makes herbs more tonic and moistening. Ginger makes

<!-- chunk -->

### them more warming and dispersing, promoting circulation and digestion.

## CHAPTER TEN

# Aromatherapy and Flower Essences

<!-- chunk -->

## TWO UNIQUE WAYS TO EXTRACT AND USE HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### his chapter covers the use of specialized preparations made from plants—

<!-- chunk -->

### essential oils, homeopathic remedies, and flower essences. These

<!-- chunk -->

### preparations require additional study in order to be able to use them effectively,

<!-- chunk -->

### but we will introduce them here.

# AROMATHERAPY

<!-- chunk -->

### Aromatherapy is a specialized application of plant medicine that uses the volatile

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds from plants known as essential oils. Essential oils are what give

<!-- chunk -->

### flowers and herbs their distinctive fragrances. They are liquids that readily

<!-- chunk -->

### evaporate at room temperature. When we smell something, these volatile

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds are triggering the olfactory receptors in our nose.

<!-- chunk -->

### Essential oils are derived from the flowers, leaves, stems, seeds, or bark of

<!-- chunk -->

### different plants. Although they are called oils, essential oils are not made of the

<!-- chunk -->

### fatty acids found in fats and vegetable oils. They are complex mixtures of

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohols, terpenes, terpenoids, phenols, ketones, and oxides and are soluble in

<!-- chunk -->

### fats, oils, glycerin, and high-proof alcohol, but not in water.

<!-- chunk -->

### The French chemist who coined the term “aromatherapy,” Professor René-

<!-- chunk -->

### Maurice Gattefossé, conducted experiments with essential oils on wounded

<!-- chunk -->

### soldiers during World War I. At that time, the most commonly used antiseptic

<!-- chunk -->

### was phenol, which was good for cleaning hospital floors but not very effective

<!-- chunk -->

### for healing wounds. The soldiers Gattefossé treated had badly infected wounds

<!-- chunk -->

### that often resulted in serious poisoning as the body reabsorbed harmful

<!-- chunk -->

### substances produced by decaying tissue. His work proved that essential oils,

<!-- chunk -->

### particularly lavender, are superior to chemical antiseptics in their ability to

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxify and speed up the elimination of these substances.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aromatherapy is widely accepted in Europe by the medical profession. In

<!-- chunk -->

### England, for instance, the relaxing aroma of lavender is wafted through the

<!-- chunk -->

### wards to help raise patient morale, which helps patients to heal faster. Before

<!-- chunk -->

### bed, these same patients are given a choice of a tranquilizer drug or an

<!-- chunk -->

### aromatherapy oil massage. The use of essential oils is also gaining popularity in

<!-- chunk -->

### the United States, as more and more companies are selling the oils and

<!-- chunk -->

### promoting their use.

# HEALING PROPERTIES OF ESSENTIAL OILS

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many benefits of essential oils, one of them being that they do not

<!-- chunk -->

### appear to lose their effect with repeated applications. Generally speaking, most

<!-- chunk -->

### essential oils have effects on the nervous and glandular systems and help to

<!-- chunk -->

### destroy harmful microbes. Their effects on the nervous and glandular systems

<!-- chunk -->

### make them mood altering, and this effect takes place primarily through the sense

<!-- chunk -->

### of smell.

<!-- chunk -->

### The sense of smell is unique because it is wired directly into the brain. Nerve

<!-- chunk -->

### pathways connect the sinus cavity with the olfactory bulb, which is part of the

<!-- chunk -->

### limbic system of our brain. This is a survival mechanism, as smells can alert us

<!-- chunk -->

### to danger or suggest that something may be good to eat.

# ESSENTIAL OILS AND MOOD

<!-- chunk -->

### Odors directly affect the amygdala and the hippocampus, as well as the

<!-- chunk -->

### hypothalamus, the part of the brain that regulates the pituitary gland. This means

<!-- chunk -->

### that smells can directly alter hormone production and affect the autonomic

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous system, which regulates digestion, heart rate, blood pressure, and

<!-- chunk -->

### breathing. This is what gives them their mood-altering effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Marketers were the first to capitalize on the ability of fragrances to alter

<!-- chunk -->

### mood. For instance, the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research Foundation

<!-- chunk -->

### tested the effects of various scents on shoppers in stores selling Nike® shoes.

<!-- chunk -->

### The results were surprising: 84% of customers preferred shoes in the scented

<!-- chunk -->

### showroom and were even willing to pay more for them! Soon thereafter,

<!-- chunk -->

### Japanese companies began applying this type of research by using lemon and

<!-- chunk -->

### other citrus scents in their office buildings to stimulate alertness and

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration, thereby reducing errors and boosting productivity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because of their effect on mood, essential oils can even help set the mood for

<!-- chunk -->

### intimacy or aid meditation and spiritual awareness. They can also be used in

<!-- chunk -->

### emotional healing work and to aid in the treatment of mood disorders, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, sadness, and depression. They can also improve mental alertness,

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration, memory, and cognition.

# PHYSICAL HEALING PROPERTIES

<!-- chunk -->

### Besides having a direct impact on our mind and mood, essential oils have

<!-- chunk -->

### beneficial physical healing properties. As already mentioned, essential oils tend

<!-- chunk -->

### to be infection fighters, possessing various degrees of antibacterial, antiviral,

<!-- chunk -->

### antifungal, and, in some cases, antiparasitic actions. They can stimulate various

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic processes, which may result in the faster healing of wounds, increased

<!-- chunk -->

### white blood cell counts, improved digestion, enhanced energy production, and

<!-- chunk -->

### increased circulation.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is not necessary to ingest essential oils to obtain these benefits. Research has

<!-- chunk -->

### shown that essential oils are absorbed through the sinuses and skin and carried

<!-- chunk -->

### through the circulatory system to all the organs. They are then removed from the

<!-- chunk -->

### body via various eliminative organs such as the lungs or the urinary system.

<!-- chunk -->

### The process takes anywhere from minutes to several hours. You can

<!-- chunk -->

### experience this if you rub the sole of your foot with a slice of raw garlic. It will

<!-- chunk -->

### show up on your breath several hours later. The volatile compounds in garlic are

<!-- chunk -->

### absorbed through the skin, travel through the bloodstream, and are eliminated

<!-- chunk -->

### from the body via the lungs. The organs the body uses to eliminate an oil are

<!-- chunk -->

### going to receive the antimicrobial and stimulating actions of that herb. Because

<!-- chunk -->

### garlic is eliminated via the lungs, but not the kidneys, it helps respiratory

<!-- chunk -->

### infections but not urinary tract infections.

# UTILITARIAN USES

<!-- chunk -->

### Essential oils have utilitarian uses, too. They are often added to products for skin

<!-- chunk -->

### and hair care, such as lotions and shampoos, both for their therapeutic benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### and their emotional appeal. Their disinfectant properties make them useful in

<!-- chunk -->

### mouthwashes, natural deodorants, and disinfectant cleaners for the home.

<!-- chunk -->

### Essential oils can also be used as perfumes and natural air fresheners. Many will

<!-- chunk -->

### also help to repel insects and rodents.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aromatherapy involves using essential oils in many different ways. For

<!-- chunk -->

### example, they can be added to a fixed oil or massage lotion to be applied to the

<!-- chunk -->

### skin. They can be added to bath water or used in soaks, compresses,

<!-- chunk -->

### fomentations, gargles, and mouthwashes, or diffused into the air for inhalation

<!-- chunk -->

### via a vaporizer or diffuser. For health problems, they are usually inhaled and

<!-- chunk -->

### applied topically, although some may be used internally by professionals if they

<!-- chunk -->

### are highly diluted.

<!-- chunk -->

### The chaos of modern life and the continual rise of medical costs have inspired

<!-- chunk -->

### many individuals to rediscover aromatherapy as a natural self-help technique.

# ESSENTIAL OIL SAFETY

<!-- chunk -->

### Because the oils used in aromatherapy are available over the counter, some

<!-- chunk -->

### people assume that they are completely safe. They are safe when used properly,

<!-- chunk -->

### but can cause problems ranging from irritation of the skin and mucous

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes to more severe reactions such as liver damage, uterine hemorrhage,

<!-- chunk -->

### and abortion. Consult with a qualified aromatherapist before using undiluted

<!-- chunk -->

### oils, and talk to a health care professional before using aromatherapy if you are

<!-- chunk -->

### pregnant, have high or low blood pressure, or have allergies. The National

<!-- chunk -->

### Association for Holistic Aromatherapy is a good place for finding information

<!-- chunk -->

### on practitioners and education in aromatherapy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Reports abound about people having serious reactions from using essential

<!-- chunk -->

### oils without proper respect. Thomas has seen several cases of elevated liver

<!-- chunk -->

### enzymes, and one case of colitis, from the internal use of essential oils by

<!-- chunk -->

### untrained individuals. Eventually, if these adverse reactions continue, the FDA is

<!-- chunk -->

### likely to step in and enact strict regulations on the sales of essential oils. To

<!-- chunk -->

### continue to have these marvelous remedies available long term, we must become

<!-- chunk -->

### more conservative in their use, and stop the trend of using them undiluted and

<!-- chunk -->

### internally for problems easily treated by more gentle remedies. Carefully follow

<!-- chunk -->

### the guidelines provided below for safely diluting and using essential oils.

# USING ESSENTIAL OILS

<!-- chunk -->

### To get started, we want to acquaint you with some basic terms and techniques for

<!-- chunk -->

### using essential oils (EOs). Although they are natural substances, EOs are highly

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrated, which increases their potential for misuse. So, be sure you

<!-- chunk -->

### understand the following terms and basic guidelines for using these powerful

<!-- chunk -->

### natural substances.

<!-- chunk -->

## Diluting Oils

<!-- chunk -->

### EOs can be diluted with a fixed vegetable oil (like almond or olive oil) or a

<!-- chunk -->

### natural soap or lotion. EOs can also be added to unscented liquid soap products.

<!-- chunk -->

### Generally, the finished product should be about 2%–3% EOs. For easy reference,

<!-- chunk -->

### use Table 9 to calculate how much oil to add to a liquid for a 2½% and 5%

<!-- chunk -->

### dilution.

<!-- chunk -->

## Amount of Carrier Oil

<!-- chunk -->

## TABLE 9. Essential Oil Dilutions

<!-- chunk -->

## Topical Use

<!-- chunk -->

### The term “neat” is used for oils that can be applied topically in an undiluted

<!-- chunk -->

### form. Oils that are too irritating to be used neat should be diluted as described in

<!-- chunk -->

### the next paragraph. Certain essential oils, such as tea tree or lavender, may be

<!-- chunk -->

### applied neat to wounds to fight infection and stimulate tissue healing and repair.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other essential oils can be diluted (as per Table 9) into a fixed oil or lotion and

<!-- chunk -->

### applied topically for the treatment of skin conditions. People with sensitive skin

<!-- chunk -->

### may want to dilute even neat oils at least 1:1 (equal parts).

<!-- chunk -->

### One can also blend oils in this manner for local use; for example, massaging

<!-- chunk -->

### essential oils diluted in a carrier oil onto the neck for a sore throat, the chest for

<!-- chunk -->

### coughs and congestion, the abdomen for gas, bloating, and infection, and so

<!-- chunk -->

### forth. Essential oils make good additions to many of the topical preparations

<!-- chunk -->

### mentioned in Chapter Eight, including salves, balms, lotions, butters, liniments,

<!-- chunk -->

### and other preparations.

<!-- chunk -->

## Diffusion

<!-- chunk -->

### Diffusing oils can help to freshen the air, enhance mood, and/or kill airborne

<!-- chunk -->

### microbes to promote healing and prevent the spread of infection. It is a very safe

<!-- chunk -->

### and effective way to use EOs. There are many types of diffusers you can

<!-- chunk -->

### purchase on the market that can be used to disperse essential oils into the air.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can also diffuse oils by bringing a pot of water to a boil on the stove, turning

<!-- chunk -->

### the heat down to a simmer, and adding 5–15 drops of one or more essential oils.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let the water simmer uncovered on the stove for 20–30 minutes to diffuse the

<!-- chunk -->

### oil(s).

<!-- chunk -->

### Steam inhalation is an excellent method of application for treating problems

<!-- chunk -->

### of the respiratory system, such as colds, coughs, and sinus conditions, and

<!-- chunk -->

### relieving tension and headaches. The aroma goes straight to the brain while the

<!-- chunk -->

### oils pass from the lungs into the bloodstream.

<!-- chunk -->

### To diffuse oils in this manner, put 5–10 drops of oil in a bowl containing

<!-- chunk -->

### cups boiling hot water. Inhale the steam for 5–10 minutes, keeping your nose

<!-- chunk -->

### about 8 inches above the water. Keep your eyes closed. You can drape a towel

<!-- chunk -->

### over your head to concentrate the steam. Repeat up to 3 times daily.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can make a portable inhaler by putting a few drops of EO on a

<!-- chunk -->

### handkerchief or tissue and taking deep breaths through the cloth.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can also make an EO spray to use as an air freshener. To make your own

<!-- chunk -->

### air purifier, fill a spray bottle halfway with distilled water. Blend 30 drops of

<!-- chunk -->

### vegetable glycerin and about 20 drops of EO(s) for every 30 milliliters (1 fluid

<!-- chunk -->

### ounce) of water and then add this mixture to the spray bottle. Shake well and

<!-- chunk -->

### spray as you would any air freshener.

<!-- chunk -->

## Perfumes

<!-- chunk -->

### One can also get the benefit of EOs by using them as perfumes. Add 10–15

<!-- chunk -->

### drops of an EO to ¼ ounce of a massage oil and place in a bottle with a roll-on

<!-- chunk -->

### applicator to apply topically.

<!-- chunk -->

## Baths and Soaks

<!-- chunk -->

### To disperse EOs into a bath, first add 8–15 drops of the oils to 1 tablespoon of

<!-- chunk -->

### unscented natural liquid soap like Dr. Bronner’s Supermild Baby Soap or

<!-- chunk -->

### Nature’s Sunshine’s Sunshine Concentrate. Hold this mixture under the faucet

<!-- chunk -->

### while drawing the bath. This will disperse the EOs into the bath water. For a foot

<!-- chunk -->

### or hand soak, use about 4 drops in a teaspoon of liquid soap and add it to a

<!-- chunk -->

### container of water. Aromatic baths soothe muscular aches and pains, skin

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, circulation problems, tension, fatigue, and insomnia.

<!-- chunk -->

## Internal Use

<!-- chunk -->

### There is a big movement, popularized by essential oil companies, to use EOs

<!-- chunk -->

### internally. Although some EOs can be used internally, that is best left to well-

<!-- chunk -->

### trained aromatherapists. In fact, the use of oils internally comes from the French

<!-- chunk -->

### school, where it’s primarily medical doctors, trained in aromatherapy, who are

<!-- chunk -->

### using them internally. There are not many instances that the internal use of EOs

<!-- chunk -->

### offers better results than a cup of herb tea, so we don’t advise it. If you do decide

<!-- chunk -->

### to use them internally, please only use EOs that are GRAS (generally recognized

<!-- chunk -->

### as safe), and know that even then they should be well diluted to avoid mucosal

<!-- chunk -->

### irritation. EOs that are not GRAS should never be used internally, as they can

<!-- chunk -->

### have harmful effects when ingested. When using EOs internally, you must

<!-- chunk -->

### always dilute them. Because they do not dissolve readily in water, taking them

<!-- chunk -->

### with water is not a good idea, as the oils will float to the top of the water.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can also add EOs to herbal extracts to increase their potency, mask

<!-- chunk -->

### disagreeable flavors, or improve the taste. Generally speaking, add no more than

<!-- chunk -->

### 1–2 drops per 2 ounces of extract.

# FLOWER ESSENCES

<!-- chunk -->

### Flower essences are homeopathic-like remedies made from the flowers of plants.

<!-- chunk -->

### They help a person find healing on an emotional, rather than a physical or

<!-- chunk -->

### mental, level. Like homeopathy, flower essences are a form of energy medicine,

<!-- chunk -->

### but are not made to the exacting standards of homeopathics. Also, they are

<!-- chunk -->

### designed to affect a person’s emotional state rather than their physical

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Edward Bach, an English medical doctor and homeopath, discovered how

<!-- chunk -->

### to use flowers for emotional healing and created the first thirty-eight flower

<!-- chunk -->

### essence remedies. Dr. Bach was frustrated by the symptomatic approach of

<!-- chunk -->

### modern medicine. He felt that medical doctors focused too much on the

<!-- chunk -->

### pathology (the disease symptoms) and not enough on the patient.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bach was a pioneer in understanding gut microflora. He developed

<!-- chunk -->

### homeopathic “vaccines” called Bach nosodes to adjust the friendly flora of the

<!-- chunk -->

### gut to improve health. He also was an advocate of healthy diet and detoxification

<!-- chunk -->

### of the gastrointestinal tract as a route to good health.

<!-- chunk -->

### As he observed patients, however, he began to notice that certain infections

<!-- chunk -->

### and illnesses tended to go with certain personality traits. He also noticed that a

<!-- chunk -->

### patient’s emotional state had a lot to do with their ability to heal. Bach felt that

<!-- chunk -->

### unresolved emotional conflicts within the person created disharmony between

<!-- chunk -->

### the soul and the mind, which eventually led to physical illness. In Bach’s mind,

<!-- chunk -->

### health was created by restoring internal harmony, with health being “the true

<!-- chunk -->

### realization of what we are; we are perfect; we are children of God.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Bach wanted to create a system of healing that wouldn’t destroy living things

<!-- chunk -->

### and that would be gentle and effective in nature. In his search he found that

<!-- chunk -->

### homeopathic preparations of flowers could guide a person to greater emotional

<!-- chunk -->

### balance. He called these preparations flower essences, and more than eighty

<!-- chunk -->

### years later millions of people have benefited from Bach’s remedies. Also, since

<!-- chunk -->

### the time of Dr. Bach, many more flower essences have been discovered, so that

<!-- chunk -->

### today, there are hundreds of flower essences from dozens of suppliers that can

<!-- chunk -->

### help a person with just about any emotional issue one might face in life.

# HOW FLOWER ESSENCES WORK

<!-- chunk -->

### To understand how flower essences work, we need to understand that plants have

<!-- chunk -->

### to overcome challenges, just like we do. They may encounter extremes of

<!-- chunk -->

### temperature or moisture, harsh weather conditions (such as wind or rocky soil),

<!-- chunk -->

### and attacks by insects and animals. Plants, like people, have a “personality,”

<!-- chunk -->

### characteristics that help them rise above these challenges. The plant personality

<!-- chunk -->

### is found in its energy pattern, which can become apparent when we study how

<!-- chunk -->

### the plant grows and the form it takes in meeting its life challenges.

<!-- chunk -->

### Just as associating with a person with positive personality traits can help you

<!-- chunk -->

### learn how to meet life’s challenges in a constructive way, so can associating with

<!-- chunk -->

### the right plant energies. As Matthew Wood says in his book Seven Herbs: Plants

<!-- chunk -->

### as Teachers, every healing plant is the embodiment of a conflict in the

<!-- chunk -->

### environment that the plant has successfully overcome. By capturing the

<!-- chunk -->

### “vibration” of the plant’s personality through the flower, you can take that

<!-- chunk -->

### vibration into your own being and “learn” how to experience that same

<!-- chunk -->

### emotional energy. The plant “teaches” us on a vibrational level how to cope with

<!-- chunk -->

### life in a happy, peaceful, and loving manner.

<!-- chunk -->

### Flower essences are made by soaking flowers in pure spring water, usually in

<!-- chunk -->

### the sunlight, and then preserving the strained water with brandy. The resulting

<!-- chunk -->

### mother tincture is then diluted in a homeopathic-like manner to imprint the

<!-- chunk -->

### plant’s vibration into the flower essence remedy.

<!-- chunk -->

### When we take the flower essence, it floods our body with a positive vibration

<!-- chunk -->

### that can break through emotional blocks and help us to become more aware. This

<!-- chunk -->

### increased awareness helps us make constructive changes in our lives, which, in

<!-- chunk -->

### turn, helps us find our way back to a balanced emotional state of inner peace and

<!-- chunk -->

### happiness.

# MAKING FLOWER ESSENCES

<!-- chunk -->

### You can make your own flower essences using the following process.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step one: Obtain flowers from the plant at the peak of blooming. Place them in a

<!-- chunk -->

### glass bowl filled with clean spring water. Allow them to soak in the sunlight for

<!-- chunk -->

### 3–5 hours. If the plant blooms at night, gather the flowers at the height of their

<!-- chunk -->

### blooming and soak them (preferably under a full moon) for the same 3–5 hours.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step two: Pour off the water into a storage container, straining out the flowers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Preserve the flower water with an equal amount of brandy. This produces the

<!-- chunk -->

### flower essence mother tincture.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step three: Prepare a second bottle filled with a mixture of water and brandy.

<!-- chunk -->

### This bottle needs to be only about 20–25% brandy. To this bottle, add 5–6 drops

<!-- chunk -->

### of the mother tincture for each ounce of water in the new bottle. Put the lid on

<!-- chunk -->

### this bottle and shake it vigorously up and down against the palm of your hand

<!-- chunk -->

### about 10 times. This creates the stock bottle, the preparation the practitioner

<!-- chunk -->

### keeps on the shelf.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step four: Dilute the stock tincture in the identical manner as described in step

<!-- chunk -->

### three to create a dosage bottle. The dosage bottle is what the practitioner gives to

<!-- chunk -->

### the client. You can add about 1–5 different flower essences to the dosage bottle.


<!-- chunk -->

## CHAPTER ELEVEN

# Formulas and Dosages

<!-- chunk -->

## DESIGNING HERBAL FORMULAS AND USING HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

## EFFECTIVELY

<!-- chunk -->

### his chapter covers two very critical considerations in herbalism—how to

<!-- chunk -->

### combine herbs together effectively and how to determine the effective dose.

<!-- chunk -->

### These topics are important because they help a person get the results they want

<!-- chunk -->

### from herbal remedies. We’ll cover the principles of herbal formulation first and

<!-- chunk -->

### how to determine dosages second.

# PRINCIPLES OF HERB FORMULATION

<!-- chunk -->

### It is frustrating for an experienced herbalist to see books that describe the actions

<!-- chunk -->

### of herbal combinations by listing all the properties of the individual single herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### they contain. Such information gives the illusion that by taking this particular

<!-- chunk -->

### formula one can derive all of the benefits of each herb in the product as if each

<!-- chunk -->

### herb were being taken separately. This is simply not the case.

<!-- chunk -->

### Just as the action of a single herb is different from the individual actions of its

<!-- chunk -->

### constituents or so-called active ingredients, the total action of a formula is

<!-- chunk -->

### different from the action of its individual herbs. It is no different from the effect

<!-- chunk -->

### of cooking with foods; a complete dish is different from its individual

<!-- chunk -->

### ingredients. The ingredients blend to form a new creation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even if you’re not going to design herbal formulas, you may take more than

<!-- chunk -->

### one herb at the same time. When you do this, you are creating a formula,

<!-- chunk -->

### because the herbs interact with each other. Basically, some herbs will enhance or

<!-- chunk -->

### increase the activity of each other, whereas other herbs will counteract or

<!-- chunk -->

### diminish each other’s effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is largely based on simple common sense. For instance, if one mixes an

<!-- chunk -->

### herb that stimulates the peristalsis of the colon with an herb that restrains the

<!-- chunk -->

### peristalsis of the colon, one cannot claim that the mixture will cure both diarrhea

<!-- chunk -->

### and constipation. Quite the contrary: the contradictory actions may result in the

<!-- chunk -->

### formula being good for neither.

# FORMULAS VERSUS SINGLES

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbs can be used as single remedies in much the same way that homeopathic

<!-- chunk -->

### remedies are. Each herb has a unique combination of actions and properties, and

<!-- chunk -->

### when a person’s overall symptom picture very closely matches that of a single

<!-- chunk -->

### herb, very powerful effects can be created using single remedies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Using herbs in this manner requires a great deal of knowledge and skill,

<!-- chunk -->

### however. Most herbalists give their clients more than one remedy, which means

<!-- chunk -->

### they are creating a custom formula for the client. So herbs are more often used in

<!-- chunk -->

### combinations than they are as singles.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most herb books focus primarily on single herbs, but ironically, it’s harder for

<!-- chunk -->

### a beginner to see results with single herbs than it is with well-crafted herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### formulas. It can be likened to the difference between using a rifle and a shotgun

<!-- chunk -->

### to hit a target. Using single herbs is like using a rifle. It has a lot of power, but

<!-- chunk -->

### you have to know how to aim it properly to hit the target.

<!-- chunk -->

### A formula, on the other hand, is like a shotgun. You may not hit the target

<!-- chunk -->

### with as much concentrated force, but your aim doesn’t have to be as good. This

<!-- chunk -->

### is because an herbal formula combines many herbs that work on multiple causes

<!-- chunk -->

### of a problem. Using St. John’s wort, an herb that is often used for depression, as

<!-- chunk -->

### an example, we would find that St. John’s wort would help a person’s depression

<!-- chunk -->

### only if it is the kind of depression that St. John’s wort works best on (depression

<!-- chunk -->

### related to anxiety and intestinal problems).

<!-- chunk -->

### However, if we mix several herbs together that work on several different

<!-- chunk -->

### underlying causes of depression, a person is more likely to get at least some

<!-- chunk -->

### benefit. This is partially because the formula is composed of herbs that address

<!-- chunk -->

### multiple potential root causes of a problem. It is also partly because the synergy

<!-- chunk -->

### of the ingredients often enhances the basic action, and because the multiple

<!-- chunk -->

### ingredients tend to counteract some of the other effects of the single herbs,

<!-- chunk -->

### which also lessens the chance of the remedy throwing the body out of balance in

<!-- chunk -->

### other ways.

<!-- chunk -->

### To paraphrase Michael Moore, a famous southwestern herbalist, single herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### have subtle and deep actions. Combinations tone down those subtleties to a gray

<!-- chunk -->

### background noise and leave the predominant effects of the herb intact. The

<!-- chunk -->

### literature of the Eclectics, a group of medical doctors who used herbs in the

<!-- chunk -->

### nineteenth century, emphasized utilizing the subtle effects of the herbs and

<!-- chunk -->

### matching all of a person’s problems to one herb. However, in actual practice,

<!-- chunk -->

### they frequently resorted to tried and true formulas.

<!-- chunk -->

### Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) also relies heavily on formulas. Basic

<!-- chunk -->

### formulas are used for certain situations, with the ingredients being modified to

<!-- chunk -->

### fit individual needs.

# CREATING HERBAL FORMULAS

<!-- chunk -->

### People unskilled in herbalism often create “kitchen sink” formulas, where they

<!-- chunk -->

### simply blend together everything that has been historically used for a particular

<!-- chunk -->

### health problem, thinking that this will be highly effective. This does not take into

<!-- chunk -->

### account the idea of herbal energetics, however. The principle of energetics tells

<!-- chunk -->

### us that some herbs will enhance each other’s effects, whereas some herbs will

<!-- chunk -->

### counter each other’s effects. So, randomly mixing herbs together does not

<!-- chunk -->

### always yield more effective results.

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbal Formulas and Energetics

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal energetics refers to the ability of herbs to move the body’s energies in

<!-- chunk -->

### specific directions. We use a model of energetics based on six tissue states and

<!-- chunk -->

### six basic directions of action. Without going into great detail, here are the basics.

<!-- chunk -->

### First, herbs can affect metabolism in two general directions. Cooling herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce irritation and excess heat (inflammation and fever). Warming herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### relieve depression and cold (underactivity of organs and tissues). Warming herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### and cooling herbs have opposite actions, which means they tend to restrain each

<!-- chunk -->

### other’s effects. We use the term “neutral” to describe herbs that are neither

<!-- chunk -->

### warming nor cooling.

<!-- chunk -->

### Second, herbs affect the balance of minerals and fluids in the body. Drying

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs treat stagnation and water retention, drying up excess fluids, reducing

<!-- chunk -->

### swelling, shrinking swollen lymph nodes, and otherwise tightening tissues by

<!-- chunk -->

### removing excess moisture. Moistening herbs restore flexibility and tissue

<!-- chunk -->

### function in atrophy, which means they are used when tissues are dry, hard,

<!-- chunk -->

### brittle, or inflexible. Again, these two actions move the tissues of the body in

<!-- chunk -->

### opposite directions, so they tend to counteract and restrain each other. We use the

<!-- chunk -->

### term “balancing” to describe herbs that help to bring tissues back to normal from

<!-- chunk -->

### either stagnation or atrophy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Third, herbs can affect muscle tone, relaxing the body to promote flow and

<!-- chunk -->

### secretion, or tightening tissues to reduce flow and secretion. Relaxing herbs ease

<!-- chunk -->

### muscle spasms and improve the flow of energy and fluids by easing constriction.

<!-- chunk -->

### Constricting herbs stop leakage by toning up tissue relaxation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Finally, we use the term “nourishing” to describe herbs that work primarily by

<!-- chunk -->

### providing nutrients that help the body heal itself and restore normal function.

<!-- chunk -->

### These herbs tend to not move the body’s energies strongly in any direction,

<!-- chunk -->

### although they might be slightly warming or cooling, or slightly moistening or

<!-- chunk -->

### drying.

<!-- chunk -->

### So, the first step in creating an herbal formula is to decide the primary

<!-- chunk -->

### energetic you want the formula to have: warming or drying, cooling or

<!-- chunk -->

### moistening, relaxing or nourishing, and so forth. To get this effect, combine

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs into a formula with a similar energetic.

<!-- chunk -->

## Body Systems and Properties

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to considering energetics, you can also design formulas to target

<!-- chunk -->

### specific organs and body systems. Because herbs have affinity for organs and

<!-- chunk -->

### tissues, you can blend herbs to support the structure and function of specific

<!-- chunk -->

### body systems. For example, you can create digestive formulas, respiratory

<!-- chunk -->

### formulas, nervous system formulas, or a formula targeted specifically to the

<!-- chunk -->

### liver, heart, or brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbs also have certain properties, meaning they affect the structure and

<!-- chunk -->

### function of the body in specific ways. By blending herbs with similar properties,

<!-- chunk -->

### you can create a synergistic effect, making the formula have very specific

<!-- chunk -->

### healing actions. For instance, you could create nervine formulas, diuretic

<!-- chunk -->

### formulas, alterative or blood purifying formulas, or hepatoprotective formulas.

<!-- chunk -->

### In contrast, herbal formulas will be less therapeutic and more nourishing in

<!-- chunk -->

### their effects when herbs are combined in ways that cancel out their energetic

<!-- chunk -->

### effects and properties. This prevents the formula from having a specific action or

<!-- chunk -->

### moving the body’s energies strongly in any direction.

<!-- chunk -->

## A Plan for Designing Formulas

<!-- chunk -->

### We use a system for creating herbal formulas based on four major components.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is not necessary to use all four components in any formula, but we usually

<!-- chunk -->

### create formulas using at least 2–3 of them. These components are key herbs,

<!-- chunk -->

### supporting herbs, balancing or harmonizing herbs, and catalysts.

<!-- chunk -->

## Key Herbs A key herb is one that has the primary action you want the formula to

<!-- chunk -->

### have. So, if you want the formula to have primarily an energetic action, you

<!-- chunk -->

### choose a single herb that has a very strong energetic. For example, if you want a

<!-- chunk -->

### warming formula, you might choose an herb like capsicum or ginger.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can also choose a key herb based on organ affinity. So, if you want your

<!-- chunk -->

### formula to be focused on the heart, you might choose hawthorn as a key herb. If

<!-- chunk -->

### you want your formula to be a liver formula, you might choose milk thistle.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can also choose a key herb that has a specific property you want. For

<!-- chunk -->

### example, if you want to create a stimulating diuretic formula, you might choose

<!-- chunk -->

### juniper berries as a key herb. If you want the formula to help a person go to

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep, you might choose hops or scullcap as a key herb.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your key herb can have a combination of any or all of the above. For example,

<!-- chunk -->

### hawthorn is well known as a heart herb and has cooling and toning effects on the

<!-- chunk -->

### heart. So, you could use it as a key herb for a formula designed to reduce cardiac

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation and to tone or strengthen the heart.

<!-- chunk -->

### Think of the key herb as the king or emperor of the formula; it directs the

<!-- chunk -->

### action of the other ingredients. Generally speaking, a formula will have only one

<!-- chunk -->

### or possibly two key herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

## Supporting Herbs Supporting herbs are like the advisers to the king or emperor.

<!-- chunk -->

### They may have a similar action to the key herb(s) or may somehow enhance the

<!-- chunk -->

### action(s) of the key herb. A supporting herb may also be used to “fill in” effects

<!-- chunk -->

### wanted in the formula that are not supplied by the key herb(s). So, in the

<!-- chunk -->

### previously mentioned idea of using hawthorn in a heart formula, you might add

<!-- chunk -->

### motherwort to calm the heart rate.

<!-- chunk -->

## Balancing or Harmonizing Herbs These are optional ingredients in any

<!-- chunk -->

### formula. They help to harmonize the action of the whole formula. Balancing or

<!-- chunk -->

### harmonizing herbs may reduce an undesirable side effect of the key herb. For

<!-- chunk -->

### example, cascara sagrada tends to cause intestinal cramping. To counteract this,

<!-- chunk -->

### you might add an antispasmodic like lobelia to the formula.

<!-- chunk -->

### You might also add a balancing herb to help counteract a disagreeable flavor

<!-- chunk -->

### in the key and/or supporting herbs. For instance, licorice root is often added as a

<!-- chunk -->

### balancing herb in bitter formulas, as it adds a sweet flavor that reduces the bitter

<!-- chunk -->

### taste.

<!-- chunk -->

### Traditional Chinese herbalists nearly always use balancing herbs in their

<!-- chunk -->

### formulas. They add just a small amount of herbs that have exactly the opposite

<!-- chunk -->

### effect as the key herb(s) in order to make the formula more balanced. In other

<!-- chunk -->

### words, if they are creating a warming formula, they add a small amount of

<!-- chunk -->

### cooling herbs to balance out the warming nature of their key and supporting

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

## Catalysts These are herbs that help activate the formula or make it work more

<!-- chunk -->

### quickly. In Western herbal formulas, these are usually small amounts of an

<!-- chunk -->

### aromatic or pungent herb like capsicum or ginger. John Christopher used lobelia

<!-- chunk -->

### and capsicum in small amounts as catalysts in nearly all of his formulas.

<!-- chunk -->

### Traditional Chinese herbalists often use licorice root or ginger as catalysts. We

<!-- chunk -->

### often use aromatic herbs as catalysts in our formulas.

<!-- chunk -->

## Determining Parts Once you have selected all the herbs for the formula, use

<!-- chunk -->

### them in parts as follows:

<!-- chunk -->

### 1–2 key herbs (8–16 parts per herb)

<!-- chunk -->

### 2–4 supporting herbs (4–8 parts per herb)

<!-- chunk -->

### 0–3 balancing herbs (2–4 parts per herb)

<!-- chunk -->

### 0–2 catalysts (1–2 parts per herb)

<!-- chunk -->

### Parts are measured in weight, so a part could be a milligram or an ounce in

<!-- chunk -->

### making a small batch, or a kilogram or a pound in making a large batch. So, for

<!-- chunk -->

### example, we might make a formula with proportions as follows.

<!-- chunk -->

### 8 ounces key herb

<!-- chunk -->

### 4 ounces supporting herb

<!-- chunk -->

### 4 ounces supporting herb

<!-- chunk -->

### 2 ounces supporting herb

<!-- chunk -->

### 2 ounces balancing herb

<!-- chunk -->

### 1 ounce balancing herb

<!-- chunk -->

### 1 ounce catalyst

<!-- chunk -->

### If you examine many of the formulas we have included as examples in

<!-- chunk -->

### Chapter Twelve, you will gain greater insight into how to use this system to

<!-- chunk -->

### create effective formulas. We recommend that you learn to adjust formula

<!-- chunk -->

### ingredients by tasting the formula, just as a good chef always tastes the food he

<!-- chunk -->

### is preparing. You can adjust proportions to get just the effects you want, as well

<!-- chunk -->

### as to improve the overall flavor and appeal.

# DETERMINING DOSAGES

<!-- chunk -->

### Part of learning to use herbs correctly is learning how to dose them properly.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbalists use a broad range of dosages, from single-drop doses of tinctures to

<!-- chunk -->

### bulk doses of herbs in near food quantities.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because of this, dosage, especially of tinctures, sometimes becomes a point of

<!-- chunk -->

### contention in Western herbal medicine. Some professional herbalists favor large

<!-- chunk -->

### doses (5 milliliters), whereas others use drop doses (1–5 drops), of most

<!-- chunk -->

### common tinctures. We believe that both drop doses and substantial doses have

<!-- chunk -->

### their place in herbal medicine, and we’ve listed both types of doses with specific

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs in Chapter Thirteen.

<!-- chunk -->

### The theory is that small doses of tinctured plants contain the essence, or

<!-- chunk -->

### energetic signature, of the plant. When matched to a person correctly, they act in

<!-- chunk -->

### a subtle yet powerful way through an unknown mechanism of action. On the

<!-- chunk -->

### other hand, substantial doses of herbs act through their chemical constituents to

<!-- chunk -->

### influence physiology and pathology.

# THE DROP

<!-- chunk -->

### Although the dosages for many tinctures are given in drops, the drop was never a

<!-- chunk -->

### good way to measure fluid volume. The size of a drop varies depending on the

<!-- chunk -->

### size of the dropper, the technique used to produce the drop, and the density and

<!-- chunk -->

### surface tension of the liquid. In pure water there are about 20 drops per milliliter,

<!-- chunk -->

### in pure alcohol there are about 60 drops per milliliter, and in pure vegetable

<!-- chunk -->

### glycerin there are about 12 drops per milliliter. Most tinctures are a mixture of

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol and water (a hydroalcoholic extract). For a standard low-proof tincture

<!-- chunk -->

### (25%–40% EtOH) you can assume around 22–28 drops in 1 milliliter. For a

<!-- chunk -->

### high-proof tincture (80%–90% EtOH) there are around 35 drops per milliliter.

<!-- chunk -->

### These differences in drop size led English pharmacists in 1809 to adopt the

<!-- chunk -->

### minim as an alternative to the drop. The minim is measured in a graduated

<!-- chunk -->

### pipette called a minimometer. A minim is described as exactly 61.611519921875

<!-- chunk -->

### microliters.

<!-- chunk -->

### Knowing the exact number of drops in a milliliter or even a minim is not

<!-- chunk -->

### really necessary in modern herbalism. The only time dosing by the drop is

<!-- chunk -->

### important is if you are taking a low-dose (toxic) botanical. Low-dose botanicals

<!-- chunk -->

### should be made according to an official dispensatory and dosed as that

<!-- chunk -->

### dispensatory advises. We prefer either The Dispensatory of the United States of

<!-- chunk -->

### America by Remington, Wood, and colleagues (1918) or King’s American

<!-- chunk -->

### Dispensatory (1898). Drop doses of low-dose botanicals are most often added to

<!-- chunk -->

### a large volume of water and given in teaspoonful doses, making them safer than

<!-- chunk -->

### if they were given in direct drop doses.

# DOSING STRATEGIES FOR ADULTS

<!-- chunk -->

### We have included the standard adult dosages for all of the formulas and single

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs in this book. When purchasing commercial herbal formulas or single

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs, assume that the recommended dose on the bottle is for an average weight

<!-- chunk -->

### person of around 150 pounds.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lower-range dosages are used for people who are smaller than average or who

<!-- chunk -->

### react with sensitivity to herbs and supplements. Use higher-range doses for

<!-- chunk -->

### larger people or people who are less sensitive to herbs and supplements. You can

<!-- chunk -->

### also adjust the dose upward if the results you’re getting aren’t strong enough or

<!-- chunk -->

### the condition is more severe.

<!-- chunk -->

### Develop your intuition when dosing herbs by paying attention to your own

<!-- chunk -->

### body, especially when using liquids. Generally speaking, a formula will be

<!-- chunk -->

### tolerable (or even taste good) only as long as you need it. As soon as you have

<!-- chunk -->

### taken enough, the taste changes and you will not want any more. (An exception

<!-- chunk -->

### to this is digestive tonics: although you might not like the bitter taste to begin

<!-- chunk -->

### with, most of the time you begin to tolerate or even enjoy it within a few days.)

# DOSING STRATEGIES FOR CHILDREN

<!-- chunk -->

### Many herbalists calculate children’s dosages by age, but calculating by weight is

<!-- chunk -->

### just as easy and probably a bit more accurate.

<!-- chunk -->

## Clark’s Rule (for children ages two to seventeen)

<!-- chunk -->

### Divide the child’s weight in pounds by 150 (which is the weight that is assumed

<!-- chunk -->

### for adults when calculating adult doses) and multiply the result by the adult dose

<!-- chunk -->

### to find the equivalent child’s dosage.

<!-- chunk -->

### (Weight in pounds ÷ 150) × adult dose = child’s dose

<!-- chunk -->

### If the adult dose of a tincture is 5 milliliters and the child weighs 30 pounds,

<!-- chunk -->

### divide the weight (30) by 150: 30/150 = ⅕. Multiply ⅕ times the adult dose (5

<!-- chunk -->

### milliliters) to get 1 milliliter.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fried’s Rule (for children under two years old)

<!-- chunk -->

### Divide the age of the child (in months) by 150. Multiply the result by the adult

<!-- chunk -->

### dose.

<!-- chunk -->

### (Age of child in months ÷ 150) × average adult dose = child’s dose

<!-- chunk -->

### If the adult dose of tincture is 2 milliliters and the child is one year (12

<!-- chunk -->

### months) old, divide the age of the child (12 months) by 150 to get 0.08. Multiply

<!-- chunk -->

### this by the adult dose (2 milliliters) to get 0.16 milliliters for the child’s dose.

<!-- chunk -->

### In a normal hydroalcoholic (water plus alcohol) extract there are around

<!-- chunk -->

### drops per milliliter. Multiply 0.16 times 25 to get 4 drops per dose.

# EXPECTED RESULTS

<!-- chunk -->

### It doesn’t take forever to see results. The following are general guidelines for

<!-- chunk -->

### when you should begin to see improvement if you are on the right track.

<!-- chunk -->

### With acute illnesses, small, frequent doses work best. Dose every 15 minutes

<!-- chunk -->

### up to every 2 hours. You should see improvement within 1–3 hours.

<!-- chunk -->

### Subacute illness happens when you don’t treat an acute illness and it lingers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dose every 2–4 hours or 4–8 times daily. You should see improvement within

<!-- chunk -->

### 24–48 hours.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic illness is illness that has been around for more than a week or two.

<!-- chunk -->

### When dealing with chronic conditions, dosing is usually 2–4 times daily. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement should occur within 7–10 days.

<!-- chunk -->

### Degenerative illness occurs when the body is extremely run-down. Dosing

<!-- chunk -->

### strategies are similar to those for chronic illness, but it takes as long as 1–3

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks to see any significant improvement.

<!-- chunk -->

### daily as needed.

# GARLIC LEMON AID

<!-- chunk -->

### This is a simple, but great formula for fighting colds and respiratory infections.

## CHAPTER THIRTEEN

# Single Herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARING AND USING SINGLE HERBS

<!-- chunk -->

### his chapter provides you with instructions for preparing and using

<!-- chunk -->

### single herbs. We’ve included information about each plant’s energetics and

<!-- chunk -->

### properties as well as warnings. We’ve also listed which major bulk herb

<!-- chunk -->

### suppliers carry the herb. Directions for making preparations are starting

<!-- chunk -->

### suggestions; feel free to experiment.

# AÇAÍ

<!-- chunk -->

## Latin name: Euterpe oleracea

<!-- chunk -->

### Like other berries, açaí berries are loaded with antioxidants that help to protect

<!-- chunk -->

### cells from damage that may lead to chronic diseases such as heart disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes, and cancer. Açaí berry contains vitamin A, fiber, calcium, iron,

<!-- chunk -->

### essential fatty acids (omega-9), anthocyanins (antioxidant), and polysterols. The

<!-- chunk -->

### Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry published a 2008 study showing

<!-- chunk -->

### that the açaí berry has more antioxidants than blackberries, blueberries,

<!-- chunk -->

### strawberries, and raspberries, but fewer antioxidants than red wine and

<!-- chunk -->

### pomegranate juice.


<!-- chunk -->

### Cooling and nourishing


<!-- chunk -->

### Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and nutritive

### helpful for those with cloudy, smelly urine and for those with incontinence. It

<!-- chunk -->

### also has an energetic action on the nervous system and helps to relieve emotional

<!-- chunk -->

### tension. Its indication as a flower remedy is a good guide to its herbal use—it

<!-- chunk -->

### helps people who mask their pain behind a facade of cheerfulness. It’s helpful

<!-- chunk -->

### for people who have a tense pulse and appear friendly and cheerful, but are

<!-- chunk -->

### actually very tense and stressed. It is a great urinary tract remedy and helps

<!-- chunk -->

### urinary tract infections and cystitis. It also helps constricted liver chi, a pattern in

<!-- chunk -->

### traditional Chinese medicine that is commonly seen in many Americans. This

<!-- chunk -->

### involves an inner resistance, anger, or frustration that constricts blood flow to the

<!-- chunk -->

### liver and creates a tense, wiry pulse. Agrimony relaxes blood flow to the liver

<!-- chunk -->

### and helps a person relax and go with the flow of life.


<!-- chunk -->

### Drying and relaxing

<!-- chunk -->

### Echinacea aids the process of antibody formation and stimulates the production

<!-- chunk -->

### of white blood cells. It helps to strengthen and clear lymph nodes. It inhibits

<!-- chunk -->

### hyaluronidase (an enzyme produced by bacteria that breaks down compounds

<!-- chunk -->

### that bind cells together), thus inhibiting the spread of infection. Echinacea also

<!-- chunk -->

### helps the body fight viral infections. Echinacea is a wonderful herb to use

<!-- chunk -->

### topically for infections. It is often used to treat colds and flu, but is actually not

<!-- chunk -->

### overused for many applications when other herbs would be just as effective.


<!-- chunk -->

### disease. It enhances circulation, lowers blood pressure, and protects the heart. It

# YARROW

<!-- chunk -->

## Latin name: Achillea millefolium

<!-- chunk -->

### Yarrow’s hemostatic properties (ability to stem bleeding) made it the medication

<!-- chunk -->

### of choice for treating war injuries in ancient times. Yarrow leaves were

<!-- chunk -->

### traditionally applied to wounds to stop bleeding. Its hemostatic effects are not as

<!-- chunk -->

### reliable as proper bandaging and pressure, so it’s rarely used for bleeding now.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, yarrow can be taken internally to stop internal bleeding. Yarrow

### flowers are also a strong diaphoretic and are used to cool high fevers and help

<!-- chunk -->

### the body fight infection. A warm tea of yarrow is one of the best remedies for

<!-- chunk -->

### inducing a sweat and breaking a fever. Add a little peppermint to improve the

<!-- chunk -->

### flavor. The flowers are highest in the volatile oil during dry weather, so a fresh

<!-- chunk -->

### flower tincture or sealed simmer glycerite made from flowers gathered after a 3-

### (0.05–0.2 tsp.) 3 times daily; dried flowers (1:6), 1–3 ml (0.2–0.6 tsp.) 3 times

<!-- chunk -->

### daily; add full dose to a cup of hot water for an instant diaphoretic tea.


<!-- chunk -->

### An infusion can be used as a soak or as a compress. The tincture

<!-- chunk -->

### can be applied to bites and stings, or used as a wound wash (it burns).

# YELLOW DOCK

<!-- chunk -->

## Latin name: Rumex crispus

<!-- chunk -->

### Yellow dock is high in organic iron compounds and seems to free iron stored in

<!-- chunk -->

### the liver. This makes it useful for anemia, especially when combined with

<!-- chunk -->

### alfalfa, beets, and other iron-rich herbs. It is also used as a blood purifier for skin

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders (acne, boils, etc.) and general liver problems. It stimulates the flow of

<!-- chunk -->

### bile and acts as a mild laxative while reducing heat and irritation in the digestive

<!-- chunk -->

### tract. It is especially indicated when a person has a geographic tongue (a tongue

<!-- chunk -->

### with heavily coated patches and bare, bright-red areas) and intestinal

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation with constipation.


<!-- chunk -->

### Alterative (blood purifier), aperient, cholagogue, and hepatic


<!-- chunk -->

### Felter: Vitiated blood, with skin disorders; low glandular

<!-- chunk -->

### and cellular deposits, with tendency to ulceration. Dyspnea, with epigastric

<!-- chunk -->

### fullness and pectoral distress. Anorexia, with disturbed nutrition.


<!-- chunk -->

### 2–4 ounces 2 times daily


<!-- chunk -->

### Fresh root (1:2, 95% alcohol); dried root (1:5, 60% alcohol); 10 drops

<!-- chunk -->

### to 2 ml (0.4 tsp.) 3 times daily

<!-- chunk -->

### Antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antifungal


<!-- chunk -->

### Freshly dried (1:4, 75% alcohol); fresh root (1:2, 95% alcohol, 10%

<!-- chunk -->

### glycerin); 10 drops to 2 ml (0.4 tsp.) 3 times daily

# YERBA SANTA

<!-- chunk -->

## Latin name: Eriodictyon californicum

<!-- chunk -->

### A warming and stimulating expectorant, yerba santa clears phlegm from the

<!-- chunk -->

### chest and opens air passages. It is a reliable herb for most respiratory problems,

<!-- chunk -->

### but is especially helpful for asthma, profuse expectoration, and respiratory

<!-- chunk -->

### complaints with obscure symptoms. It is also an effective diuretic and urinary

<!-- chunk -->

### antiseptic. It can be applied topically to insect bites and stings, poison oak and

<!-- chunk -->

### ivy, bruises, sprains, and cuts.


<!-- chunk -->

### Decongestant and expectorant

# YOHIMBE

<!-- chunk -->

## Latin name: Pausinystalia johimbe

<!-- chunk -->

### Yohimbe causes dilation of blood vessels, including those in the genitalia, thus

<!-- chunk -->

### helping men to achieve an erection. Unfortunately it’s also likely to cause

<!-- chunk -->

### elevated blood pressure and heart rate, agitation, and even mania. In short,

<!-- chunk -->

### yohimbe has some nasty side effects, and we feel that the benefits don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### outweigh the cost. We don’t recommend using it.


<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid long-term use, as it can irritate the urinary tract.

<!-- chunk -->

### Contraindicated in cases of emaciation or inflammation.

## APPENDIX ONE

# Herbal Hydrotherapy

<!-- chunk -->

## COMBINING HERBS AND WATER FOR HEALING

<!-- chunk -->

### Hydrotherapy is a term that means water therapy, which is the use of water for

<!-- chunk -->

### therapeutic purposes. Water can be used as ice, hot or cold water, or steam to

<!-- chunk -->

### help ease pain, improve circulation, reduce inflammation, detoxify the body, or

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulate healing. Hydrotherapy treatments include enemas and douches, baths,

<!-- chunk -->

### foot soaks, and steams.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal hydrotherapy combines these water therapies with herbs. Herbs and

<!-- chunk -->

### water are powerful allies in healing a wide variety of ailments. This appendix

<!-- chunk -->

### covers the various ways of combining hydrotherapy and herbs for healing.

# ENEMAS

<!-- chunk -->

### Enemas can be an important therapeutic aid for healing the colon. They can be

<!-- chunk -->

### used to hydrate the bowel and cleanse the body. They are even more effective

<!-- chunk -->

### when herbs are added to the water used in the enema.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal enemas can be used to:

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Cleanse the colon by removing large intestinal impactions

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Soothe colon irritation and inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Promote healing of colon tissues

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Relax bowel spasms and ease severe gas and bloating

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Reduce fevers (the majority of all fevers in children will come down once the

<!-- chunk -->

### colon is cleared)

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Relieve respiratory and lymphatic congestion

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Restore healthy intestinal flora (when probiotics or healthy fecal material are

<!-- chunk -->

### used in the enema)

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Get rid of intestinal parasites

# HERBAL ENEMA SOLUTIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal enemas have been used extensively in Ayurveda (basti) and traditional

<!-- chunk -->

### Chinese medicine, with many of the most popular herbs either being nutritive or

<!-- chunk -->

### having strong antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.

<!-- chunk -->

### Start by making the herbal enema solution using either 2 cups of a very strong

<!-- chunk -->

### tea or decoction per quart of water used in the enema, or add ½–2 teaspoons of

<!-- chunk -->

### tinctures or glycerites per quart of water. The water may be warm or cool,

<!-- chunk -->

### depending on the situation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some good herbs for enemas include catnip (for fevers), pau d’arco (for

<!-- chunk -->

### fungal infections), lobelia or lavender (for spasms), aloe vera (for inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### and tissue healing), Oregon grape (for infection), and anise (for gas and

<!-- chunk -->

### bloating). Several of the formulas in Chapter Twelve work very well as an

<!-- chunk -->

### enema. These include: Herbal Composition, Children’s Composition, and Herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### Crisis. These formulas are helpful for enemas for colds, fever, and congestion.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Herbal Crisis formula is particularly useful for clearing out sticky fecal

<!-- chunk -->

### matter as it loosens mucus.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can make an enema for infections using raw garlic. Place 1 clove raw

<!-- chunk -->

### garlic per quart of water in a blender. Blend thoroughly, then strain the solution,

<!-- chunk -->

### and use small amounts as a rectal injection. This works well for respiratory

<!-- chunk -->

### infections and fevers.

# HOW TO TAKE THE ENEMA

<!-- chunk -->

### Always test the enema solution to make sure it is warm, not hot or cold. If you

<!-- chunk -->

### place a couple of drops on your wrist (like testing a baby bottle), it should feel

<!-- chunk -->

### neutral, slightly warm, or slightly cool in temperature. Add cool or warm water

<!-- chunk -->

### to adjust the temperature if necessary, then put the enema solution into the

<!-- chunk -->

### enema bag or bucket. Release the catch on the tube and allow the solution to

<!-- chunk -->

### flow through the tube to clear all the air out of the tube, then close the catch.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lubricate the end of the enema tip and the rectal area with a petroleum jelly

<!-- chunk -->

### (Vaseline®), herbal salve, or other lubricant. Lie down on your left side and

<!-- chunk -->

### gently insert the tip into the rectum. Release the catch, and allow the solution to

<!-- chunk -->

### flow into the colon.

<!-- chunk -->

### During this process, anytime you feel pain or discomfort, stop the flow of

<!-- chunk -->

### enema solution. Wait a minute or two and perhaps even lightly massage the area

<!-- chunk -->

### where you feel the pain and discomfort. If it does not go away, then use the

<!-- chunk -->

### toilet, expelling the liquid and waste material. Then start again.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once the fluid flows freely into the colon while you are lying on your left

<!-- chunk -->

### side, you can move to your back and continue the procedure. Finish the

<!-- chunk -->

### procedure by lying on your right side.

<!-- chunk -->

### To do what is called a “high enema,” when you clear the entire colon from

<!-- chunk -->

### ascending to descending, you may need to fill the bag or enema bucket several

<!-- chunk -->

### times. In fact, the first few times you try this, you may not be able to do this at

<!-- chunk -->

### all. You may encounter spasms or other obstructions that won’t want to move.

<!-- chunk -->

### Don’t worry about this; just cleanse the colon as far as it wants to go.

<!-- chunk -->

### Don’t be discouraged; it took me several months of doing an enema once per

<!-- chunk -->

### week before I was able to get fluid past the halfway point in my colon due to a

<!-- chunk -->

### muscle spasm in my transverse colon. I finally learned to use lobelia or lavender

<!-- chunk -->

### oil (mentioned above) to relax that spasm and clean out the entire length of the

<!-- chunk -->

### colon.

# GIVING AN ENEMA TO A CHILD

<!-- chunk -->

### When giving a child or an infant an enema, you use a syringe. There are special

<!-- chunk -->

### syringes made just for giving enemas, but a regular bulb syringe can also be

<!-- chunk -->

### used. Prepare the enema solution and test the temperature as before.

<!-- chunk -->

### Place a towel on the floor and lay the child on his or her back or left side on

<!-- chunk -->

### the towel. When doing this with a baby, place a diaper on top of the towel.

<!-- chunk -->

### Explain to the child that this procedure will be uncomfortable, but it will help

<!-- chunk -->

### him or her feel better. Be gentle and patient. If you were taking the child to the

<!-- chunk -->

### doctor, the child might have to get a shot or have blood drawn, which would hurt

<!-- chunk -->

### far more, but you’d probably make the child hold still for that anyway, so think

<!-- chunk -->

### of it in this same manner. An enema is nowhere near as painful as a shot, and

<!-- chunk -->

### you can explain this to a child.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lubricate the anal opening and the tip of the syringe. Fill the syringe with the

<!-- chunk -->

### enema solution by squeezing the syringe and then sucking up the solution. Turn

<!-- chunk -->

### the syringe upright and squeeze any remaining air out of it. Fill it the rest of the

<!-- chunk -->

### way, so that the syringe is completely full. Gently insert the tip of the syringe

<!-- chunk -->

### into the anus. Then give a gentle squeeze. If you encounter strong resistance, or

<!-- chunk -->

### the child seems to be in pain, stop squeezing and withdraw the syringe. Make

<!-- chunk -->

### sure you don’t “suck” with the syringe as you withdraw.

<!-- chunk -->

### If nothing comes out, repeat the process. It may take several tries before

<!-- chunk -->

### anything passes, but don’t be concerned; just be patient. Putting in a small

<!-- chunk -->

### amount of fluid every 5 minutes will not hurt the bowel. In fact, often small

<!-- chunk -->

### children get dehydrated from not drinking enough fluids when they are feverish

<!-- chunk -->

### or sick, so the body could be absorbing all of the liquid that you have put into the

<!-- chunk -->

### bowel.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tell an older child they can go “potty” if they feel that they need to. If they

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t, repeat the process. Then wait a minute or two and put a little more fluid

<!-- chunk -->

### in.

<!-- chunk -->

### With a baby, on the other hand, put a diaper on the baby’s bottom after putting

<!-- chunk -->

### one syringe-full into the rectum, and then wrap the diaper in a towel. (Enemas

<!-- chunk -->

### can make the stool “runny,” and you don’t want it to leak onto you.) Then cuddle

<!-- chunk -->

### and hold the baby for a few minutes. If nothing comes out after about 10–20

<!-- chunk -->

### minutes, repeat the procedure.

<!-- chunk -->

### The stool should be soft. If only a small amount of hard stool is passed, you

<!-- chunk -->

### may still need to repeat the process until a soft stool passes. The trick is to get

<!-- chunk -->

### the bowel to move freely.

# RECTAL INJECTIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### Rectal injections are similar to enemas, but they are not used to try to clear the

<!-- chunk -->

### colon. Instead, a small amount of herbal fluid is injected into the rectum, and it is

<!-- chunk -->

### left there to be absorbed rather than being expelled.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rectal injections can be used to:

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Shrink hemorrhoids or anal fistulas (using liquid preparations of astringent

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs)

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Administer an herbal remedy to a child or elderly person who is having trouble

<!-- chunk -->

### swallowing an herb they need

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Hydrate a person or child who is severely dehydrated but can’t or won’t drink

<!-- chunk -->

### fluids (using solutions of mineral-rich herbs like alfalfa or oat straw to provide

<!-- chunk -->

### electrolytes)

# DOUCHES

<!-- chunk -->

### Douches can be helpful for vaginal infections, vaginal irritation, and excessive

<!-- chunk -->

### bleeding. For a douche, you will need an enema bag with a vaginal tip. Mix the

<!-- chunk -->

### douche solution the same way that you would mix an enema solution. Hold the

<!-- chunk -->

### liquid in the vagina for 5–15 minutes, using pillows to prop the hips up, before

<!-- chunk -->

### expelling it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here are some suggestions for herbs to use in douches. For vaginal yeast

<!-- chunk -->

### infections, consider using calendula flowers, pau d’arco bark, or barberry root.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tea tree oil can also be used cautiously (some women find it highly irritating),

<!-- chunk -->

### following the same directions for making an enema solution with essential oils

<!-- chunk -->

### described in the previous section. Use only 1 drop per quart.

<!-- chunk -->

### For bacterial vaginosis, mix 10% povidone iodine and 90% distilled water for

<!-- chunk -->

### a douche solution. For excessive bleeding, use styptic herbs like bayberry root

<!-- chunk -->

### bark, calendula, yarrow, or white oak bark.

<!-- chunk -->

### Regular douching is not recommended and can cause an imbalance of

<!-- chunk -->

### beneficial vaginal microbes.

# BATHS AND SOAKS

<!-- chunk -->

### Baths and soaks invigorate and stimulate circulation, or relax and soothe sore

<!-- chunk -->

### muscles. They can help to ease itching and skin eruptions and to hasten recovery

<!-- chunk -->

### from colds and fevers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Add herbs to a bath by hanging 3–4 tea bags from the tap, or put a tea infuser

<!-- chunk -->

### in the water. A large gauze bag or a cotton sock will hold larger amounts of

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs. You can also make a strong decoction, strain it, and add the liquid to the

<!-- chunk -->

### bath.

<!-- chunk -->

### Essential oils may be added to a bath as well; mix in a few drops of soap to

<!-- chunk -->

### disperse the oil in the bath water. Use caution: essential oils can burn the skin if

<!-- chunk -->

### not well diluted.

<!-- chunk -->

### A sitz bath is useful for hemorrhoids and for prostate, vaginal, and uterine

<!-- chunk -->

### problems. It is also used to relax the pelvic floor in preparation for labor. Fill a

<!-- chunk -->

### large basin as above, and sit down in the water.

<!-- chunk -->

### Foot soaks can help restore circulation to the legs, reduce swelling in the

<!-- chunk -->

### ankles or feet, and heal injuries. Fill a wash basin with hot water and herbs and

<!-- chunk -->

### soak the feet.

# HERBS FOR BATHS AND SOAKS

<!-- chunk -->

### The following are useful herbs for herbal baths and soaks:

<!-- chunk -->

## Itching (Hives, Chicken Pox, etc.) Yellow dock, burdock, Oregon grape,

<!-- chunk -->

### barberry, comfrey, chickweed, lavender, vinegar (hot bath only), clay

<!-- chunk -->

## Swelling and Inflammation Comfrey, plantain, white oak bark, calendula, witch

<!-- chunk -->

### hazel, chamomile

<!-- chunk -->

## Cleansing Skin Pores Ginger, chamomile, vinegar (hot bath only)

<!-- chunk -->

## Relaxing Nerves Kava-kava (seriously, try this as a whole-body soak), lavender,

<!-- chunk -->

### chamomile, rose, catnip, Epsom salts

# SWEAT BATHS

<!-- chunk -->

### Many people in temperate climates the world over have used sweating to both

<!-- chunk -->

### prevent and treat disease. Scandinavians built saunas; Native Americans built

<!-- chunk -->

### sweat lodges. The pioneer herbalist Samuel Thomson would wrap a person

<!-- chunk -->

### sitting in a chair in blankets and place a hot stone in a pail at his feet. By pouring

<!-- chunk -->

### water into the pail, the steam would come up under the blankets until the patient

<!-- chunk -->

### started to perspire.

<!-- chunk -->

### A sweat bath can be used to:

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Help break a fever

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Speed recovery from colds, flu, or other acute infections

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ General detoxification of the blood and lymph

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Stimulate the immune system

<!-- chunk -->

### This therapy is contraindicated if you have a weak heart or high blood

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure or if you are weak, pale, and feeble. It is also not good for small

<!-- chunk -->

### children or very elderly people.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mildly overheating the body simulates a slight fever and can be a powerful

<!-- chunk -->

### natural healing tool against serious disease. Fever is a natural defense and

<!-- chunk -->

### healing response of the immune system, created and sustained by the body to rid

<!-- chunk -->

### itself of harmful pathogens and to restore health. The high body temperature

<!-- chunk -->

### speeds up metabolism and inhibits the replication of the harmful virus or

<!-- chunk -->

### bacteria.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here’s how to take a sweat bath:

<!-- chunk -->

## Step one: Drink plenty of water, and do not eat for 2 hours prior to the sweat

<!-- chunk -->

### bath.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step two: Prepare an infusion with herbs that enhance perspiration. Drink some

<!-- chunk -->

### of the tea before entering the bath, and sip the tea frequently while in the bath.

<!-- chunk -->

### Examples of sweat-enhancing teas include:

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Herbal Composition, Children’s Composition, or Herbal Crisis (see Chapter

<!-- chunk -->

### Twelve)

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Yarrow and peppermint tea (equal parts)

<!-- chunk -->

### ▪ Fresh ginger juice tea

<!-- chunk -->

## Step three: Fill the tub with water as hot as can be tolerated comfortably. Epsom

<!-- chunk -->

### salts, Redmond clay, ginger, or essential oils may be added to the bath. If adding

<!-- chunk -->

### essential oils, mix them with a tablespoon of natural salt or ½ cup Epsom salts

<!-- chunk -->

### before adding them to the bath. This helps the oils dissolve in the water. (See

<!-- chunk -->

### more about aromatherapy in Chapter Ten.)

<!-- chunk -->

## Step four: Soak in the tub for at least 20 minutes. Keep the water as hot as you

<!-- chunk -->

### can tolerate comfortably. Keep as much of your body submerged in the water as

<!-- chunk -->

### possible. If you start to feel faint, sit up and drape a cool washcloth over your

<!-- chunk -->

### face. Drain the tub if you become too uncomfortable.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step five: Gentle massage with a skin brush helps bring the blood to the surface

<!-- chunk -->

### of the skin.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step six: Optional: After soaking in the bath, stand up and rinse off with a quick,

<!-- chunk -->

### cool shower. This will enhance the sweating effect.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step seven: Go to bed and pile on the covers. Drink plenty of fluids. Stay in bed

<!-- chunk -->

### for at least an hour. It’s fine to fall asleep. When finished, take a shower to

<!-- chunk -->

### cleanse the skin and close your pores.

<!-- chunk -->

### Don’t put small children into a really hot bath. Use a warm bath and gently

<!-- chunk -->

### wash their body down with some natural soap and a washcloth to make certain

<!-- chunk -->

### their pores are open. Add 3–4 drops lavender oil or tea tree oil (diluted with a

<!-- chunk -->

### natural liquid soap) or a little bit of Dr. Bronner’s peppermint, tea tree, or

<!-- chunk -->

### eucalyptus soap to the bath. The essential oils will help to stimulate the

<!-- chunk -->

### circulation and draw the blood to the extremities.

# COLD-SHEET TREATMENT

<!-- chunk -->

### A cold-sheet treatment is performed using the same basic procedures as for the

<!-- chunk -->

### sweat bath, but is much more effective in inducing perspiration. It is a powerful

<!-- chunk -->

### way to detoxify the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here’s how to do the cold-sheet treatment:

<!-- chunk -->

## Step one: Follow steps 1–5 for the sweat bath.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step two: Cover the bed with a piece of plastic.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step three: Soak a sheet in water (warm for a milder effect; cold for a stronger

<!-- chunk -->

### effect). As the person gets out of the bath, immediately wrap them in the damp

<!-- chunk -->

### sheet and have them lie down on the plastic sheet. Wrap the plastic around the

<!-- chunk -->

### damp sheet, and cover the person with blankets to warm up the body and induce

<!-- chunk -->

### perspiration.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step four: After about 1 hour, have the person get up and shower to clean off

<!-- chunk -->

### the skin.

# DRAWING BATHS

<!-- chunk -->

### Sweat baths open the sweat glands to cause perspiration, whereas drawing baths

<!-- chunk -->

### target the sebaceous glands (or oil ducts) in the skin. Drawing baths are useful

<!-- chunk -->

### for skin eruptive diseases, rashes, hives, pox, acne, and so forth. They can also

<!-- chunk -->

### be helpful for detoxification from heavy metals, especially the clay baths.

<!-- chunk -->

### A variety of herbs may be used in a drawing bath. You can also use Epsom

<!-- chunk -->

### salts and/or clay. Herbs that are good for drawing baths include mucilaginous

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs like comfrey leaf, plantain, and various seaweeds and alterative herbs like

<!-- chunk -->

### Oregon grape, goldenseal, burdock, yellow dock, and red clover. Oregon grape,

<!-- chunk -->

### goldenseal, and yellow dock all contain a yellow dye that can color the skin. It

<!-- chunk -->

### wears off rather quickly, but be warned.

<!-- chunk -->

### To make an herbal drawing bath, make a decoction of any of these herbs in a

<!-- chunk -->

### large pot containing 1–2 gallons of water. Use about ¼–½ cup herbs per gallon.

<!-- chunk -->

### Simmer the herbs for at least 20–30 minutes, add this to the bath, then fill the tub

<!-- chunk -->

### with more water, adjusting the temperature to make the bath comfortable.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can also use commercially prepared liquid herbal extracts in a bath, but

<!-- chunk -->

### you need about 2–4 ounces of extract per bath, which can be expensive.

<!-- chunk -->

### Two other agents that are really effective for drawing baths are Epsom salts

<!-- chunk -->

### and fine clays. Epsom salts are available at any supermarket or drugstore. Use

<!-- chunk -->

### about 2 cups Epsom salts per bath. Epsom salts are also helpful for sweat baths.

<!-- chunk -->

### They relax the skin pores and encourage elimination through the skin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fine clay is even more effective than Epsom salts as a drawing agent. You

<!-- chunk -->

### have probably heard of or maybe even used a clay mask for drawing oil out of

<!-- chunk -->

### skin pores. Clay can be used in a similar manner in a bath, to absorb both fat-

<!-- chunk -->

### and water-soluble toxins from the body. Redmond clay, which is mined in Utah,

<!-- chunk -->

### is a good brand to use, and you can buy it in large boxes; but any fine clay will

<!-- chunk -->

### do.

# HERBAL STEAM BATHS

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbs rich in essential oils, such as basil, eucalyptus, and lavender, will release

<!-- chunk -->

### their properties into steam. Set a hot plate on the floor, and warm a pot of herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### and water on it. Sit on a cushioned metal chair over the hot plate and pot, and

<!-- chunk -->

### wrap a large blanket from your neck down to the floor. Be sure that the blanket

<!-- chunk -->

### doesn’t get too close to the hot plate and catch on fire! This leaves your head out

<!-- chunk -->

### of the steam and keeps it cool, but heats up the rest of your body nicely.

<!-- chunk -->

## Pelvic Steams

<!-- chunk -->

### Pelvic steams are used for vaginal problems and hemorrhoids. Vaginal steams

<!-- chunk -->

### are less invasive than douching, and hemorrhoid steams are a nice pain reliever.

<!-- chunk -->

### Boil 1 gallon of water, add 100 grams of herbs, and let steep for 10 minutes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Place the entire pot of water in your toilet. Test the temperature by holding your

<!-- chunk -->

### inner arm over the steam at toilet-seat level. If it’s too hot, let it cool for a few

<!-- chunk -->

### minutes and retest. When you feel comfortable with the temperature, sit on the

<!-- chunk -->

### toilet. Our favorite herbs for vaginal steams are yarrow, oregano, basil,

<!-- chunk -->

### calendula, and rosemary. Don’t put essential oils into a vaginal steam; they are

<!-- chunk -->

### too irritating to the mucous membranes. For hemorrhoids, a steam of yarrow,

<!-- chunk -->

### calendula, and arnica works well.

# CONTRAST THERAPY (ALTERNATING HOT AND COLD

# SOAKS)

<!-- chunk -->

### Hot water has a relaxing, opening effect, whereas cold water causes constriction

<!-- chunk -->

### and a reduction in blood flow. Alternating hot and cold hydrotherapy stimulates

<!-- chunk -->

### blood circulation, lymphatic drainage, and nerve energy. It can ease spasmodic

<!-- chunk -->

### pain and cramping, improve circulation, enhance muscle tone, and improve

<!-- chunk -->

### mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### One form of this method is to alternate hot and cold showers. Start with a

<!-- chunk -->

### comfortable hot shower for 3 minutes. Follow with a sudden change to cold

<!-- chunk -->

### water for 2 minutes. Repeat this cycle 3 times, ending with cold. After the

<!-- chunk -->

### shower, have a full or partial massage, or a brisk towel rub.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another form of this therapy is to alternate hot and cold soaks for a body part,

<!-- chunk -->

### such as the feet. This therapy has proved helpful for gangrene or other illnesses

<!-- chunk -->

### involving poor circulation to the extremities. Alternate the hot and cold soaks in

<!-- chunk -->

### the same manner as the hot and cold showers. To further enhance the effect,

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulating herbs (like capsicum, garlic, and ginger) may be added to the hot

<!-- chunk -->

### soak, and soothing herbs (like comfrey or plantain) to the cold soak.

# SITZ BATHS

<!-- chunk -->

### Alternating hot and cold sitz baths may provide symptom relief and help speed

<!-- chunk -->

### recovery from a variety of ailments. It may be used as a healing technique for a

<!-- chunk -->

### patient who cannot take a full shower. It is especially beneficial for increasing

<!-- chunk -->

### circulation in the pelvic and urethral area, and is commonly recommended for

<!-- chunk -->

### vaginal yeast infections, hemorrhoids, and the like.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step one: Fill a washtub with warm water so that you can soak your bottom in

<!-- chunk -->

### the water. As an alternative, fill the bathtub with water up to about ½ inch above

<!-- chunk -->

### your navel when seated.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step two: Soak in the bath for 20–30 minutes. Cover the upper body with a

<!-- chunk -->

### towel, and place a cool, wet washcloth on the forehead.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step three: Take a quick, cool rinse in the shower, or splash the body with cool

<!-- chunk -->

### water, before drying off, to further stimulate circulation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Growing or gathering your own herbs can be a very rewarding experience.

<!-- chunk -->

### Therefore, we encourage you to grow your own medicinal plants if possible.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sources for herb plants and seeds are listed below.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can also learn how to sustainably harvest medicinal herbs growing in

<!-- chunk -->

### your area. To learn to identify local herbs, take a field botany class or plant

<!-- chunk -->

### walks with local herbalists and get to know the plants around you. To look for

<!-- chunk -->

### herbalists who do plant walks, visit http://findanherbalist.com.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you can’t harvest your own plants, purchase them from ethical suppliers.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s a good thing to know who is picking the herbs you purchase. Are they

<!-- chunk -->

### harvesting these plants with reverence and respect for nature? Are they

<!-- chunk -->

### harvesting them ethically and sustainably? Are the herbs correctly identified and

<!-- chunk -->

### free from contaminants?

<!-- chunk -->

### This appendix contains a list of small companies that grow and collect herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### themselves. Small suppliers don’t have the variety of plants that large suppliers

<!-- chunk -->

### do, but purchasing from them supports small scale family growers and local

<!-- chunk -->

### economies. You’re also supporting people who are passionate about the quality

<!-- chunk -->

### of herbs they provide.

<!-- chunk -->

### Larger bulk herb companies offer a better selection, and sometimes better

<!-- chunk -->

### prices. You may also be able to save on shipping if you’re ordering a wide

<!-- chunk -->

### variety of herbs. Our favorite company in this category is Mountain Rose Herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Their commitment to quality herbs, and the time and money they spend

<!-- chunk -->

### supporting multiple free herbal clinics, great educational experiences, herb

<!-- chunk -->

### conferences, and the herbal community as a whole, is amazing.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Chapter Thirteen we’ve listed larger bulk herb companies that supplied

<!-- chunk -->

### each herb at the time this book was written. A more up-to-date database of herb

<!-- chunk -->

### companies and suppliers for individual herbs, herbal formulas, and supplements

<!-- chunk -->

### is found in the member area at http://herbiverse.com.
