# Comparing Natural Cholesterol-Lowering Agents

diabetic patients, but newer studies with slightly lower dosages (1000– 2000 mg) of niacin have not shown it to adversely affect blood sugar regulation.80 For example, during a 16-week, double-blind, placebo- controlled trial, 148 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to placebo or 1000 or 1500 mg per day of niacin; in the niacin-treated groups, there was no significant loss of glycemic control, and the favor- able effects on blood lipids were still apparent.81 Other studies have actually shown hemoglobin A 1C to drop, indicating improvement in blood sugar control.82 The most common blood lipid abnormalities in patients with type 2 diabetes are elevated triglyceride levels, decreased HDL-C levels, and a preponderance of smaller, denser LDL-C particles. Niacin has been shown to address all of these areas more significantly than the statins or other lipid-lowering drugs. In addition to lowering cholesterol and triglycerides, niacin exerts additional benefits in battling atherosclerosis. Specifically, niacin pro- duces beneficial lipid-altering effects on particle distribution in patients with CAD that are not well reflected in typical lipoprotein analysis. In addition, systemic markers of inflammation decrease in patients receiv- ing niacin. In one study, when a modest dosage of niacin (1000 mg daily) was added to existing therapy for 3 months in 54 subjects with stable CAD, participants experienced a 32% increase in large-particle HDL- C, an 8% decrease in small-particle HDL-C, an 82% increase in large- particle LDL-C, and a 12% decrease in small-particle LDL-C.83 Niacin therapy also decreased lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 and CRP levels (20% and 15%, respectively). No significant changes from baseline were seen in any tested parameter in subjects who received placebo. These results indicate that the addition of niacin to existing medical regimens for patients with CAD and already well-controlled lipid levels improves the distribution of lipoprotein particle sizes and inflammatory markers in a manner expected to improve protection against a cardiovascular event. Although niacin exerts significant benefit on its own, it does not appear to enhance the benefits of statins in well-controlled patients. The AIM-HIGH study funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recruited 3400 patients who were at risk for heart trouble despite the fact that their LDL-C was under control (<70 mg/dL) with the use of a statin drug [simvastatin (Zocor)]. The study ended months early because no additional cardiovascular benefit was found in those taking niacin despite increases in HDL-C and reductions in triglycerides.84 In the Carotid Plaque Composition Study, 126 subjects with a his- tory of CVD were randomized to atorvastatin or a combination of atorvastatin and niacin to evaluate the relationship between these ther- apies and the concentration of high-density lipid particles (HDL-p) and cholesterol efflux capacity (i.e., the ability of serum HDL [serum depleted of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins] to remove cholesterol from macrophages).85 Atorvastatin significantly reduced LDL-C levels by 39% (−65 mg/dL, P<0.0001) and apoB by 35% (−47 mg/dL, P<0.0001). Adding niacin to atorvastatin reduced both LDL-C and apoB levels by an additional 11% (−83 mg/dL and −63 mg/dL, respectively). After 1 year of treatment with atorvastatin, HDL-C lev- els increased by 11%, and combination therapy raised HDL-C by an additional 18%. Combination therapy also increased macrophage cholesterol efflux capacity but failed to improve ATP-binding cas- sette transporter A1 (ABCA1)-specific cholesterol efflux capacity, which may explain why clinical trials have shown that although niacin increases HDL-C levels, it does not reduce cardiac risk.

## The side effects of niacin. The side effects of niacin are well

known. The most common and bothersome side effect is the skin flushing that typically occurs 20 to 30 minutes after the niacin is taken. Other occasional side effects of niacin include gastric irritation, nausea, and liver damage. In an attempt to combat the acute reaction of skin flushing, several manufacturers began marketing “sustained- release,” “timed-release,” or “slow-release” niacin products. These formulations allow the niacin to be absorbed gradually, thereby reducing the flushing reaction. However, although these forms of niacin reduce skin flushing, earlier timed-release preparations proved to be more toxic to the liver than regular niacin. In one analysis, 52% of the patients taking the earlier sustained-release niacin preparations developed liver toxicity, whereas none of the patients taking immediate-release niacin did so.86 “Intermediate-release” preparations appear to have solved this problem, as relatively large clinical trials have shown them to be extremely well tolerated even when combined with statin drugs.87–89 The safety and tolerability of intermediate-release niacin prepara- tion have been evaluated in a multicenter study of 566 patients.90 The target dose was achieved by 65% of patients. Flushing was the most common side effect (42%), as expected, and 9.7% withdrew because of this. Other drug-related adverse reactions occurred at low frequency (18.6%), and 8.7% withdrew for an adverse reaction other than flush- ing. Most adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. There was no hepatotoxicity or serious adverse event involving muscle. The researchers concluded that intermediate-release nicotinic acid was well tolerated, and these results support its use in the management of patients with an increased cardiovascular risk due to low HDL-C. Inositol hexaniacinate has long been used in Europe to lower cho- lesterol levels and to improve blood flow in intermittent claudication. It yields slightly better clinical results than standard niacin but is much better tolerated in terms of both flushing and, more importantly, long- term side effects.91,92 Regardless of the form of niacin being used, periodic checking (at least every 3 months) of cholesterol and liver function is indicated. Niacin should not be used in patients with preexisting liver disease or elevations in liver enzymes. For these patient groups, policosanol, gar- lic, or pantethine are recommended.

For best results, niacin should be taken at night, because most cho- lesterol synthesis occurs during sleep. If pure crystalline niacin is being used, it should begin with a dosage of 100 mg a day and be carefully increased over 4 to 6 weeks to the full therapeutic dosage of 1.5 to g per day. If a timed-released preparation or inositol hexaniacinate is being used, a 500-mg dose should be given at night and increased to 1500 mg after 2 weeks. If after 1 month of therapy the dosage of 1500 mg per day fails to effectively lower LDL-C, the dosage should be increased to 3000 mg.

## Plant Sterols and Stanols

Phytosterols and phytostanols are structurally similar to cholesterol and can act in the intestine to lower cholesterol absorption by displac- ing cholesterol from intestinal micelles. Because phytosterols and phy- tostanols are poorly absorbed themselves, blood cholesterol levels will likely drop owing to increased excretion. These compounds are show- ing up in functional foods (e.g., margarine and other spreads, orange juice), as well as in dietary supplements.93 Phytosterols and phytostanols are effective in lowering LDL-C in some people. A meta-analysis of 41 trials showed that a daily intake of 2 g of stanols or sterols reduces LDL-C by 10%.93 Administration of higher dosages produced little additional benefit. Effects of phytos- terols and phytostanols are additive with diet or drug interventions: Eating foods low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in stanols or sterols can reduce LDL-C by 20%; adding sterols or stanols to sta- tin medication is more effective than doubling the statin dose alone. Individuals most likely to respond have been identified as having high cholesterol absorption and low cholesterol biosynthesis. Phytosterols and phytostanols have been shown to have antiplatelet and antioxidant effects as well.94–97 Phytosterol or phytostanol intake at higher dosages may reduce carotenoid absorption. Human subjects consuming 6.6 g per day phy- tosterols showed cholesterol-adjusted plasma reduction of alpha- and beta-carotene levels (–19% to –23%), lutein (–14%), and lycopene (–11%). However, this effect was partially reversed by increased fruit and vegetable intake.98

## Pantethine

Pantethine is the stable form of pantetheine, the active form of vitamin B 5 or pantothenic acid. Pantothenic acid is the most important com- ponent of coenzyme A (CoA). This enzyme is involved in the transport of fats to and from cells, as well as to the energy-producing compart- ments in cells. Without coenzyme A, the cells’ fats could not be metab- olized to energy. Pantethine has significant lipid-lowering activity, whereas panto- thenic acid has little if any effect in lowering cholesterol and triglycer- ide levels owing to pantethine’s ability to be converted to cysteamine. Pantethine administration (standard dosage 900 mg per day) has been shown to significantly reduce serum triglyceride (−32%), total cho- lesterol (−19%), and LDL-C (−21%) levels and to increase HDL-C (+23%) levels.99,100 It appears to be especially useful in lowering blood lipids in diabetic patients.101–103 The lipid-lowering effects of pantethine are most impressive when its toxicity (virtually none) is compared with that of conventional lip- id-lowering drugs. Its mechanism of action is due to the inhibition cho- lesterol synthesis and acceleration of the use of fat as an energy source.

## Garlic (Allium sativum) and Onion (Allium cepa)

Garlic offers significant protection against heart disease and stroke by lowering blood cholesterol levels even in apparently healthy individu- als. According to the results of numerous double-blind placebo-con- trolled studies in patients with initial cholesterol levels above 200 mg/ dL, supplementation with commercial preparations providing a daily dose of at least 10 mg of alliin or a total allicin potential of 4000 mg can lower total serum cholesterol levels by about 10% to 12% and LDL-C by about 15%. HDL-C usually increases by about 10%, and triglyceride levels typically drop by 15%. However, most trials using lower dosages of allicin fail to produce a lipid-lowering effect.104–108 Although the effects of supplemental garlic preparations on cho- lesterol levels are modest, the combination of lowering LDL-C and raising HDL-C can greatly improve the HDL-C:LDL-C ratio, a sig- nificant goal in the prevention of heart disease and stroke. Garlic preparations have also demonstrated blood pressure–lowering effects, inhibition of platelet aggregation, reduction of plasma vis- cosity, promotion of fibrinolysis, prevention of LDL-C oxidation, and an ability to exert positive effects on endothelial function, vas- cular reactivity, and peripheral blood flow (see Chapter 51 for more information).

## Comparing Natural Cholesterol-Lowering Agents

Numerous natural compound products can effectively improve cho- lesterol and triglyceride levels. Of the several described earlier, niacin produces the best overall effect. However, the others do have a place in the clinical management of hyperlipidemia and the prevention of atherosclerosis (Table 149.6). Typically, along with dietary and lifestyle recommendations, niacin (1500–3000 mg at night) reduces total cholesterol by 50 to 75 mg/dL within the first 2 months in patients with initial total cholesterol levels above 250 mg/dL. In patients with initial cholesterol levels above mg/dL, it may take 4 to 6 months before cholesterol levels begin to reach recommended levels. Once cholesterol levels are reduced below 200 mg/dL, the dosage of niacin is reduced by 500 mg for 2 months. If the cholesterol levels creep up above 200 mg/dL, the dosage of nia- cin is raised back up to previous levels. If the cholesterol level remains below 200 mg/dL, then the niacin is dropped by another 500 mg and the cholesterol levels are rechecked in 2 months, with niacin therapy at previous levels if levels have exceeded 200 mg/dL. Continue with this reduction in dosage until niacin can be stopped entirely and choles- terol levels remain below 200 mg/dL. Pantethine is recommended primarily to patients who have HTG, especially patients with diabetes. As stated earlier, pantethine has demonstrated excellent effects in diabetics. It not only improves cho- lesterol and triglyceride levels but also normalizes platelet lipid compo- sition and function as well as blood viscosity. With regard to elevations in Lp(a), both niacin and vitamin C have shown an ability to reduce Lp(a) levels dramatically (35% and 27% reductions, respectively). In addition, it is important to rule out low thyroid function (hypothyroidism) in all cases of elevated blood lipids, especially elevated Lp(a).

It is well established that patients with overt hypothyroidism are prone to CAD because of increased LDL-C and decreased HDL-C. What is not as well established is the significance of “subclinical” hypo- thyroidism in terms of risk for cardiovascular mortality. One study demonstrated that patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (defined in the study as normal T3 and free thyroxine index with a raised TSH) were shown to have significantly elevated levels of LDL-C as well as elevated Lp(a).109 For more information, see Chapter 180.

# THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS—ANTIOXIDANT

# STATUS

Dietary antioxidant nutrients like lycopene, lutein, selenium, vita- min E, and vitamin C have been shown in epidemiological studies to offer significant protection against the development of CVD. Fats and cholesterol are particularly susceptible to free radical damage. When damaged, fats and cholesterol form lipid peroxides and oxidized cho- lesterol, which can then damage the artery walls and accelerate the pro- gression of atherosclerosis. Antioxidants block the formation of these damaging compounds. Although diets rich in antioxidant nutrients have consistently shown tremendous protection against CVD, clinical trials using antiox- idant vitamins and minerals have produced inconsistent results.110,111 The human antioxidant system represents a complex scenario of inter- acting components, which may explain the inconsistent findings. It is unlikely that any single antioxidant would prove to be effective, espe- cially in the absence of a supporting cast. Most antioxidants require some sort of “partner” antioxidant, allowing them to work more effi- ciently. The most salient example of this is the partnership between the two primary antioxidants in the human body—vitamins C and E. Vitamin C is an “aqueous phase” antioxidant, and vitamin E is a “lipid phase” antioxidant. Although some studies have shown that supple- mentation with these nutrients reduces atherosclerotic lesions, more protection is likely required to ensure optimal effect.112 In addition to vitamin C, vitamin E also requires selenium and CoQ 10 to work efficiently. Further adding to the shortcomings of many of the studies on antioxidant nutrients is the lack of consideration of the importance of phytochemicals and plant-derived antioxidants that, in addition to exerting benefit on their own, are well known to potenti- ate the activities of vitamin and mineral antioxidants. Phytochemicals like carotenes (especially lycopene and lutein) and flavonoids are espe- cially important in fighting against free-radical damage. Most scien- tific reviews on antioxidant supplements devote significant attention to the studies using beta-carotene, because they have involved more than 70,000 subjects, but such studies fail to differentiate the facts that synthetic beta-carotene was used, and that beta-carotene is of little importance in protecting against LDL-C oxidation. (Unlike lycopene and lutein, beta-carotene does not become incorporated into LDL-C effectively, although it may help protect the endothelium.) Lutein may be one of the most significant carotenes in the battle against atherosclerosis. Based on analysis of the different subtypes of LDL- C, lycopene, beta-carotene, and cryptoxanthin were mainly located in the larger, less dense LDL-C particles, whereas lutein and zeaxanthin were found preferentially in the smaller, denser LDL-C particles.113 Because the smaller, denser LDL-C subtype is most easily oxidized, lutein and zeaxan- thin are particularly important in protecting against damage to LDL-C. The support of nonantioxidant vitamins and minerals may also be important in supporting the effectiveness of antioxidants. Taking a multivitamin/multimineral supplement seems appropriate. In one double-blind study, CRP levels were significantly lower in the multi- vitamin group than in the placebo group, with the reduction in CRP levels most evident in patients who had elevated levels ( ≥ 1 mg/L) at baseline.114 Researchers found that serum vitamin B 6 and vitamin C levels were inversely associated with CRP level.


Oxidation of LDL to oxLDL is a crucial step in the development of ath- erosclerosis. Although clinical studies have shown inconsistent effects, vitamin E plays a role in the protection against oxidation of LDL-C because it can be easily incorporated into the LDL-C molecule (Table 149.7). In a placebo-controlled, randomized study, 12 weeks of vitamin E supplementation (800 International Units (IU) per day) increased LDL resistance to oxidation without changing the serum lipid profile or lipoprotein lipid composition.115 There is a clear-cut dosage effect (i.e., the higher the dosage of vitamin E, the greater the degree of pro- tection against oxidative damage to LDL-C). Doses greater than 400 IU are often required to produce clinically significant effects.116–118 Improvements have also been noted in insulin sensitivity and plasma lipids in non–insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Several large population studies have demonstrated that vitamin E levels may be more predictive of incipient heart attack or stroke than total cholesterol levels.117–120 Although the consumption of red wine has been suggested as the reason behind the French paradox, described earlier, higher vitamin E levels also provide a viable explanation.117–119 Vitamin E may offer additional benefit in protecting against heart disease and strokes by its ability to: • Reduce LDL-C peroxidation and increase plasma LDL-C break- down • Inhibit excessive platelet aggregation • Increase HDL-C levels • Increase fibrinolytic activity • Reduce CRP levels • Improve endothelial cell function • Improve insulin sensitivity Two early large-scale studies with relatively low dosages of vitamin E supplementation demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of heart attack or stroke. The Nurses’ Health Study of 87,245 nurses con- cluded that those who took 100 IU of vitamin E daily for more than years had a 41% lower risk of heart disease compared with nonusers of vitamin E supplements.119 The Physicians’ Health Study of 39,910 male health care professionals found similar results: a 37% lower risk of heart disease with the intake of more than 30 IU of supplemental vitamin E daily.120 Subsequent studies have been equivocal.110 Large-scale studies examining the effect of vitamin E supplementa- tion in patients with existing CAD have also shown somewhat conflict- ing results.111,112 Some of the disappointing results may have been due to the choice of synthetic vitamin E (DL-alpha tocopherol) in one of

the large studies versus the more active natural form (D-alpha tocoph- erol). In addition, interference by statin drugs in vitamin E and CoQ 10 metabolism increases the needs for both compounds (Table 149.8). Vitamin E and CoQ 10 work synergistically, and each is required for the regeneration of the other. For example, CoQ 10 is present in the blood in both oxidized (inactive) and reduced (active) forms. During times of increased oxidative stress or low vitamin E levels, more CoQ 10 will be converted to its oxidized (inactive form). Thus by providing higher levels of vitamin E, the biological activity and function of CoQ 10 are enhanced, and vice versa. Several studies in humans and animals have shown that the combination of vitamin E and CoQ 10 works bet- ter than either one alone. For example, in a study in baboons, where supplementation with vitamin E alone reduced CRP levels, cosupple- mentation with CoQ 10 significantly enhanced this effect of vitamin E. Similar results have been seen in other animal studies on other factors associated with atherosclerosis, including LDL-C oxidation and lipid peroxide content within the aorta.120–123 In addition to CoQ 10 , vitamin E also requires adequate selenium status for optimal antioxidant effects. Selenium functions primarily as a component of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase. This enzyme works closely with vitamin E to prevent free-radical damage to cell membranes. Studies looking only at vitamin E’s ability to reduce cancer and heart disease are often faulty because they fail to factor in the critical partnership between selenium and vitamin E, not to men- tion the interrelationship between vitamin E and CoQ 10 . Several stud- ies have clearly demonstrated that low selenium status is significantly associated with CAD.124,125 Failure to cosupplement with selenium as well as vitamin C and CoQ 10 may be a major reason for the inconsistent results in intervention trials with vitamin E supplementation alone. Finally, the importance of prescribing the full complement of the eight vitamin E isomers cannot be overstated. Most of the cardiovas- cular research with vitamin E has been on the synthetic DL alpha-to- copherol. The problem with this approach is more fully discussed in Chapter 127, Vitamin Toxicities and Therapeutic Monitoring.


Vitamin C works as an antioxidant in aqueous (water) environments in the body—both outside and inside human cells. It is the first line of antioxidant protection in the body. Its primary antioxidant partner is vitamin E, as this antioxidant is fat-soluble. Along with CoQ 10 , vitamin C is also responsible for regenerating oxidized vitamin E in the body, thus potentiating the antioxidant benefits of vitamin E.126 Vitamin C also works along with antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxi- dase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. Vitamin C has been shown to be extremely effective in preventing LDL-C from being oxidized, even in smokers.127 Vitamins C and E supplementation (500 mg and 272 IU daily, respectively) for 6 years has been shown to reduce the progres- sion of carotid atherosclerosis by 53% in men and 14% in women.128 A high dietary intake of vitamin C has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of death from heart attacks and strokes, as well as all other causes including cancer in numerous population studies.129 One of the most detailed studies analyzed the vitamin C intake of 11,348 adults over 5 years and divided them into three groups: (1) less than mg dietary intake daily; (2) greater than 50 mg daily dietary intake with no vitamin C supplementation; and (3) greater than 50 mg dietary intake a day plus vitamin C supplementation (estimated to be ≥ 300 mg).129 Analysis showed that the standardized mortality ratio, a com- parison with the average death rate, was up to 48% lower in the high vitamin C intake group than in the low-intake group for CVD and overall mortality. These differences correspond to an increase in lon- gevity of 5 to 7 years for men and 1 to 3 years for women. Dozens of observational and clinical studies have shown that vita- min C levels correspond to total cholesterol and HDL-C.130–132 In one of the best-designed studies, it was shown that the higher the vitamin C content of the blood, the lower the total cholesterol and triglycerides and the higher the HDL-C.132 The benefits for HDL-C were particu- larly impressive. For each 0.5 mg/dL increase in vitamin C content of the blood, there was an increase in HDL-C of 14.9 mg/dL in women and 2.1 mg/dL in men. This study demonstrates that the association of vitamin C and HDL-C levels persists even in well-nourished indi- viduals with normal serum levels of vitamin C who supplement their diets with additional vitamin C. Vitamin C therapy also has positive effects on the fibrinolytic system, and has been shown to reduce CRP and Lp(a) In summary, vitamin C lowers the risk of CVD by126–134: • Acting as an antioxidant • Strengthening the collagen structures of the arteries • Lowering total cholesterol, Lp(a), and blood pressure • Raising HDL-C levels • Inhibiting platelet aggregation • Promoting fibrinolysis • Reducing markers of inflammation

## Grape Seed and Pine Bark Extracts

One of the most beneficial groups of plant flavonoids are the proan- thocyanidins (also referred to as procyanidins or procyanidolic oligomers [PCOs]). Although PCOs exist in many plants, as well as in red wine, commercially available sources of PCO include extracts from grape seeds and the bark of the maritime pine (Landes).135 These extracts offer protec- tion via several different mechanisms, including their antioxidant activity and effects on endothelial cells. For more information, see Chapter 106.

compounds that dramatically promote the formation of the athero- sclerotic plaque, or they can form a clot that can lodge in small arter- ies and produce a heart attack or stroke. The adhesiveness of platelets is determined largely by the types of fats in the diet and the level of antioxidants. Although saturated fats and cholesterol increase plate- let aggregation, omega-3 oils (both short-chain and long-chain) and monounsaturated fats have the opposite effect.136,137 In addition to the monounsaturated and omega-3 fatty acids, anti- oxidant nutrients, and flavonoids, vitamin B 6 also inhibits platelet aggregation and lowers blood pressure and homocysteine levels.138,139 In one study, the effect of vitamin B 6 (pyridoxine HCl) supplemen- tation on platelet aggregation, plasma lipids, and serum zinc levels was determined in 24 healthy male volunteers (19–24 years old) given either pyridoxine at a dosage of 5 mg/kg body weight or a placebo for 4 weeks.138 Results demonstrated that pyridoxine inhibited platelet aggregation by 41% to 48%, but there was no change in the control group. Pyridoxine prolonged both bleeding and coagulation time but not over the physiological limits. It had no effect on platelet count. Pyridoxine was also shown to lower total plasma lipids and cholesterol levels considerably from pretreatment levels. Total plasma lipids were reduced from 593 to 519 mg/dL, and total cholesterol was reduced from 156 to 116 mg/dL. HDL-C increased from 37.9 to 48.6 mg/dL. Serum zinc levels increased from 96 to 138 mg/dL. In another study, a significant inverse graded relation was observed between the serum level of pyridoxal-5-phosphate (P5P) and both CRP and fibrinogen.140 The odds ratio for CAD risk related to low P5P concentrations after adjustments for the major classic CAD risk fac- tors, including CRP and fibrinogen, was 1.89. In addition, the CAD risk as a result of low P5P was additive when considered in combi- nation with elevated CRP concentrations or with an increased LDL- C:HDL-C ratio. These results provide clear evidence of the possible role of vitamin B 6 supplementation in reducing the risk of atherosclerotic mortality. Garlic preparations standardized for alliin content as well as garlic oil have also demonstrated inhibition of platelet aggregation. In one study, 120 patients with increased platelet aggregation were given either 900 mg per day of a dried garlic preparation containing 1.3% alliin or a placebo for 4 weeks.141 In the garlic group, spontaneous platelet aggregation disappeared, the microcirculation of the skin increased by 47.6%, plasma viscosity decreased by 3.2%, diastolic blood pressure dropped from an average of 74 to 67 mm Hg, and fasting blood glucose concentration dropped from an average of 89.4 to 79 mg/dL.

## Fibrinogen

Early clinical studies encouraged detailed epidemiological investi- gations into the possible link between fibrinogen and CVD.142 The first such study was the Northwick Park Heart Study in the United Kingdom. This large study involved 1510 men 40 to 64 years of age who were randomly recruited and tested for a range of clotting fac- tors including fibrinogen. At the 4-year follow-up, there was a stronger association between cardiovascular deaths and fibrinogen levels than that for cholesterol. This association has now been confirmed in at least five other prospective epidemiological studies. Natural therapies designed to promote fibrinolysis include exer- cise, omega-3 oils, niacin, garlic, and nattokinase. In addition, the Mediterranean diet alone significantly reduces fibrinogen and other markers of inflammation.143 Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was shown to be associated with a 20% lower CRP level, 17% lower inter- leukin-6 level, 15% lower homocysteine level, and 6% lower fibrinogen level. Natto is a traditional Japanese food prepared from fermented soy- beans by Bacillus subtilis. Nattokinase is a serine proteinase isolated from natto that has potent fibrinolytic and thrombolytic activity. An open-label, self-controlled clinical trial was conducted on subjects of the following groups: healthy volunteers (healthy group), patients with cardiovascular risk factors (cardiovascular group), and patients undergoing dialysis (dialysis group). All subjects ingested two cap- sules of nattokinase (2000 fibrinolysis units per capsule) daily orally for 2 months. The laboratory measurements were performed on the screening visit and then regularly after the initiation of the study. After 2 months of administration, fibrinogen, factor VII, and factor VIII decreased by 9%, 14%, and 17%, respectively, for the healthy group; 7%, 13%, and 19%, respectively, for the cardiovascular group; and 10%, 7%, and 19%, respectively, for the dialysis group. These results highlight the potential of nattokinase as a natural fibrinolytic.144

## Homocysteine

Homocysteine is an intermediate in the conversion of the amino acid methionine to cysteine. If a person is functionally deficient in folic acid, vitamin B 6 , or vitamin B 12 , there will be an increase in homocysteine. Elevated homocysteine levels are an independent risk factor for devel- oping a heart attack, stroke, or peripheral vascular disease. Elevations in homocysteine are found in approximately 20% to 40% of patients with heart disease and are significantly associated with CAD.145–147 A meta-analysis found that for each increase of μ mol/L in homocys- teine, the risk of CHD events increased by approximately 20%, inde- pendently of traditional CHD risk factors.148 A number of interrelated atherogenic mechanisms are thought to be involved with hyperhomocysteinemia. These mechanisms include advanced thickening and smooth muscle cell proliferation of endo- thelial vessel wall intima, enhanced lipid deposition in the vessel wall, forced detachment of endothelial cells, activation of leukocytes and thrombocytes, increased LDL-C oxidation, initiation of platelet thromboxane synthesis, enhanced oxidative stress induced by peroxide formation during homocysteine oxidation, and prothrombotic coagu- lation interference. Homocysteine is thought to promote atherosclero- sis by directly damaging the artery, reducing the integrity of the vessel wall, and interfering with the formation of proper collagen. Although supplementation with the active form of folate, 5-meth- ylfolate (400 mcg daily), alone can reduce homocysteine levels in many subjects, given the importance of vitamins B 12 and B 6 for proper homo- cysteine metabolism, all three should be used together. In one study, the suboptimal levels of these nutrients in men with elevated homocys- teine levels were 56.8%, 59.1%, and 25% for folic acid, vitamin B 12 , and vitamin B 6 , respectively, indicating that folate supplementation alone would not lower homocysteine levels in many cases.149 In other words, folate supplementation will lower homocysteine levels only if there are adequate levels of vitamins B 12 and B 6 . In 1998 the FDA mandated the fortification of food products with folic acid. Although homocysteine levels have decreased modestly since then, the effect on mortality has been minor at best.150 This reflects the importance of more aggressive supplementary measures to reduce homocysteine-associated cardiovascular risk, as well as the importance of supplementing with the most active forms to enhance bioavailability.

## “Type A” Personality

“Type A” behavior is characterized by an extreme sense of time urgency, competitiveness, impatience, and aggressiveness. This behav- ior carries with it a twofold increase in CHD compared with non–type A behavior.151-152 Particularly damaging to the cardiovascular system is the regular expression of anger. In one study, the relationship between habitual anger coping styles, especially anger expression, and serum lipid concentrations were examined in 86 healthy subjects.153 Habitual

## 1146SECTION 6 Diseases

anger expression was measured on four scales: aggression, controlled affect, guilt, and social inhibition. A positive correlation between serum cholesterol level and aggression was found. The higher the aggression score, the higher the cholesterol level. A negative correlation was found between the ratio of LDL-C to HDL-C and controlled affect score—the greater the ability to control anger, the lower this ratio. In other words, people who learn to control anger experience a significant reduction in the risk for heart disease, whereas an unfavorable lipid profile is linked with a predominantly aggressive (hostile) anger coping style. Anger expression also plays a role in CRP levels. In one study, greater anger and severity of depressive symptoms, separately and in combination with hostility, were significantly associated with eleva- tions in CRP in apparently healthy men and women.154 Other mecha- nisms explaining the link between the emotions, personality, and CVD include increased cortisol secretion, endothelial dysfunction, hyper- tension, and increased platelet aggregation and fibrinogen levels.138 These associations are independent of potential confounding factors. Ten tips that can help patients improve their coping strategies include: 1. Do not starve your emotional life. Foster meaningful relation- ships. Provide time to give and receive love in your life. 2. Learn to be a good listener. Allow the people in your life to really share their feelings and thoughts uninterruptedly. Empathize with them; put yourself in their shoes. 3. Do not try to talk over somebody. If you find yourself being inter- rupted, relax; do not try to outtalk the other person. If you are courteous and allow someone else to speak, eventually (unless he or she is extremely rude) he or she will respond likewise. If not, explain that he or she is interrupting the communication process. You can do this only if you have been a good listener. 4. Avoid aggressive or passive behavior. Be assertive but express your thoughts and feelings in a kind way to help improve relationships at work and at home. 5. Avoid excessive stress in your life as best you can by avoiding excessive work hours, poor nutrition, and inadequate rest. Get as much sleep as you can. 6. Avoid stimulants like caffeine and nicotine. Stimulants promote the fight-or-flight response and tend to make people more irrita- ble in the process. 7. Take time to build long-term health and success by performing stress-reduction techniques and deep breathing exercises. 8. Accept gracefully those things over which you have no control. Save your energy for those things that you can do something about. 9. Accept yourself. Remember that you are human and will make mistakes from which you can learn along the way. 10. Be more patient and tolerant of other people. Follow the golden rule.

## Magnesium and Potassium

Magnesium and potassium are absolutely essential to the proper func- tioning of the entire cardiovascular system. Their critical roles in pre- venting heart disease and strokes are now widely accepted. In addition, there is a substantial body of knowledge demonstrating that magne- sium or potassium supplementation or both are effective in treating a wide range of CVDs, including angina, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and high blood pressure. In many of these applications, mag- nesium or potassium supplementation or both have been used for more than 50 years. Because the role of potassium in the cardiovascular system is described in detail in Chapter 179, the focus here is on magnesium. Most Americans do not consume enough of this important mineral. The average intake of magnesium by healthy adults in the United States ranges from 143 to 266 mg/day. This level is well below even the rec- ommended daily allowance (RDA) of 350 mg for men and 300 mg for women. Food choices are the main reason. Because magnesium occurs abundantly in whole foods, most nutritionists and dietitians assume that most Americans get enough magnesium in their diets. However, most Americans are not eating whole, natural foods. They are con- suming large quantities of processed foods. Because food processing refines a large portion of magnesium, most Americans are not getting the RDA for magnesium. The best dietary sources of magnesium are tofu, legumes, seeds, nuts, whole grains, and green leafy vegetables. Fish, meat, milk, and most commonly eaten fruits are quite low in magnesium. Most Americans consume a low-magnesium diet because their diet is high in low-magnesium foods such as processed foods, meat, and dairy products. People dying of heart attacks have been shown to have lower heart magnesium levels than people of the same age dying of other causes.155 Low serum magnesium ( ≤ 0.80 mmol/L) has been associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease mortality (hazard ratio: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.09–1.69) and sudden cardiac death (hazard ratio: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.12–2.11) as well as subclinical atherosclerosis (expressed as increased carotid intima-media thickness: +0.013 mm, 95% CI: 0.005–0.020).156 Low magnesium levels contribute to atherosclerosis and CVD via many mechanisms including the promotion of endo- thelial dysfunction by generating a proinflammatory, prothrombotic, proatherogenic environment.157 Intravenous magnesium therapy has emerged as a valued treat- ment measure in acute MI.158–160 The major obstacle to it becoming the preferred method for saving a person’s life may be a financial interest. Magnesium is inexpensive compared with high-tech, high-priced, genet- ically engineered drugs currently being promoted by drug companies. The treatment of acute MI is big business in the United States. Each year more than 1.5 million U.S. citizens experience acute MI. Although many other parts of the world are now using magnesium therapy for acute MI because of its effectiveness, low cost, safety, and ease of administration, it plays second fiddle to the high-tech drugs in the United States. Several well-designed studies involving more than 4000 patients have demonstrated that intravenous magnesium supplementation during the first hour of admission to a hospital for acute MI produces a favorable effect in reducing immediate and long-term complications as well as death rates. The beneficial effects of magnesium in acute MI relate to its ability to: • Improve energy production within the heart • Dilate the coronary arteries, resulting in improved delivery of oxy- gen to the heart • Reduce peripheral vascular resistance, resulting in reduced demand on the heart • Inhibit platelets from aggregating and forming blood clots • Reduce the size of the infarct (blockage) • Improve heart rate and arrhythmias

## Vitamin D Deficiency

Data from more than 8000 individuals enrolled in the NHANES to 2004 study indicate that individuals with vitamin D (25-OH) levels below 30 ng/mL were more likely to be at high risk for CVD (OR 1.32), for CHD (OR 1.48), and for both CHD and heart failure (OR 3.52).161 A prospective cohort study of more than 3000 men and women found that those in the lowest quartile of 25-hydroxy vitamin D had a haz- ard ratio of 2.22 for cardiovascular mortality and 2.08 for all-cause mortality.162

# THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS—PREVENTING A

# RECURRENT HEART ATTACK

People who have experienced a heart attack or stroke and live through it are extremely likely to experience another. The primary prevention of subsequent cardiovascular events is to control the major cardiac risk factors (e.g., hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabe- tes, physical inactivity). The most popular “secondary” recommenda- tion to reduce the risk of a subsequent heart attack being given by most physicians is low-dose aspirin (e.g., 325 mg per day or every other day). However, there may be effective alternatives, especially for those who cannot tolerate aspirin therapy. It is becoming standard to recommend dosages of aspirin lower than 325 mg (e.g., 50–150 mg per day or every other day). To date these lower dosages have not been shown to be effective in reducing CVD mortality.

<!-- chunk -->

## Aspirin

Aspirin has been shown to decrease the risk of CVD events in both primary and secondary trials. The first primary prevention study was the Physicians’ Health Study, a randomized double-blind pla- cebo-controlled trial of 22,071 apparently healthy men. The study was terminated early owing principally to a statistically extreme 44% reduction in the risk of a first MI with the use of 325 mg of aspirin every other day. Since this study, three additional randomized trials including both men and women have shown aspirin to be effective in the primary prevention of MI: the Thrombosis Prevention Trial, the Hypertension Optimal Treatment Study, and the Primary Prevention Project. Among the 55,580 subjects, aspirin use was associated with a statistically significant 32% reduction in the risk of a first MI and a significant 15% reduction in the risk of all other important vascular events, but it had no significant effects on nonfatal stroke or vascular death. Evaluation of the data from the Physicians’ Health Study indi- cated that those with the highest CRP had the greatest decrease in risk, 55.7%, versus 13.9% in those with the lowest CRP. It seems reasonable to reserve the use of aspirin as a primary prevention strategy for indi- viduals with high CRP values.163 Regarding the secondary prevention of MI, there have been seven prospective randomized placebo-controlled trials involving almost 15,000 survivors of heart attack that have examined the use of aspirin to reduce the incidence of recurrent heart attack and death. These trials used several doses of aspirin, ranging from 325 to 1500 mg per day and enrolled patients at various intervals after infarction ranging from weeks to 5 years. None of the studies demonstrated a statistically sig- nificant reduction in mortality with aspirin use. However, when all the results from these studies were pooled, aspirin was shown to reduce the mortality rate from all causes as well as cardiovascular deaths. The mortality rate for all causes in the aspirin group was 5.8%, compared with 8.3% in the placebo group, indicating a reduction in mortality by 30% with aspirin.164,165 Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with a significant risk of peptic ulcer. However, most studies documenting the relative frequency of peptic ulcers as a conse- quence of NSAIDs have focused on their use in the treatment of arthri- tis and headaches. The risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to peptic ulcers has been evaluated for aspirin at daily dosages of 300, 150, and mg, respectively. Essentially there is an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to peptic ulcers at all dosage levels. However, the dosage of 75 mg per day was associated with a 40% reduction in ulcers compared with 300 mg per day and 30% compared with 150 mg per day.166 Because it is unknown whether 75 mg per day of aspirin is help- ful in preventing a second heart attack, most physicians recommend at least 100mg. To prevent stroke, the dosage necessary appears to be 160mg. These dosage recommendations carry with them a significant risk for developing a peptic ulcer but may be appropriate for high-risk patients unwilling to adopt the natural approach.

## Dietary Alternatives to Aspirin

Several studies have shown that dietary modifications are not only more effective in preventing recurrent heart attack than aspirin but can also reverse the blockage of clogged arteries. In addition to the stud- ies with the Mediterranean diet, three famous studies deserve special mention. The first was the Lifestyle Heart Trial conducted by Dean Ornish.167 In this study, subjects with heart disease were divided into a control group and an experimental group. The control group received regular medical care, and the experimental group was asked to eat a low-fat vegetarian diet for at least 1 year. The diet included fruits, veg- etables, grains, legumes, and soybean products. Subjects were allowed to consume as many calories as they wished. No animal products were allowed except egg whites and 1 cup of nonfat milk or yogurt daily. The diet contained approximately 10% fat; 15% to 20% protein; and 70% to 75% carbohydrates—that is, predominantly complex carbohydrates from whole grains, legumes, and vegetables. The experimental group was also asked to perform stress reduction techniques such as breathing exercises, stretching exercises, medita- tion, imagery, and other relaxation techniques for an hour each day and to exercise for at least 3 hours each week. At the end of the year, the subjects in the experimental group showed significant overall regres- sion of atherosclerosis of the coronary blood vessels. In contrast, sub- jects in the control group who were being treated with regular medical care and following the standard AHA diet actually showed progression of their disease. Ornish stated, “This finding suggests that conventional recommendations for patients with CHD (such as a 30% fat diet) are not sufficient to bring about regression in many patients.” Numerous population studies have demonstrated that people who consume a diet rich in omega-3 oils from either fish or vegetable sources have a significantly reduced risk of developing heart disease. Two famous intervention trials upheld this protective effect. In the Dietary and Reinfarction Trial (DART), it was only when the intake of omega-3 fatty acids (from fish) was increased that future heart attacks were reduced.168 In another study, the Lyon Diet Heart Study, increas- ing the intake of omega-3 fatty acids from plant sources (alpha-linole- nic acid) was found to offer the same degree of protection as increased fish intake.169

## Preventing a Subsequent Stroke

To prevent a subsequent stroke and promote recovery from a stroke, Ginkgo biloba extract should be added to the program as described ear- lier for preventing a subsequent heart attack. The extract of G. biloba leaves standardized to contain 24% ginkgo flavonglycosides and 6% terpenoids has been the subject of more than 300 published scientific papers and more than 40 double-blind studies in the treatment of decreased blood supply to the brain (cerebrovascular insufficiency). G. biloba extract has also been shown to enhance stroke recovery (see Chapter 93 for more information).

## Other Considerations

## Angiography, Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery, or Angioplasty

A significant challenge for the clinician is determining when a patient should be referred for angiography, coronary artery bypass surgery, or angioplasty. As is fully discussed in Chapter 82, these procedures are used far more frequently than is justified by objective evaluation of their appropriateness and efficacy. Chapter 145 also provides advice for patient care when angiography, coronary artery bypass surgery, or angioplasty is unavoidable.

## Earlobe Crease

The presence of a diagonal earlobe crease has been recognized as a sign of CVD since 1973. More than 30 studies have been reported in the medical literature. The earlobe is richly vascularized, and a decrease in blood flow over an extended period of time is believed to result in col- lapse of the vascular bed. This collapse leads to a diagonal crease.170,171 In one study, angiographs performed on 205 consecutive patients showed an 82% accuracy in predicting heart disease, with a false-pos- itive rate of 12% and a false-negative rate of 18%. In another study of 112 consecutive patients, the earlobe crease was highly correlated with demonstrable heart disease and less strongly with previous MI.171 The crease is seen more commonly with advancing age, until the age of 80, when the incidence drops dramatically. However, the associ- ation with heart disease is independent of age. Although the presence of an earlobe crease does not prove heart disease, it strongly suggests it, and examination of the earlobe is an easy screening procedure. The correlation does not hold with Asians, Native Americans, or children with Beckwith’s syndrome.171


There is little doubt that in most cases atherosclerosis is directly related to diet and lifestyle. Treatment and prevention include reducing all known risk factors. For many patients, this goal requires a major change in diet and lifestyle. Because so many factors are known to be involved in atherosclerosis, any treatment plan must be individualized to assure optimal results. What follows is a general approach that must be tailored according to the clinical picture and the patient’s willingness to adopt it.

## Dietary Recommendations

Follow the dietary guidelines given in Chapter 44 (a modified version of the Mediterranean diet). Table 149.9 provides additional guidance in dietary selections, and Box 149.5 lists foods to avoid because of their trans-fatty acid content. Specifically, it is important to: • Eat less saturated fat and cholesterol by reducing or eliminating the amounts of animal products in the diet. • Increase the consumption of fiber-rich plant foods (fruits, vegeta- bles, grains, legumes, and raw nuts and seeds). • Increase the consumption of monounsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids. • Follow a low-glycemic diet.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lifestyle Recommendations

• Achieve ideal body weight. • Exercise aerobically on a regular basis. • Do not smoke.


• High-potency multivitamin and mineral formula • Vitamin C: 250 to 500 mg 3 times a day • Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols): 200 to 400 IU per day • Grape seed or pine bark extract: 100 mg per day • Fish oil supplement: minimum 1000 mg of EPA + DHA • Vitamin D: 1000 to 4000 IU/day (should usually be complemented with vitamin K 2 )

## 1150SECTION 6 Diseases

antigens plays a major role in AD. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an IL-7–like cytokine secreted by barrier-defective skin and is found at high levels in skin biopsies from patients with lesional AD.5 TSLP is a critical factor linking responses at interfaces between the body and environment (skin, airway, gut, ocular tissues, etc.) to Th2 responses (Fig. 150.1). Environmental factors such as Toll-like receptor ligands, a Nod2 ligand, viruses, microbes, allergen sources, helminths, diesel exhaust, cigarette smoke, and chemicals trigger TSLP produc- tion. Proinflammatory cytokines, Th2-related cytokines, and IgE also induce or enhance TSLP production, indicating cycles of amplifica- tion. Skin barrier injury, increased epidermal endogenous protease activity, and less epidermal Notch signaling, all of which have been reported in AD, and keratinocyte-specific loss of retinoid X receptors and treatment of skin with agonists for vitamin D receptor in mice induce TSLP production, Th2 response, or AD-like inflammation.6 TSLP profoundly triggers Th2 commitment and is increased when stimulated by phthalates.7 Phthalates are used in a large variety of products, from enteric coatings of pharmaceutical pills and nutritional supplements to viscosity control agents, gelling agents, film formers, stabilizers, dispersants, lubricants, binders, emulsifying agents, and suspending agents. End applications include adhesives and glues, agricultural uses, building materials, personal care products, medical devices, detergents and surfactants, packaging, children’s toys, mod- eling clay, waxes, paints, printing inks and coatings, pharmaceuticals, food products, and textiles. Phthalates are also frequently used in soft plastic fishing lures, caulk, paint pigments, and sex toys made of “jelly rubber.” Phthalates are used in a variety of household applications, such as shower curtains, vinyl upholstery, adhesives, floor tiles, food containers and wrappers, and cleaning materials. Pervasive exposure to phthalates may therefore play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. Cosmetic colorants have also been shown to upregulate TSLP and aggravate dermatitis.8 TSLP sensitizes the lungs to allergens and may help explain the frequently observed evolution of AD to asthma, known as the atopic march. Development of atopic disease is also strongly influenced by the colonization of skin and intestinal microflora in early infancy. The microflora in the skin is dependent on the degree of hydration and the integrity of the skin barrier. Dry skin predisposes to Staphylococcus aureus colonization. Low gut microbiota diversity is associated with a Th2-dominant pattern as well as with food sensitization.9 Dupilumab is a fully humanized, monoclonal antibody targeting the alpha subunit of the interleukin (IL)-4 receptor to block signaling of IL-4 and IL-13. An in-depth study of lesional and nonlesional skin during dupilumab therapy found that modulating IL-4/IL-13 signal- ing through IL-4R α antagonism in patients with AD led to statistically significant improvement in AD after 4 weeks of treatment, compared with placebo.10 The study also demonstrated that dupilumab suppressed mRNA expression in lesional skin of genes related to activation of T cells, den- dritic cells, eosinophils, inflammatory pathways, type 2 cytokines, and downregulated genes responsible for epidermal hyperplasia (S100A and K16 genes). Blocking IL-4/IL-13 may not only improve inflam- mation in AD but may also restore skin barrier function as a result of significant increases in claudin, loricrin, filaggrin, and lipid product levels. These results show promising new insights into the role of type 2 cytokines in AD and suggest that inhibition of IL-4/IL-13 has the potential to reverse multiple molecular defects in patients with AD. Fig. 150.1 Mechanisms of immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitization to epidermal self-proteins in patients with atopic dermatitis. Inflammation induces pruritus through interleukin (IL)-31 production. Scratching results in cellular damage and release of membranous and intracellular compounds from keratinocytes (KCs) and possibly other skin cells. The local dendritic cells (DCs) subjected to thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) will induce a Th2 response and the generation of specific IgE directed against these self-proteins. IgE will bind to Fc ε RI on dendritic cells in the skin and thereby amplify the immune response and inflammatory reaction in the skin. (From Tang TS, Bieber T, Williams HC. Does “autoreactivity” play a role in atopic dermatitis? J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2012;129:1209–1215.)

Gastric Helicobacter pylori directly stimulates epidermal cells to secrete TSLP, and H. pylori antibody is positive in up to 70% of patients with AD.11 One study has shown that the treatment of infec- tion, demonstrated by a reduction in C-urea breath test and anti–H. pylori antibody titers, resulted in partial improvement in patients with AD.12 Another study found an inverse relationship between H. pylori positivity and AD in children.13 Galectins are a family of β -galactoside-binding lectins with one or two conserved carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) that play various roles in skin physiology and pathology.14 Galectin-3 contains one CRD following a nonlectin region of some 120 amino acids made of tandem repeats of short proline-/glycine-rich sequences. Galectin-3 is a proinflammatory mediator in AD by its promotion of polarization toward a Th2 immune response by regulating the functions of den- dritic cells (DCs) and T cells.15 Galectin-3 can enhance IgE synthesis by B cells and thus may play a role in the hyperactive immune response in IgE-associated atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome.16 Therapies that reduce galectin-3 may therefore be beneficial in AD (see section on treatment).

## Environmental Factors: Atopic Dermatitis and Allergy

Sensitization to foods triggers isolated skin symptoms in about 30% of children. These symptoms include immediate reactions within min- utes after ingesting food without exacerbation of AD and early and late exacerbations of AD. It is important to identify clinically relevant sensitizations to foods using skin-prick tests; atopy patch testing; spe- cific IgE and IgG4 blood tests; and double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges to initiate appropriate dietary interventions and avoid unnecessary dietary restrictions. A defective skin barrier and increased intestinal permeability appear to facilitate allergen sensiti- zation. Appropriate skin care to maintain skin barrier function and dietary avoidance of identified food allergens during infancy may help prevent further allergen sensitization, thereby reducing the severity of AD and food allergies.17 However, a study published in 2017 identified clinically active food allergies in 26.13% of 88 children with AD. No association with disease severity was found. This may be explained by this study only looking at IgE, which misses other food-related immu- nological factors.18 In February 2018 the first pilot study was published that identi- fied microbial signatures specific for food allergy in children with AD using 16S rRNA sequencing techniques followed by statistical machine-learning approaches.19 Six bacterial species discriminated between the presence and absence of food allergy in these children with AD. The fecal microbiome of children with AD and food allergy harbored significantly more Escherichia coli and Bifidobacter pseudo- catenulatum, and less Bifidobacter breve, Bifidobacter adolescentis, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Akkermansia muciniphila than children with AD without food allergy (p = 0.001). F. prausnitzii and A. muciniphila have gained interest because of their immune- modulatory and mucosal tolerance properties. F. prausnitzii is one of the most abundant species in the human intestinal microbiome. Its decreased abundance has been associated with several diseases, including allergic disease and AD F. prausnitzii is the chief source of butyrate in the colon, used as fuel by colonocytes, with import- ant anti-inflammatory effects. F. prausnitzii also secretes anti- inflammatory modulators, stimulates IL-10–producing Treg cells and regulates the balance between effector and regulatory T cells. A. muciniphila plays a role in the immunological homeostasis of the gut mucosa and gut barrier. Bifidobacteria and E. coli have been associated with food allergy and AD in other studies. Bifidobacteria is reduced in the feces of children with a confirmed cow’s milk allergy.

## Predictors of Severity

One longitudinal study of children examined a number of risk factors that may predict the severity of AD in children.20 This study surveyed 137 children and followed them through four visits over a period of 1½ years. Parameters such as age at onset, social class, ethnic group, child’s atopy, family history of atopy, and other potential risk factors were recorded. This study revealed the following: (1) Children with AD whose eczema started during the first year of life were more likely to have severe disease than were those whose eczema started later, (2) a history of atopy (asthma, hay fever, or both) was associated with severe AD, and (3) children with eczema who lived in an urban area were at increased risk of severe disease compared with their counterparts who lived in a rural environment. This urban environmental risk was inde- pendent of ethnicity. A study published in 2018 concluded that short duration of breast- feeding, absence of older siblings, parental passive smoking, food allergens along with aeroallergens, and excessive cleanliness should be considered as negative prognostic factors, leading to a higher Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score in children with AD.21 Another study found that more than three fast-food meals per week increased the overall risk of AD by 70%. At least one course of a broad-spectrum antibiotic in early life increased the risk of AD by 41%, with an addi- tional 7% increase in risk from each additional course of antibiotics. Reduced diversity of intestinal flora is a recognized risk factor, as is lack of exercise and traffic-related air pollution. Protective factors include ultraviolet light exposure, which enhances filaggrin breakdown into an immunosuppressive isoform; maternal contact with farm animals during pregnancy, high fish intake during pregnancy (lowers AD risk by 25%–43%); consumption of unprocessed milk; helminth infection during pregnancy; dog and high-level endotoxin exposure in early life (through farm animals); and thumbsucking.22

## Comorbidities

Three large data sets, including more than 1 million people, found that AD was associated with only a very small increased risk for car- diovascular disease.23 Obesity in childhood is a positive association, although there is conflicting evidence about obesity in adults and AD.24


The myriad of prescription and over-the-counter medications com- monly used to treat AD fail to address the root cause of the con- dition. Topical medications used to treat AD include emollients, corticosteroids, antibiotics, calcineurin inhibitors, and crisaborole, a boron-based PDE-4 inhibitor. Oral antihistamines are used for pru- ritus. Severe eczema has also been treated with systemic immuno- modulatory agents (e.g., cyclosporine) and systemic corticosteroids. None of these medications has shown effective long-term ability to cure AD. Side effects such as growth retardation, cutaneous com- plications, sedation, and allergic reactions are a major concern.25 Furthermore, a number of these medications can result in a rebound flare-up after discontinuation that is usually worse than the primary lesions. Naturopathic medicine generally attempts to understand the underlying causes of AD and thus attends to additional factors, includ- ing those affecting the digestive system, such as food allergies and microbial overgrowth. Although no one treatment option may be uni- versally effective, patient-specific combination therapeutics acting in synergy are encouraged for optimal efficacy.

## Overgrowth

Numerous studies have documented the role of food allergy in AD (also see Chapter 14). Studies have also shown that breastfeeding offers significant prophylaxis against AD as well as allergies in general.26 One study of 100 infants concluded that breastfeeding should be promoted for the primary prevention of allergy.27 Interestingly, further studies by the same group suggest that breastfed infants with allergies should be treated by allergen avoidance; in some cases breastfeeding cessation is recommended to avoid traces of food antigens in breast milk.28 The development of AD in breastfed infants was once believed to be the result of the transfer of allergic antigens in the breast milk, in which mothers were instructed to avoid the common food aller- gens (especially milk, eggs, and peanuts and, to a lesser extent, fish, soy, wheat, citrus, and chocolate).29 Maternal avoidance of these com- mon allergens is associated with complete resolution in some cases. However, more recent studies have found that earlier introduction of common food allergens, rather than later, may be more efficacious in preventing the development of food allergies, at least for peanuts. In a prospective controlled study, regular consumption of peanut protein in infants from 4 to 11 months of age with atopic dermatitis or egg allergy was associated with a lower prevalence of peanut allergy (1.9%) at 60 months of age compared with peanut avoidance (13.7%). Other studies demonstrated that earlier introduction of cow’s milk protein and egg powder were also associated with decreased risk for milk and egg allergy, respectively.30 In older or formula-fed infants, milk, eggs, and peanuts appear to be the most common food allergens inducing AD. In one study, these three foods were implicated in 81% of all cases of childhood AD,31 whereas in another study, 60% of children with severe AD had a positive food challenge to one or two of the following: egg, cow’s milk, peanut, fish, wheat, or soybean. One randomized controlled trial found that in those individuals with a positive radioallergosorbent test to eggs, an egg-free diet was associated with an improvement in the severity of AD, with the greatest effect seen in those most severely affected.32 Although eggs are a major suspect, virtually any food can be the offending agent.33 Diagnosis of food allergy is usually best achieved via the elimina- tion diet and double-blind placebo challenge method. This approach is especially useful in childhood eczema. Elimination of milk products, eggs, peanuts, tomatoes, and artificial colors and preservatives results in significant improvement in at least 75% of cases.31,33,34 If laboratory methods are used to identify food allergies in eczema, the most use- ful method (although not perfect) appears to be the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgE and IgG 4 (see Chapter 14).35 The presence of food allergies is thought to be partially responsible for persons with AD having a “leaky gut.”36 As a result of this increased gut permeability, there is an increased antigen load on the immune sys- tem, which subsequently overwhelms the immune system and increases the likelihood of developing additional allergies. Permeability studies using urinary mannitol and lactulose confirm that hypoallergenic diets do decrease gut permeability and are associated with improvements in atopic eczema. It is essential to identify offending foods as soon as pos- sible to avoid increasing gut permeability. Trying to deal with multiple food allergies is often a difficult task for the patient because the diet is often unrealistically restrictive. The elimination of allergenic foods and restoration of normal intestinal permeability appear to stop the development of new allergies.37 Patients should be encouraged to find out whether, if they can avoid offending foods for a period of 6 to 12 months, their antibody levels to allergens will decrease to the point that they can tolerate the reintro- duction of some foods at least twice a week. The loss rate of food allergy in patients with AD after 1 year was 26% for the five major allergens (egg, milk, wheat, soy, and peanut) and 66% for other food allergens.38

## Gluten Sensitivity

Many patients with celiac disease also have atopic disorders. Of patients with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and mucosal lesions but negative results from serological or genetic tests for celiac disease, 30% had reduced GI and atopic symptoms when placed on a gluten-free diet.39

<!-- chunk -->

## Candida albicans. An overgrowth of the common yeast

Candida albicans in the gastrointestinal tract has been implicated as a causative factor in allergic conditions, including AD. Elevated levels of anticandidal antibodies are common in atopic individuals. Furthermore, the severity of lesions tends to correlate with the level of IgE antibodies in relation to candidal antigens. Appropriate anticandidal therapy (see Chapter 159) may result in significant clinical improvement of AD.40,41


Because the intestinal flora plays a major role in the health of the host, especially regarding AD, probiotic therapy is especially indicated. Studies evaluating the administration of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG alone or in conjunction with Lactobacillus reuteri to infants with AD and cow’s milk allergy demonstrated a significant reduction of the severity of eczema.42–45 However, the one randomized controlled trial44 that prescribed both probiotic strains used a skim milk powder preparation for the placebo group. Patients were also allowed to continue corticosteroid treatment. Both of these factors may have confounded any beneficial results because it was noted that corticosteroid use increased in the placebo group during the active treatment period, possibly indicat- ing an allergic reaction to the milk proteins in the placebo. Another interesting note is the finding in this study that the positive therapeutic effect of probiotics was more pronounced in patients with an allergic constitution, as evidenced by positive responses to the skin-prick test and increased IgE levels. This suggests that these tests may be useful in forecasting who may be most responsive to probiotic therapy. A meta-analysis published in 2016 showed evidence that supports the use of synbiotics (combination of probiotics and prebiotics) for the treatment of AD in children age 1 year or older.46 Finally, a spore- based probiotic has shown preliminary evidence of improving markers of leaky gut.47 Although more study is warranted, it seems reasonable to include probiotics in a therapeutic regimen given their safety and overall health benefits.


Supplementing the diet of AD patients with evening primrose, bor- age, or black currant oil (commercial sources of gamma-linolenic acid) may prove helpful. Several double-blind studies with evening primrose oil (typically using dosages of at least 3000 mg daily, providing mg of gamma-linolenic acid) have shown benefit.48–50 The benefits of omega-6 oils are primarily in skin barrier function. However, over- all, the therapeutic results appear to be more favorable with omega-3 oil supplementation than with omega-6 oils. Several studies with eve- ning primrose oil failed to demonstrate any therapeutic benefit over a placebo. In the largest of these studies and one of the highest in methodological quality, no benefit of evening primrose oil could be demonstrated.51 Similarly, one study of 140 people, including 69 chil- dren, showed few beneficial effects of borage oil for AD.52 Dietary enrichment with “fish oil” supplements providing eicos- apentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or simply eating

more fatty fish (e.g., mackerel, herring, salmon) results in significant incorporation of omega-3 fatty acids into the membrane phospholipid pools. Flaxseed oil, which contains alpha-linolenic acid, the precursor omega-3 fatty acid, may benefit patients with AD. However, because the degree of clinical improvement correlates with the increase in the concentration of DHA in serum phospholipids, and fish oils are much more effective in raising DHA levels than flaxseed oil, supplementation with EPA/DHA or increasing the consumption of cold-water fish is likely to produce better overall results in AD than flaxseed oil.53 Epidemiological studies have found protective associations between fish intake in pregnancy, lactation, infancy, and childhood and atopic outcomes. Similar studies of fish oil supplements have also found pro- tective and therapeutic effects.54


The serum concentration of 25(OH)D3 in 95 patients with AD was not statistically different from 58 control subjects. However, the fre- quency of bacterial skin infection was higher in patients with AD with lower 25(OH)D 3 levels, and after supplementation, both mean objec- tive SCORAD and SCORAD index were significantly lower (P < .05).55


One single-blind analysis evaluated 96 patients given either 400 inter- national units of vitamin E or a placebo daily for 8 months. Significant improvement was reported in approximately 60% of the treatment group (compared with 2% among the placebo group), with significant reductions in serum IgE levels.56 The combination of vitamin D 3 1600 IU and vitamin E 600 IU daily significantly reduced SCORAD ratings.57


The use of botanical medicines in AD can be generally divided into two categories: internal and external. Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) appears to be useful in either application. Internally, licorice prepa- rations can exert significant anti-inflammatory and antiallergic effects (see Chapter 85). These benefits are perhaps best exemplified in several double-blind studies featuring a licorice-containing Chinese herbal formula.58 In addition to licorice, the formula contained the following: • Ledebouriealla seseloides • Potentilla chinensis • Clematis chinensis • Clematis armandi • Rehmania glutinosa • Paeonia lactiflora • Lophatherum gracile • Dictamnus dasycarpus • Tribulus terrestris • Schizonepeta tenuifolia Interest in this formula by a group of researchers began after a patient with AD experienced tremendous improvement after taking a decoction prescribed by a Chinese doctor. Several double-blind studies have confirmed this benefit. In one study, 40 adult patients with long-standing, refractory, widespread AD were randomized to receive 2 months’ treatment of either the active formula or a placebo decoction, followed by a crossover to the other treatment after a 4-week washout period.59 The treatment group demonstrated significant superiority over the placebo in clinical evalu- ation. In addition, of the 31 patients completing the study, 20 preferred the active formula, whereas only 4 preferred the placebo. There was also a subjective improvement in itching and sleep during the active treatment phase. No side effects were reported, although many com- plained about the poor palatability of the decoction. Similar results were demonstrated in a double-blind study in chil- dren.60 These positive preliminary studies will hopefully be followed by more extensive investigations to determine proper dosages and per- haps different forms of administration (e.g., pills, tablets, or capsules vs. decoctions). Licorice undoubtedly plays a major role in the effectiveness of the Chinese herbal formula. At this time, until the benefits of the other components can be confirmed, it makes the most sense to base the dosage level on the level of delivered licorice. With regard to using licorice topically, good results are likely to be obtained by using commercial preparations featuring pure glycyr- rhetinic acid. Several studies have shown glycyrrhetinic acid to exert an effect similar to that of topical hydrocortisone in the treatment of eczema, contact and allergic dermatitis, and psoriasis. In one study, 9 of 12 patients with intractable eczema noted marked improvement, and noted mild improvement, when an ointment containing glycyrrhetinic acid was applied topically. In another study, 93% of the patients with eczema applying glycyrrhetinic acid demonstrated improvement com- pared with 83% using cortisone.61 A proprietary topical cream of Rheum palmatum, Scutellaria bai- calensis, Cnidium monnieri, dipotassium glycyrrhizinate, Sanguisorba officinalis, and Ailanthus altissima in a base of ceramides, hyaluronic acid, shea butter, and vitamin E has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, antimicrobial, antipruritic, and barrier-repair effects: 46% reduction in SCORAD in 3 weeks, equal efficacy in severe and nonse- vere AD, 60% reduction in itching after 3 weeks, and 32% improve- ment in skin moisture level after 3 weeks (Dermatest, Germany). A clinical trial is currently in process comparing this cream with another proprietary oat-based over-the-counter (OTC) product.

## Endocrine Factors

Patients with hypothyroidism and eczema respond well to thyroid hor- mone supplementation.62

## Scratching Cessation

Scratching is extremely detrimental in AD because it breaks the skin, which aids bacterial ingress and promotes barrier dysfunction and lichenification. Factors that limit itching therefore promote healing and prevent recurrence. Some behavior modification techniques have proved valuable in reducing the exacerbation of AD symptoms caused by scratching.25 Wet wraps are an effective barrier to scratching while also increas- ing hydration as well as the penetration of medication and emollients and promoting more restful sleep, and using them is simple. After applying medication and emollient, the affected areas are wrapped in warm, wet gauze or, as an alternative, 100% cotton socks with the toe portion cut off. Apply a dry layer over the wet layer, and leave it on overnight for 5 to 14 days.63

## Bleach baths

Bleach baths (1/4 cup household bleach added to bathwater) have been shown to reduce S. aureus and diminish AD severity.64 For those patients who do not have a bathtub or prefer showering, a bleach body wash is another option. An open-label trial of 0.006% sodium hypochlorite body wash gel, left on the skin for 1 to 2 minutes before showering off, decreased S. aureus colonization and markedly improved symptoms and quality of life in children by 2/3 after 2 weeks of daily use.65

## Psychological Approach

Although the mechanism of the exact relationship between stress and AD has not been fully elucidated, it has been established through both

## 1154SECTION 6 Diseases

clinical and physiological pathways that psychological stress is a signifi- cant contributor to a patient’s AD disease course through its direct and indirect effects on immune response, cutaneous neuropeptide expres- sion, and skin barrier function.66 Emotional tension can provoke and aggravate itching in patients with AD, and according to a number of studies, patients with AD show higher levels of anxiety, hostility, and neurosis than matched controls.66 Studies employing psychotherapy have shown promising results, with one study showing reductions in the use of corticosteroids for up to 2 years.25

## Humor

Starting in 2001 a fascinating series of studies was done by Dr. Hajime Kimata, an allergist at Unitika Central Hospital in Uji-City, Japan. The first mention Kimata made of this therapeutic intervention was in a letter to the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2001.67 Kimata had a series of studies published over a 9-year period. In his letter, he gives credit to Norman Cousins for giving him the idea for his research. Cousins had authored a book, Anatomy of an Illness, published in 1979, wherein he credited his relief from the pain of anky- losing spondylitis to watching comedies on TV. In Kimata’s first trial, 26 patients with AD who were all allergic to dust mites and most of whom were also allergic to cedar pollen and cat dander were studied. After going 72 hours with no medication, they underwent skin-prick tests before and after viewing Modern Times, a comedy starring Charlie Chaplin. The size of the resulting wheal was measured. A similar pro- cedure was repeated before and after an 87-minute video featuring weather information. The wheal responses to dust mites, cedar pollen, and cat dander were significantly reduced after watching Chaplin, and the effect lasted for hours. Watching the weather had no effect on the wheal size.67 His succeeding studies built on this finding, consistently showing that humor and positive emotions ameliorated symptoms of AD.68 In 2015 Kimata was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for a study showing that 30 minutes of kissing with a lover or spouse behind closed doors while listening to soft music can reduce allergic reactions among atopic and allergic patients.69

and in their skin condition by all patients.70 An observational longitudinal study was conducted on 325 chil- dren (37.9%) with atopic diseases out of 857 children consecutively examined from 1998 to 2014 at the Homeopathic Clinic of Lucca in Italy: 127 children were affected by asthma, 72 by allergic rhinitis, and 126 (36%) by AD. Follow-up on AD was achieved with 104 (48.8%), and 65 (62.5%) of them reported a major improvement or resolution. Children with AD who started homeopathic treatment at less than 4.9 years of age were assessed 5 to 10 years later, and complete remission of AD was obtained in 84.2%. Children with two or three atopic diseases at the first visit were completely cured in 40% of cases.71 A study was conducted in a homeopathic general practice in Buenos Aires, Argentina, of 42 patients with AD spontaneously seeking homeo- pathic treatment. Of these patients, 21 had other atopic comorbidities, and 28 (66.7%) were moderate or severe cases. Significant differences were observed when comparing the first and last consultations in the mean percentage of affected skin area, 21.1% versus 5.5% respectively (P = 0.002), and in the change in the four visual analog scale (VAS) scores: area of AD, 31.1 (P < 0.0001); itch, 35.0 (P < 0.0001); gen- eral well-being, 11.1 (P < 0.0188); and sleep, 17.4 (P < 0.0073). In this study, 12 individualized homeopathic medicines were prescribed; sul- fur accounted for 60% of cases with good treatment response.72 A third study of homeopathic treatment compared with conven- tional treatment of AD conducted in Berlin, Germany, was a pro- spective, multicenter, comparative, observational, nonrandomized rater-blinded study of 135 children (48 treated with homeopathy, with conventional medicine) with mild to moderate AD. SCORAD showed no significant differences between groups at 36 months. Total costs were higher in the homeopathic versus conventional group: EUR 200.5 versus EUR 78.86 (p = 0.005).73

# ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

<!-- chunk -->

## Dust Mite Exposure

In patients with dust mite sensitization and eczema, sublingual immu- notherapy has shown benefit.74 Paradoxically, lower levels of eczema have been found in children with higher levels of dust mite exposure, so reducing house dust in early infancy could increase the risk of AD.75

<!-- chunk -->

## Microwave Exposure

One fascinating study of cell phone use continuously for an hour showed significant increases in the allergic response to dust and pollen in adults with eczema.76 Microwave radiation exposure also increased plasma levels of substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide in patients with AD. This study raises the concern that microwave radia- tion emitted from cell phones may actually increase sensitivity to spe- cific allergens in some patients.


Effective management requires relief from and prevention of itching while the underlying abnormalities are being treated. Barrier dysfunc- tion must be addressed. Food allergens must be detected and con- trolled, phthalates should be avoided and detoxification carried out, and the presence of H. pylori should be determined and treated.


The patient should begin a 4-day rotation diet and eliminate all major allergens (milk, eggs, and peanuts account for the offending food in approximately 81% of cases). As the patient improves, allergens can slowly be reintroduced, and a stringent rotation diet can be modi- fied. Cold-water fish such as wild salmon, mackerel, herring, sardine, and halibut should be included, and other animal products should be limited.


• High-potency multiple vitamin and mineral formula • Vitamin D dosed to achieve and maintain an optimal level of 65 ng/ dL • Vitamin E: 400 international units daily (mixed tocopherols) • Fish oil: 1000 to 3000 mg EPA+DHA daily • Borage oil: 1 Tbsp daily • Probiotics: 5 to 10 billion viable Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum cells daily or a spore-based probiotic • Modified citrus pectin to lower galectin-3 levels: 5 to 6 grams daily on empty stomach

## Psychological Approach

It should be determined whether the patient is experiencing significant levels of anxiety, depression, or hostility. If so, he or she may be helped to resolve these problems or referred to a psychotherapist for profes- sional assistance. Laughter from comedies and humorous films can be recommended for their salutary effect on AD.

## 1157CHAPTER 151 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder

• Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities (e.g., difficulty managing sequential tasks; difficulty keeping materials and belong- ings in order; messy, disorganized work; has poor time manage- ment; fails to meet deadlines) • Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort (e.g., schoolwork or homework; for older adolescents and adults, preparing reports, completing forms, reviewing lengthy papers) • Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g., school materials, pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, mobile telephones) • Is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli (for older adoles- cents and adults, may include unrelated thoughts) • Is often forgetful in daily activities (e.g., doing chores, running errands; for older adolescents and adults, returning calls, paying bills, keeping appointments) Symptoms of hyperactivity per the DSM-5 may include the following: • Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet or squirms in seat • Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected (e.g., leaves his or her place in the classroom, in the office or other workplace, or in other situations that require remaining in place) • Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is inappropriate (Note: In adolescents or adults, may be limited to feeling restless.) • Often unable to play or engage in leisure activities quietly • Is often “on the go,” acting as if “driven by a motor” (e.g., is unable to be or uncomfortable being still for an extended time, as in restau- rants, meetings; may be experienced by others as being restless or difficult to keep up with) • Often talks excessively • Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed (e.g., completes people’s sentences; cannot wait for turn in conver- sation) • Often has difficulty waiting his or her turn (e.g., while waiting in line) • Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversa- tions, games, or activities; may start using other people’s things without asking or receiving permission; for adolescents and adults, may intrude into or take over what others are doing) ADHD characteristics are frequently associated with difficulties in school, in both learning and behavior, as well as at work among adults. If not intensively managed, a child with ADHD will likely expe- rience academic impairment, increased risk of injuries, and problems with self-esteem and socialization. Later in adolescence and adult- hood, those with ADHD have a high risk of experiencing depression or anxiety, substance abuse and addictions, traffic accidents, financial problems, vocational underachievement, and social problems. Indeed, a 2015 large cohort of Danish individuals with ADHD found a sig- nificant increase in risk for mortality among individuals with ADHD, which remained after adjustment for related conditions, such as sub- stance abuse disorder.1 Nevertheless, ADHD is a condition that can be transcended, and many with ADHD have achieved a high level of personal success. Although influenced by the region, investigator, and diagnostic cri- teria, ADHD has been estimated to affect approximately 6% to 7% of children and 5% of adults (for whom we have prevalence data) in the United States.2 The worldwide prevalence is slightly less, with a meta-analysis of 41 studies and 27 countries finding an overall prev- alence of 3.4%.3 The economic cost associated with ADHD has been estimated to range from $143 billion to $266 billion per year in the United States alone.4 Clinical observation and epidemiological surveys typically report a greater incidence in boys than girls (approximately 3–4:1), although this gap may to some degree be due to less teach- er-based referrals, for whom boys’ behavior is seen as more disruptive. Approximately 3.5% of children in the United States take at least one prescription drug for ADHD every day, a rate consistently higher than other Western countries.5 Onset is usually by 3 years of age, although the diagnosis is often not made until later when the child is in school.6

## Etiology

The behavioral and cognitive manifestations of ADHD arise from evi- dence associating this disorder with diminished function of polysyn- aptic dopaminergic circuits belonging to executive centers within the brain’s prefrontal cortex.7,8 These executive centers are largely inhibi- tory in nature and are responsible for impulse control and the ability to maintain sustained attention.9 Evidence from studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning, single-photon emis- sion computed tomographic scan imaging, and electroencephalograms (EEGs) suggests that the brains of those with ADHD exhibit differences both morphologically and metabolically from normal controls, par- ticularly with regard to the prefrontal executive centers.10,11 Various disturbances in dopaminergic activity within these brain centers have remained the primary molecular defects implicated in ADHD, although other neurotransmitters (particularly norepinephrine) have also been incriminated. Decreased sensitivity of the dopaminergic (D4) recep- tor and heightened dopamine reuptake by the presynaptic dopamine transporter were both suggested to result in diminished dopaminergic activity within executive centers. More recently, task-activated func- tional MRI (fMRI) suggests that functional deficiencies may be more widespread throughout the brain, in multiple neuronal networks, and not just limited to executive function. For example, a meta-analysis of 55 fMRI studies found that ADHD may be better described “as a disorder underpinned by dysfunctions in multiple large-scale brain networks.” This includes both hypoactivation, such as observed in the frontoparietal executive control network, putamen, and ventral attention network, as well as potentially compensatory hyperactiva- tion in the default network and visual circuits.12 Other areas where deficits have been found include temporal information processing and timing, speech and language, memory span, processing speed and response time variability, arousal and activation, and motor control.13 However, all of these defects are not necessarily permanent, because as children with ADHD grow up, the brain may develop a normal level of functional activity, and the anatomical variations lessen. In addition, ADHD symptoms also tend to improve.14 Genetic factors play a significant role in the etiology of ADHD.15 Twin studies suggest that ADHD has a heritability of 70% to 80% in both children and adults, and parents and siblings of those with ADHD have a five- to tenfold elevated risk themselves.13 Differences have been identified in genes encoding for both the D2 and the D4 dopamine receptors in ADHD. Other studies have linked ADHD with genetic polymorphisms associated with increased activity of the presynaptic dopamine transporter (which would result in increased uptake of dopamine). The gene most frequently implicated in GWAS studies is CDH13, which is involved in cell adhesion and neurodevel- opmental processes. However, recent analyses suggest that although up to 70% of the genetic component of ADHD may be explained by com- mon variants, the effect of any single single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or copy-number variation is very small and should be viewed as a polygenic combination, comprising both common and rare variants.16 Other genetic factors contributing to ADHD may include inherited tendencies toward allergic states, decreased immune compe- tence, and various genetic polymorphisms, resulting in a diminished capacity to detoxify drugs, heavy metals, and xenobiotics. In other

words, although there is little doubt that genetics are a predisposing factor, like most health conditions, environmental and dietary factors may play a significant role in how and whether these genetic factors manifest to produce ADHD in an individual.

## Conventional Drugs

The role of nutritional and environmental factors as the underlying cause of ADHD has been increasingly recognized. Despite significant advances in the use of nutritional therapies for ADHD, the prevailing conventional approach to the treatment of ADHD relies almost entirely on amphetamine drugs for purely symptomatic relief. These drugs, like Ritalin (methylphenidate), Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphet- amine), Concerta (methylphenidate), and Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate), improve ADHD symptoms primarily by potentiating the neurotransmitter dopamine within all brain regions, including those affected in ADHD. These medications reportedly improved behavior and cognitive functioning in approximately 75% of children in formal placebo-controlled trials. However, the success of treatment when stud- ied in actual clinical practice might be significantly lower. Furthermore, follow-up studies failed to demonstrate long-term benefits with these stimulant medications. Additionally, these drugs are associated with a high prevalence of adverse effects, such as decreased appetite, sleep problems, anxiety, and irritability. Some of the long-term effects of these drugs could be extremely detrimental to both brain function and behav- ior.17–19 For example, one of the largest and longest-term studies, the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA), found that despite initial reports of treatment success, the long-term effective- ness was more questionable, and the risk of side effects, including growth suppression in children, may have been underappreciated.20 Nonstimulant drugs like atomoxetine (Strattera) have been pro- moted as a safe alternative to parents. However, the drug has its own set of problems, including studies that showed that children and teen- agers who took atomoxetine were more likely to have suicidal thoughts than children and teenagers with ADHD who did not take it.21 The bottom line is that every effort should be made to treat ADHD without the long-term reliance on medications. One of the primary goals in many cases of ADHD treatment is to enhance cognitive function. Perhaps up to 50% of people with ADHD have definable learning disabilities, and most have mea- surable cognitive disturbances. Particularly disabling is the dimin- ishment in nonverbal working memory exhibited by most patients with ADHD.22,23 This feature of ADHD results in a diminished sense of time, as well as a decreased ability to hold events or tasks in the mind. Tardiness, missed appointments, procrastination, poor task planning, and failure to meet deadlines are all examples of how diminished working memory can result in serious consequences, particularly in adulthood.

# ENVIRONMENTAL NEUROTOXINS

Environmental factors that contribute to the development of ADHD may begin at or even before conception. Maternal-to-fetal transport of various neurotoxins can occur readily during pregnancy. A woman who has an ongoing exposure to or a significant body burden of neu- rotoxic substances (e.g., heavy metals like lead and mercury, solvents, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], alcohol, or other drugs of abuse) may herself exhibit features consistent with ADHD and give birth to a child who presents with symptoms of ADHD. In such cases, it might be assumed that ADHD is inherited when it is actually acquired. Children remain susceptible to neurotoxins after birth, and some of these agents have been shown to be common among children in North America.24,25

## Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers

For example, exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) is fairly common among children, and both prenatal and postnatal exposure have been associated with increases in hyperactive and aggressive behavior, as well as decreased attention and executive function, and it may be that PBDEs potentially target the prefrontal cortex.26

In a large Norwegian birth cohort, early life exposure (e.g., breast milk concentrations) to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and β -hexachlo- rocyclohexane ( β -HCH) were each associated with nearly a twofold increase in the risk for ADHD diagnosis by a median age of 13 years.27

## Bisphenol A

Early exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) was also found to be associated with ADHD, as found in a 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis of existing data.28

## Maternal Drug Use

Maternal tobacco and drug use have also been associated with a higher risk of ADHD.29–31 One study suggested that up to 25% of all behav- ioral disorders in children can be attributed to exposure to cigarette smoking during pregnancy.29 In addition, long-term, low-level lead intoxication in North American children was reported to exist at an alarmingly high incidence.25,32

## Lead

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that about 2% of American children younger than age 6 currently meet the cri- teria for lead toxicity at a level that has been associated with cogni- tive deficits and behavioral disturbances (more than 10 ug/dL whole blood lead).32 Low-level lead intoxication has also been associated with addictive behaviors and impulsivity, suggesting neurological changes consistent with the reward deficiency syndrome, as described earlier.33 And recent data suggest that a cutoff of 10 ug/dL is not protective; a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis found that even levels as low as <3 ug/dL were associated with significant increases in ADHD symp- toms.34 A recent analysis of 75 participants with ADHD also found an interaction between lead exposure and the dopamine receptor D2 receptor (DRD2) gene on frontal lobe cortical thickness, suggesting a toxin–gene interaction that affects brain morphology.35 In keeping with these data, pilot studies demonstrated improvement in ADHD behaviors in some children with moderate elevations in blood lead lev- els who were treated with intravenous ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid chelation.36

## Other Metals

In addition to lead, other toxic metals, such as mercury, cadmium, and aluminum, as well as pesticides and PCBs, are nearly ubiquitous con- taminants arising from dental amalgams, food, air, and drinking water, and these agents may act synergistically to impair neurological func- tion and development in susceptible children. The Consumer’s Union of the United States conducted a large study looking at the level of human exposure to a wide range of pesticides in the U.S. food supply. In this startling report, it was demonstrated that human exposure to pesticides is far greater than ever previously estimated and that chil- dren are at particularly high risk for neurotoxic effects from regular inadvertent pesticide exposure from common foods.37

## Organophosphate Pesticides

Quite concerning is that an analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data suggests that children with lev- els only higher than the median for a common urinary metabolite of organophosphate pesticides (dimethyl alkylphosphate [DMAP]) have roughly twice the odds of developing ADHD as those with undetect- able levels.38 Interactions between organophosphate pesticides and genetic polymorphisms have also been observed; a study conducted in Taiwan found that not only did children with ADHD have higher levels of an organophosphate pesticide metabolite (dimethylphosphate [DMP]), but also those who had higher exposure, a polymorphism in the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4), and higher levels of oxidative stress had a nearly twelvefold risk for developing ADHD.39

## Food Additives, Sugar, and the Feingold Hypothesis

The hypothesis that food additives can cause hyperactivity in children stemmed from the research of Benjamin Feingold, MD, and is com- monly referred to as the “Feingold hypothesis.” According to Feingold, many hyperactive children, perhaps 40% to 50%, are sensitive to arti- ficial food colors, flavors, and preservatives.40 Feingold’s claims were based on his experience with more than 1200 cases in which food additives were linked to learning and behav- ior disorders. Since Feingold’s presentation to the American Medical Association in 1973, the role of food additives as a contributing cause of hyperactivity has been hotly debated in the scientific literature. In actuality, however, researchers focused on only 10 food dyes versus the 3000 food additives with which Feingold was concerned. At first glance, it appears that the majority of the double-blind stud- ies designed to test the hypothesis showed essentially negative results. However, upon closer examination of these studies and further inves- tigation into the literature, it becomes evident that food additives do play a major role in hyperactivity.41–43 Overwhelming evidence was produced in several of these studies. In a more recent study, 153 3-year-old and 144 8- to 9-year-old children from the general population (in other words, the study was not conducted on children with the specific diagnosis of ADHD) were challenged with either a drink that contained sodium benzoate and an artificial food coloring mix or a placebo mix. The main outcome mea- sure was a global hyperactivity aggregate, based on observed behav- iors and ratings by teachers and parents, plus, for the 8- to 9-year-old children, a computerized test of attention. The results showed that the children given the artificial food coloring agents definitely had a sta- tistically significant adverse reaction on hyperactivity and behavior. The results were so clear that the authors concluded that “Artificial colors or a sodium benzoate preservative (or both) in the diet result in increased hyperactivity in 3-year-old and 8/9-year-old children in the general population.”44 It is interesting to note that although the U.S. studies were largely negative, the reports from the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada were more supportive. Feingold contended that there is a conflict of interest on the part of the Nutrition Foundation, an organization supported by the major food manufacturers—Coca-Cola, Nabisco, General Foods, and so forth. It appears significant that the Nutrition Foundation financed most of the negative studies. The conflict of interest arises because these companies would suffer economically if food additives were found to be harmful. Other countries have sig- nificantly restricted the use of artificial food additives because of the possible harmful effects. In looking at all of the data on the role of food additives in ADHD, the following conclusions can be made: virtually Every study (both negative and positive) demonstrated that some hyperactive children consistently react with behavioral problems when challenged by spe- cific food additives or specific foods. Critics of the hypothesis ignore the significance of the clear (reproducible under double-blind condi- tions) individual results. The bottom line is that some children defi- nitely react quite strongly to foods or food additives, warranting the exclusion of these compounds for at least 10 days to judge their signif- icance in all cases of ADHD. In addition to eliminating food additives, there appears to be an interrelationship between sugar consumption and artificial food dyes. One study demonstrated that destructive-aggressive and restless behavior significantly correlated with the amount of sugar consumed.45 The higher the sugar intake, the worse the behavior. In another study, researchers performed 5-hour oral glucose tolerance tests on hyperactive children, with the result that 74% displayed abnormal glucose tolerance or hypoglycemia.46 There is also a positive side to this relationship; in 2017 Pediatrics published results showing not only were sugar, candy, cola, and similar dietary factors associated with a ADHD diagnosis, but lower adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a risk for ADHD of over sevenfold.47 This strongly sug- gests that changing dietary patterns may have a significant effect.

## Individual Nutrients and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity

## Disorder


Numerous studies have shown that children with ADHD have a mea- surable reduction in tissue levels of the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapen- taenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) compared with age-matched controls. The ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 is also likely to be lower, which may be as or more significant than omega-3 levels alone. A 2016 meta-analysis of studies that measured both omega-3 and omega-6 levels found elevated levels of omega-6/omega-3, particularly the ratio of arachidonic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid (AA/EPA).48 Omega-3 (EPA+DHA) supplementation in ADHD has been studied extensively and is considered a sensible intervention even by many mainstream physicians. Of particular importance is the recognition that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation improves many symptoms of ADHD, including impulsive-oppositional behavior, a symptom not typically helped by the pharmaceutical treatment of ADHD.49 A randomized trial also found that omega fatty acid supplementation had similar benefits to methylphenidate and that adding omega fatty acids to methylphenidate reduced the adverse effects of the drug.50 Because these omega-3 fatty acids are critical in the structure and function of brain cells, it is thought that low levels play a key role in ADHD. The nerve endings in the areas of the brain affected in ADHD should be rich in DHA because they are highly fluid and should be composed of approximately 80% DHA. DHA deficiency has also been shown to result in increased permeability of the blood–brain barrier in animal studies and is thought to play a critical role in protecting the brain from an influx of neurotoxic compounds.51,52 Human breast milk is also rich in DHA, and several studies sug- gested that formula-fed children are at twice the risk of developing ADHD as those who are breastfed.53 The role of DHA in brain devel- opment, intelligence, and possible protection against ADHD finally led to its inclusion in many infant formulas and other foods. Besides fatty acids, inadequate provision of other nutrients during fetal development and early childhood may also play a significant role in the development of ADHD as well as its treatment.54,55 In addition, children with ADHD often show multiple nutrient deficiencies, high- lighting the importance of broad-spectrum nutritional support. In particular, the following minerals are critical supplements in the man- agement of ADHD.

## 1160SECTION 6 Diseases


Magnesium levels in serum, red blood cells, and hair were all shown to be low in the majority of children with ADHD.56 These children also demon- strated improved behavior when administered magnesium supplements.57


Lower hair and serum zinc levels were shown to frequently accompany ADHD.58 Those children with low serum zinc were also more frequently found to have lower levels of free fatty acids, suggesting that abnormal- ities in fatty acid metabolism may, at least in part, result from zinc defi- ciency.59 It was also shown that lower hair zinc levels correlated with a poorer response to treatment with amphetamines. Several clinical trials demonstrated the positive effects of zinc supplementation in hyperactive children.60,61 An elevated copper/zinc ratio has also been observed.62

## Iron

Anemia from iron deficiency is estimated to affect approximately 20% of infants, and many more are thought to have milder iron deficiencies without anemia, leaving them at risk for impairment of brain develop- ment.63,64 Iron deficiency was found to be even much more common in children with ADHD. One study demonstrated that iron supple- mentation in nonanemic children with ADHD resulted in diminished ADHD symptoms within 30 days.65 A more recent study demonstrated improvement in ADHD symptoms in children with ADHD and low iron stores.66 A 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis found both lower ferritin levels among children with ADHD and more severe symptoms among those with iron deficiency.67 It has also been sug- gested that iron deficiency may exacerbate lead exposure toxicity.


Lower serum levels of vitamin D have been observed among children with ADHD compared with healthy controls.68 An inverse association between cord vitamin D levels and ADHD in toddlers has also been observed.69 Although clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation alone have not yet been conducted, when given as an adjunct to methylpheni- date, vitamin D has been shown to improve some symptoms of ADHD.70

## Food Allergy

There is a very strong relationship between allergies and ADHD, including food allergies.71–75 In one study, demonstrable brainwave EEG changes occurred immediately after ingestion of a previously identified food allergy.75 Food allergies and other allergic disorders were also associated with a higher incidence of recurrent ear infec- tions (otitis media).76 In turn, recurrent otitis media were associated with an increased risk of ADHD.77 Both food allergy and ADHD were associated with sleep disturbances, which may, in turn, contribute to a worsening of ADHD symptoms. Heavy snoring and sleep apnea are particularly prevalent in allergic children and may significantly con- tribute to ADHD symptoms.78,79 Studies demonstrated improved sleep in children with ADHD during a low-allergy potential (oligoantigenic) diet. Food allergy elimination or desensitization can be as effective as drug therapy in reducing ADHD symptoms.80–84 In 2011 the Lancet published the results of the Impact of Nutrition on Children With ADHD (INCA) study, a randomized controlled trial conducted in the Netherlands and Belgium, and found that a strict elimination diet had a significant benefit on symptoms in 64% of children. Although immu- noglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were not predictive of which foods induced symptoms, reintroduction of bothersome foods did induce symptoms, leading the authors to conclude that “dietary intervention should be considered in all children with ADHD, provided parents are willing to follow a diagnostic restricted elimination diet for a 5-week period, and provided expert supervision is available.”85

## Obstructive Sleep Apnea

It has been repeatedly demonstrated that attentional deficits are exceedingly common (95%) in both children and adults with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).86 Likewise, OSA is found in up to 30% of children diagnosed with ADHD, and this may be central to the etiology of their attentional problems. In children, chronic nasal or tonsillar/pharyngeal congestion is the most common eti- ological factor leading to OSA, although childhood obesity is also becoming a leading cause. OSA should be carefully considered in all children with ADHD, and health care providers should be famil- iar with the signs and symptoms suggestive of OSA as well as the local resources available for diagnosis and treatment. Children and parents will usually be unaware of the presence of OSA. However, clues such as nocturnal mouth breathing, snoring, enuresis, day- time urinary incontinence, and daytime drowsiness should strongly suggest a need to rule out OSA, usually by referring the patient for nocturnal oximetry testing or polysomnography. Because question- naires and physical examination are relatively insensitive to pick up OSA in children, a high index of suspicion is essential. OSA results in severe sleep fragmentation and frequent hypoxic episodes, which, in turn, reduces a child’s intellectual capacity, reduces attentional performance, and diminishes the child’s quality of life. Children with sleep-disordered breathing should be treated. Efforts should be made to reduce nasal congestion and decrease recurrent upper respiratory infections. However, in those children with OSA who do not clearly respond to conservative measures, tonsilloadenoidectomy has been proven to have a substantial and sustainable benefit in ADHD symp- toms and comorbidities. Parents need to be made aware of the sub- stantial risks of untreated OSA versus the risks and/or benefits of this surgery.87

## Parasites

Probiotic supplementation with Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli may be helpful in the treatment of ADHD. These organisms function as part of the first line of defense in gut immunity and have been shown to restore the altered gut permeability due to food aller- gies.88,89 In addition, a stool analysis to rule out parasitical infection or altered bacterial flora appears advisable due to disturbances in gut mucosal immunity (discussed in the following). Interestingly, in a clinical trial in which 75 infants were given Lactobacillus rham- nosus GG or placebo during the first 6 months of life, by age 13, 17.1% of those given placebo developed either ADHD or Asperger’s syndrome, whereas none in the probiotic group did. Healthy chil- dren also had higher levels of fecal Bifidobacterium during the first 6 months of life.90

# IMMUNE SYSTEM IMPAIRMENT

It has been shown that subtle immune dysfunction may be a promi- nent problem in ADHD. Both cellular and humoral immunity were shown to be abnormal in children with ADHD compared with age- matched controls.91 Plasma complement levels were found to be lower in children with ADHD.92 Immune dysfunction in ADHD may be either directly inherited or may be a result of nutritional, toxicological, or atopic factors. ADHD may also be, in part, an autoimmune disor- der. Antineural antibodies were found in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid in ADHD.93,94 ADHD has been associated with a number of auto- immune conditions, including multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease.95,96 Gut mucosal immunity may also be significantly impaired in ADHD, leading to increased susceptibility to gut pathogens and food allergies.

# COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES

All children exhibiting symptoms suggestive of ADHD should undergo thorough neurobehavioral and cognitive assessment. Many of the fea- tures often associated with gifted children can be mistaken for symp- toms of ADHD. Likewise, children with mood disorders or learning disabilities, those from abusive environments, and those who have suffered serious trauma may benefit from specific psychological or cognitive-behavioral interventions and may not respond appropriately to ADHD-specific pharmacotherapy. In addition, cognitive-behav- ioral therapies that can be implemented in schools and in the home environment have been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of ADHD.97 Cognitive-behavioral therapies also appear to be as effective in older adults as they are in children.98

# NEUROFEEDBACK

In neurofeedback (EEG biofeedback) treatment, individuals are pro- vided with real-time feedback about their brainwave activity through electronic instrumentation. This feedback allows the subject to learn self-regulation of brainwave intensity and frequency. Measurements of brain activity in many individuals with ADHD demonstrate cortical slowing and diminished brainwave intensity in the prefrontal region and frontal lobes. Neurofeedback treatment is designed to train indi- viduals to increase the production of brainwave patterns that reduce or eliminate this cortical slowing and thus reduce or eliminate many associated ADHD symptoms. Evidence supporting neurofeedback as an effective treatment in ADHD is accumulating, including studies showing cessation of methylphenidate (Ritalin) in children without loss of treatment effect.99–103 Rapid transcranial magnetic stimulation, a treatment used in many centers as a safer alternative to electroconvulsive therapy, has begun to show promise in the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric condi- tions. This treatment may hold promise in the treatment of ADHD, par- ticularly in those children with more severe forms of the disorder, with serious comorbidities, or in those who are resistant to treatment.104

# BOTANICAL MEDICINES

## Procyanidolic Oligomers

Extracts from grape seed skin and the bark of the maritime pine such as Pycnogenol are rich sources of procyanidolic oligomers—one of the most beneficial groups of plant flavonoids. These extracts may prove useful in the treatment of ADHD due to their broad-spectrum antiox- idant effects alone, because increased oxidative damage is believed to be a central factor in ADHD. To date, four studies have been conducted in ADHD with Pycnogenol. In two of the studies, children with ADHD supplemented with Pycnogenol (1 mg/kg body weight per day) showed improved antioxidant status.105,106 A third study not only confirmed this anti- oxidant effect but also showed improvements in hyperactivity.107 In the most detailed study, 61 children with ADHD supplemented with mg/kg/day Pycnogenol or placebo over 4 weeks showed that 1-month Pycnogenol administration caused a significant reduction of hyperac- tivity and improved attention and visual-motor coordination and con- centration in children with ADHD.108 No positive effects were found in the placebo group. These results point to an option to use grape seed or pine bark extract as a nutritional adjunct in ADHD.

## Ginkgo biloba Extract

Two early pilot studies, one in children (in combination with American ginseng) and the other in adults, showed some beneficial effects attributed to supplementation with Gingko biloba extract.109,110 Specifically, these studies showed improvements in inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and socialization. A more recent randomized trial found that both teacher and parent ratings improved when Gingko was given with methylphenidate versus methylphenidate and placebo.111

## -Theanine

l-theanine, an amino acid found in green tea, shows promise in improving sleep quality in children with ADHD. This amino acid is known to reduce anxiety, increase concentration, improve sleep qual- ity, and stabilize mood without sedation.112,113 It also improves cere- bral dopaminergic activity. In a recently completed double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on l-theanine in ADHD, 90 boys with ADHD were found to have significant improvements in sleep quality as mea- sured by nocturnal actigraphy with 400 mg l-theanine a day.114


Many alternative and complementary therapies have been offered for the treatment of ADHD in children and adults. Some have good evi- dence for safety and efficacy, whereas the evidence for others is still lacking. A reasonable approach with a high probability of success will be multimodal and will address as many contributing factors as are practical. A basic workup ruling out common disorders that may mani- fest as ADHD is prudent because these may require specific treatments, and delay of treatment may be harmful. Celiac disease, depression, lead poisoning, sleep apnea, and visual or auditory problems are some of the problems that should be included in the differential diagnosis. Other contributory factors, such as increased intestinal permeability; food allergies or intolerances; and iron, magnesium, zinc, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acid deficiencies, may be assessed through labora- tory testing or simply treated empirically if financial constraints pre- vent ordering noninsured tests. In general, a stepwise, rational approach is often successful.


Assisting parents in eliminating junk foods, fast foods, and food additives from the diet (especially sugary foods and beverages, white flour products, and deep-fried foods) while increasing the quantity of whole foods is an important first step. If a child consumes more whole grains, fruits, vegetables, clean protein sources, pure water, and fiber, health benefits are inevitable. In some cases, converting to a whole-foods, Mediterranean–based diet can result in marked improvements in behavior and cognitive performance. The initial adoption of a very restrictive elimination diet for at least 5 weeks, under nutritional supervision, is also likely to improve symptoms and identify problematic foods following food reintroduction. For those ready to navigate the difficulties of this diet, it may be an excellent starting point. All sources of environmental toxin exposure need to be identified and eliminated.


Nutritional supplementation is often helpful and usually includes a pharmaceutical-grade fish oil supplement or DHA/EPA concentrate; high-potency multivitamin/trace mineral supplement; additional calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, and zinc (additional iron is also beneficial in children and adolescents if anemia or low iron stores are documented); and potent antioxidant support (e.g., pine bark [Pycnogenol] or grape seed extract). Although there is evidence to support each of these interventions, when combined, as well as in the context of a whole-foods diet, the results are usually significant.

## 1162SECTION 6 Diseases


Gastrointestinal rehabilitation is a concept familiar to practitioners of natural medicine. This involves therapeutic steps to reduce intestinal permeability, improve nutrient absorption, and increase the immune response to gut pathogens while diminishing hypersensitivities. A use- ful approach follows the mnemonic “ANT PIE” (abstain, nourish, tox- ins/detoxification, probiotics, identify, eliminate). Abstain from junk foods, deep-fried foods, sugary drinks, and other foods that harm or irritate the gut, as well as unnecessary drugs or excessive alcohol. Nourish the digestive tract with nutrients that support gut heal- ing. Functional foods that combine low-allergy-potential protein and a number of nutrients helpful for gastrointestinal healing are readily available. Toxins/detoxification refers to the avoidance of pesticides by eating organic foods and consuming nutrients that improve the efficiency of detoxification processes, such as l-glutamine, N-acetylcysteine, dietary fiber, and cruciferous vegetables. Regular exercise and stress reduction are also important parts of this step. Probiotics are therapeutic bacteria (and some yeasts) that may improve the gastrointestinal microecology, improve immune response toward gut pathogens, reduce immune hypersensitivities, and stimu- late gut repair. Identify allergenic or intolerant foods and gut pathogens. Food allergies (type I or immediate hypersensitivity food reactions) can be identified by skin-prick testing, radioallergosorbent testing, or enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay testing for immunoglobulin-E antifood antibodies. Patients with evidence of type I hypersensitivity food aller- gies (e.g., postprandial swelling of the lips, urticaria, wheezing) should be referred to an allergist for definitive testing, because serious anaphy- laxis could occur without proper avoidance. Delayed hypersensitivity reactions (usually type III mediated) are best identified with a properly conducted elimination test diet, followed by carefully observed rein- troductions of individual food items eliminated in the test diet. IgG antifood antibodies were not found to be predictive in the INCA study. Intestinal parasites, yeast, and pathogenic bacteria may also be identified by stool testing, Candida and Helicobacter pylori serology, breath testing, and urinary organic acids. Eliminate foods found to be allergic or intolerant with elimination test diet. Gut pathogens, parasites, and Candida overgrowth may be treated. This approach to gut rehabilitation follows a rational order that provides for optimal physiological responses to treatment. The results of following this program to its completion in children with ADHD can be quite dramatic.


Nutraceuticals can often provide additional improvements in behavior and cognition and may be a necessary intervention earlier on if parents are pressured to submit their child to drug intervention. For exam- ple, G. biloba extract and/or l-theanine may provide some benefit. Cognitive-behavioral therapy should also be initiated, because it is likely to have a more sustained effect than pharmaceutical interventions.

on Morgan’s strengths. I had given her a 26-page questionnaire to complete before our appointment. I had received, extracted, and contemplated her answers before the visit, sorting all of Morgan’s symptom data by frequency/ severity and coding all the symptoms that invited a therapeutic intervention. Page 2 focused on strengths, which is always the place to begin.

<!-- chunk -->

## Identifying Strengths

In previous doctors’ offices, Morgan had heard conversations about all the things that were wrong with him. Here, he heard his mom’s elab- oration of the details connecting his strengths to his medical history.

The child feels seen by me and might also better see him- or herself through my eyes. That was to be the theme of my relationship with Morgan and his mom: beginning with his strengths and going forward with a focus on him as an individual for every aspect of his treatment for autism. Morgan’s mom had never had a doctor take an interest in the details of her son’s symptoms, only those that supported the autism label. But, as I explained to her (pausing to retell Morgan what a good job he had done on the swing), with a patient with autism, as well as with a patient with any chronic disease, it is clinically important to review all aspects of the patient’s health. It is with these specific details that the functional medical doctor and the family can make joint decisions about options for treatment. The entire symptom checklist I use for all in-depth con- sultations can be found in Chapter 137, Let the Data Speak, of this book.

## Let the Data Speak

Morgan’s treatment plan was built on the previously described data enriched by his mother’s narrative as recorded in her completion of the “Chronological History Form.” The following six excerpts exemplify the value of such a format: 1–2 months. Breastfeeding well established. Healthy growth. Colicky baby. Poor sleeping—Perhaps 3 hours per night total. Great eye contact. Coos. Responsive. Smiles. Lifting head. Tends to cry when placed on tummy. 7–8 months. Razzing. First hand clap. Getting into crawling stance. Sits “mostly unsupported,” using pillows. Immunizations (DPT and Hib1)—“Got a fever and felt lousy for a week.” 13–14 months. 11/20/09 Immunizations. MMR, HepA, pneumococcal, conjugate vaccine. “Sick for days.” Seems like it was about a week of sick- ness. Fever, crying, fatigue, no appetite. December—Starts to shake head “no” and say “na-na” Mouths word “up” to be picked up. Doesn’t say it again. Very high activity level. Poor attention. Not gaining enough new skills; development seems to be at a standstill. 19–20 months. Morgan says, “Dive me dat!” Heard once and not again. Extreme hyperactivity. Very intense sensory seeking. Running back and forth, throwing body against the walls. Either understimu- lated or overstimulated—never at stasis. Toe walking. Flapping. 25–26 months. 11/3/2010—Autism diagnosis. December: Establishing therapies. Home program. Starts making progress. Dec. 2010—The whole family is ill. Morgan is “sick for 2 weeks.” Loses weight. Refusing all foods except bacon, waffles, and noo- dles. Morgan is “not vocalizing, quiet and unhappy.” We start ABA. Rapid improvement. 45–46 months. July—Eliminate casein. Easy adjustment. Headaches stop completely. Constipation improves within 1 to days. 2 weeks later, eliminated gluten. No noticeable changes.

Visits to developmental pediatrician and allergist/immunolo- gist. Concerns: pale, bloated belly, constipation, inflamed ring around anus, allergic shiners, seasonal allergies that seem to last all year, repeated pink eye and upper respiratory infections. Rec- ommendations are not helpful or have no impact. I start digestive enzymes. It relieves the constipation, but his stools become poorly formed; mushy. Now he has intermittent diarrhea/mushy stools and constipa- tion.

The fact of his long list of symptoms of neuromuscular irritability, despite supplemen- tation with magnesium, was disconcerting, although perhaps explained by bowel issue that would have limited his magnesium tolerance.1

## Restore the Gut

Actionable findings from laboratory tests previously ordered at an autism clinic near his home were as follows: Stool: Dientamoeba fragilis trophozoites, the growth of a non-Candida yeast, and Rhodotorula species. Blood: Nutritional profile showed unmet needs for B vitamins, vita- mins A and E, and alpha-tocopherol. Plan: 1. Treat the amoebic infection with trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxaz- ole and paromomycin as a red herring in his autism spectrum. 2. Cover the antimicrobials with an antifungal—he was already on Saccharomyces boulardii. After a hiatus for treatment by his local physician for a question of strep versus fifth disease, Morgan responded dramatically to immune restoration treatment via probiotics (discussed later in the chapter), as his mother reported: Huge improvement in overall immune functioning! Morgan has not been ill at all this summer. He attended 4 separate summer camps (each camp had attendance of 15–20 4-year-olds) and did not become ill! Previously attendance in these activities would result in

bacterial and viral infections that would essentially negate his ability to attend. He has NEVER been able to tolerate that level of exposure! He has been at school for 3 weeks and has not become ill. Addition- ally, his seasonal and mold allergies have been very mild. The immune restoration treatment has not produced signifi- cant improvements in symptoms such as weakness in his hands, poor fine motor, balance, and attention. Stimming remains.

## Restore Immune Balance

Various supplements were on Morgan’s plan, but the turning point came with the addition of helminthic therapy in the form of Hymenolepis diminuta cysticercoids, after which all of his autism symptoms cleared. He has since emerged as a brilliant and articulate. His mom recently updated me on his progress: “The school recently had a guest speaker, children’s author and Newbery Medal winner Jack Gantos. Morgan was the darling of the event when he answered all of the prized author’s questions with innocent humor and unique perspective. His teacher said he was totally engaged by the author and ‘on.’ The school is slowly recognizing that the strange, socioeconom- ically disadvantaged, disheveled-looking autistic child that managed somehow to transfer into their exclusive school is actually a benefit to their campus, as he may someday pull up their standardized test scores.”

## A Historical Perspective for a Comprehensive Model

Morgan’s story is typical of the many children for whom the word restoration is the key to understanding a therapeutic strategy designed to evoke Nature’s strong impulse toward healing by meeting special unmet needs, and/or eliminating toxins, allergens, and microorgan- isms. A consensus among 30 scientists, practitioners, and parents was formed in 1995 when Bernard Rimland, PhD; Jon Pangborn, PhD; and I organized a meeting in Dallas, Texas, in which the spirit among attendees from diverse backgrounds was to find common ground. The accompanying diagram summarized the landscape of biochemis- try, toxicology, and immunology that could, we agreed, help organize thinking for each of us as we pursued our various efforts to seek action- able options for individual children affected by autism. Now, more than two decades later, our vision has been vindicated by research findings and the kinds of clinical outcomes illustrated by Morgan’s response to treatment. Our meeting took place three decades after the publication of Dr. Rimland’s book challenging the medical view that had been current since the 1940s that autism was due to cold mothering.2 That chal- lenge unfolded when genetic research was fed by the reality that every- thing is genetic, as indicated by the “genetic predisposition” in the lower righthand corner of the diagram that evolved during 3 days of brainstorming. What was missed in the enthusiasm of advocates of the genetic etiology of autism was the impossibility of a genetic epidemic. As the prevalence of autism rose dramatically in the past two decades, those of us who were at that meeting and came up with the boxes in our diagram felt increasingly justified by our portrayal of the arrows. They give a clear impression that we are dealing with a system, which is a different reality an entity. Read the appendix by Crookshank in Ogden and Richards’s linguistic classic, The Meaning of Meaning (Harcourt, Brace Jovanovich, 1959). It presents a serious concern that the medi- cal profession’s failure to make distinctions among names, ideas, and things will lead to increasing problems for the medical profession as the burden shifts from acute illnesses to chronic disease. Conventional medical practitioners seemed incapable of avoid- ing the language and thinking about autism as if it were an entity that causes symptom until the word spectrum entered our citadel like the Trojan horse into Troy. Using the word spectrum combined with autism brought a simplicity to thinking about children with the defin- ing symptoms in behavior, speech, and movement that opened our minds to the full picture of symptoms that drew attention to immune and digestive disruptions. For parents, this shift gave rise to a dispir- iting feeling as the diagnostic label lost the implication that “we know what it is” and became one of being lost in a poorly defined space. Definition of that space came as our original meeting in Dallas in 1995 gave rise to an organization to which Dr. Rimland gave the name Defeat Autism Now! (DAN!). Keen to meet again, we were able to afford future meetings by inviting an audience of parents, profession- als, and scientist to come, listen, and participate. Richard Deth, PhD, of Tufts University pointed us to Jill James, PhD, of the University of Arkansas to add deep insight into problems of oxidative stress and the particular burdens of certain toxins (lead, mercury) on the chemistry in which glutathione was the threatened moiety in a vicious biochemical cycle breakable only by large doses of such nutrients as methylcobal- amin and methyl folate. Here is the chart that Drs. Deth and James helped me draw. More biochemists and immunologists have since come on board and stayed as the Autism Research Institute’s role as a meeting organizer shifted back to support of research and a new entity, the Medical Academy for Pediatric Special Needs, inherited the role of training physicians in the biochemistry, toxicology, and immunology that provide the basis for medical management of individual children on the autism spectrum.

## 1168SECTION 6 Diseases

Dan Rossignol, MD, has maintained his leadership role in the teaching program and in collaboration with Richard Frye, MD/PhD, published a stream of papers offering validation of the common sense of the approaches outlined in this chapter as well as peer-reviewed research supporting their scientific basis. Readers who have a strong affiliation with the Institute for Functional Medicine (IFM) will recognize in this chapter a strong influence shared by IFM, DAN!, and MAPS. IFM did not sponsor a meeting focused on children’s health until 2017, and as of this writing, the future of such a focus is uncertain. The DAN! and MAPS path to discovery of effective treatment options has yielded dramatic clinical response in the children under the care of physicians who have been trained in the commonsense application of dietary and medical interventions aimed at finding in each individual child those elements in diet, supplementation, and natural and pharmaceutical medicine that evoke Nature’s buoyant impulse toward healing. Going back to 1967, a registry kept by the Autism Research Institute (ARI) under the leadership of Dr. Rimland and Steven Edelson, PhD, recorded ratings of pharmaceuticals, nutri- tional supplements, and dietary measures and has yielded a treasure trove that should be examined by readers of this chapter.3 It offers the clinician a detailed picture of the failure of conventional pill-for-an- ill practice and strong support for natural remedies plus antifungal medicines. Dr. Rossignol’s literature review cited herein is an invaluable resource, but ARI’s presentation of good, neutral, and bad responses to various treatments given to children in the autism spectrum offers, on a single page, a clear message that will shorten the learning curve of any practitioner who may feel intimidated when crossing the bridge to the seemingly unfamiliar landscape of the autism spectrum. Once there, it will become clear to the explorer that the territory is not some exotic colony beyond the margins of mainstream medicine. On the contrary, autism is simply the core of pathology found in the most vulnerable members of our culture who are exposed to the stressors relating to micro- and commensal organisms, detoxification, and oxi- dative stress. After our DAN! group had welcomed new participants, the accompanying diagram began to coalesce around a theme that was to match that of the evolving understanding about all chronic illness and support a view of treatment options that is more of a guide than a shopping list. The diagram could be replaced in our current way of thinking by a single sentence: “While some would say that ‘everything is autoimmune until proven otherwise’ reading the chapters in this book written by world leaders in autoimmunity brings one to the conclusion that everything after all is infectious until proven otherwise (includ- ing autoimmune diseases).”4 I believe that to be the most important sentence written in the field of chronic illness in my five decades as a doctor. Its author, Dr. Yehuda Shoenfeld, embraces the decisions we clinicians make every day and the way we speak with our patients and colleagues about options for the prevention and treatment of chronic illness. The language spoken by those who care and are cared for in contemporary culture is full of particularities. These items are embodied in words such as “disease entities” that preserve an ancient mythology that is kept alive in the classification of disease. Our system for naming illnesses wrongly guides our thinking about concepts by modeling them on the Linnaean categorization of live or once-living entities. How can we escape the muddle embodied in the confusion of concepts with entities that is so deeply engrained in the way we name and blame diseases as if they are things that cause symptoms?

# CAUSES OF COMPLEX DISEASE

<!-- chunk -->

## Loss of Immune Tolerance

Dr. Yehuda Shoenfeld’s statement guides us to grasp that, whatever name we give it, the cause of chronic illness is the loss of immune tol- erance. If everything we see in the realm of chronic illness is a mani- festation of the loss of immune tolerance, then restoration of immune tolerance is the goal we strive to achieve. Nowhere more so than in the autism spectrum do we find so rich a set of symptoms presenting the ways sensitivity can be expressed in the human. Nowhere more so than in the autism spectrum do we discover resources for the recovery of immune tolerance that comes with the answer to a conceptually simple question: Does this individual have a special unmet need to get, avoid, or be rid of something, which, if taken care of, would favor Nature’s buoyant impulse toward healing? The word spectrum came into contemporary medical parlance as did the Greeks’ horse into Troy, giving medical professionals a secure metaphor while parents were deprived of the (false) security of know- ing the precise name of the “thing” that is causing their affected child’s problems. Autism’s history is full of cruelty, starting with a consen- sus formed in the mid-20th century that children who could not learn speech and were devastated by odd postures and behaviors and trou- bled by hypersensitivity to noise, touch, smell, taste, and bright lights were this way because of care given by “refrigerator mothers.” As second-year medical students at Yale in 1962, we were rarely shown movies, perhaps considering the risk of sleep. We witnessed two films at the Child Study Center. In one, the dignified doctor explained to the parents of a child with autism that it was his mother’s fault. In another, a developmentally impaired child’s parents were cautioned to “not look for answers.” We students were told that it would be unlikely that we’d ever see an autistic child, rare as was that disease. I had seen but not grasped institutionalized individuals during my internship’s rotation in the Southbury Training School. My first contact with an autistic child was when the fist of a speechless 14-year-old resident of another institution shattered the bridge of my glasses with a stroke to my nose. The precision and force of that hit produced in me the after- thought that he was saying to me, “You are looking into me with your

to learn from other children I would meet. One was referred to me by a former patient in a prepaid healthcare plan where I practiced for 7 years leading up to my directorship of the Gesell Institute of Child Development. This child of my patient’s neighbor had developed a roaring case of eczema after a course of antibiotics. Could I see the child for the minute needed to cover a

prescription for nystatin? I agreed, saw the child’s skin in a quick visit, and called in the script, and 6 weeks later, my former patient reported that the eczema was cured, and so was the child’s autism. It was the dawn of my understanding that, within Dr. Yehuda Shoenfeld’s model, the proliferation of yeasts gave a stimulus in which skin inflammation resulted in a case of mistaken identity in which immune defenses against yeasts targeted the child’s skin as they had also been doing all along to her senses. Is autism a matter of autoimmunity where yeasts are the exclusive trigger to an inflammatory response that affects the brain? No, but such a consideration deserves priority among all diagnostic and treat- ment considerations. Is autism the exclusive manifestation of the loss of immune tolerance evidenced by the increase of chronic illness in our population? No, but the increase in attention deficit disorder, arthritis, asthma, autism spectrum disorder, autoimmune disorders, develop- mental/learning disorders, cancer, cardiovascular problems, cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, epilepsy, food allergies, obesity, respira- tory allergies, sickle cell anemia, and spina bifida is more likely to have one cause than different causes for different diseases.

## Unity of Disease Causes

The perception of unity in diseases with diverse presentations is easy if we notice that all living things share the same fundamental challenges to their health: bugs, toxins, and fire. In more technical language, these threats have to do with the following: • Our interaction with internal and external predatory and commen- sal organisms • Detoxification and ridding of our own metabolic end-products and environmental toxins • Oxidative stress as expressed in the protection from being burned by our own metabolic fire The appealing odor of the essential oils of plants supports the belief that the ancient substances offer themselves to us for our use as they have for plants in the noted three domains since the dawn of life. This textbook does not have an independent chapter discussing essential oils, which are known to many readers who value their role in healing. I will only add here that the marketplace, as I have found it, suffers from the same enthusiasm as contaminates thinking in both conventional and natural medicine: an enchantment with complexity. Purveyors of essential oils tend to multiply the options beyond the capacity of beginners and fail to promote the fact that a dozen or so such oils will do to cover the bases for which these oils were evolved in plants long before so-called higher organisms evolved. These oils addressed the same problems that have existed for living organisms since our planet became oxygenated and referred to in the previous list as bugs, toxins, and fire. A selection of a dozen or so oils may be used therapeutically by patients willing to read and seek advice on how to select the ones that together cover the three bases. The fact that essential oils, being low-molecular-weight lipids, pass through the skin and may travel from the bottom of a person’s feet to the brain in 20 minutes is espe- cially important in the context of knowing that any contaminants of such oils may join them it that passage. Thus shopping for oils must be guided by a need to ensure documentation of purity. The simplicity of the challenges to health of bugs, toxins, and fire argues for a corresponding simplicity in considering the options for all individuals with chronic illness. The word special inserts itself in the thinking—as stated previ- ously—needed to solve the mystery of a person’s illness. The term spe- cial needs has been around for a long time in the delivery of social and educational services for children and adults. Natural medicine’s focus is treating not the disease but the individual, where “special needs” applies to therapeutic options. We begin in our consideration of each child’s options with the one question—about unmet special needs to get, avoid, or be rid of items—that will favor healing. The answers to such a question come from the patient’s narrative, the implication of certain symptoms, laboratory testing, and thumbs testing, defined as the introduction of a therapeutic trial in which a positive result gen- erates a thumbs-up, a negative response generates a thumbs-down, a mixed response generates one thumb up and one down, and no response generates thumbs-sideways. Of all the tests in my toolbox, the thumbs test is the most easily explained and interpreted by patients and parents.

## Shifting Thinking

The attachment of the word spectrum to autism reveals a new way of thinking in medicine and that is compatible with that of naturopathic medicine. The word spectrum joins affected children more loosely than a designation of a disease name. It was introduced in medical writing in 19855 but did not enter common lay and medical parlance until late in the 1990s. The word may be applied to all diseases, but its use belongs exclusively to autism in the sense that referring to someone as being on or “in the spectrum” is universally understood as “autistic.”6 A spec- trum is a continuum: both wide and deep. It is a metaphor embracing various features of different individuals. The traditional medical way of speaking and thinking about a disease used the word entity and carried the thought of something “well defined” by a limited number of symp- toms or laboratory tests. Shifting from “entity” to “spectrum” directs thinking away from the selection of a treatment for this disease to tailoring treatment for this individual. Failure to understand the implication of this shift cre- ates misunderstandings among doctors and patients. The confusion starts with the implication that a disease is a thing. Diseases are not things but ideas we form about people grouped by similar symptoms and laboratory tests. The danger in this confusion is neglect of the fundamental scientific principle in biology—and medicine—that each person is unique and that the individual, not the disease, is the proper target of treatment. Understanding that autism spectrum disorder happens to an indi- vidual with manifestations on a spectrum of severity allows us to better understand chronic disease and other challenges to human health in the modern age. As different as conditions such as Alzheimer’s and autism may look to specialized practitioners, they may be much more similar than we think: the manifestation of environmental, social, and epigenetic conditions I will discuss herein that are compromising human immunity and brain function.

## The Troubling Rise in Prevalence

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an umbrella term given to a wide variety of developmental brain disorders that affect behavior, socia- bility, and communication. The typical presentation of ASD includes an inability to make eye contact, limited to no social interaction with others, inflexibility, and repetitive behaviors, including hand flapping, various movements called stimming, and repetitive play. The sever- ity of symptoms in those identified as being on the autism spectrum is highly variable. Some children diagnosed with autism, like Morgan before treatment, are highly relational and enjoy social interaction. Others disappear completely into their own world and find social interaction impossible. The common denominator is that those diag- nosed with ASD are presenting with behavioral and immunological dysfunction. In 2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that ASD affected 1 in 45 children. In 2015 the estimate

## 1170SECTION 6 Diseases

was 1 in 43 children. The most current number of children diagnosed with ASD, released by the CDC in November 2017, is that 1 in every 36 children is on the spectrum.7 Three times more boys than girls are affected. That ratio was four to one for many years and, as I reported in 2014,8 it dropped suddenly in 2013 in the wake of a year when the girls’ symptom data were more dispersed, suggesting that an increase in the variance of the data points to instability in the biological system—the autism spectrum—that must surely be environmental. Doctors trained in the 1980s or earlier, as I was, were told in med- ical school that it would be unlikely they would ever encounter more than one or two people with autism over the course of their entire career. Now autism has become so prevalent that primary care doc- tors, particularly pediatricians and family physicians, often have sev- eral patients with ASD. ASD is so common, in fact, that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that every child be routinely screened for autism. The standard screening is the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), usually administered between and 30 months. Early screening is primarily recommended because of the benefits of early intervention in lessening the severity of symptoms. When delays are found on M-CHAT or clinically, steps must be taken to support optimal biochemistry, as discussed later in this chapter, and stop toxic exposures that may be harming a child’s brain functions. Although functional medical practitioners are unequivocal that autism rates have skyrocketed for reasons that cannot be contributed solely to genetics or epigenetics, there continues to be debate in the mainstream medical community about whether the rise in autism is due to a real increase in numbers or simply to better diagnosis. Work done by Stanford-educated atmospheric research scientist Cynthia Nevison, PhD, puts that debate to bed. Nevison’s systematic com- parison of temporal trends in autism prevalence in the United States revealed that between 75% and 80% of the tracked increase in autism is due to actual increase, whereas 20% to 25% may be attributed to changing diagnostic criteria.9

## Etiology of Autism

We practitioners should not be misled from considering the environ- mental causes of ASD in an individual patient when we hear the con- stant refrain from conventional medicine that the “cause of autism is unknown.” We should, moreover, take the lessons we learn from the many children who recover completely from having been autistic to become brilliant and talented individuals. That said, it is true that we do not have a clear picture of autism’s chain of causation. We know it is not caused by refrigerator mothers. We know that the autism we are seeing in the current epidemic does not have a genetic origin in the usual sense. We know that there is a viral shadow over the landscape of many children’s stories and laboratory tests, with a particular focus on the measles vaccine virus derived from the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) immunization. Whereas the conventional medical doctor is adamant that we do not know what causes autism (therefore making it impossible to avoid as well as to treat), the functional medical practitioner understands that the cause of brain and immune dysfunction that falls under the umbrella term ASD is multifactorial and may be found in a given individual. The likely environmental triggers of autism include are discussed next.

## Toxin Exposure and Autism Spectrum Disorders

Although the cause of ASD is still unclear, the role of environmental toxicants in increasing the risk for this disorder has been repeatedly shown. For example, insurance claim data covering one third of the U.S. population was reviewed to see if there was an association with known toxicant-induced disorders and ASD. Congenital malfor- mations of the reproductive system, known to be environmentally induced, were used as a surrogate for environmental toxicant expo- sures. It was found that males with congenital reproductive malfor- mations were 283% more likely to also have the diagnosis of ASD. A study of 192 twins was done to determine the roles of genetics and environment on the development of ASD.10 These researchers found that environmental factors carried 55% of the etiological weight, whereas genetics only accounted for 37%. Maternal exposure to environmental chemicals and body burden has also been associated. Mothers with chemical sensitivity were three times more likely to have a child with autism and 2.3 times more likely to have a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The risk of being a parent of a child diagnosed with ASD is increased by a factor of 7.3 for occupational exposure to lacquers, 4.7 for varnish, 2.7 for xylene, 3.1 for solvents, and 6.9 for asphalt.11 A study in San Francisco revealed that women occupationally exposed to toxicants have a significantly higher risk of having a child with ASD.12 Women exposed to disinfectants at work were 4 times more likely to have a child on the spectrum, and those exposed to exhaust and combustion by-products were 12 times more likely. The presence of low-molecular-weight phthalate metabolites in a mother’s urine during her third trimester of pregnancy has been sig- nificantly correlated to the child having greater problems with social cognition, social awareness, and social communications by the age of 7.13 In a Swedish study that followed families over a 5-year period and focused on the home environment and health, the researchers found a connection between vinyl flooring and the diagnosis of autism, Asperger’s, and Tourette’s syndromes.14 In addition to increased rates of these diagnoses in children whose parents had vinyl flooring in the bedroom, risk was also associated with parental smoking, condensa- tion on the windows, and reduced ventilation in the home. Between 2010 and 2015, several articles were published on the relationship between air pollution and ASD. The first was a case-con- trol study with 383 children with ASD and 2829 control children who had speech and language impairment from North Carolina and West Virginia.15 Exposures to ambient levels of metals, particulates, and volatile organic compounds were assessed via pollutant data on the area where the child’s parents lived during pregnancy. Significant associations were found between ASD risk and exposure to the poly- cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon quinolone (odds ratio [OR] 1.4), styrene (OR 1.8), and methylene chloride (OR 1.4). A group of 284 children with ASD in the San Francisco Bay area was compared with over neurologically normal children to see if there was any difference in air pollutant exposures between the two groups.16 The researchers found that children living in the San Francisco Bay area with higher levels of atmospheric mercury were 92% more likely to have been diagnosed with ASD. Areas with the highest vinyl chloride levels increase ASD risk by 75%, high cadmium levels by 54%, trichloro- ethylene by 47%, nickel by 46%, and diesel exhaust by 44%. Another study in California found that children with ASD were far more likely to be living in areas with high vehicular exhaust.17 During the first year of life, exposure to either nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), particulate matter (PM)2.5, or PM10 all more than doubled the child’s risk of developing ASD. In a large cohort of over 49,000 Taiwanese children, those with the highest exposure to NO 2 had a 340% increased risk of developing ASD.18 In addition to the increased risk from NO 2 , each increase of 10 ppb in ambient ozone increased ASD risk by 54%, and each 10-ppb increase in carbon monoxide (CO) levels increased the risk of autism by 37%.

implicated in autism. The fact that autism affects at least three times as many males as females raises the possibility that the timing of prenatal exposure through disruption of the embryonic development, which follows a different hormonal course in boys versus girls, could play a role.

## Combination With Oxidative Stress

An exhaustive literature review by a team of researchers from Harvard and Duke Universities found that one contributing factor in the increased prevalence of autism is increased exposure to acetamin- ophen, which, in the presence of inflammation and oxidative stress, becomes neurotoxic to infants.20 It blocks glutathione synthesis, fur- ther jeopardizing an individual with a detoxification pathway that is overloaded or compromised by other toxins.

## Overexposure to Aluminum

Intracellular aluminum in autism brain tissue has been identified as a causative factor in ASD.21 Mechanisms by which the human brain is exposed to potentially toxic amounts of aluminum include the syn- ergistic effect of multiple aluminum-containing vaccinations given simultaneously and aluminum in medications such as parenteral nutrition22 and vitamin K given to neonates, as well as via personal hygiene products and ingestion.23 In addition, many water supplies and foods are contaminated with aluminum.

## Loss and Restoration of Immune Tolerance

ASD, like all chronic illness, involves a loss of immune tolerance. If everything we see in the realm of chronic illness is a manifestation of the loss of immune tolerance, then the restoration of immune toler- ance is the goal we strive to achieve.

# A THREE-STEP PROCESS FOR CARING FOR

# CHILDREN WITH ASD

<!-- chunk -->

## Step 1: Listen. There are many ways of listening. Listening begins with

hearing the patient or the parent voice the child’s story, in which the strengths, symptoms, life events, and previous responses to treatment and dietary intervention are the key elements. No other medical con- dition is more demanding or richer than the autism spectrum in terms of the details of these elements for presenting options for treatment. A system for coding the actionable implication of symptoms is described in Chapter 137, Let the Data Speak, of this book. One way of gathering the patient’s story of strengths, symptoms, changes, treatment responses, exposures, and life events is a check- list, and the other is a free-form aid for simply listing everything that describes how your patient feels, looks, and acts. Each has its merits. Neither is easy, but no one is better than the patient or the parent at getting it done. Just as one has to endure the pain of a needle to gather information from the blood, one has to exercise patience to get the full picture of a person’s health. Having that picture will reward you in two ways. First, the picture is full of messages about treatment options. Second, when the data are organized properly, they provide a means for helping the parent and the patient with autism see through the physician’s eyes. How many times have I asked a patient how things are going and have been told that the stimming and toe walking have not changed? When I raise the question of what has happened with the hand scratching, constipation, and sleep problems, I may get a surprised reaction, “Oh, I forgot about those symptoms!” When the absence of those symptoms is noted and celebrated, families feel a sense of progress that helps support decisions about next steps.

## Step 2: Test. Next come various signals from laboratory tests—

looking at the body, as well as the blood, urine, stool, saliva, and spinal fluid, with various devices for picturing the shape, movements, and function of tissues and organs that are hidden from view. Finally, as we begin our tailoring, we observe what happens after each step in “trying on” treatments.

<!-- chunk -->

## Step 3: Try and Evaluate. Most interventions should be considered

tests until a positive response turns them into a treatment based on feedback from the patient and/or the laboratory. Healing can be felt and observed and sometimes confirmed by changes in laboratory tests, and in some laboratory tests, such as measures of heavy metals pro- voked by chelators such as ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), a clinical response to the test material may convey as strong of a message as the laboratory result. Beyond that, every treatment is what I call a “thumbs test”: a way to ask the body how it feels in response to a change. Every illness, including ASD, is a signal to change. Once a change has been made, there is no more persuasive evidence than what the body tells us as to the value of that change. We can try on various treatments and evaluate their effectiveness by reading the patient before us as opposed to rigorously following a given protocol.

## Tailoring Treatment to Fit Individuals

The conventional medical approach posits that autism cannot be suc- cessfully cured, only that the symptoms can be managed. The func- tional/natural/integrative medical approach posits that actionable treatment options exist to help with tailoring treatments to fit indi- viduals on the autism spectrum, and that with careful tailoring, many children diagnosed with ASD can improve so much as to lose their diagnoses. The fit is best determined by scrupulous attention. Imagine tailoring a suit of clothing. You try it on and then make adjustments to suit the individual until you have a good fit. A good fit does not mean attempting to suppress symptoms only. A good fit means taking action to favor Nature’s strong impulse toward healing. To achieve such a fit requires discovering and dealing with unmet needs, avoiding triggers, and detoxifying the body if necessary. Unmet needs include nutrients (vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, amino acids, and accessory nutritional factors), light, and rhythmic integration. Triggers include germs, allergens, and toxic exposures. If triggers are present in the body, detoxification will be a seminal step in healing. Toxins may be elementary (e.g., lead and mercury), synthetic (e.g., pesticides), or poisons made by living things such as plants and germs. Once we start thinking this way, the treatment process switches from being the old-fashioned “doctor knows best” and “do what the doctor says” to a different approach: “listen to the patient” and “work together.”

# TREATMENT


In my practice, for years I have avoided doing a large set of laboratory tests before seeing the patient. It saves money, and the interventions I

## 1172SECTION 6 Diseases

may begin may produce benefits that will affect laboratory tests, thus making them invalid by the time a commonsense treatment option has been engaged. Toward the end of an initial visit, I demonstrate the injection of a dose 64.5 mcg/kg that will be repeated by the parent once every 3 days from methylcobalamin solution 25 mg/mL into a child’s upper outer buttock, violating the prohibition of that location because the slow absorption in buttock fat reduces the benign but, to parents, curious appearance of pink urine resulting from renal overflow. A full explication by Jim Neubrander, MD, of the use of methyl B 12 can be found on his website.25


My next step is to find the dose of magnesium that achieves bowel tolerance. It is a precondition to all other interventions. Magnesium supplementation is free of any risk except in patients with poor renal function. Magnesium citrate is my top choice for a diagnostic trial of supplementation. The idea is to take it in escalating doses, starting in a range of 100 to 200 mg in an adult and 50 to 100 mg in a child, to fine “bowel tolerance”—that is, the point of bowel frequency and looseness that is a bit too much, and then back down a bit. Magnesium taurate is another option for patients with very light-colored stools. Many forms of magnesium citrate capsules are available, and of course, magnesium citrate solution is available as a cathartic—used for “bowel prep” before lower bowel endoscopy or surgery. The dose of approximately 4000 mg found in such prepara- tions in the 6- to 10-oz bottles sold at pharmacies gives a good indi- cation of the general safety of oral magnesium supplementation. Very few individuals with unmet needs for magnesium cannot tolerate an oral dose that would be needed for a therapeutic trial. If so, they can apply magnesium cream (CALM is a brand found in most health food stores) liberally to smooth skin at bedtime. CALM comes as a powder for making a solution for children who do not swallow pills. The idea with all of these options is to start with a low dose, usually first in the evening, and then increase by adding a dose in the morning, then more in the evening, then more in the morning, and so on until you reach “bowel tolerance” as signaled by loose bowel movements (BMs). At that point, you may back off to a dose that is associated with symptom relief and comfortable bowels. Children with autism have an increased incidence of constipation and other gastrointestinal disorders.26 Establishing a dose of magnesium at bowel tolerance provides a way of dealing with constipation. Most importantly, it lets us see improvement in neuromuscular irritability symptoms and allows us to expect the alleviation of other, less notice- able problems that are solved by meeting magnesium needs. These symptoms of neuromuscular irritability are described in Chapter 137, Let the Data Speak. Keep in mind, therefore, that as important as magnesium is in correcting “uptight” symptoms, those symptoms are not the only target of magnesium supplementation. Magnesium, with its partner pyridoxal 5 phosphate, is a cofactor in dozens of steps in every aspect of body chemistry. Many of these processes are relatively silent compared with those related to tension in the nerves and mus- cles. With that principle in mind, you may ask why I am so fixated on treating neuromuscular irritability instead of “treating autism.” Removing a pebble from your shoe is not just for your foot but also for the journey. Because various kinds of magnesium (magnesium sulfate) and high doses (4000 mg) of magnesium citrate are used as cathartics, patients and practitioners get confused into thinking that magnesium is just a temporary treatment for the constipation and fail to understand that people who have been under—and remain under—stress may have an ongoing need for magnesium supplementation that is magnified by the restricted diet common in many autistic kids.


Once bowel tolerance has been achieved for magnesium with at least one reliable BM per day, the next step is a thumbs test with Saccharomyces boulardii to be given in escalating doses with activated charcoal as needed to quench the Herxheimer reaction (a die-off reac- tion, also called Herx, explained herein) symptoms that confirm the suspicion of a yeast problem that is nearly always indicated by answers on the questionnaire and a history of antibiotics. Children with autism have a problem moving their tongues. We see in the many children who recover that they knew all the words, and some children teach us, in the midst of a sudden recovery, that they can go from very limited to fluid speech in a few days. What’s going on when that happens? The research and review of contemporary science by Woody McGinnis, MD, brought the interactions among the midbrain and its far reaches in the gut and the higher brain to the attention of the autism community. We now understand that substances in the gut pass through the bloodstream and affect or touch the midbrain. This touch is based on the midbrain’s ancient job of “tasting” the blood for signals that are needed to regulate automatic body functions shared by all animals. In recent history, humans have experienced changes in diet, enor- mous increases in exposure to novel toxins and antibiotics, and the disappearance of beneficial gut organisms. These changes result in new signals coming from the gut to the midbrain. These signals cause con- fusion and result in damage to the automatic movements of organs of digestion, including the tongue and the gut. In humans, the tongue does double duty as an organ of digestion and speech. Both of these can be impaired when the autonomic nervous system is affected. Nonverbal children diagnosed with ASD have impaired function in the midbrain. The conventional medical approach is to treat the symp- toms by intensive therapy with a speech pathologist. The consensus among professionals is that speech therapy works for children. It pro- vides benefits that would not be obtained without that intervention. Although early behavioral intervention can be helpful, the func- tional physician understands that detoxification takes precedence over speech therapy to get to the root causes of this autonomic dysfunction. I have found that successfully treating yeast overgrowth in nonver- bal children with ASD is the key to resolving this autonomic prob- lem. Morgan’s story is a case in point. As the result of being on high doses of antifungal medication, Morgan went from having no speech to being a highly articulate, precocious talker over the course of just a few months. Just recently, I treated a 4-year-old boy who was deep in the autism spectrum with very little speech. After seeing him respond to S. boular- dii with a big Herx reaction relieved by activated charcoal, I uncovered that he had a significant yeast overgrowth meriting a change to trials of pharmaceutical antifungals. I decided to change to a pharmaceu- tical to go after the yeasts that persisted in showing up in his MOAT test from Great Plains Lab, where indications of Aspergillus turned up with elevation of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-fuoic. Watching to be sure his aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) stayed level, I increased his dose of Sporanox to 600 mg per day: three times the adult dose. This increase was done in tortuous steps of Herx reactions and wonderful breakthroughs in which we saw a new boy emerging. After getting to 600 mg, my patient came to his mom and said, “Mommy, I am all better now.” In his new school (where they didn’t know he had been diagnosed with ASD), his language ability was tested to be at the 6-year-old level. As an experienced solo practitioner, I have the leeway to be guided by a decision process in which the stakes are very high, the risk is tolerable, and the odds seemed pretty good. As the work of Dr. McGinnis and this case illustrate, a leaky midbrain can let in toxins that tie up a patient’s tongue and adjacent parts of the nervous system.

## Saccharomyces boulardii, Herx, and Activated Charcoal

Why do I move forward in this description without having first addressed changes in diet, which we agree are a foundation to nearly all natural medical interventions? Because asking parents of a child in the autism spectrum to make serious dietary changes—if they have not already started a gluten-free diet—is like asking them to convert to a different religion. Whether it has to do with introducing solid foods to babies in the villages of Chad, Africa, well before they are weaned at, say, age 2 or requesting a cattle rancher to go vegan, asking people to change the dietary habits of a child with serious sensory issues is an obstacle to be avoided even at the cost of perfection. Of course, we will soon move toward dietary changes that might ideally be good to have done at the beginning. To ask for it up-front as a sort of precondition to engaging in “treatments” in the form of thumbs testing is a chal- lenge that is, I think, unnecessarily overburdening to families. Saccharomyces (sugar fungus) is the genus name of common yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker’s and brewer’s yeast). Saccharomyces boulardii is a closely related yeast whose exact classifica- tion and distinction from Saccharomyces cerevisiae are debated but that clinically acts as if it kills off pathogenic yeast and supports the devel- opment of normal gut flora. Taking S. boulardii may cause three main initial results (intense initial aggravation of symptoms typically due to Herx, nothing happens all, or marked benefit) that can be expected with any antifungal, except that the intensity of the Herx may be more than with any other antifungal. Charcoal (see box) is the answer to such a Herx and usually quenches it to make it stop or become tol- erable. Apart from Herx reactions, this microbial supplement has no toxicity. It resides in the gut, where it joins the other flora until shortly after discontinuation and then disappears. A stool culture may grow out a yeast identified by the laboratory as S. cerevisiae because the lab- oratory cannot distinguish between these two strains. The S. boulardii dosage can be increased safely to multiples of the original dose to explore the possibility of overcoming partial resistance of the targeted fungus. The option of switching to other “systemic” antifungals, such as terbinafine (Lamisil), ketoconazole (Nizoral), itraconazole (Sporanox), and fluconazole (Diflucan), is remarkably safe but cannot compete with the complete safety of S. boulardii. As I have emphasized, this trial should not be undertaken without first achieving control of constipation, usually with magnesium citrate capsules (150 mg) or CALM powder or liquid, such as is found in 10-oz bottles, provided as a cathartic but can be portioned out to be taken “to bowel tolerance” just short of risking an embarrassing urgency of BMs. As that dose is approached, the idea is to back off until reliable daily BMs are achieved with a frequency of at least once, preferably twice or three times. When yeasts are killed by S. boulardii, they burst open, releasing their toxins in larger measure than when they are alive. The resulting mischief (the Herx reaction) may consist of the very symptoms that are the target of the diagnostic trial. Herx reactions may result in new symptoms of any kind and are occasionally quite disconcerting, but not harmful, and can usually be managed by taking activated charcoal. It comes as a 500-mg fine black powder, preferably refined from coco- nut. Its capacity to absorb poisons of all kinds is astonishing, as is its effectiveness. Activated charcoal absorbs not only the targeted toxins but just about anything else it encounters, including medications, supplements, and nutrients. It is intended only for temporary use—as, for example, to get through a few days of Herx. An interval of at least 30 minutes should separate it (before or after) from medications, supplements, and food so that it neither absorbs medication and supplements nor is absorbed by food. It will impart a greenish-black hue to the stool and may be consti- pating, necessitating a sometimes-substantial hike in the dose of magne- sium to keep toxins from lagging in their trip to the toilet. Observation of the time taken from the first dose until its appearance in the toilet gives a rough idea of one’s “transit time,” which should be about 12 hours from eating a food until its waste products appear in the toilet. Activated charcoal should be recommended only if Herx symp- toms emerge. Even if such symptoms are mild—or perhaps especially so—charcoal’s effect in reversing symptoms helps to document that what your patient is experiencing is, in fact, probably a Herx reaction. I say “probably” because charcoal works for just about everything. Individuals—especially the parents of children who have been through Herx with the benefit of charcoal’s dramatic neutralization of negative symptoms—find that charcoal can alleviate a wide variety of symp- toms, such as malaise, hyperactivity, fatigue, headache, allergic reac- tions, and so forth, when taken occasionally as needed. It is not, as stated previously, for routine use.

## S. boulardii. Klaire Labs (Reno, Nevada) now provides S. boulardii

in powder form to facilitate the high doses that I recommend as needed to be able to walk away from a diagnostic trial with a strong convic- tion that it was given a fair trial. It is gratifying to hear from a patient or parent who has been skeptical of giving a high dose and struggling through the Herx reactions and charcoal and reports a sudden change to a dramatic success. The doses can be given the morning and eve- ning because we are simply feeding a colony of temporarily commensal organisms that really know how to kill their cousins—a bit like the model of steps taken in a crime family. Uncomfortable Herx symptoms can be managed with 500 to 2000 mg of charcoal up to 5 times in hours. A small amount of frozen grape juice concentrate thawed to a liquid provides a dark-colored, intensely sweet vehicle that may get charcoal past the vigilant senses of a child. For some patients, the trial of S. boulardii is sufficient to control a yeast problem without any risk beyond the Herx reactions, which stop when the critical dose is achieved. At the very least, the trial of S. boulardii is sufficient to prove the existence of a yeast problem that may then be confronted with more careful dietary methods or a trial of systemic antifungal drugs or natural medicines. The space given to magnesium and antifungal medicines and hel- minthic therapy (discussed in the following section) represents the It was 1831. In front of his distinguished colleagues at the French Academy of Medicine, Professor Touery drank a lethal dose of strychnine and lived to tell the tale. He had combined the deadly poison with activated charcoal. http://www .emedicinehealth.com/activated_charcoal/article_em.htm

priority claimed in the implication of Dr. Yehuda Shoenfeld’s point to the effect that all chronic illness is autoimmune. Of all the treat- ments that make up the toolkit for helping children in the spectrum recover, the ones that worked for Morgan represent a very good place to start. Once all these diagnostic steps are in place, I have the following tests done, along with others that may be called for based on responses to the steps: Zinc (International Classification of Diseases [ICD-10] code E60) Ferritin (ICD-10 code V78.0) Carnitine, (ICD-10 code E71.40) Vitamin D 3 (ICD-10 code E55.9) Vitamin A (ICD-10 code E56.9) Beta-carotene (ICD-10 code E50.9) Serum AST and ALT (ICD-10 code R94.6) Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 244.9 (ICD-10 E03.9) Complete blood count (CBC) with differential (ICD-10 D64.9) Cortisol morning and evening (ICD-10 code E27.40) Testosterone (ICD-10 code E27.40) Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (ICD-10 code E27.40) Pregnenolone (ICD-10 code E27.40) Amino acid profile (ICD-10 code E72.9) Lipid profile (ICD-10 code Z13.220) The next step will usually be a trial of helminthic therapy, for which 6 biweekly doses are sufficient to judge efficacy for the Hymenolepis diminuta cysticercoids (HDC). Human and pig whip- worm, human hookworm, and Trichuis suis ova (TSO) are other options available in a currently existing informal market. HDCs are supplied internationally by Biomerestoraton.com with a preserva- tive. I provide HDCs shipped overnight with freezer packs by FedEx to recipients in the United States in a consultative context with referring practitioners. Other than allergy desensitization methods, antifungals and helminths are two effective options for the resto- ration of immune tolerance. This is not to say that the restoration of immune tolerance is not a function of healing provoked by many applications of the healing arts. In my experience with patients with severe chronic illness in forms that are as explicit as alopecia or autoimmune thyroiditis, these two interventions stand above all other treatment options.

HDCs are an organism native to the gut—part of the families of micro- organisms that are essential to human health. The use of what is gener- ally called “helminthic therapies” is not widely known. The popular view of “worms” is guided by experience with pinworms as well as by false claims that many individuals with chronic illness suffer from resident helminths. The functional medical practitioner needs to understand, however, that an absence of helminths is a major driver in autoim- mune disorders, and reintroducing helminths into the human body is an essential component of the successful treatment of ASD and other chronic diseases.

## Background: 10,000 years ago, our 200th great-grandmother was

inventing agriculture while primitive men were out hunting and gath- ering. A beetle and a rat were watching Grandma planting seeds that were to become grain. The beetle said, “These humans are so cool! They are doing this for us.” Ever since, the grain supplies of our planet have been host to grain beetles and rats whose parts and poops we con- sume safely and unaware. The transient, lively presence of HDCs in our digestive tracts restores immune tolerance that is present in pop- ulations living the old-fashioned ways whose microbiome naturally includes helminths. Grain Beetle Other organisms have also coevolved with us to live peacefully in our digestive tracts, and we humans have paid a high price for losing them. As a Peace Corps Volunteer in Chad in the 1960s, I took care of large numbers of Africans who were mostly fit and healthy, although sometimes afflicted with trauma or fumigating infections. The Chadian patterns of health and disease looked very different from Europeans’. We never saw an African living the old-fashioned way who had any allergies, autoimmune diseases, gallstones, appendicitis, or any of the kinds of skin or cardiovascular diseases so common among Americans. Forty years later, researchers have established that these contrast- ing patterns of health are related to the absence in the digestive tract of Americans and Europeans of various organisms that were common among people living in less hygienic conditions. It is now uncontested that the rise in the prevalence of allergic and autoimmune diseases in Europe and America is due to the absence in our digestive system of organisms that have been regarded as parasitical. Without beneficial worms (symbionts), an underutilized immune system will attack itself. The phrase “loss of immune tolerance” applies to those of us who, during recent generations, have collectively suffered the absence of var- ious sorts of worms. As a result, we suffer a lack of tolerance (allergy) to mold, pollens, dust, foods, and our own tissues (autoimmunity). Tolerance is the treasure of all complex systems: social, political, mechanical, and biological. Its partner is diversity. As the organisms inhabiting the human digestive tract have become less diverse, the toler- ance of the immune system has decreased, which is another contributing factor in the rise of ASD, as well as other autoimmune and allergic prob- lems in those of us who have enjoyed the benefits of toilets and clean water. By introducing any of several options (human hookworms, pig whipworm eggs [TSO], or HDCs), the immune system regains tolerance so that inflammation in different tissues in different people is healed.

## Helminth therapy for ASD: My experience with TSO and HDCs

over the past decade is rich in cases with patients with all sorts of autoimmune and allergic problems. Given the high stakes involved in chronic illness and reasonable odds of success with Primobiotic use and the absence of significant risk, a trial of six doses at 2-week inter- vals is an option worthy of consideration to treat ASD. HDCs are, at first, a test in which we seek a result indicated by thumbs up, down, or sideways before deciding about continuing. Primobiotics are not the treatment for any specific symptom of ASD. They are, like other probiotics, an option for all individuals with chronic illness to weigh by considering the BROCS, which are described later in this chapter. In that consideration, we often tend to overlook the stakes when focusing on the odds. That omission may occur even when the cost is tolerable, the potential benefit is great, and the risk is close to zero, as it is with the use of HDCs. When the stakes are high, as they are with any chronic illness, the odds of success with any proposed treatment may be less decisive than the stakes.

dose of Biltricide (praziquantel). We have found that patients who have an initial puzzling mixture of positive and negative responses often have yeast problems that have not been treated with sufficiently aggressive therapy, including restriction of sugar intake. Patients respond well to visiting the question of an inadequately addressed yeast problem. Response to HDCs is more robust and less confusing when such measures are taken into consideration.

## Contraindications: Immunosuppressive drugs, systemic steroids,

anesthesia, antiparasitic medicines, and antimetabolites. Helminth therapy depends on the participation of an active immune system.

## Probiotics: Patients must be told to look at the label of any probi-

otics and discontinue those that specify any organisms with the name Lactobacillus or that begin with the abbreviation “L.” or “l.,” as in L. acidophilus. Primobiotics will work in the presence of such probiot- ics, but they work better without them. Lactobacilli that are the agents of fermentation in yogurt and kefir and other fermented foods are not a problem when these foods are consumed. Other probiotics are okay. Options for Lactobacillus-free probiotics from Klaire Laboratory include Ther-Biotic Factor 4 and BioSpora. It usually takes only a matter of weeks, during which a small num- ber (between 5 and 30) of HDCs can restore tolerance in a person’s immune system to produce a large benefit, with a risk that is close to zero. A placebo-controlled double-blind study, conducted by Joel Weinstock, MD, and his colleagues, showed that pig whipworm resulted in dramatic improvements in 44.8% of those receiving the therapy, compared with 17.4% for those who took the placebo. No patient suffered adverse effects.27

## Chelation

When chelation first appeared as a treatment for autism among pio- neering doctors in the autism community in 2000, my original reaction was profound skepticism. I soon learned that I had been wrong, not only from my own patients’ results with it but also from the data col- lected by the ARI.28 Of all the treatments that were monitored by the ARI’s parent reporting project, EDTA and DMSA chelation was not only the one with the highest score for positive/negative results, but it also climbed the ratings within a couple of years from its inclusion in the reporting module in 2001. At an annual meeting of the DAN! think tank, I asked the physician attendees to raise their hands if they had seen positive responses to EDTA and DMSA that occurred so soon after the beginning of their administration, creating a strong impression of efficacy based on a mechanism other than heavy metal removal. Note that the latter mech- anism was not to take place as monitored by serial 6-hour urine testing over months of treatment. James Adams reported that children receiving just one dose of DMSA had positive responses comparable to those who were treated with mul- tiple doses.29 There appears, in other words, to be two separate features of the heavy metal/chelation picture. First, there is good evidence30 pointing to a goal of minimizing lead and mercury levels to as low a level as can be achieved. The Lanphear paper responded to findings in a study of lead toxicity in the Boston study showing that children’s cog- nitive testing had no significant improvement when blood levels were reduced from above 45 to below 25 ug/dL. Lanphear’s review showed that cognitive health improved only when lead levels were brought below 10 ug/dL and improved more so between 5 and 0 than between and 5. These data put us in a position in which maximizing the removal of heavy metals is justified to the point of continuing chelation until no further lowering can be achieved with additional bouts of chelation on a biweekly schedule. Here we find a disconcerting gap between the data used to drive public policy and what we use for children under our care, in whom the Lanphear’s data oblige us to treat for maximum effect as measured by urinary output from an EDTA/DMSA chelation. EDTA and DMSA are chelating medicines that bind to heavy met- als and other toxins and send them out in the urine. They can be swal- lowed, injected, or given by suppository. I prefer to use suppositories, which provide very good absorption and results. Both medications can be used for testing and for treatment. EDTA and DMSA are each “strong” in ways that make for a good partnership. I find in my patients that a 500-mg suppository of EDTA will pull a substantial amount of mercury and lead into the urine, and then, if followed 6 to 7 hours later with a DMSA suppository, another—some- times larger—amount of mercury and lead comes out in the next 6 to 7 hours. The partnership of the two aligns with the observation that EDTA, while cleaning, tends to throw up some “dust” consisting of mercury and lead that would best be captured before it can settle back down in the body. Whether you go by the ARI data showing parental evaluations bringing chelation to the top of treatment ratings or by the exquisite study by Lanphear et al., measuring children’s body burden of heavy metals with an EDTA and DMSA loading test and following through with biweekly—allowing the body burden to equilibrate—chelation is the gold standard. Various protocols are in use for heavy metal detox- ification. However, when I ask families who have done such protocols, I find that they have no objective test results that document the start, course, and end of the treatment. Now we come to the second feature of the heavy metal/chelation picture. There was a consensus, referred to previously, that EDTA and DMSA often produce benefits for patients with ASD with an immedi- ate timing that is consistent with a mechanism other than the neces- sarily slow process of heavy metal removal. And James Adams’s report of sustained clinical improvement after just one chelation further sug- gests that there is something odd going on in this clinical landscape. Be that as it may, we are obliged to take very seriously the fact that we are living in an environment that exposes children to a burden of toxins and that the children on the autism spectrum have measurable weak- nesses in detoxification.

## Elevated Body Burden of Lead, Mercury, and Other

<!-- chunk -->

## Neurotoxins

Chelating agents are used to test for the body burden of lead and mercury and other neurotoxic chemicals. That burden is inside cells. Neither a blood level nor urine level will provide an accurate view of the starting point for considering further chelation unless the burden is high. Careful studies of lead poisoning have demonstrated that the improvement in key measures of health and behavior does not begin to occur until the blood levels of lead in the blood are below what has until recently been considered safe: 10 ug/dL. When lead levels drop from 5 to 0, the improvement in cognitive function is markedly better than in the range from 10 to 5. In the context of this international pooled analysis, “better” meant something quite different from what the sci- entists and intuition would predict. Most of us would expect that as the burden of lead gets closer to zero, smaller increments of improvement would occur—sort of like the law of diminishing returns, which says, for example, that continuing to add fertilizer to your lawn reaches a point where each handful produces much less of an effect than previ- ous handfuls. In the case of removing lead, one might expect the rate of improvement to diminish as zero is approached. Lanphear’s study has shown that as one gets closer to zero, the pos- itive effect is the highest.31 For the child with ASD with a high body burden of lead, it is worth the effort to pursue a target of as close to zero as can be achieved, as long as it is done safely. To do so means that

<!-- chunk -->

## 1176SECTION 6 Diseases

one has to assess the size of the problem and then track progress over time to see the rate of improvement and find the point at which further chelation produces no further improvement in not blood but urine concentrations after a challenge with DMSA. Testing for heavy metal burden may include blood levels to start with but not without giving a test dose of DMSA to see how much lead, mercury, and so forth will appear in the urine over the next hours.

## DMSA Suppository Loading Test

The Doctor’s Data Lab is used for toxic metal testing. The protocol recommended here is different from the standard challenge testing protocol. On three consecutive nights, the patient is administered 500- mg DMSA suppositories. On the first night at bedtime, administer one suppository. Nothing more is required until the second night at bedtime. On the second night, right after the bladder is emptied, administer the second DMSA suppository and begin a 6-hour urine collection—that means all urine passed during and including any pro- duced at the 6-hour mark. If sleep continues a little beyond 6 hours, that’s okay, but the collection must not exceed 7 hours. Repeat the same procedure on the third night. The reason for doing three nights’ collection is that the peak excretion of heavy metals tends to occur after the second or third night’s dose of DMSA. The reason for doing the collection at night is that nighttime is the phase of the circadian cycle when detoxification is most active. When the levels of excretion are initially high, the dis- crepancy between nights 2 and 3 may be quite wide. With ongoing treatment after the initial tests, the gap should diminish and obviate the need for the double collection. In the early phases, a single mea- surement—instead of having the average of two—may bring a less reliable picture of the trend. A trend is very helpful in predicting the overall duration. For a child, the trauma of suppositories may be alleviated/pre- vented by instructing the parent to do the following: a. Place a hand mirror on the floor and invite the child to squat over it so as to get a good view of the anus. b. “This is the hole where your poops come out. We call it your “____” c. Explain that sometimes the doctor finds it better to put medicine in there, especially when the medicine is smelly. d. Offer a whiff of the suppository. “See how smelly this is? It would not be fun to swallow it, would it?” e. “Putting the suppository into your anus feels funny—like pooping backward—but it does not hurt.” For the treatment phase, the same routine is followed for the three nights every 2 weeks.

# RESTORATION

Morgan’s story illustrates the two steps that I have witnessed since 1977 and 2007, respectively, to beckon the word restoration into our efforts to promote Nature’s buoyant impulse toward healing. First was a diagnostic trial of S. boulardii and the sequence of antifungal phar- maceuticals in search of the best fit, and finally was helminthic therapy, which was the dramatic final step in supporting Nature’s job. A third approach to promoting tolerance is embodied in various methods to achieve desensitization. It was in the medical family of clinical ecol- ogy—later to become environmental medicine—that I learned the side of my medical paradigm that has to do with avoiding allergens and toxins or ridding them from our environment, and that continues to be part of my toolkit, minus the methods for “neutralization” that I practiced for many years and admire in the hands of colleagues who can restore tolerance by those methods. The more I learned about find- ing out what my patients were sensitive to, the more I became curious about why they were sensitive. The what and why lists are short, and yeast and mutualistic organisms turn out to be the major factors in the loss of immune tolerance. The list cautions against the danger of being blinded by the obvious to the point of ignoring other causes of sensitivity.

For ASD, a diet free of sugars and starches is absolutely critical. Whether it comes in the form of Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride’s gut and psy- chology syndrome diet (GAPS); the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD), which is based on the work of Sidney Hass, MD; the diet more recently presented in Dr. David Perlmutter’s book Grain Brain; the paleo diet, popularized by Loren Cordain, PhD; or the super immunity diet pre- sented by Joel Fuhrman MD, the common feature of diets that can help resolve many of the symptoms of autism, including self-injurious behavior (which I discuss in more detail in the following discussion), is the restriction of carbohydrates. Disagreements about what is the right diet for everyone have been debated publicly and have produced con- fusion in all of us for the past half century, but a consensus has finally emerged. Dr. Mark Hyman’s 2018 book FOOD: What the Heck Should I Eat? provides a commonsense standard. A healthy diet to treat ASD: 1. Must consist of real, whole, fresh organic foods 2. Must be free of refined sugars 3. Must be gluten-free 4. Must be low in casein and soy (casein and soy are better off avoided.) 5. Must consist of a diversity of foods One of the greatest strengths in children with autism is an iron will, which makes it difficult for families affected by autism to implement new diets. Children on the autism spectrum also have problems with midbrain regulation of the muscles of chewing, swallowing, digesting, and pooping, making those functions more problematic for them than for neurotypical children. Mainstream medicine posits that there are no “proven” treatments for autism. Granted, there are a few drugs that are “approved” for the symptoms of children with autism. For instance, risperidone and arip- iprazole are both antipsychotics approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat irritability caused by ASD. The natural medical doctor’s job is not to find the cure for “autism” but to find out what works for the individual patient. If we want to find out if a given dietary intervention, supplement, or other treatment works for one particular child, we can put it to the thumbs test. Implement dietary changes for at least 6 weeks. Parents, teachers, grandparents, and practitioners who are unable to change a child’s diet are passing up the most potent therapy we have, a therapy that is cer- tainly better and often more effective than all the drugs. Understanding that should mobilize families to prove the point for themselves.

Eliminating sugar, restricting carbohydrates, and eating a diet of real foods are the first steps to resolving self-injurious behavior and other symptoms of autism that are often exacerbated by food additives,32 pesticide and herbicide residues, and other contaminants. A diet free of gluten and casein should be implemented at the beginning of any effort to make a therapeutic plan for a child on the autism spectrum. No other step is more demanding of parental understanding of the following aspects of dietary changes: A.

## The Yeast Problem

In the children I have treated who have recovered from autism to become not just normal but usually gifted with various cognitive talents, a yeast problem has been an important factor in all such children, so nat- urally I feel that this consideration is high on the list of options for testing and treatment. Symptoms, such as those discussed Chapter 137, Let the Data Speak, are a good guide to patient selection, but no child should be deprived of a diagnostic trial of a dietary thumbs test. I describe it here as a matter of protocol, with the understanding that many new patients on the autism spectrum come to us on very restricted diets with little latitude for experimentation until measures beyond the basics (gluten-, casein-, and sugar-free) can be implemented. The following may fit sit- uations in which the patient’s diet is so yeasty as to perhaps be an obsta- cle to further thinking. Otherwise, the following information may be a resource to share with parents as a glimpse down the path that will begin with less resistance and more focus. Keep in mind that the population of patients on the spectrum share a profound sensitivity expressed in the domains of the nervous and immune systems. The word senses, as in touch, taste, vision, hearing, and olfaction, has the same function as does the immune system in terms of receiving, remembering, and responding to environmental stimuli. In other words, the immune system and this aspect of the central nervous system are a functional unit. As such, it is not surprising to find that children on the spectrum have allergic, auto- immune, and sensory issues that gather under the term loss of tolerance. Food is obviously one environmental stimulus that engages the senses and immune system in challenging ways. By that token, the avoidance of a bothersome food can, in some instances—such as gluten—bring about marvelous changes in a matter of days. But let’s focus here on yeasts. Yeasts and other molds are the only organisms to be found in the air we breathe, in food (e.g., on the surfaces of fruits and as used for leavening and fermenting), as well as being members of our microflora, where they are subject to overgrowth from the consumption of antibiot- ics and sugars. Even milk can have fairly large amounts of yeast in it. Our relationship with them crosses the boundaries among commensal, infec- tious, and allergic interactions. When the latter case is put under scrutiny, various tests can indicate sensitivity, and the most precise test in terms of establishing pathological sensitivity is strict avoidance followed by a challenge. Extreme sensitivity to molds and yeasts found in food requires strict yeast/mold avoidance for at least 5 days, followed by a challenge to implicate symptoms that have cleared and then been provoked. Usually, a simplified yeast-/mold-free diet is sufficient to make this point. Many foods consumed nowadays are heavily yeasty or moldy, and avoidance of these is often enough to establish the relationship between sensitivity to yeast/mold and various symptoms, which may include craving bread, vinegar, and sugar. A simplified yeast- and mold-free diet focuses on avoiding the yeasty substances normally found in a healthy diet, including the following, which may be put in a handout for your patients.

<!-- chunk -->

## Leavened foods: Breads, bagels, pastries, pretzels, crackers, pizza

dough, and rolls are usually made with yeast as leavening. Biscuits, muffins, and soda bread, as well as waffles, pancakes, and some cookies made with baking soda or baking powder, are allowed. “Essene” bread is made with sprouted grain, and no yeasts or baking powder/soda is used. Baked goods made with baking soda or baking powder are per- mitted on a yeast-free diet. For the yeast-sensitive person, sourdough bread offers no advan- tage, and even when sourdough bread is labeled “yeast-free,” it should not be considered so from the standpoint of people avoiding yeasts and molds.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dairy products: Cheese is a product fermented from a variety of

molds and bacteria. Some of these are quite distantly related to the family of molds referred to as yeasts, and some yeast-sensitive people can eat even quite strong cheeses without difficulty. During the yeast avoidance that is designed to detect yeast sensitivity, all cheeses should be avoided. Milk products known as “processed” are usually prepared with a substance called rennet. Artificial types of rennet are derived from mold products and, therefore, are not safe for the person trying to avoid yeast. Other milk products such as cottage cheese and sour cream may be made by adding vinegars or lactic acid to milk and are, therefore, “yeasty.” Yogurt is fermented milk, and the germ used to make yogurt is a Lactobacillus or Acidophilus species. These bacteria are healthy, normal inhabitants of the human intestinal tract and vagina and are not related to yeasts or molds that are pathogenic. Yogurt without fruit can be consumed by people who are yeast-sensitive even though the milk itself, as mentioned, may have some yeast in it.

<!-- chunk -->

## Juices: The juices of all fruits and berries contain yeasts that came

from their skin. Ciders, apple juices, commercial frozen or reconsti- tuted orange juices, and the juices of berries have an impressive content of yeasts and can be extremely troublesome for yeast-sensitive people. During the trial avoidance of yeasts, then, juices must be avoided. For the treatment of ASD, juices should be avoided anyway because of their glycemic index.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dried fruits, condiments, and sauces: Most sauces and condi-

ments are made with some vinegar or other products of fermentation as well as sugars. This includes salad dressings, barbecue sauce, tomato sauce, soy sauce, miso, tamari sauce, mincemeat, horseradish, sauer- kraut, pickles, and olives. Dried fruits themselves are, of course, very “yeasty” because the drying process generally reduces the whole fruit to a small size while the surface yeast has had a chance to proliferate during drying. Salad dressing can be made with oil, lemon juice (in place of vinegar), and some spices.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mushrooms: Mushrooms, which are fungi, are the product of

molds that live in a lacy network underground and periodically push up a mushroom as part of their reproductive processes. The mush- room itself is relatively unrelated to yeasts, and some yeast-sensitive people can eat mushrooms. During a trial avoidance of molds and yeasts, mushrooms should be avoided. The same applies to truffles.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sugar and Carbohydrates: Some yeast-sensitive people have a lot

of trouble with carbohydrates of any kind, and for most, the consump- tion of refined sugar is bothersome. Anyone going to the trouble of removing yeast is well advised to eliminate refined carbohydrates, such as sugars, white rice, and white flour. The following yeast-free diet outline addresses only the yeast ques- tion, not gluten, casein, or other issues.

## Artificial Sweeteners Implicated in Brain Dysfunction

Richard Wurtman, MD, and John Fernstrom, PhD, neurologists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have pointed to aspartame’s potential interference with neurotransmitter function.33 The vigilant practitioner occasionally finds patients whose symptoms are relieved by abstinence from aspartame. The first sip of a diet soda tells the brain, “here comes sugar,” raising metabolic expectations and mobi- lizing vital processes. The brain tells the body to get the insulin because sugar is on its way. Insulin levels begin to rise, only to find that what has been imbibed is empty of the calories the insulin is there to man- age. It is as if you made a date for dinner, told your friend to order for you, and then failed to show up. The insulin grabs whatever real sugar is available and pushes it into the cells. This causes blood sugar to drop, providing a truthful signal to the brain that the body needs sugar. This cycle is the real roller coaster behind the artificial sweetener story and the mechanism behind the diet soda habit that I see in so many patients. Artificial sweeteners are all “bad” in the sense that they compromise the metabolism, fooling the body’s chemistry with a false promise that calories are about to arrive. For thousands of years, our species has used sweet taste as a perfect test for what is good to eat. Refined sugar is, strictly speaking, an artificial sweetener because in its pure form it was unknown in the human. But it is not, at least, duplic- itous at the cellular level.

## Dietary Tests

Start with all the additives. If a food has a label with anything but the name of the food on it, then do not give that food during the time when the diet test is taking place. Sensitivity is the issue. The test of avoidance to see if a person may experience a positive change that may take as little as 5 days, after which the avoidance may be followed with a confirmatory challenge. If the results are equivocal, repeat avoidance testing is required to make sure that a suspect food deserves avoidance, considering that we wish to avoid diets that verge on being too limit- ing. Rarely, the avoidance of a food may require as long as 3 weeks to be confirmatory. Such is the case with gluten. The research of Alissio Fasano, MD, shows that gluten opens the tight junctions in almost everyone. An elimination diet serving as a test should put gluten near the top of the list and be given more than the 5-day minimum for such tests.

## Oxalates. Susan Owens was an early member of the DAN! move-

ment. She has developed a website (http://www.lowoxalate.info) and a Facebook group (Trying_Low_Oxalates) with more than 15,000 members. Her work has benefited vast numbers of people who have been able to untangle the complexities of oxalates for their benefit in confronting a variety of vexing clinical problems. I encourage you and your patients to become informed and make use of her efforts in ways that, I must say, have not been fully grasped and appreciated by the DAN! movement. Foods rich in oxalate, such as the spinach, kale, Swiss chard, and arugula found in the green smoothies that have been popularized as a way of “cleaning up” the diet, can be harmful in large quantities. The complexities of oxalate are increased by the role of oxalate-producing bacteria and yeasts that are part of our microbiome. Quirks in our own biochemistry add to the total production. This biochemistry is fueled by the consumption of foods with amino acids that convert to oxalate. In addition, dietary calcium and oxalate have interactions that result in a paradox. A high-oxalate food, spinach, reduces calcium absorption even though spinach is a good source of calcium. The oxalate binds calcium in the gut and prevents its absorption so that the calcium oxa- late ends up in the toilet. Thus calcium (and magnesium) supplements lower oxalate absorption. In body fluids—destined to pass through the kidneys to become urine—calcium and oxalate combine to form kid- ney stones (if citrate levels in the urine are insufficient to solubilize the supersaturated calcium oxalate solution). One must consume the cal- cium with the meal to bind the oxalates in the gut and allow them to be excreted in the feces. Consuming the calcium between meals, however, can increase oxalate stone formation because binding will take place after absorption. Oxalate crystals can accumulate in many tissues, including the brain. Oxalate accumulation figures in chronic fatigue syndrome, and oxalate crystals in the urine can be irritants that cause vulvar pain that can be misdiagnosed as infectious or hormonal. A family history of kidney stones, vulvar pain, fibromyalgia, and even stroke or cardiovas- cular disease may alert you to the need to look for oxalate issues in a child with ASD. A rich source of information on the subject of oxalates is available at Susan’s website and Facebook address. A change in diet is not the only way to evaluate. Arguably the most informative test to have done in a child on the autism spectrum—or for that matter, with any mysterious chronic illness—is a measure of

urinary organic acids. This test was first provided by Andy Braille, PhD, and Richard Lord, PhD, at Metametrix and is now available from Great Plains Laboratory and Genova Diagnostics. Testing for the key organic acids—produced not by the patient but by the fungal flora of the patient’s microbiome—is a very useful clinical tool.

## Urinary Organic Acids

William Shaw, PhD, at Great Plains Laboratory has continued to develop testing that reveals the presence of some of the key germs that produce compounds that are closely associated with toxic and immu- nological damage in children on the autism spectrum. The test not only allows documentation of yeast and other fungi, Clostridia, and other harmful microorganisms but also provides a way of tracking progress when it comes to treatment. The urinary organic acid test reveals other features of the metabolic “fire” and many aspects of our biochemistry, including energy production. The urine organic acid test is the most valuable among all that take a biochemical inventory leading to action- able options for safe intervention.

# BROCS TEST FOR ANY PROPOSED MEDICAL

# TREATMENT FOR ASD

B stands for benefit, in which the doctor and patient share. R stands for risk, in which the doctor’s part is called liability. O stands for odds, or the probability of the desired benefit. C stands for cost, as in the expenditure of time and resources. S stands for stakes, shared variably by the doctor and patient. These considerations apply to choices confronting doctors and patients when trying to help a patient severely affected by ASD. When weighing the options for treatment, we may keep in mind that nearly all chronic illnesses have to do with the loss of immune tolerance. Once we accept that proposition, then the question of tailoring the treatment to a particular individual is simplified when we consider that the indi- vidual, not the disease, is the target of treatment. How do we know which people will be cured or benefited or will be nonresponders? We do not know. That’s where the idea of a safe therapeutic trial comes in. Indeed, it’s the only way to find out. If you have explored the terrain of thumbs testing, methyl B 12 injec- tion, magnesium to bowel tolerance, yeasty dysbiosis, helminthic ther- apy, and heavy metal testing and chelation and seen the benefits of a sugar-, casein-, gluten-free organic diet, you will have reached an altitude where the view will offer various options as your thumbs embrace a view of responsiveness. If antifungal approaches have yielded Herx reactions and some improvement, I suggest an effort to engage with a high dose of Sporanox with monitoring of AST and ALT in case it returns a sudden miracle, such as I have seen. This is the time to weigh the BROCS. The menu of choices will differ depending on whether you have a responder or not. The order of the following tests and treatments will depend on the view past your thumbs, which includes the following options:

## tive stress. At the 2016 Institute for Functional Medicine Meet-

ing, Albena Dinkova-Kostova, PhD, from Dr. Paul Talay’s team at Johns Hopkins, and Eleanor Rogan, PhD, revealed the path to rais- ing glutathione levels by inducing them as well as estrogen quinone hydroxylase and other agents for the protection of DNA, RNA, and other vital players that need to hang on to their electrons. Broccoli sprout extract has since been through various steps to produce its ideal in the form of Avmacol.

## 2. Induction of NRF2 and NRF1 with Protandim. Because it is sold

in a multilevel marketing mode, I am not sure how to handle this recommendation. You can email Erin at katepande@yahoo.com. I have done my homework on it, and so has David Perlmutter. Get microbial organic acids testing (MOAT) and MYCOTOX testing from Great Plains Laboratory. Whether you know already or not, these data will help you answer the key question in the antifungal sphere, “Have we done everything we can for this patient?”

## 3. Antiviral therapy. The immune system of autistic children tends to

be both weakened and defensive. So-called thymus helper 1 (Th1) immunity is down, and thymus helper 2 (Th2) is up. The most helpful image to illustrate this situation is an unbalanced see-saw. The low end corresponds to mechanisms that deal with viruses, fungi, and cancer cells: all foes with which we humans have nothing but unfriendly encounters. The high end represents an enhanced activity of the immune system’s branch offices that deal with more complex defensive decisions regarding food, bacteria, and other foreign agents (antigens), among which are friends, foes, and cases of mistaken identity giving rise to allergy and autoimmunity. The see-saw is an unbalanced Th1–Th2 relationship. Th1 cells are the important cellular participants in defensive activi- ties of the immune system. Th2 refers to immunity derived from anti- bodies, which are sticky proteins made specifically against everything internal and external that you encounter in life; these serve to label and handle foods, germs, toxins, and so forth. Viral or fungal infections lower Th1 immunity. Low Th1 immu- nity leads to difficulty in resisting viral and fungal infections. Here is another vicious cycle in which it is hard to tell which came first: the infection or the lowered cellular immunity. We know that measles vac- cine virus has been isolated from the biopsied gut lymphoid tissue of a number of the autistic children in whom it was tested. Did this virus cause the lowered Th1, or did the virus take hold because Th1 immu- nity was already lowered—perhaps from the effects of antibiotics or overvaccination or both? When we find evidence of viral infection—including the isolation of measles vaccine virus from gut lymph nodes as well as spinal fluid— then the cause-versus-effect dilemma becomes secondary to therapeutic considerations, which are especially confusing in kids who may have severe symptoms of autism but seem to get sick less frequently than their neurotypical siblings and neighbors. Those kids may not be getting sick because their immune systems are activated by already being sick. Jaquelyn McCandless, MD, has shown that low-dose naltrexone raises Th1 and is an antiviral, not because it kills viruses but because it rebalances immune function by other means. Dr. McCandless pre- sented evidence that low-dose naltrexone (LDN) can help children with autism, but not without some caveats. I refer practitioners to the latest edition of Dr. McCandless’s Children With Starving Brains: A Medical Treatment Guide for Autism Spectrum Disorder, published just before her untimely death in 2014.

## 1180SECTION 6 Diseases

Ridding children of the persisting presence of harmful viruses can be a helpful treatment, but we do not know if the apparent effective- ness of “antiviral” treatments stems from their antiviral properties or results from a different mechanism. The benefits of LDN have been demonstrated in AIDS, so the hope regarding the immunological ben- efits of LDN is well founded. The benefits of other antiviral treatments, such as acyclovir (Zovirax) and related medicines (e.g., Valtrex), may stem from the fact they combat viruses belonging to the large fam- ily of herpes viruses. These drugs also lower levels of adenosine in the body (see the diagram to find adenosine at the tip of the curved arrow between SAH and homocysteine). The diagram shows the effect of the antiviral Acyclovir on ade- nosine levels. It is what Dr. McCandless cited in her book tying the antiviral drug effects to the same with LDN. Its levels are, in turn, also affected by the interplay between dietary gluten and the enzyme DPP-IV that digests gluten and also functions as a regulatory protein (CD26) in the immune system.

# OTHER CONSIDERATIONS IN TREATING ASD

<!-- chunk -->

## Taurine

Notice that taurine is at the end of the line in the previous diagram. With that in mind, here is Edward’s story. This 8-year-old patient with ASD had light-colored stools. Edward came to see me with his mother and grandmother. I explained to the family how bile cuts dietary fat in the body much the same way that soap cuts grease when we wash dishes. Formed in the liver during the night, bile descends to the gall- bladder to await the need for digesting (breaking up, cutting, dissolv- ing) dietary fat in the morning. Instead of lard, which is used with a mineral in soap, the liver uses cholesterol to make bile. Instead of a caustic mineral such as potash (potassium carbonate), taurine steps forward, pretending successfully to be a mineral, and joins with cho- lesterol to make the bile that helps digests fat. If taurine is in short supply, cholesterol has no partner and is left in the gallbladder to form gallstones, which are not rocks but pebbles of hard cholesterol. After I explained all this, we decided to start Edward on a trial of taurine at a dose of 1000 mg in the evening to see if it would darken his stools and help his itchy skin and digestive issues. Mind you, taurine has other very important roles in biochemistry, not the least of which is the quenching of the ring of hypochlorite (bleach). Macrophages use taurine to protect themselves from the bleach they use to kill ingested microorganisms. If Edward’s stools would darken (not a long shot), it would reveal that his previous shortage of taurine had been giving him trouble with bile. Two months later, Edward’s family returned. Edward’s grand- mother announced that she took taurine and her gallbladder pain stopped immediately. An angry skin condition she had suffered from for decades cleared up. For years she had visited dermatologists who had confidently diagnosed eczema without being able to make the link to a special sensitivity to chlorine that resolved with her use of taurine. Meanwhile, Edward’s stools had darkened as the taurine supplement satisfied his needs in bile formation, cleared his itchy skin, and pre- sumably in the several other, more silent ways that taurine plays its role of pretending to be a mineral in his body’s chemistry. I have seen taurine supplementation result in lasting health benefits like these in my practice more times than I can count. Do you ask each patient the color of his or her stool?

## Gene Variants DQB1 and DRB1

I was asked to testify in a divorce case in a state with a law that man- dates immunization to the hilt. The judge was, moreover, noted for her anti-anti-vax position. The affluent husband insisted on catch-up immunization for his two boys, one of whom was on the spectrum and seemed to have gotten there after immunization during infancy. The boys tested positive for DQB1 and DRB1 alleles. Individuals with DQB1 and DRB1 mutations are at significant risk of having a seri- ous negative reaction to vaccines with aluminum as an adjuvant. The test can be ordered from the laboratory with a request for “Please do: HLA-DR/DQ Low Resolution Typing, CPT Code 81375, Includes DRB1, DQB1.” A small percentage of individuals with different vari- ants (alleles) of the DQB1 and DRB1 families of genes react to the aluminum that is used in the vaccines. The reaction may take the form of many different autoimmune conditions and can produce lifelong disability and continued risk with further exposure to aluminum, such as is found in baking powders and buffered aspirin. The risk may be as low as 1 in 100. If you were invited to take a flight on an air- plane with a 1 in 100 risk of crashing, would you do so? Would you consider taking such a flight once, 10 times, 50 times? You get the point. No one knowing the odds and with one of the DQB1 or DRB1 markers would allow vaccination with an aluminum-containing vac- cine. At least 75 scientific peer-reviewed articles support this recent research. The public health and commercial entities with an interest in this research have not made a public response, which is, indeed, one that will be difficult to manage in terms of the overall risk/benefit with regard to mass immunization. The literature on this is covered in Dr. Shoenfeld’s book.34 The judge returned from a brief recess, and the case was decided in the mother’s (and children’s) favor. If the question of vaccines comes up, I’d say the BROCS strongly indicate having these variants tested. Although the public has become increasingly aware of methylenetet- rahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) variants, when it comes to genetic testing, DQB1 and DRB1 testing may be more important.

## Electroconvulsive Therapy

Let’s go to a darker part of this landscape, where we find nonrespond- ers. I had a patient who seemed to respond to just about everything for a few days and then went back to breaking everything in his house, including his parents’ hearts. Brett grew to well over 6 feet tall and weighed 500 pounds. He had lost 300 pounds in the past couple of years, but that’s about the only good thing that has happened for him in the 26 years I have known him. He can, at times, be cheerful, but the injuries he has self-inflicted and delivered to his caretakers have been repetitive tragedies. I met Dr. Lee E. Wachtel, medical director of the Behavioral Unit at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, MD, and learned about electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for a similar patient. With the right technique, Dr. Wachtel explained, ECT could be transformative. Dr. Wachtel published the first report of the use of ECT in an 8-year-old child. “Self-injury included slapping and punching his head as well as banging his head on his knees and shoulders, with daily rates averaging 109.3 attempts hourly based on 24-h data collection.”39 During the 5 years since the onset of his self-injury, 17 psychotro- pic drugs had failed to provide relief, and 2 of them (sertraline and fluoxetine) made him worse. Only clomipramine and fluphenazine led to small reductions in self-injury. The following interventions failed: “behavioral assessments and interventions including, but not limited to multiple functional analyses, antecedent analyses, prefer- ence assessments, reinforcement-based interventions (i.e., functional communication training, differential reinforcement procedures, noncontingent reinforcement), response reduction procedures (i.e., brief physical holds, contingent application of helmet), and bilat- eral arm restraints and protective equipment (i.e., padding).” The ECT resulted in a profound reduction in the rates of self-injurious behavior.35

## 1181CHAPTER 152 Autism

Brett lived a thousand miles away, but miraculously, a kindly psy- chiatrist who was simply making rounds when Brett was hospitalized for a leg he broke on a trampoline peeked into his room as a courtesy. He knew about Dr. Wachtel’s protocol and managed to carry it out, and Brett had a year of respite. Then the kindly doctor moved far away, and the nuances of how to tailor the ECT to Brett went with him. The only other treatment that worked for Brett to calm his vio- lent episodes and uncontrollable rages has been cannabis. Now that cannabis has become legal in his state, it is doing a pretty good job. Cannabis may prove of medicinal benefit for many patients with ASD in the coming years. If your patient’s life is controlled by self-injurious behavior, ECT may be a reasonable intervention. A consultation with a neurologist is helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fasting

Dr. Wachtel’s reports of the use of ECT compared with the results of psychotropic drugs, as mentioned previously, certainly make the drugs seem of limited effect in extreme cases. Given that ECT itself is an extreme measure, I wonder whether extreme dietary interventions might first deserve more serious consideration. The model of extrem- ity in dietary matters is fasting. Many children have been reported to calm down and or be relieved of various severe symptoms during abstinence from food. Preparation for radiological examinations and surgery and loss of appetite during acute illness are widely recognized as having transient beneficial effects. Although many of the children I have treated have followed restricted diets (e.g., sugar, gluten, casein, yeast), none has done so in ways that would seem therapeutic in the broader sense. Many with gastrointestinal problems have been found to tolerate only a few foods (e.g., chicken, rice, squash) while continu- ing to suffer from symptoms that are barely controlled by diet. Fasting, on the other hand, requires complete abstinence from food. It is a practice with a long history in human experience and a recent upsurge of interest in its medical benefits. I believe that the resistance to the notion of fasting in children may be overcome by the comparative danger of some of the symptoms many children endure without relief when using other interventions. Just as Dr. Wachtel was the first to try the extreme measure of ECT for an 8-year-old, another researcher or practitioner will try fasting a child with uncontrolled, continuous self-injurious behavior. Supervised fasting has been a foundational protocol in the natu- ral hygiene and naturopathic medicine traditions. Trevor Salloum, ND, first wrote the first modern, scientific chapter on fasting almost three decades ago for this book. This chapter has since been extensively updated by Alan Goldhammer, DC (see Chapter 37, Fasting, and sup- porting Appendix). Several sources are of value to any practitioner who wishes to learn about fasting. The classic reference was written by early naturopath Herbert Shelton, ND: Fasting Can Save Your Life. Trevor Salloum, ND, wrote Fasting: Signs and Symptoms: A Clinical Guide for consum- ers. Fasting: The Ultimate Diet by Alan Cott, MD, is a fascinating little book by one of the pioneers of orthomolecular psychiatry. In no other concept or practice did I feel as misinformed as I was for decades on the subject of fasting. I made a sudden turnaround when biochemist T. Colin Campbell, PhD, told me the personal story of his cure by fasting from a condition for which he had consulted a top neurolo- gist. The neurologist told him he would be dead in 6 months from his progressive disease. He consulted another top neurologist, who offered the opinion that he would commit suicide in 6 months. It goes to show the value that can sometimes come from a second opinion! As it turned out, Dr. Campbell undertook a medically supervised fast, and his health was completely restored.

## Unmet Needs for Calcium Connected to Self-Injurious

<!-- chunk -->

## Behaviors

Mary Coleman, MD, a lone pioneer in autism research at the academic level in the 1970s, visited my office in the 1990s and told me about an association between eye-poking and unmet needs for calcium. She had a patient who poked incessantly at his eyes. His mom had con- sulted Dr. Coleman about the eye-poking, and Dr. Coleman asked her to collect a 24-hour urine specimen that was needed to document what Dr. Coleman thought would be a problem of unmet needs for calcium—leading to eye-poking in some autistic children. Twenty- four-hour urine collections in any child are a challenge, and especially so in children who are not toilet trained and have many uncontrolled, hyperactive behaviors. The boy’s mother was unable to collect the urine, and the boy poked out his own eye. Returning to consult Dr. Coleman after this tragic event, the mom found a way to collect the urine, which revealed the suspected low calcium level. The boy was started on a calcium sup- plement and stopped poking his other eye, saving his vision. I was haunted by this story and spoke of it again in 2014 with Dr. Coleman. She pointed out the value of the urine test for calibrating calcium intake to the patient’s need. I asked whether the level at which eye-poking stopped could be found by simply trying an escalating dos- age regimen without urine collection. She said yes. I asked her what she believed was the root cause of eye-poking. One boy in Dr. Coleman’s practice who was able to explain, once he became verbal, said that his eye-poking had been a response to an intense itching behind the eye. Many children seem to prefer pain to itching, and I have seen patients with ASD injure their skin by scratching it raw. Sometimes a self-inflicted pain, such as wrist biting, may change the intensity of another pain in the body. The father of one of my wrist-biting patients told me of his own need to press hard on his eyes to blunt the pain of severe migraine. We must keep in mind that various self-injurious behaviors may be pain substitutions. These examples illustrate that self-injurious behavior is likely done for a reason. Once the practitioner understands that self-injurious behaviors may be motivated by sensory challenges such as incessant itching or extreme pain, our own motivation to get to the bottom of the behavior is magnified. When confronted with any mysterious repeti- tive behavior, consider that remedies such as calcium supplementation may, in some individuals, also have benefits beyond the specific indi- cations that I have described. To find out if such a treatment works, try it on the individual patient and let the results speak for themselves. Take into consideration the risk, probabilities, potential benefits, and the stakes. When the stakes are high, as in self-injurious behavior, a decision to give a safe treatment—such as calcium supplementation in the form of calcium citrate—can be reasonable even if the probability of success seems low. The dose would range from 1 to 6 g daily over a few weeks, depending on body weight.

## Lithium

Head pain (e.g., cluster headaches) has been shown to be responsive to a form of lithium.36,40,41 Lithium has many medicinal uses in low doses (5–100 mg of lithium orotate), as well as in high doses (900–1200 mg of lithium carbonate). Low-dose lithium is found in some well water because the wells draw from natural water tables, which can contain a generous concentration of lithium salts. Several comparative stud- ies reveal a lower prevalence of anxiety and hyperactivity in consum- ers of such water compared with people living in low-lithium areas.37 Low-dose lithium may also help with anxiety in the child with ASD. In a nonverbal individual practicing self-injurious behavior that may be indicative of underlying severe pain, a trial of lithium is simply common sense.

## Testosterone

A mild form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia may be spotted by aggressive or hyperactive behavior accompanied by elevated testoster- one levels. This is best handled not by suppressing testosterone levels but by recognizing the underlying adrenal problem of underproduc- tion of cortisol so that the pituitary’s stimulation evokes production of what the adrenals are able to produce: androgens. Subreplacement doses of hydrocortisone are the logical answer to a problem that must be considered when seeing aggressive behavior in patients with ASD.


White spots on the fingernails and stretch marks in various parts of the skin are indications not seen in younger children with unmet needs for zinc. A serum zinc level is, therefore, an important part of blood screening. The consensus in a meeting of trace element researchers that I attended years ago was that the cutoff in displaying laboratory zinc test results should be ignored in favor of accepting a level of at least above 80 ug/dL.

## Cholesterol

See the Great Plains Laboratory’s website for an excellent body of information on the question of low cholesterol levels and their treat- ment with Sonic Cholesterol. While you are there, order William Shaw’s excellent autism book’s most recent edition. Only because of the availability of that guide do I have the leeway to focus here on sub- jects with which I am particularly familiar without having to pretend omniscience.

## Thiamine Tetrahydrofurfuryl Disulfide

Thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide (TTFD) was first identified by Derrick Lonsdale, MD, a professor and head of a department at the Cleveland Clinic. He retired in 1982 to open a private office to focus on the care of individual children, as contrasted with the study of diseases. Dr. Lonsdale brought his deep understanding of biochemistry to the ARI’s meetings and introduced us to the potential of TTFD, a “fatty” form of vitamin B 1 (thiamine), to be of benefit to some children on the autism spectrum. My experience with it has shown that its potential in different children has a wide range. The effects of its use are dazzling in some children, although no prior testing will pick the winners. Here is the protocol I have used with remarkable success in many children. A 21-day trial is a reasonable thumbs test.

<!-- chunk -->

## A. Apply TTFD cream, 0.5 mL (½ mL), on a patch of skin at bedtime.

Instruct your patient to choose a location (e.g., the lower legs and feet) that is easily washed the next morning, to remove the skunky/

<!-- chunk -->

## garlicky odor that may form there. Reapply it in the morning if

there will be no social problems arising from having a kid smell like a skunk. Otherwise, wait until later in the day when out of the

<!-- chunk -->

## public nose and then apply the second daily dose, repeating it at

bedtime. Afternoon and evening doses can be separated by only a couple of hours.

<!-- chunk -->

## B. After 3 days, apply ½ mL topical reduced glutathione twice daily

<!-- chunk -->

## to another part of the skin. Reduced glutathione (often abbrevi-

ated GSH) is the body’s main detoxifying “usher” that combines with various toxic molecules that need to be taken from the body. Note whether the odor increases consequent to the reduced gluta- thione. In some instances, the odor will be barely perceptible until the addition of the reduced glutathione. The enhancement of the odor on the skin after the application of GSH provides persuasive evidence that the GSH gets on board through the skin and forms a detoxifying partnership with TTFD.

<!-- chunk -->

## C. After 3 days of that combination, add 0.5 mL twice daily of topical

<!-- chunk -->

## alpha-lipoic acid, which is another sulfur-containing molecule and

is a partner of vitamin B 1 in key steps in chemistry in addition to having a role in detoxification that is exemplified by its use in treat- ing, for example, mushroom poisoning. The enhancement of odor with alpha-lipoic acid provides evidence for its partnership in the process we are trying to achieve.

<!-- chunk -->

## D. Keep up all three creams/gels for at least 1 month and observe

<!-- chunk -->

## any improvement in symptoms. If a rash develops at the site of

the application, add the following two supplements: molybdenum 300 mcg daily, biotin 1 mg daily. If the rash does not resolve, dis- continue. It may be preferable to start the molybdenum and biotin when starting the TTFD. This idea is based on the experience of a child who went off TTFD and GSH for a bad rash, waited for the rash to go away, started the molybdenum and biotin, and got a report from school of marked cognitive and behavioral improve- ment before she had restarted the TTFD and GSH—which, this time, were not associated with any rash. If hyperactivity occurs, try activated charcoal, approximately 500 mg four times daily, to quench it. If the hyperactivity persists, stop the treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

## Postscript about TTFD and GSH creams: We do not know yet

whether the role of TTFD in helping kids with autism resolve their symptoms has to do with heavy metal detoxification directly, for which there is some evidence (mercury in the urine), or with energy metabo- lism, where it plays a very crucial role. Considering that detoxification is the most energy-demanding part of chemistry (other than growth in children), it may not make that much difference, or it may be some of each. We do not know the exact nature (beyond membership in the family of sulfur-bearing molecules called mercaptans) of the com- pounds that appear on the skin, and it is speculative to consider that mercury is brought out by that route. The smell on the fingers of a person applying TTFD and GSH represents the same phenomenon. Both TTFD and GSH have important roles in the body’s synthetic chemistry (construction), so the benefits associated with their intended use in detoxification (sanitation) may be attributable to the multiple jobs TTFD, lipoic acid, and GSH have in energy metabolism and the making of new molecules.

# OTHER LABORATORY TESTING

<!-- chunk -->

## Complete Blood Count and Comprehensive Metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

## Panel

The CBC and comprehensive metabolic (CMP) tests are the bedrock of traditional medicine and are necessary to rule out the failure of basic body functions and organs—bone marrow, liver, kidneys—but they are generally of little value until pathology has substantially progressed. Platelet count stands out in many autistic children as a key indicator of inflammation and, as such, is useful for tracking progress. The red blood cell indices, measuring their average size and volume as MCH, MCHC, and MCV, are of interest because large red blood cells (high MCV) occur with a deficiency of vitamin B 12 and/or folic acid. Children who are very responsive overall to high doses of B 12 and folic acid may not reflect that special need with the elevated levels of MCV (i.e., large red blood cells) that go with deficiency of these two vitamins. Thus the CBC’s indices are of often of little value for tracking the benefits of B 12 and folate supple- mentation. A low MCV—typical of iron deficiency (and certain inher- ited abnormalities of red blood cell size)—is, however, a solid indicator that will increase with correction by iron supplementation.

## Thyroid

Hypothyroidism can mimic some symptoms of autism and impair development. TSH can check for this problem. The problem with thy- roid testing is the so-called “reference range.” It is a “normal” but not necessarily healthy range and may certainly not reflect the optimal level

<!-- chunk -->

## 1183CHAPTER 152 Autism

for a given individual. Endocrinologist disagree, but experts will say that a TSH of close to 1 is normal. That means that a level of above 1, which will include most tests done on children, leaves some doubt about the question at hand, namely whether the patient would benefit from a supplement of either iodine or thyroid hormone. In an adult, such a question is quite easily resolved by a thumbs test—a trial of esca- lating thyroid supplementation over a period of 3 to 6 weeks. An adult can reliably report changes in body warmth and energy. It is a tricky problem in children, and given that thyroid problems are reaching epi- demic levels and have a serious but often subtle implication for child development, it must be confronted thoughtfully by practitioners.

<!-- chunk -->

## Iron

Low iron can cause attention deficient problems and has also linked to lowered IQ. Many physicians believe that a low red blood cell count, hemoglobin level, or hematocrit (anemia) is a reliable indicator of iron deficiency, and they do not measure serum ferritin, which is the only good indicator of iron status. Serum iron levels are not reliable because iron is withdrawn from circulation under conditions of stress (infec- tion), so a low serum iron becomes a false indicator of deficiency. Iron supplements may be constipating and may be resisted by parents cop- ing with a child who already has such problems. Iron supplementation must be recommended with magnesium, if at all.

<!-- chunk -->

## Ammonia and Lactic Acid

The accuracy of blood ammonia level testing depends on the blood being drawn in the laboratory where the test is performed to avoid any delay. This testing may determine whether mitochondrial dysfunc- tion, associated with low energy production and hypotonia, exists. Mitochondrial dysfunction may be treatable with coenzyme Q 10 and L-carnitine supplementation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cholesterol

There is a subset of children with ASD who have low cholesterol lev- els and benefit from supplementation. A cholesterol count of less than 145 mg/dL has been shown to be detrimental, increasing defiance and irritability in neurotypical children. Cholesterol is needed to synthesize steroid hormones (estrogen, testosterone, cortisol) and to make bile. Conventional medical doctors continue to perpetuate the idea that cholesterol is detrimental, but in patients with ASD, low cholesterol can be problematic. Supplementation with cholesterol may be in order.

## Urinary and Stool Measures

<!-- chunk -->

## Urinary porphyrin concentrations can reflect increased heavy metal

or pesticide levels in the kidney and are markers of the metal burden in the body.

<!-- chunk -->

## Urinary neopterin is a marker of inflammation and tends to reflect

autoimmunity in some children with autism. Elevated neopterin often predicts positive responses to anti-inflammatory treatments.

<!-- chunk -->

## Urinary oxidized DNA and RNA are markers of oxidative stress

inside the cell,26 and children with elevated levels often have improve- ments with antioxidants.

<!-- chunk -->

## Urinary isoprostane is a marker of oxidative stress outside the

cell.26 Again, antioxidants can be helpful when this is elevated.

<!-- chunk -->

## Urinary pyrroles. A condition called pyroluria may also underlie

some cases of autism. Pyroluria, or pyrrole disorder, was described by Carl Pfeiffer, MD, in his 1976 book Mental and Elemental Nutrients. William Walsh, PhD, a biochemist who has continued Pfeiffer’s work, explains that this quirk in biochemistry, also known as the mauve factor, is a common feature of behavioral and emotional disorders. It is detectable as a purple metabolite in the urine on testing paper. Children with pyroluria are severely deficient in zinc, vitamin B 6 , and arachidonic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid). Walsh explains further: “cer- tain pyrroles called kryptopyrroles (literally, ‘hidden pyrroles’) bind with B 6 , then zinc to deplete the body’s supply. Common symptoms include explosive temper, mood swings, poor short-term memory, and frequent infections. These patients are easily identified by their inabil- ity to tan, poor dream recall, abnormal fat distribution, and sensitivity to light and sound. The decisive laboratory test is analysis for krypto- pyrroles (the ‘mauve factor’) in urine.”38 The treatment for pyroluria includes zinc and B 6 supplements (P5P if unresponsive), along with omega-6 essential fatty acids.

## Omega-6 and Omega-3 Fatty Acids

The omega-6 and omega-3 families of molecules are distinctive in human chemistry. The human body can make dozens of them, with two noteworthy exceptions. One exception is a member of the so-called omega-6 family, and the other is the source of all the members of the omega-3 family. These fatty acids are needed for making not only the flexible membrane that encloses each of the 10 billion cells in the body but also the messenger molecules that these cells use to communicate with one another. Linolenic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) must come from dietary sources. They are essential in two ways. We cannot make them, and we cannot live without them. Getting LA from the diet is not usually a problem; it is well distributed in food. ALA is more difficult. It is found only in flax oil (edible linseed oil 40% ALA), walnut oil (10%), and soy that is grown in northern climates (10%). When I was a child, there was no such thing as vegetable oil. We had Crisco, olive oil, and butter. Not until the 1940s were large steel presses invented for extracting vegetable oils from various seeds, such as corn. This provided consumers with cheap, easily distributed cooking fats. The traces of ALA found in such oils were removed from the vegetable oils that became widely available in grocery stores because ALA quickly becomes rancid, which limits its shelf life. The result is that our food supply is short on the very one element that we must get from our diet. Signs of unmet needs for essential fatty acids (EFAs) include dull and dry skin, dandruff, unmanageable hair, and brittle or fraying nails. The abundance of television ads to rectify these problems testify to an epidemic of EFA deficits in those living in modern industrial cultures. Blood testing readily documents such deficits. The appearance of the skin, hair, and nails is sufficient to drive a decision to supplement with omega-3 oils such as flax, fish, or krill oil. When a child with ASD shows the previously noted symptoms, I recommend daily omega-3 supplementation given in the morning, which is the best time for the body to absorb and metabolize it. The dosage is 1 teaspoon per year of life per day. So a 2-year-old would be given 2 teaspoons in the morning.

## Delta-6 desaturase deficiency: The nutritional/biochemical problem

that causes unmet needs for omega-6 fatty acids is common. The essen- tial dietary source of the oils in the omega-6 family are “regular” vege- table oils. The first step in the synthesis of downstream members of the family is the insertion of a double bond into the sixth C-C bond from the delta end of the 16-carbon structure of the essential fatty acid molecule. Delta-6-desaturase deficiency worsens with age; alcohol consumption; sugar consumption; saturated fat consumption; and deficiencies of Mg, Zn, B 3 . It is common in patients with eczema, multiple sclerosis, hyper- tension, premenstrual syndrome, hyperactivity, and autoimmune prob- lems. It can be treated by giving primrose, borage, or black currant seed oils, which are sources of fatty acids that help the body better synthesize omega-6s. These should not be routinely prescribed but may be tried in cases where a deficiency in delta-6 desaturase is suspected.

# METHYLATION

It is important for the functional practitioner to understand how methylation, methyl-B 12 , and most of the other nutrients work in the autism spectrum. The same nutrients, interestingly, are relevant to all chronic illnesses as well as to aging. Why? Because medical treatments aimed at individuals—rather than disease—are based on fundamen- tals of biochemistry that are shared by all of us.

<!-- chunk -->

## SAM: Recall that taurine, which is like an amino acid but plays roles

on stage for minerals, is at the last stop in the previous diagram. Look at the upper right-hand corner of the diagram. There he is—glad that you recognize him as he gets off the bus. See how he has been trans- formed on a trip that started all the way on the left-hand side of the diagram as methionine? Now follow the arrows that start with methionine and notice that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) gets into the game with methionine and becomes s-adenosyl methionine (SAM). SAM, under the trademark “SAMe,” is used as a treatment for osteoarthritis, depression, ADHD, and a buildup of bile in the gall bladder, as is taurine. SAMe may be effective in doses ranging from 400 to 1200 mg daily in divided doses. It has been used for patients with Alzheimer’s disease, pain, migraine, and bursitis, so it provides a good example of a remedy that may be useful for certain individuals and does not have the same effect in cer- tain diseases. Follow the arrow that goes upward as SAM goes to work as the dis- tributor of CH 3 in the long list of methylations that hovers over the first part of our bus route. Creatine, the stuff you can find in big jars in the health food store where muscle-builders go for “energy,” is indeed a molecule that is a crucial player in energy transfer in the body and cer- tainly works to give some people more energy (see Chapter 139, Sports Nutrition, for a more complete discussion). The restlessness that may be a side effect from taking SAMe may be minimized by starting with a low dose and increasing slowly. SAM’s role in methylation (adding CH 3 ) in the chemistry of neurotransmitters, proteins, RNA, and DNA strongly makes it a reasonable supplement to use in treating autism, especially considering that it is safe and has a much lower chance of producing negative effects than pharmaceutical medications. Unfortunately, my experience with it is that, although worth a try, it does not often fulfill the hopes we attach to it based on its place in biochemistry.

<!-- chunk -->

## SAH: S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) is what is left after the CH

3 leaves. Then adenosine gets off the bus. Adenosine is, as mentioned previously, mischievous when it accumulates. High levels promote inflammation, and that effect may be seen as what happens when the high adenosine level creates a stoppage on SAM. Recall that adenosine levels are decreased by the antiviral medication acyclovir.

<!-- chunk -->

## Homocysteine: As we arrive at homocysteine, we have already

found relevance in the diagram to treatment with SAMe, creatine, anti- viral medications, and a gluten-free diet. Now we arrive at a crisis point in the bus trip. Methionine has lost a CH 3 , and adenosine has come and gone, leaving a very hot, sticky molecule called homocysteine. I say sticky because its sulfur atom is very exposed. Sulfur is both stinky and sticky. The odor of sulfur that appears when you strike a match is distinctive in that it sticks to the fecal odors that you may wish to can- cel before leaving the toilet. Homocysteine is hot in the sense that it is like an ingot in the blacksmith’s tongs. It is ready to be fashioned into something useful, but it cannot be simply put down and kept around without the risk of damage. The crisis involves the choice of what to do with homocysteine: quench it, returning it to its original state as methionine, or send it further along the bus route. Quenching is not a simple as the blacksmith cooling an ingot with water. Homocysteine must get a methyl group put back on. That process is depicted in the diagram where the dashed line with a CH 3 in it catches up with the U-turn that homocysteine has made. The CH 3 gets on board right at the point of the arrow showing mercury poisoning the process. Mercury is only one of many toxins that can impair the crucial step of remethylation of homocysteine (quenching the valuable but dan- gerous ingot). This step and its investigation by Richard Deth, PhD, are of interest in understanding the pathology of ASD and other con- ditions. Does the vulnerability of this step to various environmental toxins explain its importance in the autism spectrum? Or is the special complexity of the remethylation process—involving a very delicate dance engaging vitamin B 12 , 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, homocysteine, and SAM—the source of its vulnerability? Both factors are probably at work, but the bottom line is that this step deserves our attention in all efforts to treat autism. Those efforts include the following:

<!-- chunk -->

## • Injections of high doses of methyl-B


<!-- chunk -->

## . This was described previ-

ously and is mentioned here to emphasize the point that the injec- tions are not to correct a deficiency but to bring a strong force to bear on a step that needs a good (safe) kick to get it working. That’s why oral doses are not able to do the job.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Oral doses of folinic acid. Again, not to correct a deficiency but to

ensure sufficient amounts for that kind of folic acid that is needed for a task that is not shown on the diagram.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). An enzyme is a

large molecule that embraces small ones so that the small ones join or come apart. Enzymes are named in ways that reveal their func- tion and end in -ase. Then scientists abbreviate them to letters such as MTHFR that give them an important sound. MTHFR is indeed important. This enzyme converts a molecule called 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to a molecule called 5-meth- yltetrahydrofolate. To oxidize a molecule means to steal its electron. So reduction means to give it an electron. That’s what it takes to get homo- cysteine to take the U-turn back to methionine. That’s the gift that requires several contributors, among which MTHFR is a major player. The code MTHFR refers to the gene that provides the instruc- tions for making this big molecule, in whose embrace a major part of homocysteine’s return trip takes place. Mutations (malformation of the gene) of the MTHFR gene occur with varied prevalence in differ- ent ethnic/racial groups and range from 1 in 10 to 1 in 5 individuals in most groups. The list of medical conditions and diseases for which 1 of 40 different mutations is a risk factor includes everything from heart attacks to cancer, depression, and schizophrenia. The good news is that supplementation of various activated folics is the pre- ventive measure and/or remedy for all of them. Testing for MTHFR mutations has become a common medical practice. Many patients who consult me have found out that their child with ASD has an MTHFR mutation. What it means, really, is that they need supple- mentation with methyl folate, and if they do so, their risk factors are normalized. It need not be a subject for grief or drama in the realm of genetics. Methyl folate is at the heart of the biochemistry that was previously referred to in terms of the contribution of Dr. James and Dr. Deth. Look at the chart of methylation and see where mercury does its dirty work.

# GLUTATHIONE

<!-- chunk -->

## Oral administration: The problem with oral administration is that

GSH is disassembled in the digestive tract and needs to be reassem- bled in the liver and then disassembled for export to other parts of the body. GSH is very sticky, so sending it around intact is problematic. Oral GSH can be very effective. I used oral GSH to cure long-standing inflammation of the eyes in a patient who had seen many doctors and tried many other remedies. The induction of GSH with glucoraphanin (Avmacol) is more efficient.

## Transdermal and intravenous administration: Transdermal

preparations and intravenous administration are usually more effec- tive than oral glutathione administration. There is a way of “packag- ing” GSH inside membranes, like the ones that enclose every cell in the body. These membranes are made of fat (lipid) molecules. These travel through the lymph ducts from the intestine up through the chest and are delivered directly into a vein under the left collarbone. They stay in the circulation, giving the serum a milky appearance that lasts for a few hours before it is absorbed by body tissues. GSH packaged in micro- scopical fat balls, called liposomes, takes advantage of this distribution of ingested fat to distribute GSH.

<!-- chunk -->

## Induction of GSH is the top choice in terms of safety, cost, and

long-term efficacy.

# CONCLUSION

We are in the midst of an epidemic of inflammatory disease with envi- ronmental causes. Autism is probably the most malignant, and research on its origins has been delayed by mistaken searches for genetics while it became clear that such could simply not be the case. We continue to hear that “the cause” has not been found so that a cure must await further research. We who are on the front lines of functional medicine must do our best to learn from each other as we treat each individ- ual patient, case by case, and find ways of supporting Nature’s strong impulse toward healing. We must tailor our treatments to the needs of each individual patient while heeding the experience of our peers on the familiar landscape of detoxification, microbes, and oxidative stress. Morgan’s mom’s report on the way his school now values his gifts is a testimony to what a determined parent and clinician can do together to lessen symptoms and even cure autism spectrum disorders.

## 1187CHAPTER 153 Bacterial Sinusitis

supports a diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis). Newer, more potent antibi- otics (e.g., lactam antibiotics) appear to be more effective than peni- cillin, amoxicillin, and other less potent antibiotics.9 Amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate are considered first-line antibiotics. Topical antibiotics via nasal irrigation may also be used. In children, it is also questionable that antimicrobial therapy is of sig- nificant benefit for uncomplicated sinusitis.10 Overuse of antibiotics in children with sinusitis or otitis media is a growing concern because it is leading to antibiotic-resistant strains of bacterial pathogens. Antibiotics are currently used in 82% of children with acute sinusitis, although the majority of these infections would likely resolve on their own.11 However, when controlled for symptoms that suggest a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis, antibiotics are associated with a higher cure rate (50% vs. 14%) and lower treatment failure (14% vs. 68%) than placebo.12 In chronic sinusitis, antibiotics are also of little or no benefit.13 Clearly, the most rational approach seems to be to address the under- lying cause of chronic sinusitis (e.g., respiratory or food allergens) along with providing supportive therapy (e.g., saline nasal sprays, immune-enhancing herbs, natural decongestants).

<!-- chunk -->

## Allergy

Studies indicate that most patients with chronic sinusitis, perhaps as many as 84%, have allergies.14,15 Patients with chronic sinusitis should be aggressively screened for environmental and food aller- gies. Environmental control requires the elimination of dust mites (warm-water washing at a temperature of least 58°C), use of air-fil- tering vacuum cleaners, installation of an air cleaner with a high-ef- ficiency particulate air filter, and whatever methods are necessary to maintain the humidity under 50%. Some particularly sensitive patients may need to have all pets removed, along with carpeting and featherbedding.16

<!-- chunk -->

## Mucolytics

Airway mucociliary clearance depends on the properties and volume of secreted mucus, ciliary function, and mucociliary interactions. In chronic sinusitis, mucus viscoelasticity is higher than the optimal values for mucociliary clearance. Mucolytic agents such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and proteolytic enzymes can reduce viscoelasticity and pro- mote mucociliary clearance.17 NAC is the most commonly used mucolytic agent. The free sulf- hydryl group of NAC interacts with the disulfide bonds of mucus glycoproteins, thereby breaking the protein network into less viscous strands. Although NAC is often used as a 10% solution by dilution with saline, sodium bicarbonate, and sterile water, it can also be used orally for sinusitis, and it has been shown to be effective for chronic bronchitis.18 Proteolytic enzymes may break down complex proteins at the site of inflammation, exert some antimicrobial effects, or act directly on the naked peptide region of mucus glycoproteins. Trypsin, chymo- trypsin, Serratia peptidase, bromelain, and streptokinase are the pro- teolytic enzymes that can break down mucus glycoproteins and other proteins when they are administered topically. When Serratia pepti- dase was given at a dose of 30 mg/day for 4 weeks to patients with chronic sinusitis, it significantly reduced the viscosity but not the elas- ticity of nasal mucus.19 It has been reported that the ratio of the viscosity to the elasticity is an important determinant of mucociliary transport. When Serratia peptidase was administered at the same dose to patients with chronic bronchitis, it significantly increased mucociliary clearance.20 A mul- ticenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 193 subjects suf- fering from various acute or chronic ear, nose, or throat disorders, including sinusitis, demonstrated a greater efficacy and rapid action of the peptidase against all the symptoms examined.21 Orally admin- istered bromelain has also shown benefit in the treatment of chronic sinusitis.22 A small study among children with acute sinusitis found that treatment with bromelain alone resulted in faster recovery than when combined with standard therapies or with standard therapy alone.23

<!-- chunk -->

## Nasal Saline

Intranasal saline irrigation improves sinusitis symptoms by wash- ing away secretions, allergens, and irritants. A 2015 Cochrane review found that although existing trials have been too small and had a high risk of bias, nasal saline therapy may have possible benefit for upper respiratory tract infections.24 Among individuals with frequent sinus- itis, it has also been shown to improve symptoms and sinus-related quality of life while reducing the need for medication.25

<!-- chunk -->

## Nasal Steroids

Inhaled glucocorticoids may be of use in acute sinusitis and are com- monly used in chronic sinusitis.26 A 2013 review of four studies and nearly 2000 adults and children with acute sinusitis found that intra- nasal steroids were associated with a greater likelihood of resolution or improvement versus placebo (relative risk [RR] 1.11).27

## Pelargonium sidoides (South African Geranium)

Extracts from the rhizomes and tubers of Pelargonium sidoides have been shown to exert a number of beneficial effects in upper respiratory tract infections, particularly acute bronchitis, an indication for which it is an approved drug in Germany (see Chapter 155, Bronchitis and Pneumonia). P. sidoides has demonstrated immune-enhancing effects as well as antibacterial and antiviral effects and the ability to prevent adhesion of bacteria to epithelial cells.28 In one double-blind, place- bo-controlled trial, 103 patients with acute rhinosinusitis of presum- ably bacterial origin were given an ethanolic extract of P. sidoides (EPs 7630) or matching placebo at a dose of 3 mL three times daily for a maximum 22 days.29 The mean decrease in the Sinusitis Severity Score was 5.5 points in the EPs 7630 group compared with 2.5 points in the placebo group, a difference of 3.0 points. This result was confirmed by all secondary parameters, indicating a more favorable course and a faster recovery in the EPs 7630 group.


In acute sinusitis, the immediate therapeutic goals are to reestablish drainage and clear the acute infection. Various measures can be used: local application of heat, local use of volatile oils and botanicals with antibacterial properties, and immune system support (see Chapter 136). Because chronic bacterial sinusitis is often secondary to allergy, long-term control depends on isolation and elimination of the food or airborne allergens and correction of the underlying problem that allowed the allergy to develop. During the acute phase, the elimination of common food allergens (milk, wheat, eggs, citrus, corn, and pea- nuts) is indicated until a more definitive diagnosis can be made. Local applications of heat have been shown to be effective in alle- viating both the short- and long-term symptoms of allergic rhinitis.30

## 1190SECTION 6 Diseases

In animal models, estrogen has shown molecular changes in the prostate of the aging dog.11 The evidence is less clear in humans. Estrogens in the male are predominantly the products of peripheral aromatization of testicular and adrenal androgens.12 Although the testicular and adrenal production of androgens declines with aging, levels of total plasma estradiol do not decline. In fact, estradiol remains relatively constant or even increases with age in men. This increase has been attributed to increased aromatase activity in the aging male, who often also has an increased accumulation of body fat. Fat cells contain aromatase, an enzyme that converts certain androgens to estrogen. The resulting disproportion in the estrogen:testosterone ratio may increase up to 40% in some men.13 By limiting aromatase or inhibiting the binding of estrogen to pros- tate cells, it may be possible to reduce BPH or slow its progression. Yet as we are now discovering, the interplay of androgens, testoster- one and DHT metabolites, estrogens, and their respective receptors is intricately involved in the growth of prostatic tissue. DHT has gained a reputation for being problematic and the cause for BPH; however, 3-beta-diol and 3-alpha-diol, two DHT metabolites, may affect pros- tate growth via their binding activity of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and ER-beta.14 ER-alpha induces prostatic stromal proliferation, whereas ER-beta induces apoptosis in luminal, basal, and stromal BPH cells.15 Interestingly 3-beta-diol binds to ER-beta, reducing pros- tatic growth, and has been inversely correlated with IPSS.14 ER-alpha is upregulated in BPH, along with aromatase, resulting in increased estrogens and ER-alpha, subsequently worsening BPH.16 These find- ings suggest there is a unique interplay between androgens, estrogens, and their respective metabolites and receptors. It may not be fair to indict one single hormone as a causal factor for BPH, instead requiring consideration of the complete hormonal milieu.

## Metabolic Syndrome as a Risk Factor

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of conditions including abdominal obesity, impaired glycemia, hypertension, hypertriglycer- idemia, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and hyperlipidemia.17 It is very well known that together, these conditions increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.18 However, what is less apparent but is certainly a health concern for men is the risk associated with MetS and BPH/LUTS.19 There is a significant body of evidence suggesting there is a strong clinical association between BPH and MetS.20–22 Not only has the cor- relation between the two been very well established in the literature, but MetS has also been correlated with the severity of LUTS21 and increased prostatic growth17 and is a predictor of the clinical progres- sion of BPH.23 BPH/LUTS is also positively associated with the num- ber of MetS components, with the research showing an increased risk of experiencing an IPSS of greater than 7, a total prostate volume of greater than or equal to 30cc, and a postvoid residual (PVR) of greater than or equal to 50 mL with an increasing number of MetS abnormal- ities.20 This suggests that the more components of MetS a man experi- ences, the more likely he is to experience BPH/LUTS. With lack of exercise also being a significant risk factor for LUTS24 together with MetS, it would be prudent for practitioners to address MetS as an underlying cause of BPH and LUTS in older men.

## Toxins as Risk Factors

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are defined as exogenous agents that interfere with the synthesis, secretion, transport, metabo- lism, binding action, or elimination of natural blood-borne hormones that are present in the body and are responsible for homeostasis, reproduction, and developmental process. EDCs include the biolog- ically persistent organochlorine compounds (chlorinated pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs] and dioxins) and brominated flame retardants (PBDE), as well as nonpersistent plastics (bisphenol A), plasticizers (phthalates), organophosphate pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides. It is well established that steroidal hormones (testosterone and estrogen) increase the risk of BPH, and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, especially CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and CYP17, metabolize these hormones. Thus functional polymorphisms in these genes and expo- sure to EDCs may further increase BPH risk. A study of 100 subjects with newly diagnosed BPH and 100 age-matched healthy male controls evaluated this potential risk.25 Levels of p,p ′ -DDE and Endosulfan- α were found to be significantly higher among subjects with BPH com- pared with controls, and CYP17 polymorphism was observed to be sig- nificantly associated with subjects with BPH compared with controls, indicating that these factors may be important risk factors for BPH. Although cadmium is a known antagonist of zinc and increases the activity of 5-alpha-reductase, its concentration in the prostate and its effects are unclear. Several studies have produced conflicting results.26,27 An epidemiological study from India examined the asso- ciation of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) in the pathophysiology and progression BPH in 116 patients with the condition.28 Prostatic acid phosphatase activity, prostate-specific antigen, maximum urinary flow rate, and redox status of BPH patients were correlated with Cd and Pb contents in the prostate. Increased levels of lipid peroxidase, a marker of oxidative damage, and increased glutathione peroxidase, thought to be via a compensatory action, are the possible mechanism as to which Cd contributes to prostatic hyperplasia. Bisphenol A (BPA) has been shown to exert endocrine-disrupt- ing effects on reproduction, development, metabolism, and cancer in humans, and findings in animal studies have linked BPA with BPH. In BPA-treated rats, the weight of the ventral prostate significantly increased, with a corresponding depletion of the antioxidant defense system and an increase in oxidative stress in epididymal sperm.29 An additional rodent study induced BPH with testosterone and then treated the rats with BPA (10, 30, or μ g/kg daily), β -estradiol (50.0 μ g/kg daily), or vehicle for 4 weeks. Rats treated with low-dose BPA (10 μ g/kg) had a significant increase in relative prostate weight, and for prostate lobes, BPA μ g/kg/day significantly increased the rel- ative weight of the ventral prostate as well as the weight and relative weight of the dorsolateral prostate.30

## International Prostate Symptom Score

A useful subjective assessment tool for BPH patients is the IPSS. The IPSS is a modification of the American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom Index, adding a single question assessing the quality-of-life or bother score based on the patient’s perception of the problem. The IPSS is a questionnaire that assesses the degree of LUTS and the quality of life of patients with BPH. Patients can fill out the IPSS form before their examinations, but as little as possible interference from the health care provider and per- sonnel is recommended (Fig. 154.1). A score of 7 or less is considered mildly symptomatic, 8 to 19 points is considered moderate, and a score of 20 to 35 points is considered severely symptomatic. Both the AUA index and IPSS questionnaire—although not specific for BPH, pros- tate volume, urinary flow rate, PRV, or bladder outlet obstruction— have been validated and are sensitive enough to be used in evaluating symptoms and selecting treatment.31 A good physical examination should include a digital rectal exam- ination (DRE) to determine the approximate consistency and shape of the patient’s prostate and abnormalities suggestive of prostate cancer,

## 1191CHAPTER 154 Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

BPH, or prostatitis. The approximate size of the prostate can be deter- mined with a DRE; however, inadvertent misestimations can be made even by physicians who are highly experienced. Prostate size can be determined most accurately by a TRUS or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

<!-- chunk -->

## Urine and Blood Tests

Patients with suspected BPH should undergo dipstick urinalysis test- ing or microscopical urinalysis to screen for infection and hematuria, proteinuria, pyuria, glycosuria, and ketonuria. If a urine dipstick is positive, a urine culture may be necessary to determine whether the patient’s LUTS are independent of BPH.

<!-- chunk -->

## Prostate-Specific Antigen

Because the symptoms of BPH and prostate cancer can be similar, measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is often used to differ- entiate BPH from prostate cancer. Recent studies show there are high levels of false-positive and false-negative PSA test results; therefore the benefits and risks of the test should be discussed with the patient. PSA testing is one of the tools used to assess for prostate cancer and its severity, along with imaging, PSA density, staging, and Gleason score. This remains a controversial test, however, owing to its lack of specific- ity, which can lead to the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of indolent prostate cancers.32,33 One European study showed that it takes 1 of men treated for prostate cancer to be saved from prostate cancer death

## PSA and BPH

PSA is a glycoprotein secreted by the glands of the prostate; it is released in the serum with disruption of normal prostatic tissue due to prostate cancer, inflammation, BPH, or trauma. Finasteride (5-mg dose) and dutasteride (0.5-mg dose), both of which are 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors used for the treatment of BPH and male-pattern baldness (1-mg dose of finasteride), will lower PSA levels by approximately 50% regardless of the dose.35 Ejaculation and DRE have been reported to increase PSA levels, but studies have shown the effects to be variable or insignificant.36,37 Prostate biopsy, however, will usually cause a substantial elevation of PSA levels. Therefore, after biopsy, PSA testing should be postponed for at least 3 to 6 weeks.38,39 Although an elevated level indicates prostate cancer in about 90% of cases, it must be kept in mind that midrange elevations in PSA can be caused by BPH and that in some instances, there may be prostate cancer without an elevation of PSA levels. One approach to distinguish the two conditions when PSA is elevated is to measure the ratio of free to total PSA: more free PSA (fPSA) than complexed PSA suggests BPH rather than prostate cancer. A ratio of around 20% or greater for fPSA is considered more likely to represent BPH than cancer.40 The 4K score, an algorithm utilizing total PSA, fPSA, intact PSA, and hK2, is being integrated into medical practices because it has the highest level of evidence of its ability to identify aggressive prostate cancer before biopsy.41 PSA density (PSAD) can be used to differentiate between prostate cancer and BPH in men with PSAs between 4 and 10 ng/mL and nor- mal DRE results. PSAD should be higher in men with prostate can- cer than in those with benign disease because cancer causes a greater elevation in PSA per prostate volume in comparison with BPH. To determine PSAD, the patient’s PSA can be divided by prostate volume (as determined by a TRUS examination). Studies show that a PSAD greater than 0.15 may mean a higher risk of prostate cancer. A lower PSAD would likely indicate that the patient has BPH. This method should not conclusively determine whether a patient has BPH or pros- tate cancer, but it can be one piece of the puzzle.42


Left untreated, BPH eventually obstructs the bladder outlet, leading to the retention of urine and eventual kidney damage. Because this situa- tion is potentially life-threatening, proper surgical treatment is crucial. Surgery may also be indicated in patients who have failed medical ther- apy or have recurrent infections, hematuria, or renal insufficiency. In the past, medical treatment involved a procedure called transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Because this surgery is associated with the risk of considerable morbidity (sexual dysfunction, inconti- nence, and bleeding)43 and often makes matters worse, it should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. Surgical procedures that use ther- mal microwaves or a laser to reduce hyperplastic tissue are also avail- able. Generally, these newer procedures are less expensive than TURP and have fewer complications, although subsequent therapies are often required.44 Green-light therapy or photoselective vaporization of the prostate is a newer option that has similar outcomes to TURP, with a reduced risk of bleeding.45

## Lifestyle/Exercise

There is an inverse association between physical activity22 and BPH and a positive association between abdominal obesity and BPH.44 In fact, sedentary men are at higher risk of LUTS/BPH, with even nonsed- entary activities such as field work and casual walking proving to be protective against BPH.46 The ingestion of more calories may encourage abdominal obesity and sympathetic nervous system activity, both of which can increase the risk of BPH. Increased sympathetic activity, which is the “fight- or-flight” arm of the autonomic nervous system, may cause the prostate’s smooth muscle to contract, resulting in a worsening of LUTS. Furthermore, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance caused by increased caloric ingestion, especially of high sugar content, may further complicate BPH/LUTS via a hypersympathetic response, thus resulting in constriction of the internal urethral sphincter.46–48 However, a higher caloric intake does not seem to increase BPH risk when accompanied by increased physical activity.49 It is thus possible that physical activity may serve a threefold purpose: It may increase blood flow to the area, allowing the body to remove wastes efficiently. It can decrease the sympathetic stress responses, thus relaxing pros- tatic tissue. It can reduce excess abdominal weight, which increases over- all lower body pressure, thus relaxing the prostate/rectal region and improving blood flow into and out of the area.

## Dietary and Nutritional Factors

Diet appears to play a critical role in the health of the prostate. Diets high in overall fat (not specific to the type of fat) are associated with an increased risk of BPH, as are diets high in red meat (whether con- ventional meats were used in comparison with the grass-fed kind is unknown). Conversely, according to a recent large randomized trial, diets high in protein and vegetables are associated with a decreased risk.44 A special emphasis should be considered for onions, garlic, and other Allium plants because higher intakes of these foods have been found to be associated with a decreased BPH risk.50 It is particularly important to avoid pesticides, increase fruit consumption,51 increase the intake of zinc and essential fatty acids, decrease coffee consumption,52 decrease butter consumption, avoid margarine,51 and keep cholesterol levels below 200 mg/dL. A mod- erate intake of alcohol can possibly benefit BPH but make LUTS worse.53

<!-- chunk -->

## High-Protein Diet

The research evaluating protein intake and BPH is mixed. Some evi- dence shows that a high-protein diet (total calories: 44% protein, 35% carbohydrate, 21% fat) can inhibit 5-alpha-reductase, whereas a low-protein diet (10% protein, 70% carbohydrate, and 20% fat) may stimulate the enzyme.54 On the other hand, an 8-year study of men with BPH found that total protein intake is positively associated with BPH, with the association being slightly stronger for animal pro- tein intake than vegetable protein.44 A study of Chinese farmers also revealed a correlation between a higher intake of animal protein and the incidence of BPH (91.1% in those eating diets high in animal pro- tein vs. 11.8% in those not eating animal protein).55 A possible theoretical reason why high protein intake may not be helpful relates to a greater osmolar load, which may influence uri- nary output and thus impose an undue extra burden on an already taxed system.7 Therefore we recommend against ingesting excess animal protein as a means to increase total protein intake. Instead, high-quality, plant-derived protein and protein from cold-water fish in moderate amounts is probably a reasonable recommendation until we know more about the relationship between protein intake and BPH.

## 1193CHAPTER 154 Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia


Studies conducted in the 1970s showed that zinc supplementation reduced the size of the prostate and the symptomatology of BPH in the majority of patients.56 A more recent randomized trial comprising 4770 participants indicates a possible protective role of zinc against BPH. In that investigation, BPH was assessed over 7 years and defined in terms of medical or surgical treatment or repeated elevation (above 14) on the IPSS questionnaire. Diet, alcohol, and the use of supple- ments were assessed via a food frequency questionnaire. Higher zinc intake was associated with a significantly reduced risk for BPH.49 The mechanism probably involves zinc’s ability to inhibit 5-alpha-reduc- tase57 and/or its ability to inhibit prolactin.58 Prolactin has been shown to increase the uptake of testosterone by the prostate, thereby leading to increased levels of DHT by providing additional substrate.59

<!-- chunk -->

## Alcohol

Although only beer raises prolactin levels, higher alcohol intake may be associated with BPH. In a 17-year study of 6581 men in Hawaii, it was noted that an alcohol intake of at least 25 ounces per month was directly correlated with the diagnosis of BPH.60 The association was most significant for beer, wine, and sake and less so for distilled spirits. Most other recent studies confirm a protec- tive effect of alcohol with regard to BPH when consumption is kept under three alcoholic beverages daily because anything above this amount may increase obstructive and irritative LUTS in men.43,61,62

<!-- chunk -->

## Amino Acids

The combination of glycine, alanine, and glutamic acid (in the form of two 6-grain capsules administered three times daily for 2 weeks and one capsule three times daily thereafter) has been shown in several studies to relieve many BPH symptoms. In a controlled study of men, nocturia was relieved or reduced in 95%, urgency was reduced in 81%, frequency was reduced in 73%, and delayed micturition was alleviated in 70%.63 These results have also been reported in other con- trolled studies.64 The mechanism of action is unknown but is likely related to the amino acids acting as inhibitory neurotransmitters and reducing the feeling of a full bladder. In other words, amino acid ther- apy is only palliative.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cholesterol

The association among cholesterol, BPH, and LUTS is mixed. High levels of serum lipids have been associated with cardiovascular disease and include elevated serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, decreased serum HDL cholesterol, and increased serum triglycerides. In the case of BPH, however, as described by Parsons, no positive asso- ciation has been shown for cholesterol.65 In fact, hyperinsulinemia with hyperlipidemia and low HDL are risk factors for prostatic inflam- mation and BPH.47

<!-- chunk -->

## Beta-Sitosterol

Beta-sitosterol is one of several plant sterols (cholesterol is the main animal sterol) found in almost all plants. High levels are found in rice bran, wheat germ, corn oil, and soybeans; peanuts and their prod- ucts—such as peanut oil, peanut butter, and peanut flour; and Serenoa repens, avocados, pumpkin seed, Pygeum africanum, and cashew fruit. The ability of beta-sitosterol and other phytosterols to lower choles- terol has been well documented.66 Beta-sitosterol has also been shown to improve BPH. One double-blind study comprised 200 men receiv- ing beta-sitosterol (20 mg) or placebo three times daily.67 The beta-sit- osterol group experienced an increase in maximum urinary flow rate from a baseline of 9.9 to 15.2 mL/s and a decrease in mean residual urinary volume of 30.4 from 65.8 mL. In yet another study, 177 patients with benign prostate enlarge- ment were randomized.68 Patients received 130 mg of beta-sitosterol each day and were monitored for over 6 months. Measurements of the IPSS, urinary flow, and residual urine in the bladder after voiding were recorded. On average, urinary flow values increased by 4.5 mL/s, whereas residual urine volumes decreased by a substantial 33.5 mL. The IPSS showed a statistically significant improvement.68 Furthermore, a large systematic review analyzing 519 men among four randomized, placebo-controlled trials found that beta-sitosterol, although it did not reduce prostate volume, did improve urinary flow measures via IPSS, urodynamic measure, mean urine flow, residual urine volume, and nocturia.69


Krystal and colleagues showed that vitamin D supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of BPH, but the dosage was imprecise. The association in this 4770-subject trial was observed only among men who used both multivitamins and single vitamin D supplements. There were no associations of supplement use with BPH risk, with the exception of a trend toward decreased BPH risk with increased intake of supplemental vitamin D.49 Although this study lacked data on the frequency, dose, and duration of vitamin D use, the results are intrigu- ing enough to support further research addressing whether high-dose supplementation will have any benefit for BPH. Numerous studies have shown that vitamin D 3 may have protective effects against pros- tate cancer.70 The mechanism of vitamin D’s favorable effect on BPH is by attach- ing this molecule to vitamin D receptors on the prostate and bladder and inhibiting prostate growth, lowering excessive contractility, and reducing inflammation.71

## Lycopene

Commonly found in watermelon and tomatoes, lycopene is a carot- enoid known for its strong antioxidative effects. Levels in the prostate appear inversely correlated with disorders. However, controlled inter- vention trials, although promising, have been small and typically in conjunction with other interventions, such as the botanical medicines discussed in the next section.


Botanical medicines in the treatment of BPH have been a popular rec- ommendation in Europe for decades.72 The chance of clinical success with any of the botanical treatments of BPH appears to be determined by the degree of obstruction, as indicated by the volume of residual urine. For levels of less than 50 mL, the results are usually excellent. For levels between 50 and 100 mL, the results are usually quite good. With residual urine levels between 100 and 150 mL, it will be tougher to produce a significant improvement within the customary 4- to 6-week period. If the volume of residual urine is greater than 150 mL, saw palmetto extract and other botanical medicines alone are unlikely to produce any significant improvement.

## Serenoa repens (Saw Palmetto)

The liposterolic extract of the fruit of the saw palmetto palm tree (also known as Sabal serrulata), native to Florida, has been shown to sig- nificantly improve the signs and symptoms of BPH in numerous clin- ical studies (see Chapter 112). The mechanism of action is related to inhibition of DHT binding to both the cytosolic and nuclear androgen receptors, inhibition of 5-alpha-reductase, and interference with intra- prostatic estrogen receptors. Owing to these effects, the results of most randomized trials have been excellent. Systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses of clinical trials report excellent results using

## 1194SECTION 6 Diseases

Serenoa, comparing quite favorably with those of finasteride (Proscar) and tamsulosin (Flomax) in terms of efficacy but with a better side-ef- fect profile. It appears that the effect of Serenoa extract is most obvious in the early stages of BPH (i.e., in cases of mild to moderate hyper- trophy) because the clinical research has clearly shown that roughly 90% of men with mild to moderate BPH experience improvement in symptoms during the first 4 to 6 weeks after starting Serenoa extract (320 mg per day of the liposterolic extract). However, it is likely that Serenoa extract may show little if any clinical benefit in more advanced cases of BPH. Chapter 112 offers a complete discussion of the pharma- cology of Serenoa. Furthermore, although Serenoa is often very effective on its own, better results may be achieved by combining Urtica dioca root extract (discussed herein) with Serenoa extract. One double-blind study involving 431 patients found this combination to produce clini- cal benefit equal to that of finasteride.73 In a more recent long-term study, the efficacy and tolerability of this combination was investi- gated in elderly male patients suffering from LUTS caused by BPH.74 In total, 257 patients were randomized to treatment with the combi- nation (320 mg of Serenoa and 240 mg of Urtica extracts per day) or placebo. A 24-week double-blind treatment was followed by an open control period of 24 weeks, during which all patients were given the Serenoa and Urtica combination. Patients treated with the botanical combination exhibited a substantially greater reduction in total IPSS after 24 weeks of double-blind treatment than did patients in the pla- cebo group. This applied to obstructive as well as to irritative symp- toms and to patients with moderate symptoms as well as those with severe symptoms at baseline. Patients randomized to placebo showed a marked improvement in LUTS (as measured by the IPSS) after being switched to the botanical combination. Like the extract of Serenoa, Urtica extract appears to interact with the binding of DHT to cytosolic and nuclear receptors.75 In vitro studies also show that lignans found in Urtica may modulate hormonal effects because of their affinity for sex hormone–binding globulin.74 Although earlier studies have shown promising results, a large recent Cochrane review suggests that the benefits of Serenoa, even at high doses, may be best utilized as a com- bination therapy. Studies have shown benefits when combined with Urtica, as described previously, but also with selenium and lycopene. The combination of selenium, lycopene, and S. repens shows improved IPSS and urinary function tests.76 Furthermore, this same Cochrane review claims Serenoa alone was no better than placebo but also that it was equally as effective as tamsu- losin in reducing IPSS scores.77 This thus raises the question, if Serenoa is no better than placebo but equal to tamsulosin, then is either no better than placebo?

## Cernilton

Cernilton, an extract of rye-grass flower pollen, has been used to treat prostatitis and BPH in Europe for more than 35 years.78 It has been shown to be quite effective in several double-blind clinical studies in the treatment of BPH,79,80 where the overall success rate is about 70%.81 Patients who respond typically experience less nocturia and diurnal frequency (a reduction of about 70%) as well as significant reductions in residual urine volume.73 The extract has been shown to exert some anti-inflammatory action and to produce a contractile effect on the bladder while simultaneously relaxing the urethra. In addition, Cernilton contains a substance that inhibits the growth of prostate cells.75 In one study, the clinical efficacy of Cernilton in the treatment of symptomatic BPH was examined over a 1-year period.79 Seventy-nine men averaging 68 years of age (range 62–89) with a mean baseline prostatic volume of 33.2 cm2 were given 63 mg Cernilton pollen extract twice daily for 12 weeks. As a result, their average urinary maximum flow rate increased from 5.1 to 6 mL/s. The average flow rate increased from 9.3 to 11 mL/s. Residual urine volume decreased from 54.2 mL to less than 30 mL. Clinical efficacy, based on symptoms, was as follows: Urgency or discomfort: improved by 76.9% Dysuria: improved by 71.4% Nocturia: improved by 56.8% Incomplete emptying: improved by 66.2% Prolonged voiding: improved by 64.1% Delayed voiding: improved by 62.2% Intermittency: improved by 60.6% Postvoid dribbling: improved by 42.7% Overall, 85% of the test subjects experienced benefit: 11% reporting “excellent,” 39% “good,” 35% “satisfactory,” and 15% “poor” results. A summary review of two placebo-controlled studies, two compar- ative trials (both lasting 12–24 weeks), and three double-blind studies of 444 men showed that although Cernilton did not improve urinary flow rates, residual volume, or prostate size compared with placebo or the comparative study agents, it did improve self-rated urinary symptom scores and reduced nocturia compared with placebo and an amino acid mixture.75 Clearly, more long-term studies of Cernilton need to be conducted to elucidate the terms of its usefulness as an alter- native or adjunct to Serenoa. Last, a study by Preuss and associates illustrates the potential value of a combination of nutrients used for BPH. In this randomized trial, 144 subjects were randomized to Cernilton, saw palmetto, beta-sitos- terol, vitamin E, or placebo. After 3 months, the combination group had significantly less nocturia, frequency, and overall BPH symptoms, without any adverse side effects.82

## Ganoderma lucidum

Of the many medicinal mushrooms utilized in naturopathic medicine, Ganoderma lucidium has shown the most promise in improving BPH symptoms and LUTS in older men. This medical mushroom has been shown to inhibit 5-alpha-reductase in the ventral prostate of rats.83 Two follow-up randomized, placebo-controlled trials tested the use of G. lucidum in adult men with LUTS. The primary outcomes assessed for changes in the IPSS. The two studies exhibited a significant reduc- tion in IPSS using 6 mg daily of G. lucidum.84,85 There was no added benefit at doses of 60 mg, suggesting a higher dose is not necessary to reduce LUTS.84 Interestingly, no changes were noted in quality-of-life scores, peak urinary flow, mean urinary flow, residual urine, prostate volume, serum PSA, or testosterone levels.84,85 This would suggest that the benefits observed from Ganoderma are not dependent on the ability to inhibit 5-alpha-reductase, as was seen in earlier animal trials. This is significant because reductions in PSA and the inhibition of andro- gen and DHT receptors in the prostate may affect screening for BPH and prostate cancer. Therefore supplementing with Ganoderma may improve symptoms and still allow for proper PSA screening and monitoring.

## Vaccinium macrocarpon

Vaccinium macrocarpon, better known as cranberry fruit, has been popularized for its use in urinary tract infections. However, the use of this fruit has also shown promise in the management of LUTS and BPH in men. Two studies have assessed the efficacy of Vaccinium extract in improving the IPSS and quality-of-life scores, along with clinical parameters such as PSA, PVR, average urinary flow rate (Q ave), and maximum urinary flow rate (Q max). Findings from both studies suggest that Vaccinium improves the IPSS, along with sig- nificantly improving urinary parameters such as Q max, Q ave, and

PVR.86,87 One of the studies assessed the benefits of PSA reduction, showing this fruit was able to reduce PSA in men with histologi- cally confirmed nonbacterial chronic prostatitis.86 Possible mecha- nisms, although unclear, suggest V. macrocarpon improves detrusor contraction and activation, improves the micturition reflex, reduces inflammation, and possibly improves the dynamic and static prostatic components of voiding.86,87

## Pygeum africanum

The bark of Pygeum africanum, an evergreen tree native to Africa, has historically been used in the treatment of urinary tract disorders. The major active components of the bark are fat-soluble sterols and fatty acids. Virtually all of the research on Pygeum has featured a Pygeum extract standardized to contain 14% triterpenes, including beta-sitosterol and 0.5% n-docosanol. This extract has been exten- sively studied in both experimental animals and humans in clinical trials (see Chapter 107). A study on rat prostatic cells suggests that the therapeutic effect of Pygeum may be due in part to the inhibi- tion of growth factors epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibro- blast growth factor (bFGF), and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), which are responsible for prostatic overgrowth.88 Additional possible benefits of Pygeum have been suspected to be due to its ability to inac- tivate androgen receptors, inhibit cellular proliferation, and reduce inflammation.89–91 Numerous clinical trials with more than 600 patients have shown Pygeum extract to be effective in reducing the symptoms and clinical signs of BPH, especially in early cases.92 However, in a double-blind study that compared Pygeum extract with extract of saw palmetto, the latter produced a greater reduction of symptoms and was better tolerated.93 In addition, the effects on objective parameters, especially urine flow rate and residual urine content, were better in the clinical studies with saw palmetto. However, there may be circumstances in which Pygeum is more effective than saw palmetto. For example, saw palmetto has not been shown to produce some of Pygeum’s effects on prostate secretion. Of course, the two extracts have somewhat overlap- ping mechanisms of action and can be used in combination.

## Urtica dioica (Stinging Nettle)

Extracts of the root of Urtica dioica have also been shown to be effective in the treatment of BPH. Three double-blind studies have shown it to be more effective than a placebo.94,95 The most recent study, conducted in Iran, was a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled, random- ized, partial crossover, comparative trial of Urtica with placebo in patients.96 Both groups continued the medication up to 18 months, and only those who continued the therapy had favorable results. No side effects were identified in either group.


Therapeutic goals for BPH are aimed at the following goals: Normalize prostate nutrient levels. Restore steroid hormones to normal levels. Inhibit excessive conversion of testosterone to DHT. Inhibit DHT-receptor binding. Reduce inflammation. Eliminate excess estradiol production. Limit promoters of the hyperplastic process (e.g., prolactin). Severe BPH resulting in significant acute urinary retention may require catheterization for relief; a sufficiently advanced case may not respond rapidly enough to therapy and may require the short-term use of an alpha 1 antagonist by itself or combined with a 5-alpha-reductase medication or surgical intervention.


Patients should exercise, between four to six times a week, and prop- erly stretch the prostate/urogenital area to increase blood flow.


Initially, the diet should be higher in vegetable protein, low in carbo- hydrates, low in animal fats, and high in unsaturated oils. After the patient responds, a less strict whole-foods, balanced approach can be used. The patient should limit alcohol and coffee intake; avoid drug-, pesticide- and hormone-contaminated foods; and limit cholester- ol-rich foods. Soy foods should be used regularly.97


Zinc: 30 to 45 mg/day (picolinate preferred, maximum of 6 months; reduce dosage to 15–30 mg/day after 6 months; consider monitor- ing copper status in long-term therapy) Glycine: 200 mg/day Glutamic acid: 200 mg/day Alanine: 200 mg/day Vitamin D3: 2000 to 5000 IU/day


Liposterolic extract of saw palmetto (S. repens) (standardized at 85%– 95% fatty acids and sterols): 160 mg two times a day Flower pollen extract (e.g., Cernilton): 63 mg two to three times a day P. africanum extract (14% triterpene content): 50 to 100 mg/day U. dioica extract: 120 to 150 mg two times a day Beta-sitosterol: 60 to 130 mg/day

lead). Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for COPD and con- tinues to be one of the leading causes of cigarette smoke–related death worldwide.2 Although pneumonia may appear in healthy individuals, it is usu- ally seen in those who are immune compromised, particularly drug and alcohol abusers. The growing population of those with chronic lung diseases and other debilitating illnesses and a history of the use of respiratory therapy, immunosuppressive drugs, and other such tech- nologies has contributed to the further increase of nosocomial and opportunistic pneumonias, which have high mortality rates. Acute pneumonia is the seventh-leading cause of death in the United States.3 It is particularly dangerous in the elderly. In healthy individuals, pneumonia most often follows an insult to the host defense mechanisms: viral infection (especially influenza), cigarette smoke and other noxious fumes, impairment of conscious- ness (which depresses the gag reflex, allowing aspiration), neoplasms, and hospitalization (Table 155.1). In immunocompetent, nonelderly adults, cigarette smoking is the strongest independent risk factor for invasive pneumococcal disease.4

# DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY

<!-- chunk -->

## Bronchitis

The diagnosis of acute bronchitis is usually made by ruling out other causes of an acute cough—such as pneumonia, the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Fig. 155.2). In patients with the presumed diagnosis of acute bronchitis, viral cultures, serological assays, and sputum analyses should not be rou- tinely performed because the responsible organism is rarely identified in clinical practice. In patients with acute cough and sputum production suggestive of acute bronchitis, the absence of the following findings reduces the likelihood of pneumonia sufficiently to eliminate the need for a chest radiograph: (1) heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute; (2) respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths per minute; (3) oral body tem- perature above 38°C; and (4) chest examination findings of focal con- solidation, egophony, or fremitus.

<!-- chunk -->

## Pneumonia

The diagnosis of pneumonia is usually made by physical examination and confirmed by a chest x-ray. Common physical examination find- ings include: • Rales (a bubbling or crackling sound)—Rales on one side of the chest and rales heard while the patient is lying down are strongly suggestive of pneumonia. • Rhonchi (abnormal rumblings indicating the presence of thick fluid) • Percussion—A dull thud instead of a healthy hollow, drum-like sound indicates certain conditions that suggest pneumonia, including: • Consolidation (a condition in which the lung becomes firm and inelastic) • Pleural effusion (fluid buildup in the space between the lungs and the surrounding lining) Examination of the sputum suggestive of infection includes the presence of blood; a positive Gram stain; and thick, opaque, yellow-, green-, or brown-colored sputum. Sputum culture and sensitivity are not always helpful in identifying the cause of pneumonia due to con- tamination of the sample with throat or mouth bacteria. A urine test (Binax NOW, Binax Inc., Scarborough, Maine) can detect Streptococcus pneumonia or Legionella pneumophila antigens within 15 minutes. It may identify up to 77% of pneumonia cases and may rule out the infection in 98% of patients who do not have S. pneu- moniae. However, the test is not very useful in diagnosing S. pneumoniae as a cause of pneumonia in children because the organism is common in this population with or without pneumonia. L. pneumophila is the bac- terium that causes Legionnaires’ disease, a severe form of pneumonia. A chest x-ray is nearly always taken to confirm a diagnosis of pneu- monia, but a positive result is not necessary to make the clinical diag- nosis. A positive chest x-ray for pneumonia may reveal lung infiltrates or complications of pneumonia such as pleural effusions.

## Special Considerations With Pneumonia

There are more than 100 types of bacteria, viruses, and fungi known to cause bronchitis or pneumonia. The three most common forms of pneumonia are viral, mycoplasmal, and pneumococcal.

<!-- chunk -->

## Viral pneumonia. Viral pneumonia is most often caused by one of

several viruses: adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. Viral pneumonia is responsible for about 30% of pneumonia cases and may develop as a complication of viral upper respiratory infections. Immunocompromised individuals are at risk for more serious viral pneumonia. Antibiotics are of no value in treating viral pneumonia unless a secondary bacterial infection develops.

<!-- chunk -->

## Clinical summary for viral pneumonia.

• People who are at risk for more serious viral pneumonia are often immunocompromised. • Antibiotics are of no value in viral pneumonia. • Symptoms of viral pneumonia often begin slowly and may not be severe at first. • The most common symptoms of viral pneumonia are as follows: • Cough (some patients with pneumonia may cough up mucus or even bloody mucus) • Fever, which may be mild or high • Shaking chills • Shortness of breath (may only occur when on merely climbing stairs)

<!-- chunk -->

## Mycoplasmal pneumonia. Mycoplasma is a genus of bacteria that

lack cell walls. Mycoplasmal pneumonia is caused by the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Various studies suggest that M. pneumoniae is responsible for 15% to 50% of all cases of pneumonia in adults and even more than those in school-age children. It is often referred to as “walking pneumonia” because symptoms tend to be milder than pneumonia caused by other organisms. M. pneumoniae infections are one of the most common etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Antibiotics are usually not necessary but may speed recovery. Effective classes of antibiotics that may be effective against M. pneumoniae include macrolides, quinolones, and tetracyclines.

<!-- chunk -->

## Clinical summary for mycoplasmal pneumonia.

• Most commonly occurs in children or young adults • Insidious onset over several days • Nonproductive cough, minimal physical findings, temperature generally less than 102°F • Headache and malaise are common early symptoms • White blood cell count is normal or slightly elevated • X-ray pattern is patchy or inhomogeneous

<!-- chunk -->

## Pneumococcal pneumonia. Pneumococcal pneumonia (due

to S. pneumoniae) is the most common bacterial pneumonia and the most common cause of pneumonia requiring hospitalization. Careful clinical judgment is necessary in determining the severity of the disease and the status of the patient’s immune system because it is often necessary to administer antibiotics or to refer for hospitalization, especially for elderly or immunocompromised patients. Unfortunately, most reports show an increase in resistance rates to antibiotic therapy and an increase in the proportion of highly resistant strains.5–7 In two multinational studies, the worldwide prevalence of penicillin- and macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae ranged from 18% to 22% and from 24% to 31%, respectively.8,9 Given this information, it is important to consider natural treatments in cases resistant to antibi- otics or as an adjunctive treatment to strengthen the immune response and increase the therapeutic effect.

<!-- chunk -->

## Clinical summary for pneumococcal pneumonia.

• Pneumonia is usually preceded by upper respiratory tract infection. • There is a sudden onset of shaking, chills, fever, and chest pain. • Sputum is pinkish or blood-specked at first, then becomes rusty at the height of the infection, and finally becomes yellow and muco- purulent during resolution. • Gram-positive diplococci are present in the sputum smear. • A rapid urine test (Binax NOW) for S. pneumoniae antigens is positive. • Initially, chest excursion is diminished on the involved side, breath sounds are suppressed, and fine inspiratory rales are heard. • Later, classic signs of consolidation appear (bronchial breathing, crepitant rales, dullness). • Leukocytosis is present. • Radiograph shows lobar or segmental consolidation.


The basic approach in the treatment of bronchitis and pneumonia is to use an expectorant, mucolytic, and immune-supportive nutrients. Although antibiotics are of limited value in acute bronchitis, they cer- tainly play a role in treating pneumonia.

## Expectorants

Botanical expectorants have a long history of use in bronchitis and pneumonia. Because impaired cough reflexes have been thought to play a role in recurrent bronchitis and pneumonia,10 it seems rea- sonable that these botanicals would be useful in helping relieve this condition and preventing recurrences. Botanical expectorants act to increase the quantity, decrease the viscosity, and promote expulsion of the secretions of the respiratory mucous membranes. Many also have antibacterial and antiviral activity. Some expectorants are also antitus- sives; however, Lobelia inflata, a commonly used expectorant, helps promote the cough reflex.11 Therefore Lobelia may be more effective at clearing the lungs than other expectorants when the cough is pro- ductive. Other commonly used expectorants include Glycyrrhiza gla- bra (licorice), Pelargonium sidoides (South African geranium), Hedera helix (ivy), and wild cherry bark.

## Pelargonium sidoides (South African Geranium)

P. sidoides is a medicinal plant in the geranium family that is native to South Africa. Umckaloaba, its common name, is a close approxi- mation of the word in the Zulu language that means “severe cough” and is a testimony to its effect in bronchitis. The plant has an intri- cate grouping of thick dark-red rhizomes and tubers underground that allows it to withstand the frequent grass fires in its habitat. Extracts from the rhizomes and tubers have been shown to exert a number of effects beneficial in upper respiratory tract infections, particularly bronchitis. Most of the research has been conducted using an ethanolic extract known as EPs 7630 (also marketed as Umcka), and it is an approved drug for the treatment of acute bron- chitis in Germany. It is produced using 11% ethanol to yield a drug/ extract ratio of 1:8 to 10. The primary active ingredients include highly oxygenated coumarins (e.g., umckalin) and polyphenolic compounds.12 Research with EPs 7630 shows that it exerts a three-pronged approach in acute bronchitis: (1) it enhances immune function; (2) it has some antimicrobial effects, including antimycobacterial13 and antiviral activity,14 and appears to inhibit the attachment of bacteria, viruses, and perhaps other organisms to mucous membranes of the respiratory tract12; and (3) it acts as an expectorant.12 These effects are mediated by the activation of macrophages (with the involvement of cytokine interferon-gamma) and the consequent increase in the production of nitric oxide (NO) (Fig. 155.3). Regarding its antiviral effects, EPs 7630, at concentrations up to 100 mcg/mL, interfered with

the replication of seasonal influenza A virus strains (H1N1, H3N2), respiratory syncytial virus, human coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and coxsackievirus but did not affect replication of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H5N1), adenovirus, or rhinovirus.14 A 2008 meta-analysis of four randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of EPs 7630 comprising 1647 patients with acute bronchitis supports its safety and efficacy in acute bronchitis.15 Inclusion criteria required patients to have been diagnosed with acute bronchitis within 48 hours and that they should not have received antibiotic therapy and had no obvious contraindications to therapy. The primary outcome or review of efficacy for most of the trials involved changes in the Bronchitis Severity Score (BSS), which includes the symptoms of coughing, expectoration, chest pain, dyspnea, and wheezing from baseline versus after 7 days of treatment. Included in this review was a double-blind placebo-controlled study in 468 adults with recent onset of acute bronchitis who were given either placebo or EPs 7630 for 1 week. The results showed a significantly greater improvement in symptoms in the treatment group compared with the placebo group. On average, par- ticipants who received the real treatment were able to return to work 2 days earlier than those given placebo. In another included study, children with acute bronchitis showed a drop of at least 80% in the severity of component symptoms of the BSS within 2 weeks of ther- apy, and over 88% of the treating physicians rated the performance as “successful.” In 2018 a review of eight RCTs found that the early administra- tion of EPs 7630 not only reduced the severity of symptoms resulting from infection of the airways but also preponed the start of symp- tom improvement, with a reduction of illness duration and an earlier resumption of usual activities in the affected patients.16 Additional studies provide evidence of the safety and efficacy of EPs 7630 in acute bronchitis as well as further insight on dosage. In one study, 406 patients with acute bronchitis were randomly assigned to one of four parallel treatment groups—10-mg EPs 7630 tablets three times a day (30-mg group), 20-mg EPs 7630 tablets three times a day (60-mg group), 30-mg EPs 7630 tablets three times a day (90- mg group), or placebo three times a day (control group)—for a treat- ment period of 7 days.17 The primary endpoint was the change in the total BSS score from baseline to day 7. Between day 0 and day 7, the mean BSS score decreased by 2.7 (control group), 4.3 (30-mg group), 6.1 (60-mg group), and 6.3 (90-mg group), respectively. These results indicated that the 20-mg tablets of EPs 7630 taken three times daily constitute the optimal dose. Similar results were seen in a study of children with acute bronchitis using the same dosage assessment.18 In another study, 200 children with acute bronchitis were random- ized to receive either EPs 7630 in liquid form or placebo for 7 consec- utive days.19 Dosage was based on age: from ages 1 to 6 years, 10 drops three times daily; from ages 6 to 12 years, 20 drops three times daily; and from ages 12 to 18 years, 30 drops three times daily. From baseline to day 7, the mean BSS score improved significantly more for EPs compared with placebo (3.4 vs. 1.2 points). On day 7, secondary mea- sures of treatment outcome were significantly better, satisfaction with treatment more pronounced, onset of effect faster, and time of bed rest shorter compared with placebo. In clinical studies with umcka in more than 2500 adults and chil- dren, adverse events occurred on par with a placebo and mainly con- sisted of mild gastrointestinal complaints and skin rashes. There were no known drug interactions.12

## Hedera helix (Ivy)

In Europe, herbal preparations containing extracts from the leaves of ivy enjoy great popularity for the relief of cough as well as asthma. In 2007 more than 80% of herbal expectorants prescribed in Germany comprised ivy extract and amounted to nearly 2 million prescriptions nationwide. Ivy leaf contains saponins that show expectorant, muco- lytic, spasmolytic, bronchodilatory, and antibacterial effects. The mucolytic and expectorant action of ivy is based on indirect β2 -ad- renergic effects, and this action is due to the saponins α -hederin and hederacoside C, the latter of which is metabolized to α -hederin when ingested. The indirect effect is that α -hederin inhibits the intracellular uptake of β2 receptors and leads to an increased β2 -adrenergic response of the cell.20 Ivy is often used as a monopreparation, with very good safety, com- pliance, and efficacy ratings from postmarketing surveillance studies in both acute and chronic bronchitis.21,22 A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was con- ducted to assess the efficacy and safety of ivy leaves cough liquid in the treatment of 181 adult patients with acute cough. 23 Participants were treated with either ivy leaves cough liquid containing EA or with placebo three times a day for 1 week. The evaluation of the visual analogue scale (VAS), BSS, and Verbal Category Descriptive (VCD) score revealed that subjects treated with ivy leaves cough liq- uid showed statistically significant and clinically relevant reductions in cough severity, severity of symptoms associated with cough, and bron- chitis compared with the placebo group. In addition, an early onset of efficacy was observed: significant reductions of cough severity were detected within 48 hours after the first intake. Treatment advantage was observed at all following visits and even 7 days after the end of treatment compared with placebo. One double-blind study in acute bronchitis used a combination of ivy and thyme (Thymus vulgaris).24 The 361 patients with acute bronchitis and 10 or more coughing fits during the day, onset of bronchial mucus production with impaired ability to cough up at a maximum of 2 days before recruitment, and a BSS score of greater than or equal to 5 points were randomly assigned to an 11-day treat- ment (5.4 mL three times daily) with either thyme–ivy combination syrup or placebo syrup. The mean reduction in coughing fits on days 7 to 9 relative to baseline was 68.7% under the thyme–ivy combina- tion compared with 47.6% under the placebo. In the thyme–ivy com- bination group, a 50% reduction in coughing fits from baseline was cytokines stimulation of effector cells IFN, TNF iNOS citrullin NADPH-oxidase bacteria

reached 2 days earlier compared with the placebo group. The symp- toms of acute bronchitis (BSS) improved rapidly in both groups, but the regression of symptoms was faster, and the responder rates compared with placebo were higher at visit 2 (83.0% vs. 53.9%) and visit 3 (96.2% vs. 74.7%) under the treatment of the thyme–ivy com- bination. Treatment was well tolerated, with no difference in the fre- quency or severity of side effects between the thyme–ivy combination and placebo groups.

## Mucolytics

A mucolytic agent should be used to improve the quality of the mucus secretions so as to promote expectoration. Guaifenesin (also known as glycerol guiacolate) is a derivative of a compound originally iso- lated from beech wood. Guaifenesin is an approved over-the-counter expectorant and mucolytic. Alternatives include N-acetylcysteine and bromelain.

<!-- chunk -->

## N-Acetylcysteine

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has an extensive history of use as a mucolytic in the treatment of acute and chronic lung conditions. It directly splits the sulfur linkages of mucoproteins, thereby reducing the viscosity of bronchial and lung secretions. As a result, it improves bronchial and lung function, reduces cough, and improves oxygen saturation in the blood. NAC is helpful in all lung and respiratory tract disorders, especially chronic bronchitis and COPD. A detailed analysis of 39 trials con- cluded that oral NAC reduces the risk of exacerbations (severe wors- ening) and improves symptoms in patients with chronic bronchitis compared with placebo. In addition to its effects as a mucolytic, NAC increases the synthesis of glutathione, a major antioxidant for the entire respiratory tract and lungs. The typical dosage for NAC is 200 mg three times daily.

<!-- chunk -->

## Bromelain

Bromelain is a useful adjunctive therapy for bronchitis and pneumonia owing to its fibrinolytic, anti-inflammatory, and mucolytic actions as well as enhancement of antibiotic absorption.25 Bromelain’s mucolytic activity is responsible for its effectiveness in respiratory tract diseases, including pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinusitis.26

# IMMUNE AND BARRIER FUNCTION SUPPORT


In the early part of the 20th century, before the advent of effective anti- biotics, many controlled and uncontrolled studies demonstrated the efficacy of large doses of vitamin C in bronchitis and pneumonia but only when they were started on the first or second day of infection.27 If administered later, vitamin C tended only to lessen the severity of the disease. Researchers also demonstrated that in pneumonia, white blood cells take up large amounts of vitamin C. The value of vitamin C supplementation in elderly patients with pneumonia was demonstrated in a double-blind study of 57 elderly patients hospitalized for severe acute bronchitis and pneumonia.28 The patients were given either 200 mg/day of vitamin C or a placebo. Patients were assessed by clinical and laboratory methods (vitamin C levels in the plasma, white blood cells, and platelets; sedimentation rates; and white blood cell counts and differential). Patients receiving vitamin C demonstrated substantially increased vitamin C levels in all tissues, even in the presence of an acute respiratory infection. Using a clinical scoring system based on major symptoms of respiratory infec- tions, results indicated that the patients receiving the vitamin C fared significantly better than those on placebo. The benefit of vitamin C was most obvious in patients with the most severe illness, many of whom had low plasma and white blood cell levels of vitamin C on admission.


Vitamin A supplementation appears to be of value, especially in children with measles. This may be because of the increased rate of excretion of vitamin A found during severe infections such as pneu- monia. One study evaluated 29 patients with pneumonia and sepsis and found that their mean excretion rate of vitamin A was 0.78 mmol/ day. Subjects with fever excreted significantly more retinol than did those without fever. A remarkable 34% of the patients excreted more than 1.75 mmol/day of retinol, which is equivalent to 50% of the U.S. recommended daily allowance.29 This may be particularly important for children. A randomized, double-blind trial of 189 children with measles (average age 10 months) in South Africa evaluated the efficacy of vitamin A in reducing compli- cations. Providing 400,000 IU (120 mg of retinyl palmitate), one-half on admission and one-half a day later, reduced the death rate by more than 50% and the duration of pneumonia, diarrhea, and hospital stay by 33%.30 However, another study did not show any benefit from vitamin A supplementation. The difference may be due to the lower dose (100,000 IU) used in the second study or that vitamin A was not limited to chil- dren with pneumonia as a complication of measles, a condition known to also decrease vitamin A levels.31 Evidence also indicates there are positive results using vitamin A concomitantly with zinc supplementation. One study of 2482 children aged 6 months to 3 years revealed that those children given initial high doses of vitamin A followed by 4 months of elemental zinc (10 mg/ day for infants and 20 mg/day for children older than 1 year) brought about a reduced incidence of pneumonia, which was not seen in the group given only vitamin A.32


Patients with influenza complicated by pneumonia experience a sharp rise in lipid peroxidation (LPO) products, especially those who are seriously ill. Administration of α -tocopherol promotes a significant decrease in the levels of lipid peroxidation products and a more benign clinical course.33

## Garlic

Allium sativum (garlic) has exhibited a broad spectrum of antibiotic activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.34 In vitro studies have demonstrated garlic to be an effective antibacterial agent against S. pneumoniae.35 Therefore its use should be considered in cases of antibiotic resistance or as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy. Alternatively, berberine-containing plants like Hydrastis canadensis (goldenseal) may be helpful.

## Bottle Blowing and Salt Pipes

A Swedish study was carried out with 145 adults hospitalized for commu- nity-acquired pneumonia.36 These patients were divided into three groups. Group A was given early mobilization with no breathing-associated exer- cises, group B was instructed to sit up and take 20 deep breaths 10 times daily, and group C was instructed to sit up and blow bubbles in a bottle con- taining 10 mL water through a plastic tube 20 times on 10 occasions daily. In this study, length of hospitalization was significantly modified in groups B and C: group A patients were hospitalized for a mean of 5.3 days, group B for 4.6 days, and group C for only 3.9 days. The number of days with fever was lowest in the bottle-blowing group. It should be noted that early mobi- lization itself is known to significantly decrease hospital stays in pneumonia patients.37 Despite the positive clinical results, C-reactive protein levels, peak expiratory flow, and vital capacity were not significantly affected.

## 1201CHAPTER 155 Bronchitis and Pneumonia

Although it is not completely understood why the patients who performed bottle blowing had shorter hospital stays, it seems that the changes in respiratory pressure associated with this exercise may be involved in providing an environment for more efficient bacterial clearance. Another study also found decreased impairment of pulmo- nary function and an increase in total lung capacity in patients who had undergone coronary artery bypass.38 This modality or another similar activity, like playing a wind instrument, may well prove use- ful as a means of decreasing the frequency and duration of respira- tory events in patients who are vulnerable to respiratory infections like pneumonia. An alternative to bubble blowing is the use of a salt pipe. These pipes are inhaler-type devices containing tiny salt particles said to ease breathing. The practice originated in central Europe, where individuals with respiratory complaints would spend time in salt caves or mines to help relieve their breathing problems.


As previously mentioned, the basic approach is to use an expectorant, mucolytic, and immune-supportive nutrients to help resolve the con- dition. Some general physical modalities and measures that may be helpful include the following: • Diathermy to chest and back: 30 min/day • Mustard poultice: once/day • Lymphatic massage: three times a day • Postural drainage: three times a day • Bottle-blowing therapy: blowing bubbles in a bottle containing mL water through a plastic tube 20 times on 10 occasions a day • Getting plenty of rest • Drinking enough liquids • Using a humidifier

## Expectorants

Choose one or more of the following:

<!-- chunk -->

## Lobelia inflata

• Dried herb: 50 to 200 mg three times a day • Tincture: 10 to 20 drops three times a day • Fluid extract: 8 to 10 drops three times a day

<!-- chunk -->

## Glycyrrhiza glabra

## Pelargonium sidoides

Dosage recommendations for EPs 7630 or equivalent preparation are as follows: Adults: 1.5 mL three times a day or 20-mg tablets three times a day for up to 14 days Children: age 7 to 12 years, 20 drops (1 mL) three times a day; age years or less, 10 drops (0.5 mL) three times a day

<!-- chunk -->

## Hedera helix

Ivy leaf is available primarily in tincture and fluid extract forms and the dry powdered extract in capsules and tablets. Based on clinical studies, the daily dosages are to deliver the following equivalent to dried herbal substance: 1 to 5 years: 150 mg; 6 to 12 years: 210 mg; above 12 years: 420 mg. Therefore the typical dosage for adults and children over years of age for a 4:1 dried powdered extract is 100 mg daily.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mucolytics

Choose one or more of the following.

<!-- chunk -->

## Guaifenesin

Adults and children 12 years of age and older: 200 to 400 mg every hours. It is inadvisable to take more than 2400 mg in a 24-hour period. The dosage for children age 6 to 11 years is 100 to 200 mg every hours and no more than 1200 mg in a 24-hour period. For children age 2 to 5 years, 50 to 100 mg every 4 hours and no more than 600 mg in 24 hours. Guaifenesin is not recommended for children under 2 years of age.

## Additional Recommendations for Pneumococcal

<!-- chunk -->

## Pneumonia

Choose one or both of the following.

<!-- chunk -->

## Garlic

A commercial garlic product should provide a daily dose equal to at least 4000 mg of fresh garlic, which translates to at least 10 mg alliin or a total allicin potential of 4000 mcg (see Chapter 50, Allium cepa).

<!-- chunk -->

## Hydrastis canadensis

Given berberine’s broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and immune-enhancing effects, berberine-containing plants are an important consideration. The dosage should be based on berberine content. Because of the wide range of quality in goldenseal prepara- tions, standardized extracts are recommended. The following dosages are intended to be given three times daily: • Dried root or as an infusion (tea): 2 to 4 g • Tincture (1:5): 6 to 12 mL (1.5–3 tsp) • Fluid extract (1:1): 2 to 4 mL (0.5–1 tsp) • Solid (powdered dry) extract (4:1 or 8%–12% alkaloid content): 250 to 500 mg

<!-- chunk -->

## Risk Factors and Frequency of Occurrence

CTS most often occurs after age 30, and women are affected three times as often as men.4 Repetitive strain injury (RSI) from light-duty work as a cause of CTS is not well supported by the current litera- ture.5 However, a study of 501 participants, 156 of whom were diag- nosed with CTS, showed the following risk factors: repetitive activities with a flexed or extended wrist, hysterectomy without oophorectomy, and menopausal women who had their last menstrual period 6 to months earlier.6 Others report an increased incidence of CTS due to pregnancy, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and recent menopause.7 Although uncommon, acute carpal tunnel syndrome has been reported after anticoagulation therapy.8 Complications appear to be secondary to intraneural hemorrhage of the median nerve. In addition, features of CTS, predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy, were found in 18% of individuals with lifetime low-level exposures to drifts containing organophosphate pesticides.9


There is no single reference standard for diagnosis of the syndrome; a combination of symptoms, signs, and tests should be used to charac- terize the disorder.1

<!-- chunk -->

## History

CTS typically has an insidious onset of intermittent tingling or numb- ness, often bilaterally, of the first three fingers and the lateral one half of the fourth digit. Symptoms are frequently worse at night, often wak- ing the patient. As the condition progresses, loss of fine motor skills and loss of grip strength, with “things slipping from my fingers,” are commonly reported. Relief is gained from shaking the affected hand or hands. Katz and Stirrat10 developed a self-administered hand diagram test that has an 80% sensitivity and a 90% specificity for CTS. Loss of finger dexterity and atrophy are late complaints.

<!-- chunk -->

## Physical Examination

Examination may show decreased sensation over the distribution of the median nerve to sharp, light touch and vibration (128-Hz tun- ing fork). Surprisingly, many patients are not able to localize the symptoms to the median distribution and feel that the whole hand is involved, which may be due to autonomic nerve involvement. Tingling in the distribution of the median nerve produced by tapping on the wrist crease (positive Tinel’s sign), tingling in the distribution of the median nerve produced by holding the wrist in forced flexion for to 90 seconds (Phalen’s test), or tingling produced by forcibly extend- ing the wrist and applying pressure over the median nerve (reverse Phalen’s test) are signs of CTS. Early on, the perceived loss of strength may be due to loss of sensory feedback, not loss of strength. Manual muscle tests may elicit weakness of the LOAF muscles—the muscles

## ond, opponens pollicus, abductor pollicus, and flexor pollicis brevis.

As CTS advances, atrophy of the thenar eminence and weakness of the thumb abductor muscle may develop.

<!-- chunk -->

## Other Diagnostic Tests

The carpal compression test, in which the examiner exerts direct compression with the thumbs over the patient’s carpal tunnel for seconds and reproduces the symptoms, was reported as having 89% sensitivity and 96% specificity when performed with the Durkan gauge.11 Other studies have not reproduced these findings but have reported that “Tinel’s, Phalen’s, Reverse Phalen’s, and carpal tunnel compression tests are more sensitive, as well as being specific tests for the diagnosis of tenosynovitis of the flexor muscles of the hand, rather than being specific tests for CTS.”12,13 Weakness of the thumb abduc- tor muscle is a strong indication to order neurophysiological testing (nerve conduction studies [NCSs] and/or electromyography). In CTS, NCSs may show motor and sensory latencies across the wrist. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high-definition ultra- sound imaging can measure the dimensions of the carpal tunnel and size of the median nerve, but these tests are expensive and not needed in uncomplicated CTS.

# DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

When the clinical picture is not clear, other sources of paresthesia should be considered, such as compression of the brachial plexus in the thoracic outlet, impingement of the median nerve under the pronator teres muscle, and entrapment of either the radial or ulnar nerves. The initial presentation of complex regional pain syndrome (reflex sympa- thetic dystrophy) may appear to be CTS.


Many patients report spontaneous recovery from CTS. CTS from preg- nancy most often is self-resolving. The waxing and waning symptoms of CTS can give a false sense of success from conservative treatment. The cost of conservative care in persistent CTS may be greater than a carpal tunnel release when performed as an office procedure.14 In cases of progressive neurological deficit and pain, an open release procedure may be the best choice of treatment.15 In the Netherlands, only open procedures are compensated by the state plan because of their high rate of success and low rate of complications. Unless the surgeon has good skills, the more expensive endoscopic procedures have poorer outcomes.16

## Physical Medicine

## Splinting

Initially, the most recommended treatment is 4 weeks in a neutral wrist splint worn full time, which provides better results than night-only splinting, but night-only splinting has higher compliance. Splinting is most effective when it is started within 3 months of the onset of CTS. Specialized splints have not been proven more effective than a good-quality, well-fitted, off-the-shelf splint.17,18 Splinting should not be done after carpal tunnel release.19

<!-- chunk -->

## Therapeutic Ultrasound

Ultrasound (US) therapy for 2 weeks is generally not beneficial, but one trial showed significant symptom improvement from US (1 MHz, 1.0 W/cm2, pulse 1:4, 15 minutes per session) after 20 sessions over weeks that was maintained at 6 months.20 The cost of 15 to 20 sessions of US treatment may be prohibitive.

<!-- chunk -->

## Yoga and Stretching

One small preliminary study described 10 yoga poses held for 30 sec- onds, each followed by 10 to 15 minutes of relaxation, that resulted in significantly reduced pain and increased grip strength persisting for more than 8 weeks.21 Tests recording carpal tunnel pressure showed a significant rise in pressure with wrist flexion, wrist extension, making a fist, holding objects, and isolated isometric flexion of a finger against resistance. But after 1 minute of specific stretching–loading exercises, intratun- nel pressures dropped to normal levels and remained normal for more than 15 minutes.22

## Manual Manipulation

Studies of manipulation show benefits from soft tissue and joint mobi- lization of the forearm, wrist, and hand but not from spinal manipu- lation alone. A case report of manipulative treatment to the cervical spine, right elbow, and right wrist performed three times per week for 4 weeks reported improved grip strength; both Tinel’s and Phalen’s tests became negative, and NCSs improved.23 In 1993 Sucher24 described the treatment of four patients with myo- fascial release and self-stretching techniques performed three to five times daily. Posttreatment comparison MRI demonstrated increased dimensions in the carpal tunnel, and NCSs showed a reduction in dis- tal latencies or an increase in motor response amplitudes. Nerve and tendon gliding exercise produced no changes in Phalen’s test, Tinel’s test, or NCSs but reduced the number of reported surgeries.25

## Low-Level Laser Therapy

One small (N = 11) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial studied low-level laser therapy (LLLT) combined with microcurrent transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).26 Eleven patients with mild to moderate symptoms of CTS who had failed to improve with standard medical or surgical treatment were treated with real or sham local applications of LLLT and microcurrent for 3 to 4 weeks. After treatment, there was a significant improvement in scores on the McGill Pain Questionnaire, sensory and motor latency scores with electromyography (EMG), and Tinel’s and Phalen’s tests; these improvements were not found after sham treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hydrotherapy

An anecdotal naturopathic treatment to relieve CTS pain is immersing the wrist and hand in hot water for 3 minutes, then immersing in cold water for 30 seconds, repeated three to five times once or twice a day. It is important to ensure that the hot-water immersion is deeper than the cold.


A randomized controlled study comparing prednisolone (20 mg for weeks, then 10 mg for 2 weeks) to eight sessions of acupuncture over 4 weeks showed acupuncture to be effective in symptom control, but acupuncture decreased distal motor latency, and prednisolone did not.27 One acupuncture study with the puncture of PC-7 and PC-6 on the affected side demonstrated a positive response in 35 of 36 patients (14 of whom were previously treated unsuccessfully with surgery).28

## Ergonomics

There is insufficient epidemiological evidence that computer work causes CTS.4 Other studies have not demonstrated that work practices (other than high-force work, like that done by meatpackers) have a direct influence on CTS.29

## Nutrition

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin B Supplementation

The increased incidence of CTS since its initial description by Phalen in 1950 parallels the increased presence of pyridoxine antimetabolites (hydrazine dyes, isoniazid, hydralazine, dopamine, penicillamine, and oral contraceptives) in the environment as well as the intake of exces- sive protein. Ellis and coworkers30–32 demonstrated the efficacy of vitamin B 6 supplementation for CTS with 50 mg initially and increased to 200 to 300 mg. An even greater effect was seen when vitamins B 6 and B 2 were given together, possibly as a result of riboflavin-dependent enzymes, which convert pyridoxine to pyridoxal ′ -phosphate. Two random- ized controlled trials suggest that vitamin B 6 is no better than placebo; however, given its safety profile, vitamin B 6 can be considered in the treatment of CTS.33,34 Failure of vitamin B 6 supplementation to relieve CTS could be due to a lack of riboflavin or a genetic defect that does not allow sufficient levels of vitamin B 6 to be converted to the active P5P form.

<!-- chunk -->

## Medications

Steroid injection proximal to the carpal tunnel provides relief for up to 8 weeks, but 50% of those receiving the steroid injection require surgery within a year. Oral prednisolone (20 mg for 2 weeks, then mg for 2 weeks) provides short-term relief over 8 weeks. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and diuretics were found to provide no reduction in symptoms and should not be used because of their poten- tial side effects.35 No studies were found evaluating the use of the “natural” anti-in- flammatory medications (bromelain, curcumin, Boswellia, various oils). Remedies that address noninflammatory synovial fibrosis2 and vascular proliferation would theoretically be beneficial.

<!-- chunk -->

## Surgery

Surgery for CTS should not be considered before 6 months of more conservative treatment, but “In general, the management is surgery for persistent (not resolving after 1 year) or deteriorating (worsening clin- ically plus or minus deterioration on nerve conduction studies) CTS.” Surgery should not be delayed beyond 3 years. Open carpal tunnel release surgery is one of the most commonly performed outpatient sur- geries and is less expensive than endoscopic procedures. The abstract in the review of the Cochrane Library36 reports no difference in long- term results between the procedures, but pain is reduced during the first 2 weeks after endoscopic surgery compared with open procedures. Surgery with early mobilization,19 surgery with oral homeopathic Arnica and topical Arnica ointment,37 and surgery with controlled cold therapy38 all showed benefits over surgery alone.

# THERAPEUTIC APPROACH FOR MILD/MODERATE

# IDIOPATHIC CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME

Approximately 50% of patients will improve spontaneously. Identify and reduce causes of strain and vibration, and prevent repeated trauma.

<!-- chunk -->

## Physical Medicine

Regular wrist stretching, yoga, and exercises. The key to these exercises is performing them several times daily and “breaking up” activi- ties that are strenuous and repetitive. Nerve/tendon gliding may be helpful. Splint. For moderate persistent CTS, full-time splinting in neutral is recommended. Splinting is less effective if it is not started within months of onset or if the splints are only worn at night. Acupuncture. PC-7 and PC-6 on the affected side should be needled. Laser acupuncture can be considered. Manipulation/deep-tissue mobilization. Manipulation for CTS can be very effective if a comprehensive manipulation protocol is uti- lized. In the short term, manipulation of the distal radial ulnar expansion/gapping and the “opponens roll maneuver” (Kalten- born) to increase the length of the transverse carpal ligament are very effective. Some musculoskeletal etiological factors must be considered to understand the effectiveness of manipulation procedures.

## 1205CHAPTER 156 Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

The distal radioulnar joint is functionally a homologue of the ankle mortice joint. During the late midstance phase of gait with full dor- siflexion, the tibia and the fibula have to separate due to the width of the talus. A joint restriction that prevents this from happening causes an adaptation that leads to looser (hypermobile) tarsal joints and a pronated foot. The same process occurs in the wrist. During dorsiflexion of the wrist, the radius and ulna must also separate to accommodate the shape of the carpals. A joint restriction that does not allow for this separation or gap- ping also leads to hypermobile carpal joints that are the support structure for the carpal tunnel. The mechanical support for the carpal tunnel fails, leading to the collapse of the roof of the car- pal tunnel, which is the transverse carpal ligament. The trans- verse carpal ligament mechanically rests on the median nerve, which leads to the symptoms of CTS. It should also be noted that if atrophy is prevalent during CTS examination, there is a high probability that the median nerve axon distal to the tun- nel has undergone Wallerian degeneration (the axon has died). Any treatment modality at this point requires that the axon must regrow to reinnervate the distal structures. This regrowth process could take a minimum of 2 to 3 months, and the first sensation that would return would be pain. This, I believe, is why many research studies fail to show significant effectiveness in the treat- ment of CTS. In addition to the previously mentioned treatment protocols, a comprehensive treatment must also include the entire upper extremity, the upper thoracic spine, and the lower cervical spine. In her editorial, a second commentary on “Multifocal Neuropathy: Expanding the Scope of Double Crush Syndrome,” Catherine Cur- tin, MD, uses a new term called multifocal neuropathy. The dou- ble-crush theory as theorized by Upton and McComas in Lancet in 1973 stated that a peripheral nerve may only develop symptom- ology if there is more than one compression site along the length of the entire nerve. Curtin stated that treatment should include metabolic, postural, and secondary entrapments for effective treat- ment to occur. One omission that has led to much controversy and misunderstanding concerning the double-crush theory or the new term multifocal neuropathy is mechanical traction of the nerve. All studies and articles have focused on entrapment or compression and fail to recognize the effect of mechanical traction on nervous tissue, which could cause continuous firing of pain fibers. As noted in Curtin’s editorial, postural changes should be a part of any CTS treatment. Manipulation and postural exercise would be the best treat- ment to effect this change. A review of the National University of Health Sciences (NUHS) Postgraduate Neuroanatomy Study Guide (National University of Health Sciences, Lombard, IL), reveals that the C5, C6, and C7 nerve roots; first rib; scalenes; pectoralis minor; three different sites at the elbow; and the carpal tunnel (10 sites) can all be affected by compression, entrapment, or mechan- ical nerve traction. Therefore effective carpal treatment should include all the tissues and joints along the path of the median nerve. Contrast hydrotherapy. Immerse for 3 minutes in hot water followed by a 30-second immersion in cold water three to five times daily. Heat alone is contraindicated.


All sources of hydrazines should be avoided. All foods containing yellow dyes should be avoided. Daily protein intake should be limited to a maximum of 0.75 g/kg body weight.


• Pyridoxine: 50 to 200 mg/day: administer in divided dosages of 25 to 50 mg two to four times a day • If no response to pyridoxine, pyridoxal ′ -phosphate: 10 mg two to four times a day • Riboflavin: 5 to 10 mg/day

## Zonulin

Zonulin is a protein modulator of intercellular tight junctions. It has been shown to induce a significant and reversible increase in gastrodu- odenal and small intestinal permeability and is involved in tolerance/ immune response balance. The hybridization of wheat to dramatically increase gluten (gliadin) content and its overconsumption, multiple times a day, every day, in the typical diet, chronically disrupts this toler- ance/immune response balance. Zonulin release is stimulated by con- tact with gliadin (alpha-gliadin is the most effective). The enterocytes that release zonulin occur in the jejunum and distal ileum but not in the colon. When exposed to gliadin, zonulin receptor-positive IEC6 and Caco2 cells release zonulin, leading to the rearrangement of the cell cytoskeleton, loss of occluding-ZO1 protein–protein interaction, and increased intestinal permeability to macromolecules.7 Chemokine receptor CXCR3 is the receptor for specific gliadin peptides that cause zonulin release and a subsequent increase in intestinal permeability (Fig. 157.3). In vitro research with chemokine receptor CXCR3 transfectants found that several peptides, especially 33-mer, from gliadin bind to the receptor. Zonulin and CXCR3 are overexpressed in the intestinal mucosa of patients with celiac disease and autoimmune disease. Human zonulin was discovered to be prehaptoglobin-2 (pre-HP2) and was known in earlier research as an “inactive” precursor for HP2. Haptoglobin, identified as a marker of inflammation several decades ago, is an α 2–globulin found in human plasma at a concentration of 82 to 236 mg/dL. It is an acute-phase plasma protein whose primary role appears to be to bind the free hemoglobin released when erythro- cytes are damaged, thus decreasing the oxidative damage of the freed iron. It is composed of four polypeptide chains: two α chains and two β chains connected by disulfide bridges. Human haptoglobin occurs primarily as three major phenotypes: HP1-1, HP2-1, and HP2-2. The phenotypes are differentiated by the presence of an α 1 chain (HP1-1) or an α 2 chain (HP2-2) with a combination of α 1 and α 2 chains dis- tinguishing HP2-1. Gliadin causes the release of zonulin in the 80% of the population with HP2. Although HP1-1 has a much lower chance of an immu- nological reaction, the probability is still not zero. There is growing recognition of the nonimmunological reaction to wheat, which is identified as nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS).

## Pathogenesis

Celiac disease appears to have a genetic etiology because it is associated with specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules—HLA-DQ2 in 95% of patients and DQ8 in the remainder. These gene loci are believed to be linked to the immunological recognition of antigens and specific T-cell–regulated immune responses. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathogene- sis of celiac disease. Currently, the most likely relates to abnormalities in the immune response rather than some “toxic” property of gliadin. Sensitization to gliadin occurs both in humoral and cell-mediated immunity, and it appears that T-cell dysfunction is the main factor responsible for the enteropathy.6 A number of circulating antibodies that are specific for celiac disease, particularly antiendomysial antibody Fig. 157.3 Gliadin release of zonulin to open tight junctions and activate immune system.

(AEA), have been identified. These serological markers have been used successfully to screen patients and to estimate the true prevalence of celiac disease in the general population. The discovery that tissue trans- glutaminase (tTG) is the autoantigen for AEA led to the development of an improved enzyme-linked assay using recombinant tTG, which has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific for celiac disease. Tissue transglutaminase is a ubiquitous, predominantly cytoplasmic enzyme that can be released extracellularly, particularly in response to tissue wounding and stress. The observation that anti-tTG antibody titers fall and can become undetectable during a gluten-free diet suggests that tTG–gliadin complexes stimulate gluten-specific T cells to induce anti- tTG antibody production. T and B cells likely recognize different parts of this antigen complex, with T cells reacting to the smaller gliadin pep- tides and B cells responding to the larger tTG enzyme.6 Interestingly, breastfeeding appears to have a prophylactic effect, and breastfed babies have a decreased risk of developing celiac dis- ease.8,9 The reduced risk of celiac disease was even more pronounced in infants who continued to be breastfed after dietary gluten was intro- duced. Not surprisingly, the risk of celiac disease was greater when glu- ten was introduced in the diet in large amounts than when introduced in small or medium amounts. The early introduction of cow’s milk is also believed to be a major etiological factor.10 Research in the past few years has clearly indicated that breastfeeding and delayed administra- tion of cow’s milk and cereal grains are primary preventive steps that can greatly reduce the risk of the development of celiac disease.

# CLINICAL ASPECTS

The histological lesions of celiac disease are often indistinguishable from changes caused by tropical sprue, food allergy, diffuse intesti- nal lymphoma, and viral gastroenteritis. Furthermore, celiac disease often leads to the development of multiple food allergies; disaccha- ridase deficiency, causing lactose intolerance; and increased intesti- nal permeability.11 Improving nutritional status, even something as simple as taking a multiple B vitamin, appears to produce significant improvement in quality of life in patients with celiac disease. In one double-blind study, 65 patients with celiac disease who were on a strict gluten-free diet for several years were randomized to a daily dose of 0.8 mg folic acid, 0.5 mg cyanocobalamin, and 3 mg pyridoxine or placebo for 6 months.12 After vitamin supplementation, homocyste- ine levels dropped a median of 34%, accompanied by a significant improvement in well-being, notably anxiety and depressed mood. Celiac disease exhibits a range of clinical presentations (Fig. 157.4). Atypical celiac disease involves gluten-sensitive enteropathy that man- ifests only as extraintestinal signs and symptoms such as short stat- ure, anemia, and osteoporosis. Silent celiac disease also involves fully expressed gluten enteropathy, but patients are asymptomatic, and the diagnosis is typically discovered after serological testing. A com- bination of serological, genetic, and histological data has led to the identification of latent celiac disease (normal-villus architecture on a gluten-containing diet but have had or will have gluten-sensitive villus atrophy) as well as potential celiac disease (elevated gluten antibodies but negative intestinal biopsy).

## Associated Conditions

Perhaps the most significant condition associated with celiac disease is an early death. A landmark study looked at almost 30,000 patients between 1969 and 2008 and examined deaths in four groups: those with full-blown celiac disease, those with inflammation of the intestine but not full-blown celiac disease, those with latent celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, and a control group with no evidence of celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.13 The findings were significant: compared with the control group, there was a 39% increased risk of death in those with celiac disease, 72% increased risk in those with gut inflammation related to gluten, and 35% increased risk in those with gluten sensitivity but no celiac disease. A review article lists 55 health conditions linked to celiac disease and gluten sensitivity, including irritable bowel disease, inflammatory bowel disease, anemia, migraines, epilepsy, fatigue, canker sores, oste- oporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, and almost all other autoimmune diseases.14 Thyroid abnormalities, insulin-de- pendent diabetes mellitus, psychiatric disturbances (including schizo- phrenia), dermatitis herpetiformis, and urticaria have also been linked to gluten intolerance.1 A more ominous association is the increased risk for malignant neoplasms seen in celiac patients, especially for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.15 The hypothesis that gluten is a contrib- uting factor in some cases of schizophrenia is substantiated by epide- miological, clinical, and experimental studies.16–19 Pepsin hydrolysates of wheat gluten have demonstrated opioid activity. This activity is believed to be the factor responsible for the association between wheat consumption and schizophrenia. Gluten sensitivity has also been weakly linked to mood scores, cognitive impairment, and autism.20–22 The effects of gut inflammation associated with altered permea- bility are not restricted to the digestive system. For example, animal models of type 1 diabetes have shown that intestinal permeability, with IgA EMA or tTG antibody positive Intestinal mucosal abnormality Classic celiac disease Atypical celiac disease Silent celiac disease Latent celiac disease Healthy individual Genetic susceptibility HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 Fig. 157.4 The spectrum of celiac disease.

resultant inflammation, plays a role in the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet cells. There appears to be a link between antibodies to Glo-3a (a wheat-related protein), zonulin up-regulation, and islet cell autoimmunity in children at increased risk for type 1 diabetes.23 In individuals who went on to develop type 1 diabetes, elevated serum zonulin was detected in 70% of subjects during the pre–type 1 diabetes phase and preceded the onset of disease by 3.5 ± 0.9 years.24 Increased lactulose permeability (with normal mannitol) appears to precede the detectable clinical onset of disease, suggesting that the small intestine participates in the pathogenesis of the disease. The composition of the gut microbiota combined with gluten intake affects intestinal integ- rity, which affects the development of diabetes (Fig. 157.5). Zonulin is also associated with the development and/or progres- sion of chronic inflammatory lung and neurological disease. The blockade of zonulin reduces the severity of acute lung injury by reducing capillary leak, diminishing the accumulation of polymor- phonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in the interstitial and alveolar com- ponents, and attenuating levels of proinflammatory mediators.25 There is some evidence that the expression of zonulin correlates with the aggressiveness of gliomas and may indicate the degree of distur- bance of the blood-brain barrier and the walls of the blood vessels.26


As an initial screening for celiac disease, serological tests are an excellent starting point, and they may be followed by a biopsy of the small intestine for a definitive diagnosis. Before the introduc- tion of highly sensitive and specific serological markers, endoscopy with jejunal biopsy was the definitive diagnostic procedure. To fully understand a patient’s response to gluten, the key laboratory tests are haptoglobin type, serum zonulin, HLA type, antibodies to wheat proteins, and antiself antibodies. Of these serological mark- ers, the test for human antitissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA anti-tTG) is the most widely used, primarily owing to a lower cost compared with antiendomysium (IgA EMA) and a greater sensi- tivity compared with antigliadin antibodies (AGAs). IgA EMA can detect celiac disease with a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 99%, respectively. Anti-tTG also has a high sensitivity (99%) and specificity (>90%) for identifying celiac disease. An equivocal result on tTG testing should be followed by IgA EMA. With IgA EMA test- ing, it is recommended that a total serum IgA level be checked in parallel because celiac patients with IgA deficiency may be unable to produce the antibodies on which these tests depend, leading to a false-negative result. Genetic tests for HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 have poor positive pre- dictive value but are considered up to 100% sensitive and are therefore able to assist in ruling out celiac disease. The progression of an immunological reaction to gliadin to autoimmune disease appears to be dependent on several factors, especially HLA class. Endoscopy/gastroscopy and biopsy should still be performed if clinically warranted.

## 1211CHAPTER 157 Celiac Disease


Once the diagnosis has been established, a gluten-free diet is indicated. This diet should not contain any wheat, rye, barley, triticale, or oats. Species falling in the genus Triticum are almost certain to be harmful to gliadin-sensitive patients. Although the hybridization of wheat to higher concentrations of gluten has clearly aggravated the problem, this does not mean that so-called “ancient” wheats are safe for those who react to gliadin. Triticum spelta (spelt or spelta), Triticum poloni- cum (Polish wheat or kamut), and Triticum monococcum (einkorn or small spelt) still contain gliadin and must also be avoided. They may be acceptable in modest dosages for those who are wheat intolerant but do not react immunologically. Buckwheat and millet are often excluded as well. Although buckwheat is not in the grass family, and millet appears to be more closely related to rice and corn, buckwheat and millet contain prolamines with similar antigenic activity to the alpha-gliadin of wheat. In addition, other foods should be rotated, and milk and milk products should be eliminated until the patient’s intestinal structure and function return to normal.

## Patient Response

Usually, clinical improvement will be apparent within a few days or weeks (30% respond within 3 days, another 50% within 1 month, and 10% within another month). However, 10% of patients respond only after 24 to 36 months of gluten avoidance.1 If the patient does not appear to respond, the following should be considered: • The diagnosis is incorrect. • The patient is not adhering to the diet or is being exposed to hidden sources of gliadin. • There is an associated disease or complication, such as zinc defi- ciency. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has strict crite- ria and labeling requirements for food manufacturers to label a food “gluten-free.” However, even with this assurance, it seems that many people on a gluten-free diet are ingesting enough gluten in their diets to cause issues. Eating as little as 10 mg of gluten is enough to cause issues in some especially sensitive individuals, whereas most patients with celiac disease can tolerate up to 100 mg per day. A detailed anal- ysis to determine the amount of gluten consumed by measuring the level of gluten in the stool and urine in people with celiac disease and those without celiac disease who were following a gluten-free diet.27 The results showed that the average inadvertent exposure to gluten by people with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet was estimated to be between 150 and 400 mg/d using the stool test and between 300 and 400 mg/d using the urine test. These results indicate that patients with celiac disease, as well as those with gluten sensitivity or intolerance, should be on a gluten-digesting enzyme (discussed later in the chap- ter) as well as a gluten-free diet. Clinical trials with gluten-digesting enzymes combined with a gluten-free diet show a statistically signifi- cant, dose-dependent reduction in the severity and frequency of symp- toms as well as improved intestinal biopsy results in patients with mild to moderate celiac disease. Multivitamin/multimineral supplementation in patients with celiac disease appears indicated. In addition to treating any underly- ing deficiency, supplementation provides the necessary cofactors for growth and repair. OCTN2, the specific carnitine receptor, has been found in intestinal cells and is decreased in patients with celiac disease compared with normal subjects. A randomized, double-blind-ver- sus-placebo parallel study evaluated the effect of L-carnitine treatment on fatigue in adult patients with celiac disease.28 The results showed that fatigue was significantly reduced in the L-carnitine group, and because L-carnitine is involved in muscle energy production, its decreased absorption due to OCTN2 reduction might explain mus- cular symptoms in patients with celiac disease. Other potential nutri- tional deficiencies include iron, zinc, calcium, copper, fat-soluble vitamins, and dietary fiber. Celiac disease is refractive to dietary ther- apy if an underlying zinc deficiency is present.29

## Pancreatic Enzymes

Low fecal elastase-1, a marker for pancreatic insufficiency, is common among individuals with celiac disease. Even when following a glu- ten-free diet, celiac patients with chronic diarrhea are likely to have low fecal elastase. The effect of pancreatic enzyme substitution therapy in the 2 months after the initial diagnosis of celiac disease (gluten enteropathy) was inves- tigated in one double-blind study. The study sought to clarify the benefit of pancreatic enzyme therapy because previous studies had shown pan- creatic insufficiency in 8% to 30% of patients with celiac disease. In this study, patients followed a gluten-free diet, the standard treatment for celiac disease, and received either two capsules of pancreatic enzymes with each meal (6–10 capsules a day with each capsule containing lipase 5000 IU, amylase 2900 IU, and protease 330 IU) or two placebo capsules with meals. Complete nutritional and anthropomorphic evaluations were conducted at days 0, 30, and 60. Results indicated that pancreatic enzyme supplementation enhances the clinical benefit of a gluten-free diet during the first 30 days but does not provide any greater benefit than the placebo after 60 days. These results support the use of pancre- atic enzyme preparations in the first 30 days after a diagnosis of celiac disease30 (see Chapter 100 for a complete discussion). Alternatively, a superior choice to pancreatic enzymes is enzyme preparations containing glutenases. A mixture of two gluten-spe- cific recombinant proteases (Latiglutenase) that degrades gluten proteins into small, physiologically irrelevant fragments has been shown to mitigate gluten-induced intestinal mucosal injury as well as effect symptomatic improvements in clinical trials, and it is par- ticularly effective in patients with celiac disease who remain sero- positive despite a gluten-free diet; however, this preparation is not currently available commercially.27 Two options with confirmed glutenase activity are available: prolyl endopeptidase from genet- ically modified Aspergillus niger (AN-PEP) and dipeptidyl pepti- dase IV (DPP-IV) from Aspergillus oryzae. Of the two, AN-PEP is the most effective in degrading gluten more completely, including the immunogenic epitopes.31 (See Chapter 95 for a comprehensive discussion.) DPP-IV targets both gliadin and casein (milk protein) and is resistant to breakdown by other digestive enzymes. DPP-IV is thought to be one of the key enzymes responsible for the diges- tion of these proteins and is known to be found in lower amounts in the intestinal mucosa of individuals with celiac disease and also to have an inverse correlation with the level of mucosal damage among those with as well as without celiac disease. The lower the DPP-IV, the more significant the damage to the intestinal lining. Preparations containing DPP-IV are often recommended to safe- guard against any hidden sources of gluten. They are not a substitu- tion for a gluten-free diet.32


The therapeutic approach is straightforward: eliminate all sources of gliadin (see Appendix 6), eliminate dairy products initially, correct

underlying nutritional deficiencies, treat any associated conditions, and determine and eliminate all food allergens. If the patient does not begin to respond within 1 month, reconsider the diagnosis and search for hidden sources of gliadin. The discovery of the zonulin pathway enables an opportunity for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications to be developed. The strategy to facilitate repair of the damaged intestinal mucosa involves three steps: (1) stop the damage by avoiding known gastrointesti- nal toxins, (2) reestablish a healthy microbial flora, and (3) stimu- late regeneration. In addition, reestablishing the zonulin-dependent intestinal barrier function may provide a mechanism by which pro- cesses such as autoimmune disease, inflammatory conditions, and neoplastic disorders may be halted in their development and possibly reversed. There is interesting evidence supporting the use of the zonulin inhibitor AT1001 in the prevention of autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and celiac disease. Pretreatment with AT1001 has been shown to prevent the loss of intestinal barrier function, the appearance of auto-antibodies, and the onset of disease and protected against the insult of pancreatic islets and, therefore, of the insulitis responsible for the onset of T1D.33 The protective effects of AT1001 were also demon- strated in a small study of 20 patients on a gluten-free diet randomized to a 3-day AT1001 treatment (12 mg once daily) or placebo with a 2.5-g oral gluten challenge on the second day.34 In the placebo group, a significant 70% increase in intestinal permeability was observed after gluten challenge compared with no changes in permeability in the AT1001-treated group. In addition, AT1001 has been shown to reduce proinflammatory cytokine production and gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with celiac disease exposed to gluten.35 The maintenance of a strict gluten-free diet is difficult in the United States because of the ubiquitous distribution of gliadin and other activators of celiac disease in processed foods. Patients must be encouraged to read labels carefully to avoid hidden sources of gliadin, as it is found in some brands of soy sauce, modified food starch, ice cream, soup, beer, wine, vodka, whiskey, and malt. Patients should also be encour- aged to consult resources for patient education and information on gluten-free recipes. Supplemental glutenases may be helpful to off- set a low level of inadvertent gluten ingestion but are not a substitute for a gluten-free diet.

## Human Papillomavirus

Papillomaviruses are small DNA viruses around 50 to 55 nm. They are nonenveloped viruses. Papillomaviruses are found in not just humans but also cats, rabbits, and nonhuman primates. Papillomaviruses have an affinity for skin and mucous membranes (genitals, mouth, larynx, and esophagus). The DNA specifics of papillomavirus are summarized in Leto’s 2011 review article.13 The human papillomavirus can be classified into cutaneous, muco- sal, cutaneous and/or mucosal, and cutaneous associated with epi- dermodysplasia verruciformis.13 For the purpose of this section, only the mucosal will be discussed. There are 40 HPV mucosal types rang- ing in number from 6 to 114. High-risk types 16 and 18 are found approximately 70% of the time in cervical cancer and 50% of the time in CIN3.13 Other high-risk HPV types include 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73, and 82.13–15 There are four types that are possi- bly high risk: 26, 53, 67, and 70.15 And there are 12 low-risk types for carcinogenesis: 6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81, and CP6108.14,15 Women can be infected with more than one type of HPV, and the highest incidence of this is with younger women at the peak of their sexual activity or women with an impaired immune response.14,15 According to a 1999 study, 99.7% of cervical cancer is associated with long-term persistent HPV infection (usually HPV type 16 or 18), which is easily transmitted by genital-to-genital contact.16 The time from exposure to the appearance of a lesion or an abnormal Pap smear can range from a few weeks to decades (Fig. 158.1). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that nearly 80 million Americans are currently infected with HPV. About 14 million people in the United States become infected each year.17 For most people (9 out of 10), the HPV infections will resolve without intervention within 2 years.3,17 This suggests that the host immunity is able to defend against the development of clinical disease and that HPV infections are often transient and result in minor manifestations such as ASC-US. For other individuals, especially women, HPV results in a clinical expression to which the host immune response has not been able to respond effectively. The result is clinical disease that can include flat or raised genital warts; cervical, vaginal, vulvar, or perianal dysplasias; or progression to invasive cancers of the same site.17 The first step in the development of dysplasias or invasive cancers is viral entry. A complex interaction of host immunity, viral load, viral type, and host susceptibil- ity determines the natural course of the disease.

## Histological Considerations

The principal reservoir of HPV is the moist mucosa and the cutaneous epithelial tissue in adjacent areas. Ninety-five percent of cervical dysplasias and cancers originate in the squamocolumnar junction of the cervical os.11 In adolescence, glandular epithelium covers much of the exocervix, but as adolescence progresses, the columnar epithelium is gradually replaced by squamous cells. This actively growing area seems to be more susceptible to multiple insults and HPV, probably because of the metaplastic nature of the conversion process and the inflammatory process of metaplasia.

## Dysplasia/Cancera

aThe actual values for the absolute risk of the various risk factors are as yet somewhat controversial. The numbers listed here represent the author’s summarization of the literature. These risks are not linearly additive because they are usually closely related; more extensive multivariant analysis will be necessary to determine the actual relative risk of each. ABC Fig. 158.1 Timeline of cervical cancer progression. (a) Human papillomavirus (HPV) infects the basal cells of the cervical epithelium (dark blue) exposed by wounding, leading to cytological abnormalities. Expression of viral oncogenes E6/E7 accompanies malignant transformation. (b) HPV infection pathway. After viral entry, viral replication is synchronous with host cellular DNA replication. Integrated and episomal viral DNA produce E6 and E7 oncoproteins. E6 targets p53 for degradation and prevents apoptosis, whereas E7 inactivates retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressors, promoting cell-cycle progression. The end result of these processes is cellular transformation. HPV infection also alters the transcription of host microRNAs. (c) Samples for detection of HPV E6/E7 mRNA or host microRNA.

## Sexual Transmission

Early age at first intercourse, multiple sexual contacts without the use of condoms, or both are associated with an increased risk of cervical dysplasia/carcinoma.11,12 From this and other evidence, it has been suggested that cervical cancer is a sexually transmitted disease in the sense that the implicated infectious agent, HPV, is easily transmitted by genital-to-genital contact. Because the time from exposure to the appearance of a lesion can range from weeks to decades, it is almost impossible to identify individuals who transmit the virus.17 Genital-to-oral transmission is suggested to be possible owing to the detection of HPV types 6, 11, and 16 in some oropharyngeal can- cers, but oral HPV lesions are in fact rare. Nonsexual exposure to the virus may occur from examination tables, doorknobs, tanning beds, and other inanimate objects, but it is difficult to document and prove. Other infectious agents such as herpes simplex, Chlamydia, and HIV may serve as cofactors for HPV. These agents may alter cervical immunity, contrib- ute to inflammation, facilitate entry of HPV into the basal cells, accelerate the replication of HPV in the host cell nucleus, and coexist with HPV infection.

## Smoking

A significant risk factor for cervical cancer and cervical dysplasia is cigarette smoking: smokers have an approximately threefold increased incidence compared with nonsmokers (one study18 showed the increase to be as high as seventeenfold in women ages 20–29).18–21 Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this association: • Smoking may depress immune function, allowing a sexually trans- mitted agent to promote abnormal cellular development, leading to the onset of cervical dysplasia. • Smoking induces vitamin C deficiency, and vitamin C levels are sig- nificantly depressed in smokers.22 • Cervical cells may concentrate nicotine. • There may be unrecognized associations between smoking and sex- ual behavior.18–21

## Oral Contraceptives

Earlier studies suggested that the use of oral contraceptives (OCs) increased the risk of cervical neoplasia, both the invasive and precan- cerous types. More recent studies controlled for sexual history have not confirmed this association. Three large, well-controlled studies looked at invasive cervical cancer and OC use and did not find statistically sig- nificant associations compared with women who never used OCs.23–25 There was no overall change in the risk of invasive cervical cancer; however, one of the three studies23 found a modestly increased risk in long-term users of OCs. The other two studies failed to find a signifi- cantly increased risk of invasive cervical cancer even with long-term OC use. Two other studies assessed OC use and the risk of cervical dys- plasia, and neither found any statistically significant associations.26,27 A more disturbing aspect is that OC use has been associated with an increased incidence of adenocarcinoma, a rare cancer of the cervix. This is a less common variant of squamous cervical cancer. It appears that the incidence of this disease has increased over the past several decades, whereas the incidence of invasive squamous cervical cancer has decreased since the OC pill was introduced. Two studies found a modest but sta- tistically significant increased risk of invasive cervical adenocarcinoma in women who had used OCs for more than 12 years.24,28 OCs are known to potentiate the adverse effects of cigarette smok- ing and to decrease the levels of numerous nutrients, including vita- mins C, B 6 , and B 12 as well as folic acid, riboflavin, and zinc.29

## Toxicant Exposure

A study evaluating the effect of depleted uranium weapons used in the Balkan war on the incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) found that the incidence of precancerous lesions of the cervix in areas near the borders of former Yugoslavia may be influenced by environmental factors such as exposure to depleted uranium due to the bombings.30 Compared with histologically normal tissues, endo- metrial cancer, hyperplasia, and CIN revealed significantly increased levels of toxic metals (Cd and Pb), an altered status of Cu and Mn, and an elevated Cu:Zn ratio.31 Xenoestrogens are environmental estrogens that have endocrine effects, acting as both estrogen agonists and antagonists. In human cer- vical cancer cells (HeLa cells), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) variably but significantly suppressed bcl-2 protein expression.32 DDT has also been shown to mimic estradiol stimulation of breast can- cer cells. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, because in vitro effects cannot be reliably extrapolated to chronic, low- dose exposure in vivo effects.


A follow-up Pap test is used to determine what course of action is needed. Many cases of mild cervical dysplasia (ASC-US, LSILs) will go away spontaneously. The median time required for progression from cervical dysplasia to carcinoma in situ ranges from 86 months for LSIL to 12 months for HSIL. In LSIL, the natural approaches provided in this chapter can be followed with a follow-up Pap smear and colpos- copy at 3 months. If colposcopy finds abnormal tissue, endocervical curettage may be appropriate. Prescribing a patient diagnosed with HSIL a colposcopy with endocervical curettage is recommended.


Numerous nutritional factors have been implicated as cofactors in the development of cervical dysplasia. Although many single nutrients may play a significant role (particularly beta-carotene and retinoids, folate, pyridoxine, and vitamin C), it is important to recognize that a large proportion (67%) of patients with cervical cancer have multi- ple nutrient deficiencies or abnormal anthropometric measurements. Significant abnormalities have been found in height-to-weight ratios, triceps skin-fold thickness, midarm muscle circumference, serum albumin levels, total iron-binding capacity, hemoglobin levels, creat- inine height index, prothrombin time, and lymphocyte count. Many other patients have marginal but “normal” nutritional status as deter- mined by these cursory evaluations,33 suggesting that multiple nutrient deficiencies are probably the rule rather than the exception. Vitamin assessment by biochemical evaluation (plasma and red cell folate; serum beta-carotene; vitamins A, B 12 , and C; erythrocyte transketolase for thiamine determination; erythrocyte glutathione reductase for riboflavin determination; and erythrocyte aspartate transaminase for pyridoxine determination) in patients with untreated cervical cancer shows that at least one abnormal vitamin level was present in 67% of patients, whereas 38% displayed multiple abnormal parameters.34 There is a correlation between elevated total plasma homocysteine levels (>9.12 mumol/L) and cervical dysplasia.35 Because homocyste- ine levels are influenced by folate status, this may be an indirect way to determine whether there may be a folate deficiency. General dietary factors are also important. A high fat intake has been associated with an increased risk for cervical cancer, whereas a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is believed to offer significant pro- tection against carcinogenesis, probably owing to the higher intake of fiber, beta-carotene, and vitamin C.20 Total serum carotene and tocopherol levels and their association with dietary intakes and the risk of newly diagnosed CIN and invasive cervical cancer were evaluated in a case-control study in Brazil.36 Increasing concentrations of serum

lycopene were negatively associated with CIN 1, CIN 3, and cervical cancer. Increasing concentrations of serum alpha and gamma tocoph- erols and higher dietary intakes of dark green and deep yellow vegeta- bles/fruits were associated with nearly 50% decreased risk of CIN 3. In another case-control study, 239 women with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix from the tumor registry in Buffalo, New York, completed a questionnaire, whereby researchers investigated the relationships between intakes of selected dietary nutrients and food groups and risk of cervical cancer.37 Significant reductions in risk of cervical cancer of approximately 40% to 60% were observed for women in the highest versus the lowest tertiles of dietary fiber, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin A, α -carotene, beta-carotene, lutein, and folate. A 2003 study also suggests a lower antioxidant status (in this case coenzyme Q 10 [CoQ 10 ] and tocopherols) was seen in patients with var- ious grades of CIN and cervical cancer compared with controls.38


Several key individual supplements are discussed later, but a combi- nation of products may work best. One study showed that multiple vitamin and mineral formulas, vitamins A and E, and calcium were significantly associated with a lower risk of cervical cancer and a lower HPV viral load.39 The study enrolled 1096 women between the ages of 18 and 65 and included 328 HPV-positive women, 166 controls, women with CIN 1, and 72 women with CIN 2 or 3. Multiple vitamins and minerals, vitamins A and E, and calcium were significantly associ- ated with a lower risk of CIN 2 or 3. The patients who took the multiple vitamins and minerals had a lower HPV viral load and a significantly decreased frequency of CIN 1.

## Vitamin A and Beta-Carotene

A minor association appears to exist between dietary retinoids and the risk of cervical cancer or dysplasia as well as a strong inverse cor- relation between beta-carotene intake and the risk of cervical can- cer or dysplasia.40–43 Although only 6% of patients with untreated cervical cancer have below-normal serum vitamin A levels, 38% have stage-related abnormal levels of beta-carotene.34 Low serum beta-carotene levels are associated with a threefold greater risk for severe dysplasia,42 and serum vitamin A and beta-carotene levels were found to be significantly lower in patients with cervical dyspla- sia than in a control group (54 vs. 104 mg/dL for vitamin A and 21.3 vs. 13.9 mcg/dL for beta-carotene).44,45 However, the serum levels of retinoic acid (vitamin A) may not be reflective of the cellular levels of retinoic acid,46,47 meaning even if the serum retinoic acid level is normal, it may still be low in the cervical tissue. Response rates to intervention with carotenoids have been inconsis- tent. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial composed of more than 100 women who used either 30 mg/day of beta-carotene or placebo,48 cervical biopsies were performed before treatment and after 6 and 24 months. Persistence of CIN 3 resulted in the patient’s removal from the study. Of the 124 women included, 21 were not randomized because they moved, became pregnant, or voluntarily withdrew or the pathological review of their initial cervical biopsies did not confirm CIN 2 or 3. Of the remaining 103 women, 33 experienced lesion regression, 45 had persistent or progressive disease, and 25 women did not com- plete the study and were considered nonresponders. The overall regression rate (32%) was similar between the beta- carotene and placebo arms and when stratified for CIN grade. HPV typing of 99 women showed that 77% were HPV positive and 23% HPV negative at enrollment. HPV-positive lesions were subdivided into indeterminate-, low-, and high-risk categories. The response rate was highest for women with no HPV detected (61%), lower for those ranked at indeterminate or low risk (30%), and lowest for those classified at high risk (18%). In conclusion, beta-carotene did not enhance the regression of high-grade CIN, especially in HPV-positive subjects.48 Other intervention studies also fared poorly for beta-carotene: • No difference in regression of CIN 1 lesions after 12 months with 30 mg of beta-carotene daily versus placebo49 • No regression of CIN lesions with 10 mg/day of beta-carotene ver- sus placebo50 • After 9 months, lower regression rates of CIN 1 to 3 with 30 mg/day beta-carotene versus placebo51 • Slightly increased progression of ASCUS and CIN 1 with 30 mg/day of beta-carotene versus no treatment52 However, naturopathically, carotenoids and retinols can offer sev- eral types of protection. They improve the integrity and function of the epithelial tissues, regulate cellular differentiation, provide antioxidant properties, and enhance immune system function (see Chapter 136).47 In an HPV-immortalized human ectocervical epithelial cell line, retinoids downregulated the cell proliferative activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression.53 Topical vitamin A was used in a study of 301 women who received either four consecutive 24-hour applications (using a collagen sponge in a cervical cap) of retinoid or placebo followed by two more applica- tions at 3 and 6 months. Retinoic acid increased the complete regres- sion rate of moderate dysplasia from 27% in the placebo group to 43% in the treatment group. The women with severe cervical dysplasia did not improve.54 In a University of Arizona study, vitamin A was delivered to 20 women via a cervical cap. In 10 of 20 women, cervical dysplasia completely disappeared. Of the 10 patients with a complete response, 5 had mild dysplasia, and 5 had moderate dysplasia.55 There were too few patients with severe dysplasia to be evaluated. Vitamin A suppositories have also been used as part of a multifac- torial treatment plan using oral folic acid, vitamin C, and carotenes with topical vitamin A suppositories and herbal vitamin supposito- ries. Other patients with more severe disease were treated with a top- ical “escharotic treatment.” This study of atypia, mild, moderate, and severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ comprised 43 women.56,57 Of these, 38 returned to a normal disease-free state, 3 had partial improve- ments, 2 stayed the same, and none progressed to a more severe state of dysplasia during the course of the natural treatment protocol. Newer research has illuminated a possible biochemical explanation for the improvements seen with retinoic acid and abnormal cervical cells.46,47 An enzyme that metabolizes retinoic acid (CYP26A1) was expressed in LSIL, HSIL, and cervical cancer. It was not present in nor- mal cervical epithelium. The authors theorized that the overexpression of CYP26A1 in the cervix may contribute to the development and pro- gression of cervical cell abnormalities.46,47 It seems that vitamin A, instead of beta-carotenes, may be a better recommendation for cervical dysplasia. With vitamin A (retinyl pal- mitate), it is important to watch for symptoms of excess, with the first usually being a low-grade headache. If this occurs, the vitamin A dos- age should be lowered or discontinued. As a reminder, vitamin A dos- ages in excess of 10,000 IU/d are not considered safe during pregnancy.


A significant decrease in vitamin C intake and plasma levels occurs in patients with cervical dysplasia, and it has been documented that inad- equate vitamin C intake is an independent risk factor for the devel- opment of premalignant cervical disease and carcinoma in situ.43,58,59 Vitamin C is known to do the following29: • Act as an antioxidant • Strengthen and maintain normal epithelial integrity • Improve wound healing

## Folate

Low folate levels are implicated in many cases of cervical dysplasia, although this link is less now with the widespread folic acid fortifica- tion of the food supply. When cervical cells lack folate, they become “macrocytic” in the same way as red blood cells (RBCs). Cervical cyto- logical abnormalities related to folate deficiency precede hematologic abnormalities by many weeks.60,61 Before fortification of the food sup- ply with folic acid, it was the most common vitamin deficiency in the world and was especially common in women who were pregnant or taking oral contraceptives (OCs).61,62 It is possible that many abnormal cytological smears in the past reflected folate deficiency rather than “true” dysplasia.52,54,61 Even with food fortification, folate is still a factor in many cases of cervical dysplasia. This observation is particularly applicable to patients taking OCs. It has been hypothesized that OCs induce a localized inter- ference with folate metabolism, and although serum levels may be increased, tissue levels at end-organ targets, such as the cervix, may be deficient.63,64 This is consistent with the observation that tissue status as measured by erythrocyte folate is typically decreased (especially in those with cervical dysplasia), whereas serum levels may be normal or even increased.65 OCs are believed to induce the synthesis of a macromol- ecule that inhibits folate uptake by cells. In controlled clinical studies in women with cervical dysplasia taking OCs, folic acid supplementa- tion (10 mg/day) has resulted in the improvement or normalization of Pap smears.63,66,67 Regression rates for patients with untreated cervical dysplasia are typically 1.3% for mild and 0% for moderate dysplasia. When patients were treated with folic acid, the regression-to-normal rate, as determined by colposcopy/biopsy examination, was observed to be 20% in one study,67 63.7% in another,66 and 100% in another.63 Furthermore, the progression rate of cervical dysplasia in untreated patients is typically 16% at 4 months, a figure matched in the placebo group in one study, whereas the folate-supplemented group had a 0% progression rate.64 These figures were achieved despite the fact that the women remained on OCs. Lower folate status has been shown to enhance the effect of the other risk factors for cervical dysplasia. For example, low RBC folate appears to be a major risk factor for HPV infection of the cervix.66–68 In particular, higher circulating concentrations of folate are inde- pendently associated with a lower likelihood of becoming positive for high-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs) and of having a per- sistent HR-HPV infection and a greater risk for HSIL. Vitamin B 12 supplementation should always accompany folate sup- plementation to rule out the possibility that the latter may be masking an underlying vitamin B 12 deficiency. In addition, women with higher concentrations of plasma folate who also had sufficient plasma vitamin B 12 had 70% lower odds of being diagnosed with cervical dysplasia.69

## Pyridoxine

Vitamin B 6 status, as determined by erythrocyte transaminase, is decreased in one third of patients with cervical cancer.70 Decreased pyridoxine status would have a significant effect on the metabolism of estrogens and tryptophan while also impairing the immune response.


Low selenium levels in the diet and blood have been reported to be significantly lower in patients with cervical dysplasia. In one study, sig- nificantly lower selenium and zinc levels were found in both HSIL and cervical cancer patients compared with the control group. The activity of the selenium-containing antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase was significantly lower in the patients with HSIL or cancer than with the control group, and total antioxidant ability decreased from the control group to those with CIN to those with cancer. Increased glu- tathione peroxidase activity resulting from increased selenium intake is believed to be the factor responsible for selenium’s anticarcinogenic effect, although other factors may be of equal significance.71 A 2002 study did not find a correlation with serum selenium (67.5– 185.0 ng/mL) levels and a relationship to invasive cervical cancer in 227 invasive cases, 127 in-situ cases, and 526 controls.72

## Copper:Zinc Ratio, Zinc, and Retinol

An increase in the serum copper:zinc ratio is a nonspecific reaction to inflammation or malignancy. In a study involving gynecological can- cer, it was suggested that the serum copper:zinc ratio “is clinically of utmost importance, since it constitutes a tool with which to establish the extent of the cancer.”73 A ratio above 1.95 indicated malignancy in 90% of the patients in that study. Elevated ratios are also seen in vari- ous conditions, including the following: • OC use • Pregnancy • Acute and chronic infections • Chronic liver disease • Inflammatory conditions Therefore the serum copper:zinc ratio should not be used to pre- dict malignancy in patients with these conditions. A decrease in avail- able zinc may explain why retinol-binding protein was either absent or undetectable in 80% of dysplastic tissue samples compared with 23.5% in normal tissue. A large study of 206 women found an inverse relationship between serum levels of both retinol and zinc and the inci- dence of cervical dysplasia.74

## Indole-3-Carbinol/Diindolylmethane

Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a phytochemical found in vegetables of the cabbage family. It is converted in the stomach to several com- pounds, including diindolylmethane (DIM). I3C and DIM are anti- oxidants and potent stimulators of natural detoxifying enzymes in the body. Studies have shown that increasing the intake of vegeta- bles of the cabbage family or taking I3C or DIM as a dietary sup- plement significantly increases the conversion of estrogen from cancer-producing forms to nontoxic breakdown products.75,76 The body breaks down estrogen in several ways. It can be converted into a substance called 16- α -hydroxyestrone, a compound that pro- motes estrogen-dependent cancer. Another method of breakdown produces 2-hydroxyestrone, which does not stimulate cancer cells. Women with HSIL have altered estrogen metabolism, with a higher level of 16- α hydroxyestrone and fewer 2-hydroxyestrogen metabo- lites than normal.77 Given the ability of I3C or DIM to improve estrogen metabolism and possibly exert anti-HPV activity, these agents are very good can- didates in the treatment of cervical dysplasia.76 Preliminary studies are very encouraging. In one double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 30 women with HSIL (biopsy-proved CIN 2 or 3), the women were given either 200 or 400 mg of I3C or a placebo for 12 weeks.77 In 4 of patients in the group who took 200 mg per day of I3C and 4 of 9 in the 400-mg group, there was complete regression of their severe dysplasia, compared with none of the placebo group. HPV was detected in 7 of 10 placebo patients, in 7 of 8 in the 200 mg/day group, and in 8 of 9 in the 400 mg/day group. DIM was used in another study of 64 patients with HSIL (biop- sy-proved CIN 2 or 3) who were scheduled for loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). The patients were randomized 2:1 to receive DIM at approximately 2 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks or placebo.

## 1218SECTION 6 Diseases

Although there was no statistically significant difference in any out- come between the DIM and placebo groups, the overall results with DIM showed an improved Pap smear in 49% (22 out of 45), with either a less severe abnormality or normal result. Colposcopy also improved in 25 subjects in the DIM group (56%).78

## Green Tea

Constituents of green tea, namely polyphenol E and epigallocate- chin-3-gallate (EGCG), have been effective against HPV-infected cer- vical cells and lesions in both laboratory and clinical studies. Green tea appears to induce apoptosis of HPV-infected cervical cells and also to arrest cell cycles, modify gene expression, and inhibit tumor formation.79,80 A clinical study confirmed these findings in patients through the use of either topical application via a green tea polyphenol ointment and/or oral ingestion of a green tea polyphenol capsule or an EGCG capsule. All treatment groups improved more than the placebo group (50%–75% vs. 10%), but those given the topical treatment improved most significantly.80

## Coriolus Versicolor

The Coriolus versicolor mushroom has a mucopolysaccharide and polysaccharide protein complex that composes its cell wall. These complexes are high in beta-glucans. Studies done with mucopolysac- charides indicate many beneficial health benefits, such as anticarcino- genic, immune-modulating, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory effects, to name a few.81 There have been at least three studies on C. versicolor and HPV.82–84 Unfortunately, no further details can be provided because the studies are all in Bulgarian. However, the Bogdanova study82 used Coriolus to study the ability to reverse the early stages of cervical cancer and reduce the risk factors of recurring HPV virus.

## Vaginal Depletion Pack

The vaginal depletion pack (or “vag pack”) has a long history of effec- tive use by naturopathic and eclectic physicians in the treatment of cervical dysplasia. Although its mechanism of action has not yet been elucidated, it is thought to work by promoting the sloughing of the superficial cervical cells, particularly those that are abnormal. It is effective as part of a multifactorial nutritional and topical treatment approach.56,57 (See Appendix 14 for a complete description of this technique.)

## Escharotic Treatment

The escharotic treatment is a topical herbal cryotherapy treatment of the cervix used to remove abnormal cells. It involves the use of zinc chloride mixed with Sanguinaria canadensis, a botanical. A full description of this protocol is given in Appendix 2. The escharotic treatment is especially indicated for CIN 2 and CIN 3, both HGSILs, but only when a satisfactory colposcopy has been performed by a cli- nician. In addition, the use of the escharotic treatment, rather than a LEEP or conization, must fall within the guidelines outlined under “Therapeutic Approach.” The escharotic treatment is best imple- mented twice a week, with 2 full days between treatments. The zinc chloride solution must be made by a compounding pharmacy as a prescription item. A 2009 case report involved a 20-year-old female with CIN 2, who refused conventional recommendation and instead received escharotic treatment twice weekly for 5 weeks and oral vitamins and botanicals. She had a complete reversal of the diagnosis at her 4-month and 10-month check-ups. She was followed for 5 years and remained negative for abnormal Pap smears.85A case report involving a 28-year- old female with CIN 3 who followed the same escharotic treatment protocol (as the 2009 case report) had similar results.86


Treatment of cervical dysplasia requires proper monitoring and coor- dination of care if one practitioner is doing the workup with colpos- copy/biopsies and another is proceeding with natural or integrated treatment approaches. The basic approach is to eliminate all factors known to be associated with cervical dysplasia and to optimize the patient’s nutritional status. In particular, smoking and OC use are eliminated, and the patient follows the supplementation program listed here. The guidelines provide further insight into the appropriate medical care of cervical dysplasia. A. Criteria for Naturopathic Protocol 1. ASC-US 2. ASC-US with documented HPV 3. ASC-H: endocervical curettage is negative or positive with a sat- isfactory colposcopy. 4. Low-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia: endocervical curettage is negative, with a satisfactory colposcopy. 5. High-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia: endocervical curettage is negative, with a satisfactory colposcopy. 6. ASC-H: endocervical curettage is positive, with a satisfactory colposcopy, but either the patient is at low risk for more serious disease, has a low-risk type of HPV, or even if the patient does not have low-risk HPV, the natural treatment protocol may be recommended at the discretion of the practitioner. 7. Low-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia: endocervical curettage is positive, with a satisfactory colposcopy, but either the patient is at low risk for more serious disease or has a low- risk type of HPV or the practitioner may recommend the natu- ral treatment protocol at his or her discretion. 8. High-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia: endocervical curettage is positive, with a satisfactory colposcopy, but the patient is at low risk, or even if not, the natural treatment pro- tocol may be recommended at the discretion of the practitioner and considered carefully after colposcopy, biopsies, and careful evaluation. 9. It is possible to treat carcinoma in situ in select cases, but this is definitely a judgment call and should be considered very carefully after colposcopy, biopsies, and careful fol- low-up. B. Referrals for Colposcopy With Biopsies 1. ASC-US if HPV DNA testing is positive for high-risk HPV; if no HPV testing is done, then the Pap test should be repeated twice at 4- to 6-month intervals. If HPV typing is negative for high-risk types, then the Pap test should be repeated in months. 2. ASC-H 3. Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions 4. High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions 5. Atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS); endometrial biopsy is needed as well. 6. Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS): endometrial biopsy is needed as well. 7. Pap smear diagnosis of microinvasion or frank invasion 8. Endometrial cells present in a postmenopausal woman; also calls for an endometrial biopsy even if the cells are benign.

## 1219CHAPTER 158 Cervical Dysplasia

9. A patient who may not follow through with the recommended follow-up Pap smear after an abnormal Pap result 10. Visible unknown cervical lesion regardless of the Pap smear test result 11. Initial examination of a DES daughter 12. Unexplained or persistent cervical bleeding 13. Vulvar condyloma with abnormal Pap test result 14. To be used for follow-up after treatment plan is completed, especially in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions C. Referrals for Conization or LEEP 1. Pap test results show more than one grade of dysplasia different from that seen on colposcopy or reported on in the biopsy. 2. Biopsy shows squamous intraepithelial lesions with three to four quadrants involved. 3. Unsatisfactory colposcopy with any degree of squamous intraepithelial lesions on biopsy 4. The patient may not be a good candidate for ongoing treatment and the closer follow-up required by alternative treatments. 5. No improvement in pathology with the initial naturopathic plan or repeated alternate plan 6. If AGUS is found on the Pap test and no disease is detected on colposcopy, biopsies and endocervical curettage are indicated. 7. If AIS is found on the Pap test and no disease is detected on colposcopy, biopsies and endocervical curettage are indicated. D. At the Discretion of the Practitioner and Patient 1. Positive endocervical curettage with any degree of squamous intraepithelial lesions. A more assertive approach is recommended. 2. High-risk patients: the last Pap test more than 1 year previ- ous, a history of genital warts, a history of cervical dysplasia, smokers, multiple sex partners with lack of safe-sex prac- tices. In these cases, a more proactive and assertive approach is recommended. E. Referral for Probable Hysterectomy 1. Microinvasive cervical cancer 2. Frank invasive cervical cancer 3. Adenocarcinoma

## 1221CHAPTER 159 Chronic Candidiasis

the digestive disturbance that is likely to be the underlying factor responsible for C. albicans overgrowth. In addition, the CDSA may determine that the symptoms are not related to C. albicans over- growth but, rather, to conditions such as SIBO and/or the leaky gut syndrome.

<!-- chunk -->

## Antibody and Antigen Levels

Another laboratory method to confirm the presence of C. albicans overgrowth is measuring the level of antibodies to Candida or the level of antigens in the blood.3,5 Although these tests are rarely necessary, some patients and physicians may desire confirmation that C. albicans is a responsible factor in the patient’s health equation. In this situation, blood studies can be helpful and may also be used as a way of moni- toring therapy.


A comprehensive approach is more effective in treating chronic can- didiasis than simply trying to kill C. albicans with a drug or natural anti–C. albicans agent. Drugs like nystatin, ketoconazole, and Diflucan, as well as various natural anti–C. albicans agents, rarely produce sig- nificant long-term results because they fail to address the underlying factors that promote C. albicans overgrowth. In many cases, it is use- ful to try to eradicate C. albicans from the system, preferably with the help of natural anti–C. albicans therapies such as timed-release caprylic acid preparations, enteric-coated volatile oil preparations, or fresh garlic preparations. A follow-up stool culture and C. albicans antigen determination will confirm if the C. albicans has been eliminated. If C. albicans has been eradicated but symptoms persist, the symptoms are unrelated to an overgrowth of C. albicans and may be caused by SIBO. In this scenario, pancreatic enzymes and berberine-containing plants like goldenseal can be helpful.


A number of dietary factors appear to promote the overgrowth of C. albicans. The most important factors are a high intake of sugar, milk and other dairy products, foods containing a high content of yeast or mold, and food allergies/sensitivities.

## Sugar

Sugar is the chief nutrient of C. albicans. It is well accepted that restric- tion of sugar intake is a necessity in the treatment of chronic candidia- sis. Most patients do well by avoiding refined sugar and large amounts of honey, maple syrup, and fruit juice.1–4

<!-- chunk -->

## Milk and Other Dairy Products

Several reasons to restrict or eliminate the intake of milk in patients with chronic candidiasis include the following: • High lactose content promotes the overgrowth of Candida. • Cow’s milk and dairy products are some of the most frequent food allergens. • Milk may contain trace levels of antibiotics, which can further dis- rupt the GI bacterial flora and promote Candida overgrowth.1–4

<!-- chunk -->

## Mold- and Yeast-Containing Foods

Many experts recommend that individuals with chronic candidiasis avoid foods with a high content of yeast or mold, including alcoholic beverages, cheeses, dried fruits, and peanuts. Although many patients with chronic candidiasis may be able to tolerate these foods, it is best to eliminate these foods from the diet until the situation is resolved.1–4

<!-- chunk -->

## Food Allergies

Food allergies are another common finding in patients with the yeast syndrome.3 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests, which deter- mine both immunoglobulin E– and immunoglobulin G–mediated food allergies, are often helpful in identifying food allergies.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hypochlorhydria

Gastric hydrochloric acid, pancreatic enzymes, and bile all inhibit the overgrowth of C. albicans and prevent its penetration into the absorptive surfaces of the small intestine. Decreased secretion of any of these important digestive components can lead to over- growth of C. albicans in the GI tract. Therefore the restoration of normal digestive secretions through the use of supplemental hydro- chloric acid, pancreatic enzymes, and substances that promote bile flow is critical in the treatment of chronic candidiasis. The CDSA can provide valuable information in identifying which factor is most important. People on antiulcer drugs, such as Tagamet (cimetidine) and Zantac (ranitidine), often develop C. albicans overgrowth in the stomach.6 This occurrence highlights the importance of hydrochloric acid in the preven- tion of C. albicans overgrowth. Restoring proper levels of gastric acid with supplemental hydrochloric acid is often useful in chronic candidiasis. Pancreatic enzymes can also be useful in the treatment of chronic candidiasis. As well as being necessary for protein digestion, prote- ases are responsible for keeping the small intestine free from parasites (including bacteria, yeast, protozoa, and intestinal worms).7,8 A lack of proteases or other digestive secretions greatly increases an individu- al’s risk of having an intestinal infection, including chronic C. albicans infections of the GI tract.

<!-- chunk -->

## Enhancing Immunity

Recurrent or chronic infections, including chronic candidiasis, are char- acterized by a depressed immune system. The cycle of chronic candi- diasis makes it difficult for individuals to overcome the condition (Fig. 159.2); a compromised immune system leads to infection, and infection leads to damage of the immune system, further weakening resistance. The importance of a healthy immune system in protecting against C. albicans overgrowth is well known by physicians who work with patients having acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or those who may be taking immunosuppressive medications. The occur- rence of C. albicans overgrowth in these conditions provides consider- able evidence that improving immune function is essential in resolving chronic candidiasis. In addition, patients with chronic candidiasis often have other chronic infections, likely secondary to a weakened immune system. Typically, this depression of immune function is related to decreased thymus function, primarily presenting as depressed cell-mediated immunity. Although expensive laboratory tests can document this depression, a history of repeated viral infections (including the com- mon cold), outbreaks of cold sores or genital herpes, and prostatic (men) or vaginal (women) infections provides enough evidence to support reduced immune function. Growth controlled Candida Overgrowth Digestive insufficiency High-sugar diet Impaired immunity Nutrient deficiencies Drugs Impaired liver function Underlying diseases Absorption of yeast products AntigensToxins Multisystem involvement with multiple symptoms: food allergies, chemical sensitivities, low immune function, and endocrine imbalance Positive feedback loop Development of autoantibodies Activation and disruption of immune system Metabolic stress Nutrient deficiencies Impaired liver function

## Causes of Depressed Immune Function in Candidiasis

Regarding the immune system, a triggering event such as antibiotic use or nutrient deficiency (Box 159.3) can lead to immune suppression, allowing C. albicans to overgrow and become more firmly entrenched in the lining of the GI tract. Once the organism attaches itself to the intestinal cells, it competes with the cell and ultimately the entire body for nutrition—potentially robbing the body of vital nutrients. In addi- tion, C. albicans secretes a large number of mycotoxins and antigens and is referred to as a “polyantigenic” organism because more than distinct antigens have been identified.9,10

<!-- chunk -->

## Restoring Proper Immune Function

Restoring proper immune function requires a comprehensive approach involving lifestyle, stress management, exercise, diet, nutritional supple- mentation, glandular therapy, and the use of plant-based medicines. Perhaps the most effective intervention in reestablishing a healthy immune system is employing measures designed to improve thymus function. Oral candidiasis occurs in roughly 90% of HIV-positive indi- viduals, and the clinical remission of oral candidiasis has been shown to be critically dependent on T-cell function.11,12 Presumably, improving thy- mus-mediated immunity is also critical in the remission of chronic can- didiasis. Promoting optimal thymus gland activity involves the following: • Prevention of thymic involution or shrinkage by ensuring adequate dietary intake of antioxidant nutrients, such as carotenes, vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, and selenium • The use of nutrients that are required in the manufacture or action of thymic hormones

<!-- chunk -->

## Promoting Detoxification

Patients with chronic candidiasis may exhibit multiple chemical sen- sitivities and allergies, indicating that detoxification reactions are stressed. Therefore their liver function must be supported. When the liver is even slightly damaged by chemical toxins, immune function is severely compromised. Improving the health of the liver and pro- moting detoxification may be one of the most critical factors in the successful treatment of candidiasis. The immune system–suppressing effect of nonviral liver damage has been repeatedly demonstrated in experimental animal studies and human studies. For example, when the liver of a rat is damaged by a chemical toxin, immune function is severely hindered.13 Liver injury is also linked to C. albicans overgrowth, as evident in studies of mice demonstrating that when the liver is even slightly damaged, C. albicans runs rampant through the body.14 A rational approach to aiding the body’s detoxification involves the following: • A diet focused on fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds • A healthy lifestyle, including avoiding alcohol and exercising regu- larly • A high-potency multiple vitamin and mineral supplement • Lipotropic formulas and silymarin to protect the liver and enhance liver function • A 3-day fast at the change of each season If any of the factors in Box 159.4 apply to the patient, enhancing detoxification is a major therapeutic goal.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lipotropic Factors

The nutrients choline, betaine, and methionine are often beneficial in enhancing liver function and detoxification reactions. These com- pounds, referred to as lipotropic agents, promote the flow of fat and bile to and from the liver. In essence, they produce a “decongesting” effect on the liver and promote improved liver function and fat metab- olism. Formulas containing lipotropic agents are useful in enhancing detoxification reactions and other liver functions. Lipotropic formulas have been used for a wide variety of conditions, including a number of liver disorders such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and chemical-induced liver disease. The daily dosage should be 1000 mg of choline and 1000 mg of methionine or cysteine, or both. Lipotropic formulas appear to increase the levels of two important liver substances: S-adenosyl-methionine, the major lipotropic com- pound in the liver, and glutathione, one of the major detoxifying com- pounds in the liver.15,16

<!-- chunk -->

## Promoting Elimination

A diet that focuses on high-fiber plant foods should be sufficient to promote proper elimination by supplying an ample amount of dietary fiber. If additional support is needed, fiber formulas can be prescribed. These formulas are composed of natural plant fibers derived from psyllium seed, kelp, agar, pectin, and plant gums like karaya and guar. Alternatively, fibers can be purified semisynthetic polysaccharides like methylcellulose and carboxymethylcellulose sodium. Psyllium-containing laxatives are the most popular and usually the most effective. Fiber formulas most closely approxi- mate the natural mechanism that promotes a bowel movement. In the treatment of candidiasis, 3 to 5 g of soluble fiber at bed- time should be recommended, especially if antiyeast therapies are employed, to ensure that dead yeast cells are excreted and not absorbed.

## 1224SECTION 6 Diseases


Intestinal flora plays a major role in the health of the host, especially in the battle against GI tract infection.17,18 Intestinal flora is intimately involved in the host’s nutritional status and affects immune system function, cholesterol metabolism, carcinogenesis, and aging. Although probiotic supplements such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bacterium bifidum can be used to promote overall good health, the four primary uses related to chronic candidiasis are the promotion of a proper intestinal environment, postantibiotic therapy, vaginal yeast infec- tions, and urinary tract infections. The dosage of a commercial probiotic supplement is based on the number of live organisms. The ingestion of 5 to 10 billion viable L. aci- dophilus or B. bifidum cells daily is a sufficient dosage for most people. Amounts exceeding these may induce mild GI disturbances, whereas smaller amounts may not be able to colonize the GI tract. See Chapters 104 and 105 for a more comprehensive discussion of these useful agents.

<!-- chunk -->

## Natural Antiyeast Agents

A number of natural agents have proven activity against C. albicans. Rather than relying on these agents as a primary therapy, it is import- ant to address the factors that predispose one to chronic candidiasis, especially a lack of either hydrochloric acid or pancreatic enzymes. The five natural agents recommended against C. albicans are as follows: • Caprylic acid • Berberine-containing plants • Garlic • Enteric-coated volatile oil preparations • Propolis Most patients can achieve benefits from the natural agents described rather than the use of pharmaceuticals. Antiyeast therapy can produce a die-off (Herxheimer) reaction due to the rapid killing of the organ- ism and subsequent absorption of large quantities of yeast toxins, cell particles, and antigens. The Herxheimer reaction refers to a worsening of symptoms as a result of this die-off. The Herxheimer reaction can be minimized by the following means: • Following the dietary recommendations for a minimum of 2 weeks before taking an antiyeast agent • Supporting the liver • Starting any antiyeast medications in low doses and gradually increasing dosages over 1 month to achieve full therapeutic dosage

<!-- chunk -->

## Caprylic Acid

Caprylic acid is a naturally occurring fatty acid that has been reported to be an effective antifungal compound in the treatment of candidia- sis.19,20 Because caprylic acid is readily absorbed in the intestines, it is necessary to take timed-release or enteric-coated caprylic acid formu- las to allow for gradual release throughout the entire intestinal tract.21 The standard dose for these delayed-release preparations is 1000 to 2000 mg with meals.

<!-- chunk -->

## Chitosan

Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide derived from the outer skeleton of shellfish composed of β -linked D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D- glucosamine. It is used in the treatment of obesity, high cholesterol, and Crohn’s disease. In addition, a randomized, single-blind, clini- cal trial investigated the antifungal effects of low-molecular-weight chitosan solution on C. albicans in denture stomatitis in comparison with nystatin suspension.22 After 2 weeks of treatment, the chitosan solution significantly decreased the erythematous surface area, burn- ing sensation, and time required for clinical improvement, making it a promising candidate for use as an antifungal mouthwash.

<!-- chunk -->

## Berberine-Containing Plants

Berberine-containing plants include goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), barberry (Berberis vulgaris), Oregon grape (Berberis aquifolium), and goldthread (Coptis chinensis). Berberine, an alkaloid, has been exten- sively studied in both experimental and clinical settings for its antibi- otic activity. Berberine exhibits a broad spectrum of antibiotic activity, having shown antibiotic activity against bacteria, protozoa, and fungi, including C. albicans.23–29 Berberine’s action in inhibiting C. albicans, as well as pathogenic bacteria, prevents the overgrowth of yeast, which is a common side effect of antibiotic use. Diarrhea is a common symptom in patients with chronic candi- diasis. Berberine has shown remarkable antidiarrheal activity in even the most severe cases. Positive clinical results have been shown with berberine in relieving diarrhea in cases of cholera, amebiasis, giardiasis, and other causes of acute GI infection (e.g., Escherichia coli, Shigella, Salmonella, and Klebsiella) and may also relieve the diarrhea seen in patients with chronic candidiasis.30–36 The dosage of any berberine-containing plant should be based on berberine content. Because there is a wide range of quality in golden- seal preparations, standardized extracts are preferred. Three-times-a- day dosages are as follows: • Dried root or infusion (tea), 2 to 4 g • Tincture (1:5), 6 to 12 mL (1.5–3 tsp) • Fluid extract (1:1), 2 to 4 mL (0.5–1 tsp) • Solid (powdered dry) extract (4:1 or 8%–12% alkaloid content), 250 to 500 mg Note that the dosage recommendations for berberine would be to 50 mg three times daily or a daily dose of up to 150 mg. This dos- age is consistent with the dosage range in the positive clinical studies in patients with GI infections. For children, a dosage based on body weight is appropriate. The daily dose would be the equivalent of 5 to 10 mg of berberine/kg (2.2 lb) body weight. Berberine and berberine-containing plants are generally nontoxic at the recommended dosages. However, berberine-containing plants are not recommended for use during pregnancy, and higher dosages may interfere with vitamin B metabolism.37

## Allium sativum. Garlic has demonstrated significant antifungal

activity. Its inhibition of C. albicans in both animal and test tube (in vitro) studies has shown it to be more potent than nystatin, gentian violet, and six other reputed antifungal agents.38–40 The active component is allicin—the pungent and odorous principle of garlic. The clinical use of garlic features commercial preparations designed to offer the benefits of garlic without the odor. These preparations are designed to delay the formation of allicin until the enteric-coated tab- let is delivered to the small and large intestines. The treatment of chronic candidiasis requires a daily dose of at least 10 mg allicin or a total allicin potential of 4000 mcg. This amount is equal to approximately one clove (4 g) of fresh garlic. Higher dosages of these preparations usually result in the odor of garlic being detectable.

<!-- chunk -->

## Enteric-Coated Volatile Oils

Volatile oils from oregano, thyme, peppermint, and rosemary are all effective antifungal agents. In one study, the sensitivity of 30 different strains of C. albicans to 12 essential oils was compared with the three mainly used drugs (clotrimazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole).41 Mint, basil, lavender, tea tree oil, winter savory, and oregano essential oils inhibited both the growth and the activity of C. albicans more effi- ciently compared with the mainly used drugs (especially clotrimazole). The results showed that the essential oils primarily affected the cell wall and the membranes of the yeast. An additional study compared the anti–C. albicans effect of oregano oil with that of caprylic acid.42 Although the minimum inhibitory concentration of oregano oil was

<!-- chunk -->

## 1225CHAPTER 159 Chronic Candidiasis

less than 0.1 mg/mL, and the 0.1% survival of C. albicans occurred at a concentration of 45 mg/mL, the minimum inhibitory concentration of caprylic acid was less than 500 mg/mL, and 0.1% survival occurred at a concentration of 5000 mg/mL. These results indicate that the anti–C. albicans activity of oregano oil is more than 100 times more potent than caprylic acid. Because volatile oils are quickly absorbed and asso- ciated with inducing heartburn, an enteric coating is recommended to ensure delivery to the small and large intestines. An effective dosage for an enteric-coated volatile oil preparation is 0.2 to 0.4 mL twice daily between meals.

<!-- chunk -->

## Melaleuca alternifolia. In one open study, 27 patients with

AIDS and oral candidiasis clinically refractory to fluconazole were randomized to receive either an alcohol-based or alcohol-free Melaleuca alternifolia oral solution 4 times daily for 2 to 4 weeks. Overall, 60% of patients demonstrated a clinical response to this oral solution (seven patients were cured, and eight patients clinically improved) at the 4-week evaluation.43

<!-- chunk -->

## Propolis

Propolis has shown considerable in vitro antimicrobial activity against C. albicans, as well as an ability to enhance the effectiveness of conven- tional antifungal drugs.44–47 Its cytotoxic activity against C. albicans, along with its immune-enhancing effects, make propolis a strong can- didate for the treatment of chronic candidiasis.


The following is a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to the suc- cessful elimination of chronic candidiasis. Step 1. Identify and address predisposing factors: • Eliminate the use of antibiotics, steroids, immune-suppressing drugs, and birth control pills (unless medically necessary). • Perform a CDSA. • Follow the specific recommendations if the identifiable predispos- ing factor is dietary factors, impaired immunity, impaired liver function, or an underlying disease state. Step 2. Recommend the C. albicans control diet: • Eliminate refined and simple sugars. • Eliminate milk and other dairy products. • Eliminate foods with a high content of yeast or mold, including alcoholic beverages, cheeses, dried fruits, melons, and peanuts. • Eliminate all known or suspected food allergies. Step 3. Provide nutritional support: • A high-potency multiple vitamin and mineral formula • Additional antioxidants • 1 Tbs of flaxseed oil daily Step 4. Support immune function: • Promote a positive mental attitude. • Help patients deal with stress by teaching positive stress-coping techniques. • Recommend avoiding alcohol, sugar, smoking, and elevated cho- lesterol levels, which can impair immune function. • Recommend plenty of rest and good sleep. • Follow the supplement recommendations given in Chapter 136 on immune support. Step 5. Promote detoxification and elimination: • Recommend 3 to 5 g of a water-soluble fiber source, such as guar gum, psyllium seed, or pectin at night. • If necessary, recommend lipotropic factors and silymarin to enhance liver function. Step 6. Recommend probiotics: • Dose: 5 to 10 billion viable L. acidophilus and B. bifidum cells daily Step 7. Use appropriate antiyeast therapy: • Ideally, use the recommended nutritional or herbal supplements, or both, to help control against yeast overgrowth and promote a healthy bacterial flora. • If necessary, use prescription antiyeast drugs appropriately. These steps should resolve chronic candidiasis in most cases. If a patient follows these guidelines and fails to achieve significant improvement or complete resolution, further evaluation is necessary to determine whether chronic candidiasis is the underlying factor. Repeat stool cultures and antigen levels are often helpful. If the organ- ism has not been eradicated, stronger prescription antibiotics can be used, along with the other general recommendations.

## Etiology

<!-- chunk -->

## Infectious Agents

Owing in part to the similarity of CFS to acute or chronic infection, it was initially thought to be caused by a virus (e.g., EBV mononu- cleosis).3 It now seems clear that CFS is not caused by any single rec- ognized infectious disease agent. The CDC’s four-city surveillance study found no association between CFS and infection by a wide variety of human pathogens, including EBV, human retroviruses, herpesvirus, rubella, Candida albicans, and others. No one pathogen appears to be causing CFS. However, the possibility remains that CFS may have multiple causes leading to a common endpoint, in which case, some viruses or other infectious agents may play a contributing role (Fig. 160.1).

<!-- chunk -->

## Immune System Abnormalities

There is little argument that a disturbed immune system plays a central role in CFS. A variety of such abnormalities have been reported in CFS patients (Box 160.2). Although no specific immu- nological dysfunction pattern has been recognized, the most consis- tent abnormality is a decreased number or activity of natural killer (NK) cells.4–7 NK cells received their name because of their ability to destroy cells that have become cancerous or infected by viruses. In fact, for a time, CFS was also referred to as low natural killer cell syndrome (LNKS). Other consistent findings include a reduced ability of lymphocytes, key in the battle against viruses, to respond to stimuli.7 One reason for this lack of response may be reduced activity or decreased produc- tion of interferon. Although both low and high levels of interferon have been reported in CFS, levels are depressed in most cases. When interferon levels are low, reactivation of latent viral infection is likely. Conversely, when interferon (as well as other chemical mediators like interleukin-1) levels are high, many of the symptoms may be related to the physiological effects of interferon. When interferon is used as a therapy in cancer and viral hepatitis, the side effects produced are similar to the symptoms of CFS.

## Other Causes of Chronic Fatigue

Chronic fatigue can be caused by various physical and psychological factors. Box 160.3 lists the major causes of chronic fatigue in an order of importance that represents how common the cause is among sufferers of chronic fatigue in the general population. The list is based on the findings of several large studies as well as the author’s clinical experience (CFS is listed under a broader category of impaired immune function).

## Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, and Multiple

<!-- chunk -->

## Chemical Sensitivities

Fibromyalgia (FM) and multiple chemical sensitivities (MCS), like CFS, are recognized disorders with a substantial overlap of symptom- atology.4,5,8,9 The only difference in the diagnostic criteria for FM and CFS is the requirement of musculoskeletal pain in fibromyalgia and fatigue in CFS. The likelihood of being diagnosed as having fibromy- algia or CFS depends on the type of physician consulted. Specifically, if a rheumatologist or orthopedic specialist is consulted, the patient is much more likely to be diagnosed with fibromyalgia. (Box 160.4 pres- ents the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia.)

## 1228SECTION 6 Diseases

One group of researchers carefully compared the symptomatology of 90 patients who had been diagnosed as having CFS, MCS, or FM (30 in each category).9 Using the same questionnaire for all 90 patients, 70% of the patients diagnosed with FM and 30% of those with MCS met the CDC criteria for CFS. Particularly significant was the observa- tion that 80% of both the FM and MCS patients met the CFS criteria of fatigue lasting more than 6 months, with a 50% reduction in activity. More than 50% of the CFS and FM patients reported adverse reactions to various chemicals.


A great number of factors must be considered when evaluating a patient with chronic fatigue. Women tend to be at higher risk than men.10 A detailed medical history and review of body systems goes a long way toward identifying important factors. The goal is to identify as many factors as possible that may be contributing to the patient’s feeling of fatigue. For example, if a patient has heart disease, diabetes, or some other health condition and the condition or the drug he or she is taking is clearly responsible for the fatigue, the treatment of the fatigue becomes secondary to the treatment of his or her underlying health condition. In many cases of chronic fatigue, further evaluation is necessary. The next steps can include a complete physical examination and laboratory studies. In the physical examination, it is important to look for clues that may point to the cause of chronic fatigue. For example, swollen lymph nodes may indicate a chronic infection, and the presence of a diagonal crease on both earlobes usually indicates impaired blood flow to the brain, a significant cause of fatigue in the elderly.

## 1229CHAPTER 160 Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

Plasma neuropeptide Y (PNY) has been reported as a potential bio- marker for symptom severity in CFS.11 Clinical research has demon- strated a significant correlation of PNY with stress, negative mood, general health, depression, and impaired cognitive function. However, expensive laboratory tests are best not ordered unless they are abso- lutely necessary. For example, if it is quite obvious that the patient has impaired immunity, it does not make much sense to perform elaborate and expensive blood tests on immune function because the results of these tests are not likely to influence the method of treatment. Of particular value are assessments of liver detoxification function, bowel dysbiosis, and gastrointestinal permeability (see Chapters 9, 19, and 28).


Because chronic fatigue and CFS are generally multifactorial condi- tions, the therapeutic approach typically involves multiple therapies that address different facets of the clinical picture. A person’s energy level, as well as his or her emotional state, is determined by an interplay between two primary factors—internal focus and physiology. Many people with chronic fatigue focus on how tired they are. They repeatedly reaffirm their fatigue to themselves and to anyone who will listen. Their physiology includes not only the chemicals and hormones circulating in the body but also the way they hold their bodies (usually slouched) and the way they breathe (shal- low). In most patients with chronic fatigue, both the mind and the body must be addressed. The most effective treatment is a comprehen- sive program designed to help people use their minds, attitudes, and physiologies to fuel higher energy levels.

<!-- chunk -->

## Underlying Physiological Dysfunctions

<!-- chunk -->

## Depression

The first factor to address is any underlying depression. Depression is one of the major causes of chronic fatigue, and it is a common feature of CFS. In the absence of a preexisting physical condition, depression is generally regarded as the most common cause of chronic fatigue. However, it is often difficult to determine whether the depression preceded the fatigue or vice versa. Depression is fully discussed in Chapter 142.

<!-- chunk -->

## Stress

Stress is another factor to consider in the patient with chronic fatigue or CFS (Fig. 160.2). Stress can be the underlying factor in the patient with depression, low immune function, or another cause of chronic fatigue (see Chapter 140 for guidelines on assessing the role of stress). One of the tools recommended to rate stress levels is the Social Readjustment Rating Scale developed by Holmes and Rahe.12 The scale was originally designed to predict the likelihood of a person get- ting a serious disease due to stress. Various life-changing events are numerically rated according to their potential for causing disease. Even events commonly viewed as positive, such as an outstanding personal achievement, carry stress with them.

## Impaired Liver Function, Environmental Illness, or Both

Exposure to food additives, solvents (e.g., cleaning materials, formalde- hyde, toluene, benzene), pesticides, herbicides, toxic metals (e.g., lead, mer- cury, cadmium, arsenic, nickel, aluminum), and other toxins can greatly stress the liver and detoxification processes.13,14 This exposure can lead to a condition labeled by many naturopathic and nutrition-oriented physi- cians as the “congested liver,” “sluggish liver,” or the more recently coined “impaired hepatic detoxification.” These terms signify a reduced ability of the liver to detoxify. The congested or sluggish liver is characterized by a diminished bile flow, a condition known in medical terms as cholestasis or steatohepatitis, whereas the term impaired hepatic detoxification refers to decreased Phase I or II enzyme activity, or both. Phase I detoxification rates in excess of Phase II activity also cause toxicity problems owing to excessive accumulation of activated intermediates. In addition to exposure to toxic chemicals, various other agents and conditions, as listed in Box 160.5, can cause impairment of bile flow within the liver. Although many of the conditions listed in Box 160.5 are typically associated with alterations in laboratory tests of liver function (e.g., serum bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, γ -glutamyl transpeptidase), these tests alone may not be adequate to evaluate liver function because they are ele- vated only when the liver has been significantly damaged, and many of these conditions in the initial or “subclinical” stages of chronic fatigue may yield normal laboratory values. Although there are more sensitive tests to determine the func- tional activity of the liver, such as the serum bile acid assay and various clearance tests, clinical judgment based on medical history remains the major diagnostic tool for the “sluggish liver” or impaired hepatic detoxification enzymes, the presence of chronic fatigue being the hall- mark symptom. People with a sluggish liver may also complain of the following: • Depression • General malaise • Headaches • Digestive disturbances • Allergies and chemical sensitivities • Premenstrual syndrome • Constipation Not surprisingly, people exposed to toxic chemicals often complain of the same symptoms. Many toxic chemicals (especially solvents) and toxic metals have an affinity for nervous tissue, giving rise to various psychological and neurological symptoms14,15: • Depression • Headaches aFulfillment of all three major criteria and four or more minor criteria required.

• Mental confusion • Mental illness • Tingling in the extremities • Abnormal nerve reflexes • Other signs of impaired nervous system function A hair mineral analysis is a possible screening test for metal toxic- ity. Refer to Chapter 22 (Metal Toxicity: Assessment of Exposure and Retention) for further discussion. A multiclinic research study of chronically ill patients, many of whom were diagnosed as suffering from CFIDS, evaluated the effi- cacy of a comprehensive detoxification program. Patients were placed on a hypoallergenic diet and given a dietary food supplement rich in nutrients that assist in liver detoxification. These patients reported a 52% reduction in symptoms after 10 weeks, and symptom improve- ment was mirrored by normalization of hepatic Phase I and Phase II detoxification.15

## Gastrointestinal Permeability

Excessive gastrointestinal permeability, as measured by the lactu- lose-mannitol absorption test (see Chapter 19), is a common finding in CFS.16

## Hepatic Detoxification Functions

A treatment program using hypoallergenic rice protein food replace- ment formula to support hepatic Phases I and II detoxification was provided to patients who fulfilled the classic criteria of the CDC Fig. 160.2 Biological model that may explain “fatigue” and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syn- drome (ME/CFS) by organic abnormalities and cause and effect relationships.

and National Institutes of Health for CFS. The treatment resulted in symptom reduction, with clinical improvement being paralleled by improved hepatic detoxification function.17

## Impaired Immune Function, Chronic Infection, or Both

When the immune system is impaired, infections can linger, and fatigue can persist. There is a good reason for this: fatigue is the body’s response mechanism to infection because the immune system works best when the body is at rest. To determine the role that the immune system is playing in patients with chronic fatigue, the series of questions listed in Box 160.6 can be used during the patient interview to indicate an impaired immune system. Chapter 18 describes in substantial detail the laboratory meth- odologies for assessing immune function.

<!-- chunk -->

## Chronic Candidal Infection

One of the most common findings in individuals with impaired immune function is gastrointestinal overgrowth of Candida albi- cans. Candidal overgrowth is now becoming recognized as a complex medical syndrome also known as the “yeast syndrome” and “chronic candidiasis.” This overgrowth is believed to cause a wide variety of symptoms in virtually every system of the body, with the gastrointes- tinal, genitourinary, endocrine, nervous, and immune systems being the most susceptible. Box 160.7 lists the profile of a typical patient with chronic candidiasis (see Chapter 159 for a comprehensive discussion). The diagnosis of chronic candidiasis is often difficult because there is no specific diagnostic test. Stool cultures and elevated antibody levels to Candida are useful diagnostic aids, but they should not be relied on for diagnosis. The best method for diagnosing chronic candidiasis in most cases is a detailed medical history and patient questionnaire (see Appendix 1). Box 160.8 lists the factors that typically predispose a patient to candidal overgrowth.

## Food Allergies

As far back as 1930, chronic fatigue was recognized as a key feature of food allergies.18 Originally, Rowe and Rowe19 used the term allergic toxemia to describe a syndrome that included the symptoms of fatigue, muscle and joint aches, drowsiness, difficulty in concentration, ner- vousness, and depression. Around the 1950s, this syndrome began to be referred to as the “allergic tension-fatigue syndrome.”19 With the popularity of CFS, many physicians and others are forgetting that food allergies can lead to chronic fatigue. Furthermore, between 55% and 85% of individuals with CFS have allergies. For more information on food allergies, see Chapter 14.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hypothyroidism

Hypothyroidism is a common cause of chronic fatigue. However, the condition is often overlooked. The reason for this may be the reliance on standard blood measurements of thyroid hormone levels as the method of diagnosis.20–22 Undiagnosed hypothyroidism is a serious concern because failure to treat such a critical and underlying problem

reduces the effectiveness of every other measure designed to increase energy levels. For more information, see Chapter 182.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hypoglycemia

The association between hypoglycemia and fatigue is well known. Numerous studies have shown that depressed individuals suffer from hypoglycemia.23–26 Because depression is the most common cause of chronic fatigue, hypoglycemia must always be ruled out (see Chapter 181).

<!-- chunk -->

## Hypoadrenalism

Adrenal exhaustion was first proposed as a cause of chronic fatigue more than 50 years ago by Tintera.27 A small but growing body of evidence now supports the role of a disruption of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis in CFS.28 Salivary tests of patients with chronic fatigue show lower cortisol levels on wakening.29 Other research suggests that there is no specific change to the HPA axis in CFS and that the observed changes are of multifactorial etiology, with some factors occurring as a consequence of the illness. This second school of thought suggests that the HPA axis might play a role in exac- erbating or perpetuating symptoms late in the course of the illness but not as a primary etiology.30 Either way, one of the major symptoms of glucocorticoid deficiency is debilitating fatigue. Glucocorticoid insufficiency is also characterized by a stressing event followed by feverishness, arthralgias, myalgias, ade- nopathy, postexertional fatigue, exacerbation of allergic responses, and disturbances of mood and sleep (i.e., the typical presentation of CFS). These symptoms are seen in partial or subclinical adrenal insufficiency, which may be detected only by the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test or other endocrine testing. Glucocorticoids have a profound endogenous immunosuppressive effect. In subclini- cal adrenal insufficiency, this may allow for the symptoms of chronic fatigue, including exacerbation of allergic responses, enhanced antibody titers to various viral antigens, and elevations in cytokine levels. A group of CFS researchers believes that these patients form a heterogeneous group with various infectious and noninfectious antecedents.28 They feel that CFS does not represent a discrete disease with a singular cause but rather a clinical condition. CFS is analogous to a number of com- plex medical conditions, such as hypertension, in which various direct and indirect factors lead to the development of the clinical syndrome. The researchers hypothesize that in CFS, specific pathophysiologi- cal antecedents such as acute infection, stress, and preexisting or con- current psychiatric illness may ultimately converge in a final common biological pathway, resulting in the clinical syndrome of CFS. They believe that their data and those of others suggest that a reduction in adrenocortical secretion is an important pathophysiological compo- nent in the development of many biological and behavioral features of the syndrome. For example, in one of their studies, 30 patients with classically defined CFS were compared with 72 normal volunteers and patients.31 The CFS patients were found to have significantly reduced evening cor- tisol levels and low 24-hour urinary-free cortisol excretion. The CFS patients also had elevated basal ACTH concentrations and increased adrenocortical sensitivity to ACTH but a reduced maximal response, and they showed an attenuated net integrated ACTH response to corti- cotrophin-releasing hormone. These results are most compatible with a mild central adrenal insufficiency secondary to either a deficiency of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) or some other central stimu- lus to the pituitary–adrenal axis. The authors feel that the hyperrespon- siveness of the adrenal cortex to ACTH in patients with CFS may reflect a secondary adrenal insufficiency in which adrenal ACTH receptors have become hypersensitive owing to inadequate exposure to ACTH. The reduction in response to large doses of ACTH might suggest overall adrenal atrophy. The evidence suggests that the mild hypocortisolism in these patients reflects a defect at or above the level of the hypothalamus, resulting in a deficiency in the release of CRH or other secretagogues, or both, that serve to activate the pituitary–adrenal axis.

## Endotoxins

Endotoxins are lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria. One bacterial cell contains approximately 3.5 million LPS molecules. Upon bacterial cell death, cell-wall lysis occurs, releasing LPS to interact with intestinal cell membranes and surface proteins, triggering local and systemic inflammatory reactions. Patients with diagnosed CFS have been shown to have significantly higher circulating LPS levels than healthy controls (119.43 pg/mL ver- sus 74.74 pg/mL).32 They also have higher levels of CD 14 (49 μ g/mL versus μ g/mL in controls) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (46 mg/L versus 34 mg/L in controls). In addition, CFS patients had lower intestinal microbiome diversity with significantly diminished Firmicutes population.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mind and Attitude

The mind and attitude play a critical role in determining the status of the immune system and energy levels. Many patients with chronic fatigue (including CFS) are either depressed or just seem to have lost a real enthusiasm for life. It is not easy to have much enthusiasm when you do not have much energy, but the two usually go hand in hand. Related to these psychological difficulties, it has been shown that there is a lack of social support for CFS patients.33 It is a question of whether the lack of energy affects the CFS patient’s ability to maintain a rela- tionship, or vice versa, or possibly both. Cognitive-behavioral therapy has shown some effective results in clinical use.34,35 The first step is to convey to CFS patients that they can get better. Many patients with CFS are told that this is “something they will have to live with” and that “there is no cure.” Achieving or maintaining a positive mental attitude is critical to good health and high energy levels, especially in patients with CFS. To achieve a posi- tive mind-set, a person must exercise or condition the attitude, much as one would condition the body. To help patients, physicians can prescribe mental exercises such as visualizations, goal setting, affirma- tions, and empowering questions, as detailed in Chapter 142.


Energy level appears to be directly related to the quality of foods rou- tinely ingested. Patients should be encouraged to adhere to the dietary guidelines given in Chapter 44. It is especially important to eliminate or restrict caffeine and refined sugar. Although acute caffeine consumption provides stimulation, regu- lar caffeine intake may actually lead to chronic fatigue. Although mice fed one dose of caffeine demonstrated significant increases in their swimming capacity, when the dose of caffeine was given repeatedly for 6 weeks, a significant decrease in the mice’s swimming capacity was observed.36 Several studies have found caffeine intake to be extremely high in individuals with psychiatric disorders. Another interesting finding is that the degree of fatigue experienced is often related to the quantity of caffeine ingested. In one survey of hospitalized psychiatric patients, 61% of those ingesting at least 750 mg/day (at least five cups of coffee) complained of fatigue, compared with 54% of those ingesting 250 to 749 mg/day and only 24% of those ingesting less than 250 mg/day.37 In patients who routinely drink coffee, abrupt cessation of coffee drinking will probably result in symptoms of caffeine withdrawal, including fatigue, headache, and an intense desire for coffee.38,39 Fortunately, this withdrawal period does not last more than a few days.

## 1233CHAPTER 160 Chronic Fatigue Syndrome


Nutritional supplementation is essential in the treatment of chronic fatigue. A deficiency of virtually any nutrient can produce the symp- toms of fatigue as well as render the body more susceptible to infec- tion. Individuals with chronic fatigue require, at the bare minimum, a high-potency multivitamin-multimineral formula along with extra vitamin C (3000 mg/day in divided doses) and magnesium (500–1200 mg/day in divided doses).


An underlying magnesium deficiency, even if subclinical, can result in chronic fatigue and symptoms similar to those of CFS. In addi- tion, low red blood cell magnesium levels, a more accurate measure of magnesium status than routine blood analysis, have been found in many patients with chronic fatigue and CFS. The literature demon- strates that magnesium deficiency is not necessarily due to low dietary intake,40 and several studies have shown good results with supplemen- tation with improvements in magnesium stores. For example, in one double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with CFS received an intramuscular injection of either mag- nesium sulfate (1 g in 2 mL of injectable water) or a placebo (2 mL of injectable water) for 6 weeks. At the end of the study, 12 of the patients receiving magnesium reported, on the basis of strict criteria, significantly improved energy levels, improved emotional state, and less pain. In contrast, only 3 of the 17 placebo patients reported that they felt better, and only 1 reported improved energy levels.41 This study seems to confirm some impressive results obtained in clinical trials during the 1960s on patients suffering from chronic fatigue.42–45 These studies used oral magnesium and potassium aspar- tate (1 g each) rather than injectable magnesium. Between 75% and 91% of the nearly 3000 patients studied experienced relief of fatigue during treatment with the magnesium and potassium aspartate. In contrast, the number of patients responding to a placebo was between 9% and 26%. The beneficial effect was usually noted after only 4 to 5 days, but sometimes it took as long as 10 days to achieve results. Patients usually continued treatment for 4 to 6 weeks; afterward, fatigue frequently did not return. Injectable magnesium is not necessary to restore magnesium sta- tus.46 Absorption studies indicate that magnesium is easily absorbed orally when it is bound to aspartate or citrate. In addition, both of these compounds may also help fight fatigue. Aspartate feeds into the Krebs cycle, the final common pathway for the conversion of glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids to chemical energy (adenosine triphos- phate [ATP]), whereas citrate is itself a component of the Krebs cycle. Krebs cycle components, including aspartate, citrate, fumarate, malate, and succinate, usually provide a better mineral chelate; evidence sug- gests that minerals chelated to the Krebs cycle intermediates are better absorbed, used, and tolerated compared with inorganic or relatively insoluble mineral salts, including magnesium chloride, oxide, or carbonate.46,47


In one study, essential fatty acid supplementation was shown to improve the clinical picture and red blood cell phospholipid mem- brane profile of patients with postviral fatigue. The preparation given contained linoleic, gamma-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosa- hexaenoic acids and was given as eight 500-mg capsules per day over a 3-month period.48 In another study, an essential fatty acid supplement rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was given daily to a female patient with a 6-year history of unremitting symptoms of CFS. Within 6 to 8 weeks, the EPA-rich essential fatty acid supplementa- tion led to a marked clinical improvement in the symptoms of CFS.49 Previous research suggests that CFS is associated with pathophysio- logical brain changes, such as an enlargement in cerebral ventricular volume.50 More clinical research is needed.

## Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), the active coenzyme form of vitamin B 3 , has been shown to be effective in countering the negative effects of jet lag on cognition and wakefulness.51 It is also known to encourage energy production through increased ATP gener- ation. One small trial of NADH found a beneficial effect and improve- ment in quality of life in patients with CFS. This study supplemented the stabilized oral absorbable form in a 26-subject randomized, dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg of NADH or placebo for 1 month. After a 1-month washout period without supplement, subjects were then crossed to the alternate regimen for a final 1-month period. Within this cohort of 26 patients, 8 of 26 (31%) responded favorably to NADH, in contrast to 2 of 26 (8%) to placebo. No severe adverse effects were observed related to NADH,52 nor have studies in animals shown any toxicity, even at megadoses.53 More clinical research is necessary to fully elucidate the possible beneficial effects of NADH in patients with CFS.

## -Carnitine

Carnitine is an essential nutrient for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix. One randomized controlled crossover study compared the efficacy of l-carnitine with amantadine, a drug known to relieve fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis. Each intervention was given for 2 months, with a 2-week washout period between medicines. In 30 patients with CFS, l-carnitine or amantadine was given as the first medicine. Amantadine was poorly tolerated by the CFS patients, of whom only 15 were able to complete the 8 weeks of treatment. In those individuals who completed 8 weeks of treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in any of the clinical parameters. With l-carnitine, there was a statistically significant clin- ical improvement in 12 of the 18 studied parameters after 8 weeks of treatment, with none of the clinical parameters showing any deterio- ration. The greatest improvement took place between weeks 4 and 8 of l-carnitine treatment. Only one patient, owing to diarrhea, was unable to complete the eight-treatment course.54 l-Carnitine is extremely safe, with no significant side effects having been reported in any of the human clinical studies.

## Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)

CoQ10 plays a role as a mitochondrial nutrient that acts as an essential cofactor to produce ATP in the mitochondria.55 Plasma CoQ10 has been found to be significantly lower (P = 0.00001) in CFS patients than in controls. Symptoms such as fatigue and neurocognitive impairment may be related to CoQ10 depletion. In one randomized controlled trial, 43 patients with CFS were randomly assigned to receive either ubiqui- nol-10 (150 mg/day) or placebo every day for 12 weeks.56 Although no direct improvement in fatigue was observed, measured with Chandler’s Fatigue Scale, ubiquinol-10 supplementation improved several CFS symptoms (e.g., nighttime awakenings), which may have longer-term effects on reducing fatigue in CFS patients.

## Melatonin

Dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) is a naturally occurring event that may account for delayed-sleep-phase syndrome in 10% of patients with chronic insomnia. Research on DLMO concluded that a certain subset of CFS patients may respond to the therapeutic use of melatonin.

## 1234SECTION 6 Diseases

In one study, 29 patients with CFS were asked to take 5 mg of mela- tonin at bedtime for 3 months.57 Several variables were measured using the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS) questionnaire. The authors determined that the total score (P = 0.006), as well as the subscores of fatigue (P = 0.017), concentration (P = 0.031), motivation (P = 0.010), and activity (P = 0.008), improved significantly after 90 days of mel- atonin use. Additionally, in those patients with late DLMO (>21.30 hours), overall CIS scores and its subscores were better than in those CFS patients with early DLMO.


Several botanical medicines support adrenal function and may offer significant benefits in CFS. Most notable are adaptogens, such as Chinese ginseng (Panax ginseng), Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus), rhodiola (Rhodiola rosacea), and ashwaganda (Withania somnifera). The effects of these herbs as “adaptogens” are discussed in Chapter 140, Stress Management. Of these herbal adaptogens, both Siberian ginseng and rhodiola have shown effects specific to CFS.

## Siberian Ginseng (E. senticosus)

In addition to supporting adrenal function and acting as a nonspecific adaptogen, Siberian ginseng has been shown to exert a number of ben- eficial effects on immune function that may be useful in the treatment of CFS. In one double-blind study, 36 healthy subjects received either 10 mL of a fluid extract of ginseng or placebo daily for 4 weeks.58 The group receiving the ginseng demonstrated significant improvements in various immune system parameters. Most notable were a significant increase in T-helper cells and an increase in NK cell activity—both of which are of value in the treatment of CFS.

## Rhodiola rosea

Rhodiola rosea (artic root) is a popular plant in traditional medical systems in Eastern Europe and Asia, where it has traditionally been recommended to help combat fatigue and restore energy. In one ran- domized, placebo-controlled trial of 60 patients with stress-related fatigue, Rhodiola was found to have an antifatigue effect that increased mental performance, particularly the ability to concentrate, and decreased the cortisol response to awakening stress.59

## Licorice Root (Glycyrrhiza glabra)

Considering the possible roles of viral infection and hypoadrenalism in CFS, licorice root, with its antiviral and glucocorticoid-potentiat- ing properties (see Chapter 85 for documentation of these properties), would seem to be an ideal botanical for this condition.60 Unfortunately, this has not been rigorously evaluated, although an excellent response in a single patient has been reported.61 The whole root must be used to ensure glucocorticoid-potentiating glycyrrhizic and glycyrrhetinic acid activity.

## Breathing, Posture, and Bodywork

Proper care of the body is critical to the achievement of high levels of energy. Breathing with the diaphragm, good posture, and body- work (e.g., massage, spinal manipulation) are all important in helping relieve the stress that is a common contributor to fatigue.


Exercise alone has been demonstrated to have a tremendous effect on mood and the ability to handle stressful life situations.62 Regular exercise has also been shown to lead to improved immune status. For CFS patients, regular exercise has been shown to lead to a significant increase (up to 100%) in NK cell activity.63,64 Although more strenuous exercise is required to benefit the cardiovascular system, light to mod- erate exercise may be best for the immune system. One study found that immune function was significantly increased by the practice of tai chi exercises.65 Tai chi is a martial art technique that features movement from one posture to the next in a flowing motion that resembles dance. Research suggests that light to moderate exercise stimulates the immune system, whereas intense exercise (e.g., training for the Olympics) can have the opposite effect.36,66 Graded exercise therapies, in which the patient begins with gradual walking and weight exercises and increases duration and intensity as is comfortable over time, may be the best approach.67 Although there is a concern for overtraining, one study has shown this method to be superior to relaxation and flex- ibility exercises.68


Successful treatment of CFS requires a comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Especially important is identifying underlying factors that may be affecting the patient’s energy levels or immune sys- tem. The strong correlation between CFS, FM, and MCS suggests that all may respond to hepatic detoxification, food allergy control, and a gut-restoration diet. Special attention should be paid to the advice on immune support in Chapter 136.


Food allergies should be identified and controlled. Water consump- tion should increase, whereas the consumption of caffeine-containing drinks and alcohol should stop. A diet of whole organically grown foods should be encouraged. Hypoglycemia should be controlled through the elimination of sugar and other refined foods and the reg- ular consumption of small meals and snacks.


The patient should be taught diaphragmatic breathing and proper pos- ture. A regular exercise program should be prescribed; low-intensity activities may produce the greatest benefits.

depletion. This impaired energy production is often the result of a nutrient or coenzyme deficiency (e.g., magnesium, thiamine, coenzyme Q 10 [CoQ 10 ], carnitine). The dietary recommendations given in Chapter 174 are appropriate for most patients with CHF, especially if the CHF is due to long-term hypertension. Of partic- ular importance is a diet low in sodium and high in potassium. A high intake of sodium greatly exacerbates the hemodynamic aspects of CHF. Sodium intake should be restricted to below 1.8 g daily. Furthermore, the dietary intake of several nutrients is usually well below recommended levels in patients with CHF.1 Most notably low are magnesium, calcium, zinc, copper, manganese, thiamine, ribo- flavin, and folic acid. A high-potency multivitamin/multimineral formula is critical in these patients, especially if they are taking a diuretic.


Low magnesium levels (particularly white blood cell [WBC] magne- sium) are commonly found in patients with CHF. This association is extremely significant because magnesium levels have been shown to correlate directly with survival rates. In one study, CHF patients with normal levels of magnesium had 1- and 2-year survival rates of 71% and 61%, respectively, compared with rates of 45% and 42%, respec- tively, in patients with lower magnesium levels.2 These results are not surprising considering that magnesium deficiency is associated with cardiac arrhythmias, reduced cardiovascular prognosis, worsened ischemia, and increased mortality in acute myocardial infarction. The magnesium deficiency probably stems from a combination of inadequate intake and increased wasting due to overactivation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, as is commonly seen in patients with heart failure. It can also be the effect of diuretics like furosemide.

## 1238SECTION 6 Diseases

In addition to providing benefits of its own in CHF, magnesium supplementation prevents the magnesium depletion caused by the con- ventional drug therapy for CHF (e.g., digitalis, diuretics, and vasodila- tors such as beta blockers and calcium channel blockers). Magnesium supplementation has even been shown to produce positive effects in patients with CHF receiving conventional drug therapy even if serum magnesium levels are normal.3 However, magnesium supplementation is not indicated in patients with renal failure, because this condition predisposes them to hypermagnesemia—a significant risk factor for mortality.4 ACE inhibitors appear to produce a magnesium-sparing effect in patients on furosemide.5 Typical dosages are 200 to 300 mg one to three times per day of magnesium in the citrate form. Oral mag- nesium can be effective in raising WBC magnesium and potassium lev- els.6 It is highly important to monitor serum magnesium levels so as to prevent hypermagnesemia in patients with renal impairment as well as those on digoxin. Magnesium significantly reduces the frequency and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias in digoxin-treated patients with CHF even without the presence of digoxin toxicity, but too much magnesium may interfere with digoxin.7

## Thiamine

Interest has increased regarding the potential role of thiamine defi- ciency in CHF. Thiamine was the first B vitamin discovered, hence its designation as vitamin B 1 . It is well established that thiamine deficiency can result in the cardiovascular manifestations of “wet beriberi,” sodium retention, peripheral vasodilation, and heart failure. It is also well established that furosemide (Lasix), the most widely prescribed diuretic, has been shown to cause thiamine deficiency in animals and patients with CHF. Diuretic use, changes in dietary habits, and altered thiamine absorption and metabolism have all been identified as possi- ble mechanisms of thiamine deficiency in heart failure.8 Although severe thiamine deficiency is relatively uncommon except in alcoholics, many Americans do not consume the recom- mended daily allowance of 1.5 mg, especially elderly patients in hospi- tals or nursing homes. To gauge the prevalence of thiamine deficiency in the geriatric population, 30 consecutive patients visiting a uni- versity outpatient clinic in Tampa, Florida, were tested for thiamine levels. Depending on the thiamine measurement, plasma versus red blood cell thiamine, low levels (defined as a level below the lowest reference range for younger age groups) were found in 57% and 33%, respectively.9 These results highlight the growing body of evidence that a signifi- cant percentage of the geriatric population is deficient in one or more of the B vitamins. Given the essential role of thiamine and other B vita- mins in normal human physiology, especially cardiovascular and brain function, routine supplementation of B vitamins in this age group appears to be worthwhile. The association between thiamine deficiency and long-term furo- semide use was discovered in 1980, when it was shown that after only 4 weeks of furosemide use, thiamine concentrations and the activity of the thiamine-dependent enzyme transketolase were significantly reduced. The first study looking at thiamine as a potential adjunct in the treatment of CHF showed only modest benefits. However, several subsequent studies have shown that daily doses of 80 to 240 mg of thiamine daily improved the clinical picture, as indicated by a 13% to 22% increase of left ventricular ejection fraction.10,11 This is quite significant, because an increase in ejection fraction is associated with a greater survival rate in patients with CHF. Thiamine has also been shown to improve cardiac function, urine output, and weight loss in patients with CHF.12 In one study, biochemical evidence of severe thiamine deficiency was found in 98% of patients receiving at least 80 mg/day of furosemide and in 57% of patients taking 40 mg furose- mide daily.13 Given the possible benefit, lack of risk, and low cost of thiamine supplementation, administration of 200 to 250 mg of thiamine daily appears to be warranted in patients with CHF, especially if they are on furosemide.

## Carnitine

Normal heart function is critically dependent on adequate concentra- tions of carnitine and CoQ 10 . These compounds are essential in the transport of fatty acids into the myocardium and mitochondria for energy production. Although the normal heart stores more carnitine and CoQ 10 than it needs, if the heart does not have a good supply of oxygen, carnitine and CoQ 10 levels quickly decrease. Both of these agents have shown benefit in the treatment of CHF. Several double-blind clinical studies have shown that carnitine sup- plementation improves cardiac function in patients with CHF.14–16 In one double-blind study, only 1 month of treatment (500 mg three times daily) was necessary to cause a significant improvement in heart function.15 The longer carnitine was used, the more dramatic was the improvement. After 6 months of use, the carnitine group demonstrated an increase in maximum exercise time of 25.9% and a 13.6% increase in ventricular ejection fraction. Another double-blind study showed that after 6 months of treatment, maximum exercise time on the treadmill increased by 16.4%, and the ejection fraction increased by 12.1%.16 Even more obvious benefits were seen in a 3-year study of patients with moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA classifications III to IV) caused by dilated cardiomyopathy. After a period of stable cardiac function up to 3 months, patients were randomly assigned to receive either carnitine (2 g/day orally) or placebo. After a mean of 33.7 months of follow-up (range, 10–54 months), 70 patients were in the study: 33 in the placebo group and 37 in the carnitine group. At the time of analysis, 63 patients were alive. Six deaths occurred in the placebo group and one death in the carnitine group. Survival analysis showed that patients’ survival was statistically significant in favor of the carnitine group.17 A meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled trials with 1625 CHF patients demonstrated that l-carnitine treatment was associated with considerable improvement in overall efficacy, left ventricular ejection fraction, stroke volume, and cardiac output.18 In addition, treatment with l-carnitine resulted in significant decreases in serum levels of brain natriuretic peptide, N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide, left ventricular end-systolic dimension, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, and left ventricular end-systolic volume.

In one of the early studies, 17 patients with mild CHF received 30 mg/day of CoQ 10 .19 All patients improved, and 9 (53%) became asymptomatic after 4 weeks. In another early study,20 patients with congestive heart failure due to either atherosclerosis or high blood pressure were treated with CoQ 10 at a dosage of 30 mg/day for 1 to 2 months.20 Of these patients, 55% reported subjective improvement, 50% showed a decrease in NYHA classification, and 30% showed a “remarkable” decrease in chest con- gestion as seen on chest radiography. Patients with mild disease tended to improve more often than those with more severe disease. Subjective improvements in these patients—including increased cardiac output, stroke volume, cardiac index, and ejection fraction—were confirmed by various objective tests. These results were consistent with CoQ 10 producing an increased force of heart muscle contraction (a positive inotropic effect) similar to but less potent than the effect of digitalis.21,22 Three more studies have also shown CoQ 10 to be effective in significantly improving heart function in patients with CHF. In a double-blind Scandinavian study of 80 patients, participants were given either CoQ 10 (100 mg/day) or placebo for 3 months and then crossed. The improvements noted with CoQ 10 were actually found to be more positive than those obtained from conventional drug ther- apy alone.23 In another double-blind study, 641 patients with CHF received either CoQ 10 (2 mg/kg) or a placebo for 1 year.24 The num- ber of patients requiring hospitalization or experiencing serious con- sequences due to CHF was significantly reduced in the CoQ 10 group compared with the placebo group. In the largest study to date, a total of 2664 patients in NYHA classes II and III were enrolled in an open study in Italy.25 The daily dosage of CoQ 10 was 50 to 150 mg orally for 90 days, with the majority of patients (78%) receiving 100 mg/day. After 3 months of CoQ 10 treat- ment, the proportions of patients with improvement in clinical signs and symptoms were as follows: • Cyanosis: 78.1% • Edema (fluid retention): 78.6% • Pulmonary edema: 77.8% • Enlargement of liver area: 49.3% • Venous congestion: 71.8% • Shortness of breath: 52.7% • Heart palpitations: 75.4% • Sweating: 79.8% • Subjective arrhythmia: 63.4% • Insomnia: 66.2% • Vertigo: 73.1% • Nocturnal urination: 53.6% Improvement of at least three symptoms occurred in 54% of patients, indicating a significantly improved quality of life (QoL) with CoQ 10 supplementation. The results also showed a low inci- dence of side effects; only 36 patients (1.5%) reported mild side effects attributed to CoQ 10 . These positive results with CoQ 10 , however, were not seen in one clinical trial. In this double-blind study, 55 patients with CHF NYHA classes III and IV, ejection fraction of less than 40%, and peak oxygen consumption less than 50% during standard therapy were randomly assigned to receive CoQ 10 (200 mg) or placebo. Analysis indicated that there were no changes in ejection fraction, peak oxygen consumption, or exercise duration in either group. Possible explanations for failure to achieve a therapeutic benefit in this study may include the insufficient strength of CoQ 10 to produce significant effects in more severe stages of CHF or the fact that blood levels of CoQ 10 did not reach sufficient levels. Although the mean serum concentration of CoQ 10 increased from 0.95 mcg/mL to 2.2 μ g/mL in 19 of 22 patients on CoQ 10 , blood levels were below the suggested threshold of 2.5 mcg/mL.26

## Arginine

Another amino acid of value in CHF is arginine, although via totally different mechanisms from those of other nutrients. Patients with CHF are less able to achieve peripheral vasodilation during exercise due to endothelial dysfunction. Because the endothelial cells make the natural vasodilator nitric acid from arginine, several researchers have evaluated the efficacy of arginine in improving CHF. The first study of orally administered arginine showed promising results. In a ran- domized double-blind placebo-controlled study of 5.6 to 12.6 g/day of oral l-arginine, peripheral blood flow was found to increase by 29%; in addition, 6-minute walking distance increased by 8% and arterial compliance by 19%.27 Subsequent studies have shown arginine sup- plementation to improve endothelial cell and renal function (as shown by improvements in glomerular filtration rate, natriuresis, and plasma endothelin level) in patients with CHF.28,29 The use of arginine is cau- tioned by a report in one study in survivors of myocardial infarction, where supplementation with arginine (9 g/day for 6 months) was asso- ciated with an increase in mortality compared with the placebo group (8.6% vs. 0%).30

## Crataegus oxyacantha (Hawthorn)

Preparations of Crataegus sp. appear to be quite useful in CHF, especially in the early stages as a sole agent and in the later stages in combination with digitalis cardioglycosides. The effectiveness of Crataegus in CHF has been repeatedly demonstrated in double- blind studies.31–33 For example, 30 patients with CHF (NYHA stage II) were assessed in a randomized double-blind study.32 Treatment consisted of a Crataegus extract standardized to contain 15-mg pro- cyanidin oligomers per 80-mg capsule. Treatment duration was weeks, and the substance was administered at a dosage of one cap- sule taken twice daily. The group receiving the Crataegus extract showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of changes in heart function as determined by standard testing pro- cedures. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also mildly reduced. As in all other studies with Crataegus extracts, no adverse reactions occurred. In another study, 78 patients with CHF (NYHA stage II) were given either 600 mg of standardized Crataegus extract or placebo daily.33 The parameter used to measure effectiveness was the patient’s working capacity on a bicycle ergometer. After 56 days of treatment, the Crataegus group had a mean increase of 25 W compared with the placebo group’s increase of only 5 W. In addition, the Crataegus group experienced a mild but significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (171–164 mm Hg) and heart rate (115–110 beats per min- ute). There was no change in blood pressure or heart rate in the pla- cebo group. In patients with NYHA stage III CHF, Crataegus may not be suffi- cient to produce clinical effects. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 120 ambulatory patients with NYHA class II to III CHF, patients received conventional medical therapy as tolerated and were random- ized to either hawthorn 450 mg twice daily or placebo for 6 months. The primary outcome at 6 months was a change in the 6-minute walk distance. Secondary outcomes included QoL measures, peak oxygen consumption, and anaerobic threshold during maximal treadmill exercise testing, NYHA classification, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), neurohormones, and measures of oxidative stress and inflam- mation. There were no significant differences between groups in the 6-minute walk distance or on measures of QoL, functional capacity, neurohormones, oxidative stress, or inflammation. However, a modest difference in LVEF favored hawthorn.34

## Terminalia arjuna

A traditional Ayurvedic botanical for cardiac failure has been shown to be effective in controlled clinical studies. Twelve patients with severe refractory congestive heart failure (class IV NYHA) received an extract (500 mg every 8 hours) from the bark of Terminalia arjuna or placebo for 2 weeks. Those receiving the medicinal plant experi- enced, according to echocardiographic evaluation, statistically signif- icant improvements in several parameters of cardiac function, such as end-systolic volume and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). A second, uncontrolled phase of the study using a combination of T. arjuna with conventional medication found that after 2 years, nine patients showed a remarkable improvement to NYHA class II, with the other three improving to class III.35 In addition, a 12-week, dou- ble-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled, add-on clinical trial of arjuna extract in patients with CHF demonstrated improve- ment in functional capacity, antioxidant reserves, and symptom- related QoL domains.36


Treatment with diet and the natural agents as described earlier is effective in the initial stages of CHF (i.e., NYHA stages I and II; Fig. 161.2). In later stages, adjunctive drug therapy is usually neces- sary. Treatment is designed to address the underlying pathophysiol- ogy and to improve myocardial function through improved energy production.


Patients should be encouraged to achieve their ideal body weight, restrict sodium intake (below 1.8 g daily), increase the consump- tion of plant foods in the diet, reduce the intake of saturated fat, and follow the other dietary guidelines given for lowering blood pressure.


Exercise training can produce significant benefits in patients with heart failure. A review of meta-analyses and randomized, controlled trials of exercise training in patients with heart failure demonstrated that exercise training improves functional capacity, QoL, hospitalization, and systolic and diastolic function in patients with heart failure (Fig. 161.3).37 Exercise is beneficial for patients with heart failure with or without systolic dys- function, although subtle differences in prescriptions may be required.

## Sauna

Far-infrared sauna (FIR) has shown benefit for individuals with diag- nosed CHF (NYHA functional class II or III). Compared with a control group that was only treated with bed rest, the FIR sauna group experi- enced improvement in endothelial-dependent dilation of the brachial artery after only 10 sauna sessions.38 Whereas the control group had no change in improved blood flow or CHF symptoms, 17/20 in the sauna group reported an improvement in clinical symptoms. FIR daily for 4 weeks produced statistically significant reductions in systolic blood pressure and significant improvements in left ventricular ejection frac- tion, exercise tolerance, increased peak respiratory flow, and anaerobic threshold in patients with CHF.39


Magnesium: 200 to 400 mg three times a day Thiamine: 200 to 250 mg a day l-Carnitine: 500 to 1000 mg three times a day CoQ 10 : 100 to 300 mg a day Arginine: 1000 to 2000 mg three times a day

colonic or anorectal function, whereas secondary causes are related to organic disease, systemic disease, or medications. Primary causes can be further subdivided into normal-transit constipation, slow-tran- sit constipation, and anorectal dysfunction according to their patho- physiology (Fig. 162.1). Organic causes of constipation are the least common and include Hirschsprung’s disease, anorectal malformation, spina bifida, and hypothyroidism. Functional constipation is usually caused by one or a combination of the following: dehydration, dysbi- otic bowel flora, food sensitivity, and inadequate fiber intake. Pathogenesis is multifactorial, with focuses on the type of diet, genetic predisposition, colonic motility, and absorption, as well as behavioral, biological, and pharmaceutical factors. Furthermore, low-fiber dietary intake, inadequate water intake, sedentary lifestyle, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), failure to respond to urge to defe- cate, and slow transit have been revealed to be associated with a pre- disposition. Table 162.1 provides a more complete list of causes of constipation. Several factors are vital to normal gut motility, including immune and nervous system function, bile acid metabolism and mucus secre- tion, and the gastrointestinal microbiota. An imbalance or dysfunction in any of these components may contribute to aberrant gut motility and, consequently, symptoms of constipation (Fig. 162.2). Normal- transit constipation is the most common form of constipation seen by clinicians. Although patients report symptoms they believe are consistent with constipation, such as the presence of hard stools or a perceived difficulty with evacuation, stool transit is not delayed, and stool frequency is typically within the normal range.6 Slow-transit con- stipation causes infrequent bowel movements (typically less than once per week) and is most common in young women. Colonic transit time is prolonged in these patients, and patients may complain of associ- ated bloating and abdominal discomfort because they do not feel the urge to defecate.7 Defecation disorders (DDs) are a group of functional and anatomical abnormalities of the anorectum that lead to symptoms of constipation. Patients with DDs present with significant straining, often spending large amounts of time on the toilet daily, with frequent position changes and enema use. Dyssynergia, probably the most com- mon functional DD, is an acquired behavioral DD resulting from poor toilet habits, painful defecation, obstetrical or back injury, or brain– gut dysfunction.8

## Constipation in Children

Normal bowel movement frequency ranges from four stools per day in the first week of life to 1.2 per day at 4 years of age.9 Constipation in children usually occurs at three distinct points in time: after starting formula or processed foods (while an infant), during toilet training in toddlerhood, and soon after starting school (nursery school or kinder- garten). Factors that may contribute to functional constipation include pain, fever, dehydration, dietary and fluid intake, psychological issues, toilet training, medicines, and family history of constipation. As with adults, increasing fiber content usually produces the desired result. For children with a history of constipation, the initial step may be the elimination of milk and other dairy products from the diet. It is well accepted that cow’s milk intolerance (either allergy or lactose intoler- ance) can produce diarrhea. Dairy intolerance is also a major cause of childhood constipation.10 About 70% of cases of childhood constipa- tion are improved with the elimination of cow’s milk from the diet and substituting with nondairy milk alternatives (e.g., rice, almond, hemp, oat). Kids with constipation who respond to milk elimination also experience a decreased frequency of allergy symptoms (e.g., runny nose, eczema, asthma). Slippery elm is effective in treating constipation in children from months of age and above. The increased bulk stimulates peristalsis, and its mucilaginous properties create soft, slippery stools. From 12 months of age, freshly ground flax seeds can be added to pureed fruit/vegeta- bles or mixed into water to increase fiber intake. Psyllium husks are slightly more abrasive than slippery elm and flax and thus may not be suitable to all children. Mineral oil and stimulant laxatives should be avoided unless necessary.

## Microbiota

Research between intestinal diseases and gut microbiota has gradu- ally revealed a connection between constipation and intestinal flora disturbance, providing a theoretical basis for microbial treatment in chronic constipation. Dysbiosis may be an effect as well as a cause of constipation.11 Significant differences in bowel flora populations have been found in constipated individuals compared with nonconstipated individuals. Fecal microbiota composition is correlated with colonic transit time, and the colonic mucosal microbiota composition is asso- ciated with constipation status. More specifically, the abundance of Bacteroides, Lactococcus, and Roseburia was found to correlate with faster gut transit time, whereas Faecalibacterium was directly correlated to slower transit time.12 Gut microbiota modulation can be affected by probiotics, prebi- otics, symbiotics, postbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota trans- plantation (FMT). Probiotics that have demonstrated a beneficial effect on bowel motion frequency and orofecal transit time include the following: • Bifidobacterium longum 46 and 2C13 • Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12, LKM512, and DN-173 01014,15 • Lactobacillus casei Shirota16 Normal-transit constipationMost common subtype Frequently overlaps with IBS-C Slow-transit constipation Mostly characterized by reduced phasic colonic motor activity Common in women Pelvic floor dysfunction Poor coordination of pelvic floor and anal sphincter Considerable overlap with STC and NTC Fig. 162.1 Types of constipation. Primary (idiopathic) constipation can be conceptually categorized into three main types: normal transit, slow transit, and pelvic floor dysfunction. IBS-C, Constipation predominant irrita- ble bowel syndrome; STC, slow-transit constipation. (From Tack J, Muller-Lissner S, Stanghellini V, Boeckx- staens G, Kamm MA, Simren M, Galmiche JP, Fried M.

## Toxins

Although uncommon, lead poisoning should be considered as a dif- ferential diagnosis in cases of unexplained acute abdominal pain in both adults and children. Although most cases of lead intoxication come from occupational exposures, traditional remedies, specifically Ayurvedic medicines, have been reported to contain toxic amounts of lead. A retrospective, observational case series from a tertiary care center in India evaluated the charts of patients who underwent blood lead level (BLL) testing as a part of a workup for unexplained abdom- inal pain between 2005 and 2013, and patients with lead intoxication (BLLs >25 μ g/dL) were identified.20 BLLs were tested in 786 patients, and high levels were identified in 75 (9.5%) of patients, of which a majority (73 patients, 9.3%) had a history of Ayurvedic medication intake, and only 2 had occupational exposure. Five randomly chosen Ayurvedic medications were analyzed, and lead levels were excep- tionally elevated (14–34,950 ppm) in all of them. Besides abdominal pain, other presenting complaints were constipation, hypertension, neurological symptoms, and acute kidney injury. Discontinuing the Ayurvedic medicines and chelation with d-penicillamine led to an improvement in symptoms and reduction in BLLs in all patients within 3 to 4 months.


Diagnosing constipation is primarily based on clinical history, physical examination, and initial workup to rule out secondary causes. A stan- dardized definition of constipation is given in the Rome IV criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). According to the Rome IV criteria, functional constipation is defined when two or more of the following symptoms are present for the past 3 months with an onset at least 6 months before diagnosis: (1) straining during at least 25% of defecations, (2) lumpy or hard stools in at least 25% of defecations, (3) sensation of incomplete evacuation for at least 25% of defecations, (4) sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage for at least 25% of defe- cations, (5) manual maneuvers to facilitate at least 25% of defecations (e.g., digital evacuation, support of the pelvic floor), and (6) fewer than 3 defecations per week.21 In addition, loose stools are rarely present without the use of laxatives, and the patient does not meet Rome IV criteria for irritable bowel syndrome. A history and physical examination are often all that is needed to confirm the diagnosis of constipation. The physical examination should include an assessment of “alarm” signs and symptoms (i.e., fever, abdominal distention, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, or poor weight gain). On abdominal examination, distention or a palpable “mass” may be appreciated in the lower abdomen. If treat- ment with fiber supplements and/or laxatives is unsuccessful, fur- ther workup is required. Blood tests such as complete blood count (CBC); thyroid function tests; blood glucose; and serum levels of electrolytes, calcium, and magnesium help rule out organic causes of constipation. Imaging studies, including abdominal x-ray, ultra- sound, colonic transit tests, defecography, magnetic resonance (MR) defecography, and colonoscopy, may also provide information on the etiology of stool retention (Fig. 162.3). Currently, there is no uniform standardization of tests, and robust normative data for all measures of function remain inadequate, particularly regarding age and gender stratification.


Constipation will often respond to self-management strategies that include a high-fiber diet, plentiful fluid consumption, and exercise. These recommendations are well accepted. In fact, there is agreement across the medical community that these recommendations should constitute the first step in the treatment of chronic constipation. The treatment time for constipation can range from a few days in simple cases to more than 12 months in severe cases.

## Fiber. It is well accepted that increasing dietary fiber is an effective

treatment of chronic constipation. High levels of dietary fiber increase both the frequency and quantity of bowel movements, decrease the transit time of stools, decrease the absorption of toxins from the stool, and appear to be a preventive factor in several diseases. The recommended daily intake is 25 to 35 grams of fiber from dietary sources. However, higher amounts may be more optimal for health, as the human evolutionary diet contained approximately 100 grams of daily fiber. Most Western diets provide only 10 to 15 grams of fiber per day. The health-promoting effects of insoluble fiber from the bran of grains is well documented and extends beyond just its laxative effects.22 The benefits of reduced stool transit time and increased fecal frequency may have more profound long-term benefits beyond the comfort that accompanies bowel regularity.23 In addition, a systematic review showed that soluble fiber improved constipation symptoms in IBS, with varying effects on abdominal pain.24 A whole foods–based diet focusing on a large intake of vegetables and fruits as well as unrefined whole grains and legumes should be foundational. Foods particularly effective in relieving constipation are bran and prunes. The typical recommendation for bran is ½ cup of bran cereal, increasing to 1.5 cups over several weeks. A mini- mum of six to eight glasses of water should be consumed when using bran. Whole prunes, as well as prune juice, also possess good laxa- tive effects. In one study, subjects suffering from chronic constipa- tion received either dried prunes (50 g per day providing 6 g of fiber [about 10 prunes]) or psyllium (11 g per day providing 6 g of fiber) for 3 weeks each, in a crossover trial with a 1-week washout period.25 Subjects maintained a daily symptom and stool diary. The number of complete spontaneous bowel movements per week (primary out- come measure) and stool consistency scores improved significantly with dried prunes compared with psyllium. However, straining and global constipation symptoms did not differ significantly between treatments. Four to eight ounces of prune juice or 5 to 10 prunes is usually an effective dose.


Moderate to vigorous exercise, such as jogging, brisk walking, and water aerobics, is associated with a decreased prevalence of constipation. In multivariate analysis, women who reported daily physical activity had a 44% reduction in risk of constipation (prevalence ratio [PR] = 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.44–0.70).26 One study reported that in the preparation for colonoscopy, patients who did walking exercise had better colon cleansing than those who rested.27 Most walking patients (97.3%) considered walking exercise more comfortable than taking the polyethylene glycol solution. In addition, two studies on children have reported a negative association between physical activity and constipa- tion. In the first study, children with moderate (615–1230 counts/15 seconds) and total activity ( ≥ 1231 counts/15 seconds) at the age of years had significantly less functional constipation in the fourth year of life.28 Additionally, children with physical activity of more than the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation of 60 min/day

had significantly less functional constipation in the fourth year of life. The second study was a cross-sectional evaluation that looked at fac- tors associated with constipation in 1900 schoolchildren from ages 7 to 12 in Turkey.29 Siblings with health problems, history of constipation in family members, abnormal oral habits, and little regular sporting activity were more common in constipated children than in those who were nonconstipated. Considering that insufficient physical activity and excessive sedentary behaviors are associated with constipation, incorporating exercise is advised as a preventative and, in some cases, therapeutic option.

Fig. 162.3 Refractory constipation and difficult defecation. (1) Patients who fulfill the criteria for functional constipation and those who have not improved with an increase in dietary fiber and the use of simple laxa- tives, and with no alarm features, often warrant further physiological assessment. (2) The three key physio- logical investigations are anorectal manometry, the balloon expulsion test, and a colonic transit study. (3, 4) If both anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion are normal, the results of colonic transit testing enable characterization of the disorder as functional constipation with slow (5) or normal transit (6). (7, 8) If both manometry and the rectal balloon expulsion test are abnormal, this is sufficient to diagnose a functional def- ecation disorder. (9) If only one of the anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion is abnormal, further testing using barium or magnetic resonance defecography may be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. (10) If defecography reveals features of disordered defecation, a diagnosis of a functional defecation disorder can be made. (8) If defecography is not abnormal, then the patient does not fulfill criteria for the diagnosis of a functional defecation disorder; further diagnosis then depends on the presence or absence of colonic transit delay (see previous 4–6). (11–13) Treatment of choice for disordered defecation is biofeedback. If there is no adequate response to therapy, further investigation may be considered at this point. The presence of a functional defecation disorder does not exclude the diagnosis of slow colonic transit. Thus depending on the results of the colonic transit study, the patient can be characterized as suffering from a functional defecation disorder with slow (12) or normal colonic transit. (13, 14) Slow colonic transit may result from a defecation disorder. If it is felt appropriate to distinguish between the two possibilities, the colonic transit evaluation may be repeated after correction of the defecation disorder. If transit normalizes, the presumption is that the delay was secondary to the defecation disorder; if not, the delayed colonic transit is presumed to be a comorbid condition, which may require therapy if there is no clinical improvement with the treatment of functional defecation disorder.

## Nutritional Factors


Magnesium-containing cathartics are used worldwide to treat chronic constipation.30 Absorbable magnesium powders, such as magnesium citrate, alginate, oxalate, or amino acid chelate, can be used to help relax and promote healthy peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the intestinal tract. In addition, magnesium salts are known for their osmotic effects, accelerating intestinal transit time and leading to bet- ter stool consistency. A study in healthy human subjects demonstrated that high doses of orally administered magnesium sulfate accelerate small intestinal transit time and modulate antroduodenal motility in the fasting but not in the postprandial state.31 A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial investigated whether a natural mineral water rich in magnesium sulfate and sodium sulfate (Donat Mg, 13g/L of dissolved mineral substances) may help improve bowel function.32 A total of 106 otherwise-healthy subjects with functional constipation were randomly assigned to consume 300 or 500 mL of a natural min- eral water, compared with placebo water, over a course of 6 weeks. Subjects documented complete spontaneous bowel movements, spon- taneous and overall bowel movements/week, stool consistency, GI symptoms, and general well-being in a diary. For the 75 subjects in the 500-mL arms, stool consistency of spontaneous bowel movements (p < 0.001) and the subjectively perceived symptoms concerning constipa- tion (p = 0.005) improved significantly with the natural mineral water compared with placebo.


Vitamin C to bowel tolerance can be used as a bowel flush and may have added benefits in immune-challenged individuals.

## Microbial Therapy

Microbial treatment mainly includes bacterial preparations such as probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics, and FMT. Due to their safety, con- venience, and curative effect, probiotic preparations have been widely accepted. Microbial treatment improves clinical symptoms, promotes the recovery of intestinal flora, and has no complications during the treatment process.

## Prebiotics

Prebiotics are defined as “a non-digestible food ingredient that ben- eficially affects the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of bacteria in the colon, and thus improves host health.”33 Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria feed on dietary plant fibers, allowing them to have strong populations and produce a tremendous amount of organic acids with far-reaching health benefits. Short-chain fatty acids help feed and fuel the cells of the colon and pre- vent dysbiosis and inflammation in the gut. Lactulose is a disaccharide manufactured from lactose that is poorly digested in the intestines. Lactulose is highly bifidogenic and is used in conventional medicine mainly for its laxative effects. Ingestion of lactulose was found to cause statistically significant increases in the frequency, weight, volume, and water content of stools and to produce stools of softer consistency compared with both baseline and placebo.34 An intake of 15 g/day of either inulin or short-chain fructose oligosaccharides (FOSs) results in significant increases in bifidobacterial levels and increases the absorp- tion of calcium and magnesium in the large intestine.35,36 Several stud- ies were conducted to evaluate the effects of galactooligosaccharide (GOS) administration on bowel function. Consuming 9 g/day of GOS was found to increase defecation frequency (from 5.9–7.1 movements per week) in elderly subjects over a 2-week treatment period.37 There was also a trend for easier defecation during the GOS phase of the trial. Randomized controlled trials evaluating the laxative effects of GOS in healthy adult subjects with a tendency to constipation found that a daily dose of 5 or 10 g of GOS produced significant improvements in defecation frequency.38 Foods high in prebiotics include artichokes, garlic, onion, leeks, asparagus, chives, legumes, peas, fruit, and okra.


Probiotics have long been used for the treatment of constipation. Studies have shown that specific probiotics may help decrease gut transit time in people with or without constipation. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy for several probiotic strains. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials combining data from a variety of probiotic strains found a significant reduction in whole-gut transit time (12.4-hr reduction; 95% CI: −22.3 to −2.5 hr) and increased stool frequency by an extra 1.3 bowel move- ments/week (95% CI: 0.7–1.9 bowel movements/week).39 Stool con- sistency was also significantly improved. Another systematic review evaluating the capacity of probiotics to speed intestinal transit time found that probiotics could significantly reduce intestinal transit time, with large effect sizes seen in two probiotic strains: Bifidobacterium lac- tis HN019 and Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010.40 The mechanism of action of probiotics may involve the enteric nervous system. In a mouse study, administration of Lactobacillus reu- teri has been shown to modulate reflexes that communicate with the brain.41 In addition, L. reuteri has been shown to selectively increase the excitability of myenteric neurons in rats and interact with the gut– brain axis through the modulation of enteric sensory nerves that affect gut motility and pain perception.42


Although there is a paucity of research surrounding the use of herbal medicine in constipation, several herbs have properties that may provide benefit. Carminative herbs work by relaxing sphincters in the gastroin- testinal tract and may aid in the treatment of constipation. Examples of carminative herbs include Mentha piperita, Foeniculum vulgare, Zingiber officinalis, Melissa officinalis, Chamomilla recutita, Rosmarinus officinale, Curcuma longa, and Cinnamomum zeylanicum. Demulcents, such as Ulmus fulva, Althea officinalis, and Glycyrrhiza glabra, are also sometimes used to ease constipation. From the whole plant, Aloe vera latex is a laxa- tive that is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.43

## Laxatives

Bulk-forming fiber supplements are preferred to other forms of laxatives. Fiber formulas act as bulking agents and can be composed of natural sol- uble fibers derived from psyllium seed, kelp, agar, pectin, and plant gums like karaya and guar. Fiber formulas may also be composed of purified semisynthetic polysaccharides like methyl-cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium. Psyllium-containing laxatives are the most popular and usually the most effective. Psyllium is derived from the seed of the plant Plantago ovago native to Iran and India. The laxative properties of psyllium are due to the swelling of the husk when it contacts water. This forms a gelatinous mass and keeps the feces hydrated and soft. The resulting bulk stimulates a reflex contraction of the walls of the bowel, followed by emp- tying. Bulk-forming fiber formulas most closely approximate the natural mechanism that promotes a bowel movement and are both safe and effec- tive in the treatment of chronic constipation.44 In difficult cases, the use of other laxatives is required to improve symptoms (Table 162.2). Conventional guidelines recommend daily polyethylene glycol (PEG) at a dose of 1 to 1.5 gm/kg per day for 3 to 6 days for initial fecal disimpaction, followed by a daily maintenance dose of 0.4 gr/kg per day for at least 2 months to prevent reaccumula- tion. A stimulant laxative should be added if PEG alone does not cause disimpaction after 2 weeks of treatment. Neuromuscular agents, such

as tegaserod, a serotonin type 4 receptor antagonist, may also be used to stimulate peristalsis and fluid secretion. Senna is a natural stimulant laxative that works by increasing the strength of contraction of the intestinal muscles. The laxative com- ponents are compounds known as sennosides. Senna should be used occasionally because tolerance can develop, and long-term use can lead to dependence. Senna is recommended to be taken on an empty stomach. Six to eight glasses of liquid should be consumed daily while taking senna or any other laxative. Stimulant laxatives may cause abdominal cramping, nausea, and increased mucus secretion. Less common side effects are associated with chronic use and are usually related to loss of potassium and other electro- lytes (e.g., muscle spasms, weakness, fatigue). A benign blackish-brown pigmentation of the lining of the colon (pseudomelanosis coli) may occur with prolonged use (at least 4 months) of senna due to the anthraqui- nones. This condition is generally reversible within 4 to 15 months after discontinuation. More significant side effects, including a sudden change in bowel habits that persists over a period of 2 weeks, rectal bleeding, or failure to have a bowel movement after use, require immediate attention. Stimulant laxatives may decrease the absorption of drugs that pass through the GI tract. Individuals taking oral medications should talk to their pharmacist or physician before self-medicating with senna. Senna may potentiate the action of digoxin and other heart med- ications due to potassium depletion. The use of senna with thiazide diuretics and corticosteroids may further decrease potassium levels. If stimulant laxatives are used for long periods of time, the bowels will need to be “retrained.” Table 162.3 provides recommended rules for reestablishing bowel regularity. The results of this procedure may take 4 to 6 weeks.

## General Recommendations

Constipation is a symptom, not a disease. The most common causes are inadequate consumption of dietary fiber, inadequate fluid intake, and/or a sedentary lifestyle. Determining the cause is the first step in treatment. In most cases, constipation is not serious and responds quickly to dietary and supplement strategies.


Follow the guidelines given in Chapter 5, Philosophy of Naturopathic Medicine. • Obtain 25 to 35 g of fiber daily from dietary sources. • Drink at least six to eight glasses of water per day. • Four to eight ounces of prune juice or 5 to 10 prunes is effective. • Incorporate a variety of prebiotic foods.


• Psyllium: 5 g one to two times per day. Mix each 5 g dose in at least 8 ounces of water immediately before consumption. After taking a dose of soluble fiber, drink a second glass of water. • Probiotics • Vitamin C: 1000 mg/hour to bowel tolerance • Magnesium: 300 mg to 2000 mg depending on individual sensitiv- ity and response. Dosage can be increased and repeated until the desired outcome is achieved.


• Consider demulcent and/or carminative herbs. • Senna: Follow manufacturer’s instructions on package label. The usual dosage recommendation is based on sennoside content: 15 to 30 mg sennosides at bedtime.

## 1251CHAPTER 163 Cystitis and Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome


The diagnosis of bladder infection is imprecise because clinical symp- toms and the presence of significant amounts of bacteria in the urine do not correlate well. As indicated in Table 163.2, only 60% of women with the typical symptoms of UTI actually have significant levels of bacteria in their urine. Equally important, however, is the fact that 20% have the more potentially serious involvement of the upper tract. In general, the diagnosis is made according to signs and symptoms and urinary findings. A pelvic examination is indicated if there is a history consistent with vaginitis or cervicitis or if there is confusion regarding diagnosis. Microscopical examination of the infected urine shows high levels of white blood cells (WBCs) and bacteria. Culturing the urine determines the quantity and type of bacteria involved. As shown in Table 163.3, Escherichia coli (from the colon) is by far the most common. The presence of fever, chills, and low back pain can indicate involvement of the kidneys. Those with recurrent infections should be examined by intravenous urogram to determine whether a structural abnormality is present.6 IC/PBS can also be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms over- lap with a variety of other disorders, including endometriosis, UTI, CPP, overactive bladder (OAB), and vulvodynia.7,8 Because there is no definitive diagnostic test, IC/PBS remains a diagnosis of exclusion. The presence of additional symptoms caused by other pain generators can confuse the diagnosis even further. Patients may not receive an accu- rate diagnosis for years. The median time between the development of IC/PBS symptoms and the diagnosis is approximately 5 years.9 CPP is pain lasting 6 months or longer that is severe enough to affect daily functioning or requires medical care.7 The specific etiology of CPP is often unknown and may be multifactorial.10 Gynecological conditions that can cause CPP include endometriosis, adhesions, pel- vic inflammatory disease (PID), cysts, and polyps.10 However, a retro- spective cohort analysis of a large primary care database in the United Kingdom found that only 20.2% of all cases of CPP had a gynecological etiology,11 and up to 55% of women had no known pathological cause for their pelvic pain.12 Gastrointestinal diagnoses represented 37.7% of cases, with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) accounting for 29.1%. Cystitis accounted for 30.8% of diagnoses in this population of women with noncyclic pain lasting for 6 months or longer. Up to one half of the women in primary care practices who have CPP may have more than one diagnosis for their pain. As described previously, it is com- mon for a patient with CPP to have both endometriosis and IC/PBS.10 Physical examination is a critical component of diagnosing IC/PBS. In patients with IC/PBS, this can be emotionally distressing because of pain, so it is important that the physician proceed slowly and care- fully.13 Because the bladder is a pain generator in IC/PBS, tenderness with single-digit examination of the trigonal area (bladder base or ure- thra) can help establish a diagnosis of IC/PBS, as can pain in the pel- vic floor or levator ani.7 Patients with IC/PBS tend to have urethral or bladder tenderness, whereas those with vestibulodynia have vestibular tenderness.14 Tenderness on single-digit examination of the vaginal fornices can help distinguish endometriosis from IC/PBS.13 Urinalysis can rule out hematuria, and urine culture is required to identify bladder infection.13 Cytology and computed tomography (CT) with double contrast when indicated (hematuria, history of smoking, 40 years of age and older) can help rule out urinary tract malignan- cies.15 Patients with results suggesting a malignancy should be referred to a urologist. Several optional diagnostic tests can help diagnose IC/ PBS. The presence of glomerulations seen on cystoscopy with hydro- distension may aid in the diagnosis of IC/PBS. A negative cystoscopic evaluation should never be used to rule out IC/PBS, because many patients with early IC/PBS will not have glomerulations.16 The potas- sium sensitivity test (PST) may indicate a defective bladder lining. The PST involves intravesical instillation of a potassium solution, which triggers symptoms of pain and urgency in patients with abnormal per- meability of the bladder surface.17 Intravesical instillation of an anes- thetic cocktail can be used as a diagnostic tool as well as a treatment. Known as the “anesthetic bladder challenge,” this test can help localize pain to the bladder.18,19

## Collection of Urine Specimen for Culture

The optimal clinical method for obtaining a urine sample is the voided midstream specimen. It involves cleaning of the urethral meatus or vaginal vestibule before the sample is collected. If vaginal epithelial cells are present, a new specimen should be collected. To avoid repeat- ing the collection, a satisfactory technique for the female, called the “clean catch,” consists of spreading the labia and cleaning the area with two gauze sponges moistened with an antimicrobial solution and a dry gauze sponge. The washing is accomplished by making a single front- to-back motion with each of the two moist sponges and then the dry sponge. While the labia are still held apart, a small amount of urine is allowed to pass into the toilet (or bedpan); then a midstream specimen is collected in a sterile container and immediately closed. Occasionally, the urine must be collected via catheterization. This is a more invasive procedure and carries with it a 1% to 2% chance of ini- tiating a UTI via the introduction of microorganisms into the bladder. Suprapubic aspiration is the most accurate method of urine collection, but obviously, it is also the most invasive one.

## Examination of the Collected Urine

Several methods are routinely employed in the detection of bacteria in the urine. They range from the use of dipsticks to microscopical examination and culture. For most accurate determinations, the urine should be examined within 1 hour. If examination must be delayed, refrigeration at 58°C preserves the urine for most routine examina- tions. However, culturing requires that the urine not be refrigerated for more than 8 hours.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dipstick Methods

The modern examination of urine specimens typically involves the use of reagent strips, which are dipped into the urine and removed. Parts of each dipstick are impregnated with chemicals that react with specific substances in the urine to produce various colors. Color standards, with which the color can be compared, are provided. Careful attention must be paid to match the dipstick to the color standard at the appro- priate time. Instructions accompany commercially prepared dipsticks. Dipsticks are invaluable for qualitative and rough quantitative analysis. Typically, they provide information on pH, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, hemoglobin, leukocyte esterase, nitrite, and uro- bilinogen. Some dipsticks also allow for the detection of WBCs and bacteria (including semiquantitative cultures). Urinary infections typically increase the number of WBCs present. The leukocyte esterase test is used to detect WBCs in the urine. Because many common organisms contain enzymes that reduce nitrate in the urine to nitrite (Box 163.1), the measurement of urinary nitrite pro- vides an inexpensive and rapid way to detect significant bacteriuria, but the findings should be confirmed by culture. Although both tests have a high specificity (approximately 95%), the leukocyte esterase test is approximately 80% to 90% sensitive, whereas the nitrite test is only approximately 50% sensitive compared with a quantitative culture as the gold standard. However, the combination of both tests improves the sensitivity up to 96%.20,21

## Microscopic Examination

Microscopic examination should be performed within the first hour after collection. A drop of fresh urine or a drop of resuspended sed- iment from centrifuged fresh urine is placed on a microscope slide, covered with a coverslip, and examined with the high-dry objective under reduced illumination. The presence of more than 10 bacteria per field in an unstained specimen suggests a bacterial count of more than 100,000/mL of urine. Smears may also be made using a Gram stain and examined under the oil immersion objective. The presence of WBCs further indicates an infectious process. The presence of large quantities of protein, WBC casts, or both in the micrographic examination may be indicative of renal involvement, most commonly pyelonephritis.

## Urine Culture

Typically, only quantitative cultures are used. After the introduction of diluted urine to the suitable medium and incubation, the colonies are counted and multiplied by the dilution factor to yield the bacterial count per milliliter. Bacteriuria is considered significant if it is more than 100,000/mL, but even 1000/mL is considered clinically significant in the presence of symptoms characteristic of UTI. Most physicians are now employing semiquantitative tests22 using dipsticks or glass slides coated with culture media. Colonies are counted, and the appearance is compared within 12 to 24 hours of incubation. For recurrent or chronic infection, sensitivity studies are often performed. In more than 95% of UTIs, a single bacterial species is the problem. When mixed bacterial species are grown, the probability of contami- nation is high. Recurrence of UTI after the initial bacterial infection is resolved is common.23 Staphylococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids, and lactobacilli are com- monly found in the distal urethra but rarely cause UTI. Symptoms of recurrent UTI include urgency, frequency, nocturia, and pelvic pain. Diagnosis is established by a positive urine culture.24

# COEXISTING CONDITIONS AND DIFFERENTIAL


Although bacterial cystitis usually appears acutely and by itself, IC/PBS typically manifests with comorbidities that include endometriosis, IBS, vulvodynia, and OAB. A detailed medical history and physical examination are the basis for diagnosing the cause of CPP. The use of questionnaires, such as the Pelvic Pain, Urgency Frequency Questionnaire (PUF), or O’Leary Sant Questionnaire (OLS) indices, may elicit information about uri- nary symptoms. Tenderness of the bladder base on pelvic examina- tion is a characteristic feature of IC/PBS that may help distinguish it from other causes of CPP.13 Optional tests, including laparoscopy and diagnostic imaging, may also be helpful.9 Additional useful information may be gained from the PST or intravesical anesthetic challenge.17 Endometriosis is characterized by the presence of endometri- al-like glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. Symptoms include pain in the lower abdomen, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia

## 1253CHAPTER 163 Cystitis and Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome

and can also include such voiding symptoms as dysuria and fre- quency.25 Endometriosis and IC/PBS frequently coexist in the same patient. In one study of women with CPP and bladder tenderness on examination, more than 70% had both endometriosis and IC/PBS.26 OAB is characterized by urgency with or without urge incontinence and usually includes frequency and nocturia. The key symptom is urgency.27 OAB and IC/PBS can coexist in the same patient. Urgency can be caused by detrusor overactivity, which usually can be demon- strated through urodynamic testing. Urgency is a common symptom of both OAB and IC/PBS, although the cause differs. In patients with OAB, urgency results in a strong desire to avoid leakage, whereas in patients with IC/PBS, urgency results in a strong need to void to relieve pain caused by bladder fullness.28 Vulvodynia is characterized by vulvar discomfort, often reported as burning pain. Pain can occur during intercourse, during vigorous activity, after intercourse, or even at rest. The etiology of vulvodynia is unknown, and the diagnosis is one of exclusion. Symptoms of vulvo- dynia that overlap those of IC/PBS include pain and dyspareunia but not frequency or nocturia; this can help distinguish vulvodynia from IC/PBS. It is also possible for a patient to have both IC/PBS and vul- vodynia. The history and physical examination are important in diag- nosing vulvodynia. A history of chronic pain at the vestibule lasting more than 3 months can suggest vulvodynia. Infectious causes may include viral, bacterial, or fungal organisms; therefore these must be ruled out as causes of vulvar pain. Vulvar dermatoses may also account for vulvar symptoms.29 Tenderness to pressure with a cotton swab at the vestibule is a hallmark of vulvodynia,29 whereas tenderness at the bladder base is typical of IC/PBS.


The primary goal in the natural approach to treating infectious cys- titis is enhancing normal host protective measures against UTI. Specifically, this means enhancing the flow of urine by achieving and maintaining proper hydration, promoting a pH that inhibits the growth of the organisms, preventing bacterial adherence to the endothelial cells of the bladder, and enhancing the immune system. In addition, several botanical medicines with antimicrobial activity can be employed.

## Increasing Urine Flow

Increased urine flow can easily be achieved by increasing the quantity of liquids consumed. Ideally, these liquids should be in the forms of pure water and herbal teas. Fresh fruit and vegetable juices should be diluted with at least twice the amount of water. The patient should be encouraged to drink at least 2 L of liquid, with at least half being simply pure water. The patient should also be advised to avoid such liquids as soft drinks, concentrated fruit drinks, coffee, and alcoholic beverages.

## Chronic Interstitial Cystitis

In addition to the general measures given later for cystitis, the focus for interstitial cystitis is on enhancing the integrity of the interstitium along with the lining of the bladder wall. The “leaky bladder urothelium” the- ory postulates that there is a problem with the glycosaminoglycan layer of the bladder epithelium, which results in making the bladder wall more permeable to potassium, causing inflammation and pain (Fig. 163.1). Urothelial dysfunction and signaling (increased permeabiliity; release of neuroactive compounds) CNS “wind-up” and PNS nociceptor sensitization Increased transduction and excitability Visceral organ allodynia/hyperalgesia and/or dysfunction Inflammatory mediators upregulation C-fiber afferent nerve upregulation Mast cell activation Fig. 163.1 Potential etiological cascade and pathogenesis underlying painful bladder syndrome (PBS)/inter- stitial cystitis (IC). It is likely that PBS/IC has a multifactorial etiology that may act predominantly through one or more pathways resulting in the typical symptom complex. There is a lack of consensus regarding the etiology or pathogenesis of PBS/IC, but a number of proposals include a “leaky epithelium,” release of neuroactive compounds at the level of the urinary bladder with mast cell activation, “awakening” of C-fiber bladder afferents, and upregulation of inflammatory mediators including cytokines and chemotactic cytokines (chemokines). Inflammatory mediators can affect central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous sys- tem (PNS) neural circuitry, including central “wind-up” and nociceptor sensitization, resulting in chronic blad- der pain and voiding dysfunction. BPS/IC is associated with diseases affecting other viscera and pelvic floors. (From Gonzalez EJ, Arms L, Vizzard MA. The role(s) of cytokines/chemokines in urinary bladder inflammation and dysfunction. BioMed Res Int. 2014;120525. PubMed PMID: 24738044.)

## 1254SECTION 6 Diseases

The elimination of food allergies to reduce inflammation appears to be a valid goal, even though the association between food allergies and cystitis is not well established. Food allergies have been shown to pro- duce cystitis in some patients. Repeated ingestion of a food allergen could easily explain the chronic nature of interstitial cystitis. For a complete discussion of food allergies, see Chapter 14. Education of patients with IC/PBS helps empower them to con- trol their symptoms and to be active participants in their own therapy. Patients should be counseled to avoid triggers that lead to increased IC/PBS symptoms. They should also be encouraged to reduce stress and use support groups to deal with the effect IC/PBS has on their daily lives. Dietary changes can provide relief of symptoms.30 Herati et al.31 established the prevalence and characteristics of food sensitivities in patients with IC/PBS and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). Validated questionnaires containing a list of 175 comestibles as well as pain questions were mailed to patients with IC/PBS and 286 with CP/CPPS. The researchers found that although patients with IC/PBS were more likely to be food sensi- tive than patients with CP/CPPS, these questionnaires showed that the symptoms of patients with both IC/PBS and CP/CPPS were aggravated by similar comestibles, such as grapefruit juice, spicy foods, alcohol, and caffeinated coffee. The findings also revealed that the symptoms of both groups of patients were improved by certain comestibles, namely, water and an antacid containing calcium glycerophosphate (Prelief).31 In 2007, a study done at Long Island University reported that over 90% of patients with interstitial cystitis experience an increase in symptoms when they consume certain foods and beverages, especially coffee, tea, soda, alcoholic beverages, citrus fruits and juices, artificial sweeteners, and hot pepper.30,32 Food restrictions have not been conclusively proved to help slow the progression of the disease or to improve its course. Usually food restriction should be weighed against the decrease in the patient’s qual- ity of life. After 2 weeks, patients are usually asked to start adding one food item back into their diets every 3 days to identify any specific ali- mentary sensitivity. Medical treatments include tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline being the most popular),33 anticholinergics to reduce symptoms of uri- nary urgency, and antihistamines for their efficacy in decreasing mast cell activation and reducing inflammation.34,35 Mast cells, once thought to be responsible for allergic reactions, have in some studies been shown to be critically important in interstitial cys- titis. Current evidence from clinical and laboratory studies confirms that they play a central role in IC/PBS.36 Histamine causes pain, swelling, and scarring and prevents the lining of the bladder from healing.37,38 Pentosan polysulfate sodium (Elmiron) is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved oral treatment heparinoid com- pound that is thought to replenish the defective bladder lining. According to one placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, when it is taken orally, only 1% to 3% of the active drug reaches the blad- der. Based on levels of improvement and side effects, treatment can be continued for 3 months and then extended as needed,39 which may be necessary for proper epithelial healing. Cimetidine, a histamine-2 antagonist traditionally used for acid reflux, has been used for IC/PBS with potential benefits. It has been shown to improve pain, nocturia, and overall symptom scores by about 50% in patients with IC/PBS, yet it showed no improvements in dysuria, frequency, relief after voiding, or incomplete emptying.40 Given the complex nature of IC/PBS, this is not surprising—it is sus- pected that it is not simply a histamine-driven condition, which is further confirmed with histological studies showing that cimetidine did not change mast-cell or B-cell concentrations but still improved patient symptoms.41 Second-line therapies include immunosuppressive agents like prednisone, which was used to treat severe IC/PBS in one small clin- ical trial.42 Thirty patients with the Hunner’s ulcer subtype of IC/ PBS showed considerable improvement after endoscopic submucosal injection of triamcinolone.43 Cyclosporine has been shown in clinical trials to relieve the symptoms of severe IC/PBS.44 Symptoms generally recur after treatment is discontinued. Intravesical therapy can be used for flare management. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is the only FDA-approved intravesical IC/PBS treatment.45 Intravesical instillation of anesthetic can bring immediate relief. A study of patients with IC/PBS receiving intravesical instillation of heparin and alkalinized lidocaine showed that this treat- ment provided immediate and sustained relief of pain and urgency.19 Various intravesical cocktails use combinations of heparin, lido- caine, sodium bicarbonate, gentamicin, and glucocorticoids for the treatment of patients with IC/PBS.46 Muscle relaxants, used to treat increased muscle spasticity of the pelvic floor associated with CPP, appear to have a beneficial effect. Cyclobenzaprine is an agent closely related to the tricyclic antidepres- sants. It is used at starting doses of 10 mg daily, which can be pre- scribed up to three times daily. Tizanidine is a centrally acting alpha 2 agonist shown to be superior to placebo in treating spasticity in several conditions. In addition, clonazepam has been useful in treating neu- ropathic pain.47 The American Urological Association recognizes the multiple facets of IC/PBS, suggesting the first line of therapy must be personalized, focusing on patient education, self-care practices, behavioral modifi- cation, and stress management.48

## Alternative Treatments

Biofeedback is another aspect of physical therapy that can provide beneficial results for pelvic pain. Through biofeedback, the patient can learn to control the musculature of the pelvic floor by visualizing the activity of the muscle on a computer and using the visual feedback to achieve conscious control over muscular contractions, thus breaking the cycle of spasm. Ger et al. studied 60 patients with intractable rectal pain, 70% of whom were diagnosed with levator spasm. Biofeedback was performed on 14 of the 60 patients for 30- to 60-minute sessions a week for 6 weeks. In 6 of the 14 patients (43%), pain relief was rated as good or excellent at the 15-month follow-up.49 A prospective trial using biofeedback and a rectal manometric balloon included patients with levator ani syndrome. The median pain score before bio- feedback therapy was 8 (on a 0–10 linear analog scale) and significantly improved to a median score of 2 after therapy. All patients reported nontender musculature after treatment.50

## Herbal Medicine

Katherine Whitmore, a urologist from Drexel University, found that the Chinese herbs Cornus, garden rhubarb, Psoralea, and Rehmannia decreased pain after 4 weeks in 61% of the subjects studied (n = 25). In months, an additional 22% of the subjects had a significant response.51 The most consistent research evidence was found for Centella asiatica (gotu kola) and horsetail (Equisetum arvense).51 Centella appears to address some other pathological features of chronic interstitial cystitis. Specifically, Centella extracts have been shown to improve the integ- rity of the connective tissue composing the interstitium as well as to heal ulcerations of the bladder.52 Horsetail (E. arvense) has astringent properties.53 Aloe vera, also known as the “burn plant,” has been used extensively to heal and relieve the pain of burns. In a small open-label, double-blind crossover study using a freeze-dried whole-leaf A, vera concentrate, three 600-mg capsules were given twice daily for 3 months, followed

or preceded by placebo. Of 12 patients with interstitial cystitis, 8 com- pleted the study, and 7 had significant symptom relief.54

## L-Arginine

l-arginine is an essential amino acid that increases the production of nitric oxide (NO), which is dependent on the enzyme nitric oxide synthetase (NOS). NO and NOS have antibacterial, smooth muscle– relaxing, hormone-releasing, and immune-modulating (by increas- ing T-cell counts) properties. In a randomized, double-blind trial of oral l-arginine in the treatment of interstitial cystitis, NOS produc- tion was found to be decreased in patients with interstitial cystitis and increased in patients with UTI compared with controls. l-argi- nine (1.5 g/day) was given to 10 patients with interstitial cystitis for 6 months. The urinary NOS was then measured and found to have increased, and clinical symptoms of frequency and nocturia improved in 8 of the 10 patients.55 The same authors performed a randomized, double-blind trial using 1.5 g of l-arginine per day for 3 months. At the end of this period, 6 (29%) of the 21 patients in the l-arginine group and 2 (8%) of the 25 patients in the placebo group were clini- cally improved. When an intent-to-treat analysis was done, no signifi- cant difference was found between the l-arginine and placebo groups, although Likert scales showed a significant difference in pain intensity and global scores, favoring those taking l-arginine.56 Another ran- domized controlled trial with l-arginine found no improvement in symptoms scores of interstitial cystitis compared with controls.57 The efficacy of l-arginine, NO, and NOS in the treatment of interstitial cystitis remains controversial.

## Quercetin

Quercetin is a naturally occurring flavonoid that inhibits histamine release from mast cells and has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It is rich in onions, seeds, citrus fruits, olive oil, tea, and red wine. A quercetin-containing compound was studied in 22 patients with interstitial cystitis given 500 mg twice a day for 4 weeks. Two patients dropped out of the study. Of the remaining 20 patients, 57% had a significant decrease in the O’Leary Sant Symptom and Problem indices and a decreased global assessment of pain (Likert scale; range 0–10).56 A randomized, placebo-controlled trial is needed to deter- mine the efficacy of quercetin.

## Cranberry Juice (Vaccinium macrocarpon)

Cranberries and cranberry juice have been used for the treatment and prevention of UTI for several hundred years. Several clinical studies of benefit in patients with UTI have shown mixed results. In one study, 0.5 L/day of cranberry juice produced beneficial effects in 73% of the subjects (44 females and 16 males) with active UTI.58 Furthermore, withdrawal of cranberry juice in the people who benefited resulted in recurrent bladder infection in 61%. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that cranberry reduces adherence of Escherichia coli to uroepithelial cells. E. coli accounts for up to 80% of UTI acquired in the community. The effect of cranberry on E. coli adherence is dose dependent; exposure to cranberry also can displace preattached E. coli.59 For bacteria to infect, they must first adhere to the mucosa. By interfering with adherence, cranberry juice greatly reduces the likelihood of infection and helps the body fight it off. This is the most likely explanation of cranberry juice’s positive effects in bladder infections. A large double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the effi- cacy of 300 mL of cranberry juice in 153 women (average age 78.5) with confirmed bacteriuria.60 Even this small an amount dramati- cally decreased the level of bacteria in the women’s urine and the fre- quency of recurrence of infection. Interestingly, the researchers used saccharin-sweetened juice. Because saccharin is a suspected carcino- gen, we strongly recommend avoiding this artificial sweetener. In one study of seven juices (cranberry, blueberry, grapefruit, guava, mango, orange, and pineapple), only cranberry and blueberry demonstrated inhibitory effects.61 Blueberry juice (Vaccinium augusti- folium) is a strong cousin of cranberry juice and a suitable alternative to cranberry juice in bladder infections. It must be pointed out that most cranberry juices on the market contain one-third cranberry juice mixed with water and sugar. Because sugar has such a detrimental effect on the immune system,62–64 the use of sweetened cranberry juice cannot be recommended. Fresh cranberry (unsweetened) or blueberry juice is preferred to avoid the deleterious effects of sugar consumption. Cranberry extracts are also available commercially in pill form. To compare the efficacy and cost of tablets with fresh juice for the pre- vention of UTI, 150 sexually active women between 21 and 72 years of age were studied in a randomized controlled trial for 1 year.65 Tablets were taken twice daily, as well as juice at 250 mL three times daily. Both cranberry juice and cranberry tablets significantly decreased the number of patients experiencing at least one symptomatic infection per year (20% and 18%, respectively) compared with placebo (32%). The mean annual cost of cranberry tablets was $624, whereas the juice cost $1400. Furthermore, total consumption of antibiotics was less in both treatment groups compared with placebo. Although the cran- berry tablets may be more cost-effective, it is important to remember that sufficient fluid intake is still important, so ample water should be ingested if tablets are used. Of interest, in a large trial of cranberry juice compared with placebo juice conducted among 376 British inpatients 60 years of age and older, the incidence of symptomatic UTI was also lower than anticipated in the placebo group, but there was no significant difference between groups.66 Both the active and placebo juices contained ascorbic acid. Another randomized controlled trial of 305 individuals with neu- ropathic bladder after spinal cord injury found that the ingestion of cranberry tablets did not reduce rates of UTI relative to the standard regimen.67 A large study looked at 319 college women presenting with acute UTI. In this double-blind, randomized trial, participants were fol- lowed up until a second UTI or for 6 months, whichever came first. The study concluded that an 8-oz dose of low-calorie cranberry juice twice daily gave no protection against the risk of recurrent UTI among college-aged women.68 The research juice was formulated to be sim- ilar to the commercially available Ocean Spray and was sweetened with Splenda (sucralose), exactly as is the retail juice. Batches of the tested juice were standardized to 112 mg per day of proanthocyanidin content. The placebo juice was formulated by Ocean Spray to imitate the flavor (sugar and acidity) and color of the cranberry beverage but without any cranberry content. In addition to other food and pharma- ceutical-grade substances, both juices contained ascorbic acid in their formulations. The most recent meta-analysis identified cranberry as a useful pre- ventive therapeutic in UTIs, with analysis of more than 1400 women in seven clinical trials. Cranberry was shown to reduce recurrence in women by 26%. The authors, however, still question cranberry as a treatment option, and the most effective form and dose are unclear.69 Last, there is a theoretical concern regarding the use of cranberry juice and the formation of kidney stones. Because cranberries are con- sidered an oxalate-containing food, it is thought that this may encour- age the formation of oxalate-rich kidney stones. However, urinary oxalate excretion does not increase after drinking cranberry juice, and none of the studies using cranberries has reported an increased inci- dence of kidney stones.70

## Acidify or Alkalinize?

Although many practitioners believe that acidification of the urine is the best approach in addressing cystitis, several arguments can be made for alkalinizing the urine. First, it is often difficult to acidify the urine. Many popular methods of attempting to acidify the urine, such as ascorbic acid supplementation and the drinking of cranberry juice, have little effect on pH at commonly prescribed doses. The best argument for alkalinizing the urine is that it appears to be more effective, especially in women without pathogenic bacteria in their urine. The best method for alkalinizing the urine appears to be the use of citrate salts (e.g., potassium citrate, sodium citrate). These salts are rapidly absorbed and metabolized without affecting gastric pH or producing a laxative effect. They are excreted partly as carbonate, thus raising the pH of the urine. Potassium citrate, sodium citrate, or both have long been employed in the treatment of lower UTI. They are often used as a “holding exer- cise” until the results of a urine culture become available. Some clinical studies support this practice. For example, in one study, women pre- senting with symptoms of UTI were given 4 g of sodium citrate every 8 hours for 48 hours.71 Of the 64 women evaluated, 80% had relief of symptoms, 12% had deterioration of symptoms, and 91.8% rated the treatment as acceptable. Of the 64 women, 19 were shown to have pos- itive bacterial cultures. There was more variation in response to treat- ment in the group with proved bacterial infection, with those having symptoms of urethral pain (7 of 10) and dysuria (13 of 18) improving more than those with symptoms of frequency (9 of 17) and urgency (6 of 13). These results were similar to those of a previous study demon- strating significant symptomatic relief and abacteriuria in 80% of the 159 women studied.72 Because of these positive results, it has been suggested that urine culture could be restricted to those women who fail to respond to alka- linization therapy. Restricting urine cultures to nonresponders would also lower health care costs.


Acupuncture is attracting the interest of patients with all kinds of uro- logical conditions. The use of acupuncture also gives urologists an opportunity to collaborate with other health care professionals, such as acupuncturists.73 Patients with IC/PBS can potentially gain benefit from 10 to 20 ses- sions of acupuncture.51 Alraek has been able to show in a study with 61 women that a traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis can be useful in cystitis.74 In a study of 14 patients, Rapkin and Kames found that 6 to 8 weeks of acupuncture reduced the pain of interstitial cystitis.75 One reported a case study involves a 31-year-old woman whose symptoms of interstitial cystitis were reduced with acupuncture to the kidney and bladder meridians.76 In a Norwegian study, 67 adult women with a history of recur- rent lower UTI were randomized into three groups: one receiv- ing acupuncture treatment, one receiving sham acupuncture, and one given no treatment. A statistically significant 85% of patients in the acupuncture group were free of cystitis during the 6-month observational period, compared with 58% in the sham group and only 36% in the control group.77 Although more clinical studies are necessary to thoroughly elucidate the efficacy of acupuncture, this safe treatment method seems to be a reli- able choice as a primary or adjunctive treatment option. Some practitioners also combine acupuncture with the Chinese herbal tradition, which can also be useful in the treatment of long-term chronic conditions.

## D-Mannose

D-mannose is a simple sugar that acts similarly to cranberry juice in that it helps prevent the pili of E. coli and other bacteria from adhering to the bladder wall. In fact, D-mannose is contained in cranberry juice but in lower doses than are available through specific supplementa- tion. Although there are no clinical trials available to support the use of D-mannose powder, a handful of research articles explaining its func- tion strongly support its use. One in vitro study evaluated the effect of D-mannose on 73 E. coli strains of epithelial vaginal and buccal cells from women who suffered recurrent UTI. Of the strains from urinary, vaginal, or anal isolates, 66 (90%) demonstrated adherence to vaginal epithelial cells. When applied, D-mannose completely inhibited the adherence of strains (42%) to epithelial cells and inhibited an additional 11 strains (18%) by at least 50%. Similar results were obtained with buccal cells. The inhibitory effect of D-mannose was similar regardless of the origin of the strains.78 Another study of Sprague Dawley rats given intravesicular injections of D-mannose found significant improve- ment in bacteruria in a dose-dependent manner in the animals given D-mannose.79 More recent studies further support the use of D-mannose and a prophylactic and possible therapeutic for chronic UTIs. Domenici et al. showed that 1.5 g twice daily of D-mannose for 3 days and then 1.5 g daily for 7 subsequent days resulted in negative urine culture, improvements in symptoms, and improved Urinary Tract Infection Symptoms Assessment (UTISA) scores. Further, it proved to be effec- tive as a prophylaxis for 6 months.80 Further studies confirm the benefit of D-mannose in acute cystitis in combination with other therapeutics such as cranberry.81 As a combination therapy, D-mannose has shown benefit when used with berberine, arbutin, birch, and forskolin in uncomplicated recurrent UTIs.82 This combination not only targeted uropathogens but also improved vaginal microflora overall, thus providing direct UTI effects but also lateral benefit. Jonathan Wright recommends an adult dose of 0.5 to 1 tsp three times daily mixed in a little water. It is sweet-tasting and has been used successfully in appropriately reduced doses for pediatric UTI as well. Admittedly, more research is necessary to fully evaluate the usefulness and efficacy of this therapy.


Many herbs have been used through the centuries in the treatment of UTIs (Table 163.4). The following sections discuss several whose use is supported by both folk medicine and scientific evidence.

## Arctostaphylos uva ursi

Most research has focused on the urinary antiseptic component, arbutin, of Arctostaphylos uva ursis (bearberry or upland cranberry), which typ- ically comprises 6.3% to 9.6% of the leaves.83 Arbutin is hydrolyzed to hydroquinone and glucose in the body. Hydroquinone is most effective in an alkaline urine. However, crude plant extracts are more effective medicinally than isolated arbutin.83 A. uva ursi, reported to be especially active against E. coli, also has diuretic properties.84 However, recent research has challenged this theory. It is believed that the main antimi- crobial constituent, arbutin, requires an alkaline environment to be acti- vated to hydroquinone. In fact, uropathogens may deconjugate arbutin independent of urinary pH and still prove efficacious. This also explains the clinical benefits seen when combining cranberry and A. uva ursi.85 The prophylactic effect of a standardized A. uva ursi extract on recurrent cystitis was evaluated in a double-blind study in women.86 At the end of 1 year, 5 of 27 women in the placebo group

had a recurrence, whereas none of the 30 women receiving A. uva ursi extract had a recurrence. No side effects were reported in either group. These impressive results indicate that the regular use of A. uva ursi, like cranberry, may prevent bladder infections. A. uva ursi has also been shown to be helpful in increasing the susceptibility of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to antibiotics like beta-lactams. A Japanese group studied the effect of corilagin, a polyphenolic compound from A. uva ursi, used against methicil- lin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Corilagin reduced the minimal inhibitory concentration of oxacillin and other beta-lactam anti- biotics by 100- to 2000-fold. The effect of corilagin and oxacillin was synergistic and bactericidal. Some other antibiotics studied were not enhanced by corilagin. The authors also mentioned that catechins, compound P, and epicatechin gallate from green tea, as well as baicalin from Scutellaria amoena, may also produce similar effects.87 Although there has been worry about the use of A. uva ursi, due to the content of arbutin and hydroquinone, there has been no direct human data indicating arbutin or hydroquinone conjugates to be toxic. It appears that humans are able to eliminate the hydroquinone as conjugates at a rate that is negligible to humans. However, it would be prudent to be aware of toxic signs, including the following88: • Ringing in the ears • Nausea • Vomiting • Sense of suffocation • Shortness of breath • Convulsions • Delirium • Collapse

## Allium sativum

Garlic has been shown to have antimicrobial activity against many dis- ease-causing organisms, including those associated with urinary tract infections, such as the following89,90: • E. coli • Proteus spp. • Klebsiella pneumoniae • Staphylococcus spp. • Streptococcus spp.

## Hydrastis canadensis

Goldenseal is among the most effective of the herbal antimicro- bial agents. Its long history of use by herbalists and naturopathic physicians for the treatment of infection is well documented in the scientific literature. Of particular importance here is its efficacy against E. coli, Proteus species, Klebsiella species, Staphylococcus spe- cies, Enterobacter aerogenes (large dose required), and Pseudomonas species.91,92


Although most cases of cystitis are relatively benign, it is extremely important that the patient be properly diagnosed, treated, and mon- itored. Proper monitoring includes having the patient notify the phy- sician of any change in his or her condition. If the original culture was positive, it is appropriate to follow up with another culture 7 to days after treatment was started. Citrates can be used to ameliorate symptoms. Because of the possibility of a kidney infection, patients should notify their physician if there is fever, low back pain, nausea, or vomiting. Pyelonephritis requires immediate antibiotic therapy and sometimes hospitalization. Although the occasional acute bladder infection is easily treated, treating women with chronic cystitis can be a significant challenge. Long-term success requires determining the underlying cause: struc- tural abnormalities, excessive sugar consumption, food allergies, nutritional deficiencies, chronic vaginitis, local foci of infection (e.g., prostate, kidneys), and current or childhood sexual abuse. All potential causes must be evaluated and resolved. Although the causative agents of cystitis have not changed over time, bacterial resistance to antibiotics is fast becoming an issue; even one-time cases of simple acute cystitis have become recalcitrant.87,93 Resistance to common antibiotics—including trimethoprim-sulfame- thoxazole, beta-lactam drugs, and fluoroquinolone—is emerging at an alarming rate. In this milieu, it makes sense to use natural therapeutics that involve fluid intake to protect the urinary tract, immune support, plus nutrient and botanical medicines as first-line therapy in nonpy- elonephritic cases and as adjunctive therapy to increase the efficacy of antibiotic treatment if necessary.

## General Measures

Patients should be advised to drink large amounts of fluids (at least L/day), including at least 0.5 L of unsweetened cranberry or 0.25 L of blueberry juice. Patients should be taught to urinate after intercourse. Women who develop bladder infections after intercourse should wash the labia and ure- thra with a strong tea of H. canadensis (2 tsp/cup) both before and after. If this is inadequate, a dilute solution of povidone-iodine usually proves effective.


UTIs are mostly ascending infections caused by bacteria derived from stools. Because alterations in the bacterial composition of stools depend on the diet, it is reasonable that the risk for infection will change with dietary modifications. Patients should avoid all simple sugars, refined carbohydrates, full-strength fruit juice (diluted fruit juice is accept- able), and food allergens. Yogurt products with live probiotics are also recommended. Patients should restrict calories and eat liberal amounts of garlic and onions. Patients with IC/PBS should exclude coffee, tea, soda, alcoholic beverages, citrus fruits and juices, artificial sweeteners, and hot pep- per from their diets. Other foods, such as gluten and dairy products, may also be suspect. Although no scientific data exist to support or reject this hypothesis, the authors believe, on the basis of clinical experience, that patients benefit from the exclusion of these foods.94 An elimination/challenge diet may be worthwhile for this group of patients.

## 1260SECTION 6 Diseases

lesions found in patients with DH are extremely itchy grouped vesicles most frequently located on extensor surfaces. Intense pruritus is the predominant symptom; however, DH is a clinical chameleon and can present with excoriations, eczematous lesions, or minimal patterns of discrete erythema or digital purpura.9

# PATHOGENESIS OF DH: FROM GUT TO SKIN

At the present time, the immunopathogenesis of DH is believed to originate from occult CD in the gut with a tissue transglutaminase (TG2) autoantigen response, and possibly also an IgA epidermal trans- glutaminase (TG3) autoantibody response (Fig. 164.2). This results in an immune complex deposition of high-avidity IgA TG3 antibodies to the TG3 enzyme in the papillary dermis. This mechanism is supported by GFD results. TG3 and TG2 antibodies in serum disappear with the diet, the small intestine heals, and eventually the rash clears. However, the IgA–TG3 complexes in the dermis disappear quite slowly with the GFD, presumably because the active TG3 enzyme in the complexes results in cross-linkage of the complex to the dermal structures.10

## Gluten

The most important factor in the treatment of patients with DH is the elimination of all sources of gluten. Frazer’s criteria for the diagnosis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy (improvement on a GFD and relapse after reintroduction) have been used in many studies and have shown conclusively that the rash and villous atrophy of DH are largely gluten dependent.11–16 Gluten elimination results in an improvement in vir- tually all patients, including the elimination of the reticulin and gluten antibodies found in patients with DH.3,17 Further study of the wheat connection has shown that the gliadin polypeptide of gluten is most likely the key antigen. Indirect immuno- fluorescence shows antibodies to gliadin in the sera of 45% of patients with DH. The titer and correlation increase with increasing severity of the disease; 81% of patients with severe jejunal abnormalities show antibodies to gliadin.18 Despite the published benefits of a GFD in the treatment of DH for more than 30 years, this treatment is still often omitted from conventional dermatology and medical textbooks. The advantage of a GFD over drugs like dapsone (the most widely prescribed drug for DH) is obvious because this drug is often associated with severe side effects. In contrast, with a GFD: • Most patients (more than 65%) experience complete resolution, and the rest improve substantially. • There is complete resolution of the enteropathy associated with DH. • Harsh medications can be eliminated or substantially reduced. • Most patients experience an improved sense of well-being. Also of importance is that individuals who used a GFD rather than drugs are protected against developing non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)19 because the risk of NHL is significantly increased in DH and CD.

## Food Allergy

Although gluten control is critical in the treatment of patients with DH, some (about 35%) are not adequately helped. In particular, only 50% of patients totally eliminate the cutaneous IgA deposits and develop normal jejunal tissue. This is probably because of the presence of other food allergies that, although not initiating, devel- oped as a result of the increased leakage of macromolecules across the damaged intestinal mucosa. Milk has been found to be signifi- cantly problematic in some patients.20,21 Using a sensitive enzyme- linked immunoassay (ELISA), 75% of DH patients were shown to have serum antibodies reactive against gliadin, bovine milk, or ovalbumin.22 These results suggest that other food sensitivities are implicated in DH. An elemental diet followed by careful food rein- troduction usually produces better results than a simple gluten-free diet.23

<!-- chunk -->

## Para-Aminobenzoic Acid

Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) has been used successfully in the con- trol of DH, even in those patients who are not controlling the gluten content of their diet.24 However, because its use is recommended only for symptom control and it probably does not result in repair of the villous atrophy, it is not recommended as the treatment of choice but rather as an adjunct in unresponsive cases or to assist in particularly severe cases.

## Treatment of Nutritional Deficiencies

Evaluations for deficiencies of iron, zinc, calcium, fat-soluble vitamins, and folic acid should be conducted; also, the possibility of homocys- teinemia, osteopenia, and osteoporosis should be assessed and treated if found.


After all sources of gluten and gliadin have been eliminated (see Appendix 6 for the gluten content of foods), a careful search should be made for other food allergies (for more detail, see Chapter 14). Once allergens have been identified and avoided, a therapeutic regimen similar to that for atopic dermatitis (see Chapter 150) should be used. Patience is necessary because a response may take several weeks to months to be seen.


Use a healthy, whole-foods diet free of processed foods, gluten-con- taining grains, and foods found to be allergenic.

## 1263CHAPTER 165 Diabetes Mellitus Types I and II

T2DM is a disease characterized by progressive worsening of gly- cemic control, which starts with mild alterations in postprandial glu- cose homeostasis followed by an increase in fasting plasma glucose and often ultimately a lack of production of insulin and the need for insulin therapy. There are other types of diabetes, such as latent autoimmune dia- betes of the adult, sometimes termed type 1.5. This is a slower-onset autoimmune type of diabetes that occurs later in life, often after people reach 35 years of age. Diabetes may also occur as a result of chronic pancreatitis and other insults to the pancreas. Gestational diabetes, another type, affects about 4% of all pregnant women, adding up to about 135,000 cases in the United States each year. This occurs in women who were not diabetic before they became pregnant but devel- oped diabetes during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes occurs more frequently among African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, and American Indians. It is also more common among obese women and women with a family history of diabetes. After pregnancy, 5% to 10% of women with gestational diabetes are found to have T2DM. Women who have had gestational diabetes have a 20% to 50% chance of developing diabetes in the following 5 to 10 years. The least com- mon types of diabetes are genetic disorders, such as neonatal diabetes and mature-onset diabetes of youth, which are generally due to faulty genes causing impaired insulin function.

## Prediabetes and Metabolic Syndrome

Prediabetes (also called “impaired glucose tolerance”) is characterized by a glycosylated hemoglobin (A 1c ) from 5.7% to 6.4%, a fasting glu- cose between 100 and 125 mg/dL, and/or a postprandial glucose of to 199 mg/dL. It is the first step in insulin resistance and estimated to affect more than 60 million Americans. Many people with prediabetes will go on to develop full-blown T2DM despite the fact that prediabe- tes is usually reversible and, in most cases, diabetes can be completely avoided through dietary and lifestyle changes. Factors implicated in contributing to prediabetes, insulin resistance, and the progression to T2DM include a diet high in refined carbohydrates, particularly high-fructose corn syrup; an elevated intake of saturated fats; overeat- ing due to increased portion sizes of food; increases in inflammatory markers; lack of exercise; industrial pollution; abdominal weight gain; hormonal imbalances; inadequate sleep; and nutritional deficiencies. Research increasingly indicates that prediabetes is accompanied by serious health risks, especially an increased risk for cardiovascular dis- ease. Individuals with prediabetes often meet the criteria for the met- abolic syndrome (MetS). This is a cluster of factors that together carry a significantly greater risk for cardiovascular disease and the develop- ment of T2DM. They include the following: • Greater waist-to-hip ratio • Two of the following: • Triglycerides greater than 150 mg/dL • High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) less than 40 mg/ dL for men, less than 50 mg/dL for women • Blood pressure equal to or greater than 130/85 mm Hg • Fasting plasma glucose equal to or greater than 100 mg/dL By this definition and using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2012), the prevalence of MetS in the United States is 34.2% among men and women aged 18 and above.1 Among adolescents and using a similar definition, approximately 5.8% meet the established criteria.2 In addition to an elevated risk for car- diovascular disease and diabetes, individuals with MetS report poorer health-related quality of life, both physically and mentally.3


The classic symptoms of T1DM are frequent urination, weight loss, impaired wound healing, infections, and excessive thirst and appetite. Such individuals may suffer from diabetic ketoacidosis upon diagnosis, and they are usually lean in presentation. In T2DM, the symptoms are generally milder and may go unnoticed. For that reason and others, many people with T2DM do not even know that they have the disease. Abdominal obe- sity, fatigue, blurred vision, poor wound healing, periodontal disease, and frequent infections are often manifesting symptoms of T2DM. The standard method for diagnosing diabetes involves the mea- surement of blood glucose levels. The initial measurement is generally a fasting blood glucose taken after the patient has avoided food for at least 10 hours but not more than 16. The normal reading is between 70 and 99 mg/dL. If a person has a fasting blood glucose measure- ment greater than 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) on two separate occasions, the diagnosis is diabetes. As mentioned previously, a fasting glucose greater than 100 but less than 126 mg/dL is classified as prediabetes. A postprandial and a random glucose determination are also help- ful in diagnosing diabetes. A postprandial measurement is usually made 1 to 2 hours after a meal, whereas a random measurement is

## 1264SECTION 6 Diseases

one that is made at any time during the day without regard to the time of the last meal. Any reading greater than 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L) is considered indicative of diabetes (Table 165.2).

<!-- chunk -->

## Glycosylated Hemoglobin

The measurement glycosylated HgbA 1c is a valuable laboratory test for evaluating long-term blood glucose levels. Proteins that have glucose molecules attached to them (glycosylated peptides) are elevated several- fold in diabetic patients. Normally, about 4.6% to 5.7% of hemoglo- bin is combined with glucose. An HgbA 1c from 5.7% to 6.4% indicates prediabetes. An HgbA 1c of 6.5% or higher, particularly when done as a screening test, can diagnose diabetes and is particularly helpful in patients with nondiagnostic fasting blood sugar levels. Nonetheless, it is best coupled with a fasting blood glucose measurement and a 2-hour postprandial glucose level for a more accurate diagnosis. Because the average life of a red blood cell (RBC) is 120 days, the HgbA 1c assay represents time-averaged values for blood glucose over the preceding 2 to 4 months. An HgbA 1c at 5% indicates that the glucose median for the previous 3 months was around 100 mg/dL; for each digit of elevation in the percentage, a rough addition of 35 mg/dL is followed. Thus an HgbA 1c of 7% means that on average over the preceding months, the patient’s blood glucose was 170 mg/dL. The HgbA 1c index is extremely valuable in providing a simple, useful method for assessing the effectiveness of treatment as well as patient compliance; it should be checked every 3 to 6 months.4

# RISK FACTORS FOR TYPE 1 DIABETES

In T1DM the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas are ultimately destroyed, in most cases by the body’s own immune system, but what triggers this destruction can vary from one case to another. Genetic fac- tors may predispose a person to damage to the insulin-producing cells through either impaired defense mechanisms, immune system sensitivity, or a defect in tissue-regeneration capacity. The entire set of genetic fac- tors linked to T1DM have been termed “susceptibility genes” because they modify the risk of diabetes but are neither necessary nor sufficient for dis- ease to develop.5 Rather than acting as the primary cause, the genetic pre- disposition simply sets the stage for the environmental or dietary factor to initiate the destructive process.6 The very term predisposition clearly indi- cates that something else must occur: less than 10% of those with increased genetic susceptibility for T1DM actually develop the disease.7 In detailed studies, the concordance rate for developing T1DM in identical twins was only 23% in one study8 and 38% in another.9 If one twin develops T1DM after age 24, the concordance rates drops all the way down to 6%, meaning that the other twin is at very low risk for developing the disease. These results and others indicate that in most cases, even where there is a true genetic predisposition, environmental and dietary factors may be more important in determining whether diabetes will develop.10 Additional evidence supporting the need to focus on dietary and environmental triggers follows: • There has been a threefold to tenfold increase in the number of peo- ple with T1DM throughout the world over the past 40 years. Such a rise simply cannot be explained by an increased number of people genetically predisposed to T1DM. Changes to the human genetic code across large populations take more than one generation.11 • The rate of T1DM can increase dramatically when children in areas where T1DM is relatively rare move to developed countries.12 For example, the rate of T1DM increased by nearly fourfold in one 10-year period in children of Asian origin moving to Great Britain, and the rate increased more than sevenfold in Polynesians migrat- ing to New Zealand.13,14 Genetic factors cannot explain such a rapid change.

## Environmental and Dietary Risk Factors

Accumulating data indicate that abnormalities of the gut immune sys- tem and microbiome may play a fundamental role in the development of the immune attack on beta cells and the subsequent development of T1DM.15 The intestinal immune system serves a vital role in processing the many food and microbial antigens to protect the body from infec- tion and allergy. What appears to happen in the development of some cases of T1DM is the development of antibodies by the gut immune system that ultimately attack the beta cells. Possibly an underlying fac- tor that may contribute to T1DM is poor protein digestion. Poorly digested dietary proteins can cross-react with antigens on or within the beta cells of the pancreas. In humans, two proteins that have had the highest degree of incrimination are those found in milk (which contains bovine serum albumin and bovine insulin) and wheat (which contains gluten). For example, dietary bovine insulin differs from human insulin by only three amino acids. If a person develops antibodies to bovine insulin, there is a good chance that these anti- bodies will also attack their own insulin. In addition to causing anti- body-mediated destruction of the beta cells, bovine insulin is able to activate T cells in those predisposed to diabetes in a manner that can also lead to beta-cell destruction by direct attack from T-killer cells. Strong evidence implicates dietary factors like cow’s milk and gluten as important triggers of the autoimmune process that leads to T1DM. In contrast, breastfeeding has been identified as an important factor in

establishing proper intestinal immune function and reducing the risk of T1DM. It is well known that breastfeeding confers a reduction in the risk of food allergies as well as better protection against both bacterial and viral intestinal infections. In case-controlled studies, patients with T1DM were more likely to have been breastfed for less than 3 months and to have been exposed to cow’s milk or solid foods before 4 months of age. A critical review and analysis of all relevant citations in the med- ical literature indicate that early cow’s milk exposure may increase the risk by about 1.5 times.14,16 In addition, although the risk of diabetes associated with exposure to cow’s milk was first thought to relate only to intake during infancy, additional studies showed that ingestion at any age may increase the risk of T1DM. There is also considerable evidence that sensitivity to gluten—the major protein component of wheat, rye, and barley—may also play a role. Gluten sensitivity produces celiac disease, another autoimmune disorder. Celiac disease, like T1DM, is associated with abnormalities in intestinal immune function. And as in the case of diabetes, breastfeed- ing appears to have a preventive effect, whereas the early introduction of cow’s milk is believed to be a major causative factor. The risk of developing T1DM is higher in children with celiac disease. Not surpris- ingly, the highest level of antibodies to cow’s milk proteins is found in people with celiac disease.17

## Enteroviruses and Type 1 Diabetes

Population-based studies, as well as prospective studies, have strength- ened the hypothesis that T1DM can be the result of viral infection both during pregnancy and after birth.18,19 A working theory in this regard is that the immune system becomes slightly confused as to which proteins to attack—the food-based ones such as those from dairy or gluten or the similar proteins on the pancreatic beta cells or insulin. When the person then has a viral infection, the increased stimula- tion of the immune system is the key that prompts it to become more active, and those confused immune cells begin to damage the pancreas. Gastrointestinal infections due to enteroviruses (e.g., polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses) and rotavirus are common, especially in children. All of these viruses replicate in the gut and stimulate the intestinal immune system, which may then activate the insulin-spe- cific immune cells to seek out and destroy beta cells. These viruses and others are also capable of infecting pancreatic beta cells, causing the leukocytes to attack and destroy the beta cells in an attempt to kill the virus. Gastrointestinal viral infections may also increase intestinal per- meability and enhance the antibody response to dietary bovine insu- lin as a result of increased absorption of the intact protein. The severe “leaky gut”—or increased permeability of the small intestine that occurs during and for some time after rotavirus infections (one of the most common causes of acute diarrheal illness in children)—exposes the gut-associated immune cells to large quantities of intact protein.

## Vitamin D Deficiency

Cod liver oil may offer significant protection against the development of diabetes because of its high content of vitamin D. The use of cod liver oil became popular during the 1890s to treat rickets, a vitamin D–deficiency disease characterized by an inability to calcify the bone matrix, resulting in softening of the skull bones, bowing of the legs, spinal curvature, and enlarged joints. Beginning in the 1930s, vitamin D was added to milk at a level of 100 IU per 8 oz. As a result, rickets is now uncommon in most developed countries. Emerging evidence indicates that vitamin D supplementation from cod liver oil and other sources during early childhood can prevent not only rickets but also T1DM.20 In fact, vitamin D fortification may off- set some of the “diabetogenic” effect of cow’s milk, but the dosage level in milk may not be sufficient to do so; the level that was shown to be protective was about 2000 IU—much higher than the amount typically ingested from the consumption of vitamin D–fortified milk. The most extensive study looking at vitamin D and T1DM enrolled all pregnant women in northern Finland who were due to give birth in 1966 (more than 12,000 women), and their children were then moni- tored until December 1997.21 Final analysis of 10,366 enrollees demon- strated that children who regularly took vitamin D, primarily from cod liver oil, had an 80% reduced risk of developing T1DM, whereas those who had a vitamin D deficiency actually had a 300% increased risk of developing the disease. One study found that the use of vita- min D from cod liver oil during pregnancy significantly reduced the frequency of T1DM in the offspring.22 Furthermore, studies looking at vitamin D status in the blood of newly diagnosed individuals with T1DM have found much lower levels of the vitamin in these patients than in healthy controls. Because vitamin D can be produced in the body by the action of sunlight on the skin, lack of sun exposure during childhood may also play a role and partially explain the higher T1DM rates in northern countries. Vitamin D in recent research has been shown to prevent autoimmune conditions, including those that attack beta cells, from developing in the body, and observational studies have shown a dose-dependent degree of protection.23 This research indicates that ensuring adequate vitamin D supple- mentation during pregnancy and early childhood may reduce the risk of T1DM. Vitamin D is important for the normal development of the immune system. In addition, it has been shown that vitamin D inhibits some of the autoimmune reactions that target the beta cells.

## Omega-3 Fatty Acid Deficiency

In addition to the strong case that can be made for vitamin D as a protective factor, an equally strong case can be made for the benefits of the omega-3 fatty acids in cod liver oil and other fish oils. Human studies have shown that when essential fatty acids (EFAs) are given, the onset of T1DM was significantly reduced. Also, higher levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in RBCs have also been associated with reduced risk.24 For one thing, cod liver oil also provides both EPA and DHA, which are vital EFAs in humans. Other studies support the benefit of supplementing EFAs in pregnant women and children. The mechanisms responsible for this effect may be related to improved cell membrane function, leading to enhanced antioxidant status and the reduced formation of inflammatory compounds called cytokines.25

<!-- chunk -->

## Nitrates

Clear links between increased levels of nitrates (from both dietary sources and water) and an increased rate of T1DM have been estab- lished. Nitrates are produced by agricultural runoff from fertilizers and are found in cured or smoked meats such as ham, hot dogs, bacon, and jerky to keep the food from spoiling. Nitrates react within the body to form compounds known as nitrosamines. (Note: The U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA] requires all manufacturers of processed meats to add vitamin C to their products to prevent the formation of nitro- samines.) Nitrates and nitrosamines are known to cause diabetes in animals. Infants and young children are believed to be particularly vul- nerable to the harmful effects of nitrate exposure. One of the most alarming features of T1DM is that it is becom- ing much more prevalent, with a current growth rate of 3% per year worldwide. Some areas have been hit particularly hard, such as Finland, Great Britain, Canada, and the United States. Increased nitrate expo- sure may be a key factor; the nitrate levels in ground and surface waters of agricultural regions have increased over the past 40 years owing to the use of nitrogen fertilizers. Nitrate contamination occurs in geo- graphical patterns related to the amount of nitrogen contributed by fertilizers, manure, and airborne sources such as automobile and

industrial emissions. Nitrate exposure may explain why some geo- graphical pockets have substantially higher rates of T1DM.26,27 Circumstantial evidence from population-based studies also suggests that a higher dietary intake of nitrates from smoked/cured meats is associated with a significantly higher risk for T1DM. These foods severely stress body defense mechanisms and are to be avoided. The habit of feeding children hot dogs, cold cuts, and ham would be a good one for parents to break. Health food stores now carry nitrate-free alternatives to these toxic food choices. Also, investing in a high-quality water purifier is good insurance against ingesting nitrate-contaminated drinking water.

# EARLY TREATMENT AND POSSIBLE REVERSAL OF

# TYPE 1 DIABETES

Early intervention in T1DM designed to affect the autoimmune or oxidative process theoretically may be capable of lengthening the “honeymoon” phase or even completely reversing the process. This goal appears to have two candidates: niacinamide and epicatechin. Removing gluten and dairy from the diet and supporting gut health as well as immune system balance are also important considerations.

## Niacinamide

Niacinamide, also called nicotinamide, has been shown to prevent some of the immune-mediated destruction of the pancreatic beta cells and may actually help reverse the process in some patients.28,29 Observations that niacinamide can prevent the development of T1DM in experimental animals led to several pilot clinical trials that initially confirmed these observations and suggested that if given soon enough at the onset of diabetes, niacinamide could help restore beta cells or at least slow down their destruction. In one of the first pilot studies of people newly diagnosed with T1DM, seven patients were given 3 g of niacinamide daily, and nine were given a placebo. After 6 months, five patients in the niacinamide group and two in the placebo group were still not taking insulin and had normal blood glucose and HgbA 1c . At 12 months, three patients in the niacinamide group but none in the placebo group were in clinical remission.30 The results of this pilot study and others suggest that niacinamide can prevent T1DM from progressing in some patients if given soon enough at the onset of diabetes by helping restore beta cells. As of 2004, there had been 12 studies of niacinamide treatment in recent-onset T1DM or T1DM of less than 5 years’ duration and residual beta-cell mass. Ten of these were double-blind placebo-controlled studies, of which half showed a positive effect compared with placebo in terms of prolonged non–insulin-requiring remission, lower insulin requirements, improved metabolic control, and increased beta-cell function as determined by secretion of a substance known as C-peptide. The main differences between the positive and negative studies in recent-onset T1DM were older age and higher baseline fasting C-peptide in positive studies.31–34 Although some of the studies have shown positive results, it is important to point out that two large studies designed to evaluate the effectiveness of niacinamide in preventing the development of T1DM in high-risk individuals—such as siblings of children who developed T1DM or in individuals who already show elevations in antibodies directed against the beta cells—did not show niacinamide to be effec- tive. The first of these, the German Nicotinamide Intervention Study, did not show much of an effect with 1.2 g of niacinamide daily, and results from the larger study, the European Nicotinamide Diabetes Intervention Trial, did not show benefit with dosages as high as 3 g a day.35,36 A possible shortcoming of these studies was the choice of a timed-released niacinamide. It is possible that such a formulation did provide the peak levels of niacinamide required to block autoimmune mechanisms such as cytokine production.37 In the best-case scenario, niacinamide will likely work for only a few individuals with T1DM of recent onset. Nonetheless, the fact that some patients have had a complete reversal of their disease makes a trial of niacinamide worth the effort, especially because there is cur- rently no reasonable alternative. The dosage recommendation is based on body weight: 25 to 50 mg of niacinamide for every 2.2 lb of body weight or a maximum dosage of 3 g/day in divided doses. Niacinamide is generally well tolerated and without side effects. In fact, no side effects have been reported in clini- cal trials in T1DM. It does not cause the flushing of the skin character- izing high dosages of niacin. However, because it could possibly harm the liver, a blood test for liver enzymes should be performed every months to rule out liver damage.

## Epicatechin

The second natural compound that may offer benefit is epicatechin. The line of research on its potential role in T1DM of recent onset began with examining the bark of the Malabar kino tree (Pterocarpus marsupium). This botanical medicine has a long history of use in India as a treatment for diabetes. Initially, epicatechin extracted from the bark was shown to prevent beta-cell damage in rats. Further research indicated that both epicatechin and a crude alcohol extract of P. mar- supium were actually able to promote the regeneration of functional pancreatic beta cells in diabetic animals.38 Green tea (Camellia sinensis) extract appears to be a better choice than extracts of P. marsupium because the epicatechin content in a high-quality green tea extract is actually higher than that found in extracts of P. marsupium. Second, green tea extract exerts a broader range of beneficial effects. Green tea polyphenols also exhibit signif- icant antiviral activity against rotavirus and enterovirus—two viruses suspected of causing T1DM.39 Last, green tea extract is considerably easier to find commercially than P. marsupium. Recommended dos- ages for children below age 6 is 50 to 150 mg; for those 6 to 12 years old, 100 to 200 mg; and for children older than 12 years old and adults, 150 to 300 mg. The green tea extract should have a polyphenol content of 80% and be decaffeinated. Although the focus in the research has been on the reversal of T1DM, epicatechin may have more meaningful effects in preven- tion; epicatechin effectively prevented T1DM in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. At 32 weeks of age, 66.7% of control mice had overt diabetes, whereas only 16.6% of epicatechin-treated mice became diabetic. Consistently, epicatechin-treated mice had significantly higher plasma insulin levels but lower glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations compared with control mice. Treatment with epi- catechin elevates circulating anti-inflammatory cytokine inter- leukin-10 levels, ameliorates pancreatic insulitis, and improves pancreatic islet mass—all important factors that may help prevent T1DM by modulating immune function and thereby preserving islet mass.

# RISK FACTORS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES

Several factors are involved in the development and progression of dia- betes. The most well-accepted major risk factor for T2DM is obesity or, more precisely, excess body fat. Approximately 80% to 90% of individ- uals with T2DM are obese (a body mass index above 30). When adipo- cytes, particularly those around the abdomen, become full of fat, they secrete several biological products (e.g., resistin, leptin, tumor necrosis factor, free fatty acids, cortisol) that dampen the effect of insulin, impair glucose utilization in skeletal muscle, promote glucose production

<!-- chunk -->

## 1267CHAPTER 165 Diabetes Mellitus Types I and II

by the liver, and impair insulin release by pancreatic beta cells. Also important is that as the number and size of adipocytes increase, there is a reduction in the secretion of compounds that promote insulin action, including a novel protein produced by fat cells known as adiponectin. Adiponectin is associated not only with improved insulin sensitivity but also with anti-inflammatory activity; moreover, it lowers triglycerides and blocks the development of atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. The net effect of these negative actions of fat cells is that they severely stress blood glucose control mechanisms while also leading to the development of the major complication of diabetes: atherosclerosis. Because of all these newly discovered hormones secreted by adipocytes, many experts now consider the adipose tissue a member of the endo- crine system (e.g., the pituitary, adrenals, and thyroid).40 Measurements of blood levels of adiponectin and other hormones secreted by fat cells may turn out to be the most meaningful pre- dictors of the likelihood of developing T2DM as well as gestational diabetes.41,42 In the early stages of the increased metabolic stress produced by the various secretions of adipocytes and the lack of adiponectin, blood glu- cose levels remain normal despite insulin resistance because pancreatic beta cells compensate by increasing insulin output. As metabolic stress increases and insulin resistance becomes more significant, the conven- tional explanation is that eventually the pancreas cannot compensate and elevations in blood glucose levels develop. As the disease progresses from insulin resistance to full-blown diabetes, the pancreas starts to “burn out” and produces less insulin. Avoiding this occurrence is a key therapeutic goal and is achievable with good diabetes care and if a patient’s HgbA 1c remains at 5.7 or less. (See Box 165.2 for risk factors.)

## Genetics of Type 2 Diabetes and Obesity

In studies of identical twins, the concordance rate was between 70% and 90% for T2DM. This high concordance points to a strong genetic relationship. Data from family studies also provide additional support: children with one parent with T2DM have an increased risk of devel- oping diabetes at some point in their lives. If both parents have the disease, the risk in offspring is nearly 40%. However, even with the strongest predisposition, diabetes can be avoided in most cases.43

## The Case of the Pima Indians

The Pima Indians of Arizona have the highest rate of T2DM and obe- sity anywhere in the world. Research has demonstrated a strong genetic predisposition, but even with this strong tendency, the high rate of T2DM in this group is clearly related to diet and lifestyle. The Pima Indians living traditionally in Mexico still cultivate corn, beans, and potatoes as their main staples, plus a limited amount of seasonal vegeta- bles and fruits such as zucchini squash, tomatoes, garlic, green pepper, peaches, and apples. The Pimas of Mexico also make heavy use of wild and medicinal plants in their diet. They work hard, have no electric- ity or running water in their homes, and walk long distances to bring in drinking water or wash their clothes. They use no modern house- hold devices; consequently, food preparation and household chores require extra effort from the women. In contrast, the Pima Indians of Arizona are largely sedentary and follow the dietary practices of typical Americans. The results are astounding. Although roughly 16% of U.S. Native Americans have T2DM, 50% of Arizona Pimas have T2DM, and 95% of them are overweight or obese. T2DM is a rarity among the Mexican Pimas, and only about 10% can be classified as obese. The average difference in body weight between the Arizona and Mexican Pima men and women was more than 60 lb.44 Further evidence that diet and lifestyle appear to be able to over- come even the strongest genetic predisposition is shown by some of the intervention studies among Pima Indians. When these people were placed on a more traditional diet along with physical exercise, their blood glucose levels improved dramatically, and they lost weight. The focus right now, by various medical organizations such as the National Institute of Health, in dealing with the epidemic of diabetes and obe- sity among the Pima Indians is to educate children on the importance of exercise and dietary choices to reduce diabetes risk.

## Other Genetic and Racial Factors

Other racial and ethnic groups beside Pima Indians that have a higher tendency to develop T2DM include other Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, Australian Aborigines, and Pacific Islanders. It is important for all these higher-risk groups to learn that when they follow the traditional dietary and life- style practices of their original cultures, their rates of diabetes will be extremely low. It appears that these groups are simply highly sensitive to the “Western diet” and lifestyle.

## Diet, Exercise, Lifestyle, and Diabetes Risk

Findings from the U.S. government’s Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) make it clear that diabetes is a disease of diet and lifestyle. Of individuals with T2DM, 69% did not exercise at all or did not engage in regular exercise, 62% ate fewer than five servings of fruits and vegetables per day, 65% consumed more than 30% of their daily calories from fat and more than 10% of total calories from saturated fat, and 82% were either overweight or obese.45 Insights into the independent role of the modern lifestyle versus diet and obesity in the development of T2DM can be gleaned from the Old Order Amish. These 30,000 or so individuals, whose ancestors arrived on U.S. shores in the 18th century, maintain religious and cul- tural beliefs that preclude regular use of modern conveniences such as electrical appliances, telephones, and cars, and they have a physically active lifestyle. By comparison, the 200 million typical Americans liv- ing alongside them have, over the past 250 years, willingly adopted the advances of modern technology, making life less physically demanding. Although the typical Amish diet and rate of obesity do not differ from those of the typical American, the rate of diabetes among the Amish is considerably less—about 50% lower. Although the percent- age of Amish with impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes) is about the same as in other whites in America, apparently not as many Amish go on to develop diabetes. This suggests that physical activity has a

<!-- chunk -->

## 1268SECTION 6 Diseases

protective effect against T2DM independent of obesity or percentage of body fat.46,47 Results from other studies corroborate this hypothesis. Lifestyle changes alone are associated with a 58% reduced risk of develop- ing diabetes among those at high risk because they show evidence of impaired glucose tolerance (as based on results from the Diabetes Prevention Program—a large intervention trial of more than subjects). The two major goals of the program were a minimum of 7% weight loss/weight maintenance and a minimum of 150 min/week of physical activity similar in intensity to brisk walking.48

## A Diet High in Refined Carbohydrates

Dietary carbohydrates play a central role in the causes, prevention, and treatment of T2DM. In an effort to qualify carbohydrate sources as acceptable or not, two indices have been developed: the glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL). The GI is a numerical value that expresses the rise in blood glucose after a particular food is eaten. The standard value of 100 is based on the rise seen with the ingestion of glucose. The GI ranges from about 20 for fructose and whole barley to about 98 for a baked potato. The insulin response to carbohydrate-containing foods is similar to the rise in blood sugar. The GI is often used as a guideline in dietary recommendations for people with either diabetes or hypo- glycemia. In addition, eating foods with a lower GI is associated with a reduced risk for obesity and diabetes.49–51 One of the shortcomings of the GI is that it tells us only about the quality of the carbohydrates, not the quantity. Obviously, quantity matters too, but measurement of the GI of a food is not related to por- tion size. That is where the GL comes into play. The GL takes the GI into account but provides much more accurate information than the GI alone. The GL is calculated by multiplying the amount of carbohy- drate in a serving of food by that food’s GI (compared with glucose) and then dividing it by 100. The higher the GL, the greater the stress on insulin. In Appendix 7, we provide the GI and GL for many common foods. Research studies are just starting to use the GL as a more sensitive marker for the role of diet in chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease. The preliminary results are showing an even stronger link in predicting diabetes than the one shown for the GI.49,51 Researchers are also showing that a high-GL diet is also associated with an increased risk for heart disease. For example, when researchers from the Nurse’s Health Study used GL measures to assess the effect of carbohydrate consumption on women, they found that high-GL diets (and, by extension, high-GI foods and greater total carbohydrate intake) cor- related with even more significantly greater risk for heart disease than the GI because of lower levels of protective HDL-C and higher tri- glyceride levels.52 Increased risk for diabetes and heart disease started, on average, at a daily GL of 161. Therefore we recommend using the information in Appendix 7 to help determine how to prevent the total daily GL from exceeding 150. Keep in mind that the GL is based on the stated serving size; the larger the serving size, the greater the GL.

## The Importance of Dietary Fiber in Reducing the Risk of

<!-- chunk -->

## Developing Diabetes

Population studies, as well as clinical and experimental data, show dia- betes to be one of the diseases most clearly related to an inadequate intake of dietary fiber. Different types of fiber possess different actions. The type of fiber that exerts the most beneficial effects on blood sugar control is the water-soluble form. Included in this class are hemicellu- loses, mucilages, gums, and pectins. These types of fiber are capable of slowing down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, thereby preventing rapid rises in blood sugar. They are also associated with increasing the sensitivity of tissues to insulin and improving the uptake of glucose by the muscles, liver, and other tissues, thereby preventing a sustained elevation of blood sugar.53,54 Particularly good sources of water-soluble fiber are legumes, oat bran, nuts, seeds, psyllium seed husks, pears, apples, and most veg- etables. Large amounts of plant foods must be consumed to obtain adequate levels of dietary fiber, although beans, peas, and legumes are overall the best sources for high fiber intake in relatively easy amounts to ingest. Even the simple change from white flour products to whole- grain versions is associated with a reduced risk for T2DM55,56; our recommendation is to consume at least 35 g of fiber a day from vari- ous food sources, especially vegetables. Fiber supplements can also be taken to achieve greater effects in lowering the GI.

## The Wrong Types of Fats

Dietary fat also plays a central role in the likelihood of developing T2DM. Large controlled trials have shown that a reduction of fat intake as part of a healthy lifestyle, combined with weight reduction and exercise, reduces the risk for T2DM. However, more import- ant than the amount of fat in the diet is the type of fat consumed.57 The types of dietary fats linked to T2DM include saturated fats and trans fatty acids (partially hydrogenated vegetable oils) taken in large amounts along with a relative insufficiency of monounsaturated and omega-3 fatty acids. One of the key reasons why dietary fats appear to be related to the risk for T2DM is that they determine cell membrane composi- tion. That is, a “bad fat” pattern leads to reduced membrane fluidity, which in turn causes reduced insulin binding to receptors on cellular membranes, reduced insulin action, or both. Particularly harmful to cell membrane function are margarine, vegetable oil shortening, and other foods containing trans fatty acids and partially hydrogenated oils. These fatty acids interfere with the body’s ability to use import- ant essential fatty acids (EFAs). One study estimated that by substitut- ing polyunsaturated vegetable oils for margarine containing partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, the likelihood of developing T2DM could be reduced by 40%.58 In contrast to the dampening of insulin sensitivity caused by mar- garine and saturated fats, clinical studies have shown that monounsat- urated fats and omega-3 oils improve insulin action.59 Adding further support is the fact that population studies have also indicated that the frequent consumption of monounsaturated fats such as olive oil, raw or lightly roasted nuts and seeds, nut oils, and omega-3 fatty acids from fish protect against the development of T2DM. Healthy omega-3 fish include wild salmon, trout, sardines, halibut, and herring. All of this evidence indicates that altered cell membrane composition and fluidity play a critical role in the development of T2DM. One of the most useful food groups to reduce the risk of T2DM is nuts. Studies have shown that consumption of nuts is inversely associated with the risk of T2DM, independent of known risk factors for T2DM, including age, obesity, family history of diabetes, physical activity, smoking, and other dietary factors.60 In addition to providing beneficial monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats that improve insulin sensitivity, nuts are also rich in fiber and magnesium and have a low GI. Higher intakes of fiber and magnesium and foods with a low GI has been associated with a reduced risk of T2DM in several popu- lation-based studies. Eating mostly raw or lightly roasted fresh nuts and seeds rather than commercially roasted and salted nuts and seeds should be advocated.

## Low Intake of Antioxidant Nutrients

Cumulative free-radical damage leads to cellular aging and is a major factor contributing to T2DM as well as many other chronic degener- ative diseases. Several large population-based studies have shown that

<!-- chunk -->

## 1269CHAPTER 165 Diabetes Mellitus Types I and II

the higher the intake of fruit and vegetables, the better blood glucose levels are controlled and the lower the risk for T2DM.61 Many factors could explain this inverse correlation. Fruits and vegetables are good sources of fiber and also provide many nutrients and antioxidants. Even something as simple as the regular consumption of salads is asso- ciated with a reduced risk for T2DM.62 Studies looking at levels of individualized antioxidants have also shown similar inverse correlations—the higher the level of vitamin C, vitamin E, or carotenes, for example, the lower the risk for T2DM.63– 65 Likewise, the lower the levels of antioxidants and higher the levels of fats damaged by free radicals (lipid peroxides), the greater the risk for T2DM.66 In one study, 944 men 42 to 60 years of age were fol- lowed closely for 4 years. None of them had diabetes at the beginning of the study. At the end of this time, 45 men had developed diabetes. The researchers found that a low vitamin E concentration was asso- ciated with 3.9-fold (390%) increased risk for T2DM in the study subjects.67

## Free Radicals and Diabetes

One of the hallmark features of T2DM is the presence of higher levels of free radicals and prooxidants,68 particularly an increased produc- tion of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS).69 These compounds are also activated by high blood glucose and elevated levels of saturated fat and, as already mentioned, are pro- duced in the abdominal fat cells of individuals who are overweight or obese. These compounds greatly stress antioxidant mechanisms; they directly oxidize and damage cellular components such as DNA, pro- teins, and cell membrane fatty acids. In addition to their ability to directly inflict damage on these structures, ROS and RNS indirectly induce damage to tissues by activating several inflammatory com- pounds, such as nuclear factor-kappa B, which ultimately leads to both insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion.

## Environmental Toxins

<!-- chunk -->

## Persistent Organic Pollutants

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) include such chemical com- pounds as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), poly- chlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), organophosphates, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and bisphenol A. These compounds have been linked to the development of T2DM. In addition, research indicates that the body load of POPs is not only a significant predictor of T2DM but may also be a more significant risk factor than obesity.70 Individuals in the top quintile of exposure to six common POPs have a 37.7-fold increased risk of diabetes—much stronger than any other known risk factor. Because many POPs block insulin receptor sites, decrease glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4) activity in mus- cles, and decrease insulin production, a causal relationship appears highly probable. Beginning in the 1960s, the production of synthetic organic chemicals began to escalate along with the incidence of diabetes (Fig. 165.1). The total load of toxicants may be the stron- gest contributing factor in the development of diabetes, with data so compelling that some researchers now label these toxicants as “diabetogens.” More convincing is the correlation between body load of POPs and the risk of metabolic syndrome, as shown in Fig. 165.2. The association is synergistic. When the relationship between POP lev- els and diabetes risk is examined, the case becomes even more com- pelling. Those in the top 10% of transnonachlor level, a common termiticide used in North America for decades, have a remarkable twelvefold increased risk of developing diabetes. Those with levels of organochlorine pesticides in the top quartile have an odds ratio of 5.3 for metabolic syndrome.71 Unfortunately, direct measurement of POP levels is difficult and very expensive. However, a good indirect measure is gamma-glutam- yltransferase (GGTP). An elevated level of GGTP is a strong predictor of diabetes risk. Those with levels above 40 IU/L have a twentyfold increased risk.72

## Arsenic

Arsenic exposure occurs primarily through diet and water. A surprising 13 million people in the United States use public water that exceeds the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limit of 10 ug/L. There is a direct correlation between the amount of arsenic in a person’s body and the risk of diabetes. In this case the primary mechanism appears to be the result of damaged pancreatic beta cells with resultant decrease insulin production.73 0 19401950196019701980 Year S y n t h e ti c O r g a ni c C h e mi c al P r o d u c ti o n ( bi ll i o n s o f ki l o g r a m s ) Di a b e t e s P r e v al e n c e ( % ) 199020002010 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 50 100 150 200 300 Chemical Production Diabetes Prevalence 250

Arsenic has been shown to increase diabetes risk in a dose-de- pendent fashion. Comparing participants at the 80th versus the 20th percentiles, the odds ratios (ORs) for T2DM were 3.58 for the total level of arsenic, 1.57 for dimethylarsenate, and 0.69 for arsenobetaine.74

## Bisphenol A and Phthalates

Higher urinary bisphenol A (BPA) concentrations are associated with type 2 diabetes, with an OR of 1.39 per 1-standard-deviation increase in BPA concentration.75 BPA blocks insulin receptor sites resulting in insulin resistance. This increases the incidence of diabetes as well as obesity, especially the accumulation of visceral fat. The threshold for doubling the risk for diabetes is 5.0 ug/L urine. Phthalates, such as di-2-ethyl-hexl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dib- utyl phthalate, dimethyl phthalate, dibenzyl phthalate, and diisononyl phthalate, are associated with the development of T2DM and obesity by interfering with various cell-signaling pathways involved in weight and glucose homeostasis.76 Mitochondrial inhibition by phthalates likely contributes significantly to their role in obesity and diabetes.

## Ambient Air Pollutants

A 3+ year study of overweight and obese Latino children from Los Angeles, California, showed significant effects of elevated NO 2 and particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 (PM 2.5 ) on insulin homeostasis and beta-cell function that were independent of body fat percentage.77 Epidemiological studies have also shown that greater exposure to NO 2 and PM 2.5 is associated with a greater risk for T2DM in adults.78

## Lifestyle Management Versus Drugs to Prevent Type

<!-- chunk -->

## Diabetes

Several well-designed large trials have shown that lifestyle and dietary modifications can be used to effectively prevent T2DM. That fact has not dissuaded drug companies from sponsoring studies attempting to pre- vent diabetes with drugs. However, the degree of prevention with drugs pales in comparison with that of diet and lifestyle. For example, in one of the most celebrated studies, 3234 subjects with impaired glucose tol- erance (prediabetes) were randomly assigned to be in a group receiving a placebo, the blood glucose–lowering drug metformin (850 mg twice daily), or a lifestyle modification program with the goals of at least a 7% weight loss and at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week. The average follow-up was 2.8 years. The incidence of diabetes was 11, 7.8, and 4.8 cases per 100 person-years in the placebo, metformin, and lifestyle groups, respectively. The lifestyle intervention reduced the inci- dence of diabetes by 58% and metformin by 31% compared with pla- cebo. Clearly, the lifestyle intervention was significantly more effective than metformin—a drug with sometimes serious side effects.79

## Environmental Toxicity

Given the fact that environmental pollutants can increase the risk of developing T2DM, steps can be taken to reduce patients’ exposure to them. This can be done, for example, by eating organic foods, using natural cleaning agents in the home, and avoiding chemical pesticides. These are all valid steps in preventing environmental toxins undermin- ing the regulation of insulin.

# CLINICAL MONITORING OF DIABETES

Knowledge and awareness are the greatest allies of people with diabetes. An individual with diabetes who makes a strong commitment to learn- ing about his or her condition and accepts the lead role in a carefully supervised monitoring program that breaks away from the standard recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) greatly improves the likelihood that he or she will lead a long and healthy life. On the other hand, individuals who remain blissfully ignorant about their disease and refuse to undergo regular testing or self-monitoring are far more likely to face years of unnecessary suffering and, more often than not, catastrophic health problems. Unless it is properly managed and supervised, diabetes can be viewed as a state of biochemical and hormonal anarchy that will lead to organ injury and accelerated aging. Many of the complex control systems that faithfully govern and protect the body are damaged in the diabetic individual. For such a person to regain control, he or she must learn how to maintain an intimate awareness of blood sugar, risk factors for atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), blood pressure, body mass index, level of fitness, and other factors that determine the risk of developing diabetic complications and experiencing an erosion of his or her quality of life. Fortunately, diabetic patients who do develop a keen awareness of these risk factors through regular testing and a properly supervised self-monitoring program are also those who are much more likely to benefit from changes in lifestyle: diet, supplements, and when neces- sary, medications.

## Urinary Glucose Monitoring

The measurement of glucose in the urine is now entirely passé. Until the mid-1970s, the only option that diabetic patients had to monitor blood glucose was indirectly through urine glucose testing. Normally, the kidneys are able to conserve all of the glucose in the blood that they constantly filter. However, if blood glucose gets too high, the kid- neys become unable to conserve all of the glucose, which then begins to appear in the urine. Because the average diabetic patient’s kidneys can completely conserve glucose until the blood glucose reaches about 200 to 250 mg/dL (10 mmol/L), a negative urine glucose reading indi- cates that the blood glucose since the time of the previous voiding has been less than 200 to 250 mg/dL (10 mmol/L). Therefore the measure- ment of glucose in the urine is only a crude measurement of blood glucose control and is completely worthless in detecting severe hypo- or hyperglycemia.80 Thus urinary glucose monitoring is of little value in determining the success of blood glucose control, and it does not provide adequate feedback when lifestyle, diet, or other treatments are adjusted. These days, all diabetic patients should own a glucometer and know how to test their own blood glucose levels.

## Urinary Ketone Testing

In any circumstance when the body must derive its primary source of energy from fat, ketones are produced as a by-product. If the level of ketone production is high enough, ketones appear in the urine. In the patient with T1DM or T2DM who cannot produce any innate insulin, ketones appear in the urine when there is a severe deficiency in or activity of insulin. In general this is associated only with T1DM because the vast majority of patients with T2DM do not develop keto- acidosis. This can occur if a patient with insulin-dependent diabetes accidentally or purposefully forgets to take insulin. It can also occur when such a patient becomes ill or injured or is given high doses of cor- tisone-related drugs. All of these phenomena may result in a severe loss of insulin effectiveness, resulting in the cells’ inability to take up and use glucose. In such circumstances, blood glucose rises to high levels, high amounts of fat are used by cells that cannot take in glucose, and the blood becomes polluted with toxic levels of acidic ketones. Severe dehydration occurs rapidly because the kidneys are unable to conserve water in the presence of such extraordinary levels of blood glucose. This dangerous state is referred to as diabetic ketoacidosis, and it must be treated as a medical emergency, usually necessitating intravenous

insulin, large amounts of intravenous fluids, and careful monitoring, usually in an intensive care unit. Ignoring ketoacidosis can rapidly lead to death. Because of the events just outlined, the testing of urine or, even bet- ter, blood for ketones remains an important part of monitoring only in patients with T1DM who have no remaining pancreatic function. The presence of urine or blood ketones accompanied by high blood sugar readings can be interpreted to determine how far along the ketoacido- sis has developed and what type of medical attention is required. For this reason, all patients with T1DM should test their urine for ketones frequently during acute illness or severe stress, especially when blood glucose levels are consistently elevated (>300 mg/dL [16.7 mmol/L]); regularly during pregnancy; or when symptoms suggestive of ketoaci- dosis, such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, are present.

## Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose

Since its introduction, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) has revolutionized the management of diabetes.81 The publication of the landmark Diabetes Control and Complications Trial,82 which exam- ined intensive glucose control in people with T1DM, and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study,83 which examined intensive glu- cose control in those with T2DM, scientifically proved that the most important factor in determining the long-term risk of serious dia- betic complications in both types of diabetes is blood glucose control. Patients who do not maintain vigilant awareness of their blood glucose and who do not make every effort to keep their blood sugar under tight control can expect a significant increase in their risk of serious health problems such as eye, kidney, and heart disease as well as a whole host of other problems, including depression, fatigue, impotence, and chronic infections. SMBG is important for a number of reasons84: 1. Modifications of treatment to achieve appropriate blood glucose control 2. Detection and diagnosis of hypoglycemia 3. Adjusting care in response to daily life circumstances (e.g., food intake, exercise, stress, illness) 4. Detection and treatment of severe hyperglycemia 5. Increasing compliance with therapy (helps combat apathy and denial) 6. Improvement in motivation because of immediate positive and negative feedback (Boxes 165.3 and 165.4)

## Type 1 Diabetes and Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose

Without question, all individuals with T1DM must monitor their blood glucose frequently if they want to achieve and maintain good health. In the absence of diabetes, the pancreas monitors blood glucose continuously and adjusts its insulin output depending on moment- by-moment changes. To achieve blood glucose levels that are consis- tently as close to normal as possible, those with T1DM must replicate this natural situation as closely as possible. This means that they must monitor their blood glucose frequently, and they must learn to use this information to make ongoing adjustments to their insulin injections, diet, and exercise. Intensive insulin therapy allows a diabetic patient to achieve near-normal levels of blood glucose, along with enjoying improved lifestyle flexibility. With conventional, infrequent insulin injections, the diabetic patient must structure meals and other aspects of life- style around his or her injections or face serious abnormalities of blood glucose. On the other hand, with intensive insulin therapy that relies on rapid-acting, short-duration insulin or the use of an insu- lin pump (an electronic device that provides a continuous injection of short-acting insulins with extra boluses before meals), the timing and size of doses can be adjusted to suit the events of the day.85 Even though it may involve multiple injections (usually before each meal and often at bedtime) and blood glucose measurements up to six times or more each day, intensive insulin therapy results in greater dietary and lifestyle freedom, a higher quality of life and well-being, and near nondiabetic blood glucose control, which is vital for long- term health.

## Type 2 Diabetes and Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose

Self-monitoring of blood glucose has an important place in the management of T2DM as well. Each such patient lies somewhere on a spectrum that ranges from mild glucose intolerance (accom- panied by insulin resistance and higher-than-normal levels of insu- lin) to more advanced forms (with more severe insulin resistance, the potential for high levels of blood glucose, ketoacidosis, and partial or nearly complete pancreatic failure with an accompany- ing lack of insulin). Depending on the severity of the individual’s diabetes, SMBG plays a varying role. Each such patient should own a blood glucose monitor and have become intimately familiar with its use. Even those whose blood glucose is well controlled through diet, lifestyle, and supplements should measure their blood glucose regularly. Numerous dietary factors, supplements, exercise, stress, and illness can all have a significant effect on blood glucose control. Becoming intimately aware of how all these factors influence diabetes will help motivate these patients to make positive changes and provide imme- diate feedback as to the success of any changes that have been made. Those whose disease is more advanced and who have diminished pancreatic insulin production may also benefit from efforts to establish consistently near-normal blood glucose control using intensive insulin therapy similar to that of patients with T1DM.86 A C-peptide blood test can provide an estimate of how much insulin a patient is produc- ing and is one way to help determine the appropriateness of using insu- lin. If patients with T2DM are placed on an intensive insulin therapy program, they must perform SMBG as frequently as those with T1DM who are receiving intensive insulin therapy (usually before and 2 hours after each meal).

<!-- chunk -->

## 1272SECTION 6 Diseases

Many patients with advanced T2DM have diminished insulin pro- duction (evidenced by lower-than-normal C-peptide levels). A com- mon way to achieve optimal blood glucose in these individuals is to give one injection of the new, long-acting insulin glargine (Lantus), which provides a smooth, continual release of insulin for 24 hours, along with diet and other medication. Patients on this type of pro- gram must measure their blood glucose frequently (usually before and 2 hours after each meal).

<!-- chunk -->

## C-Peptide Determination

Often it is important to know whether a diabetic patient’s pancreas is making insulin, and if so, how much. This assessment can greatly influence treatment, especially in a patient hoping to avoid or cease using injected insulin. The level of pancreatic insulin production can also partially determine the type of medication or natural health prod- ucts that are more likely to be effective. Once it is known how well the pancreas is producing insulin, the focus may be shifted toward replac- ing deficiencies in insulin production, stimulating insulin production, preserving pancreatic function, reducing insulin resistance, or a com- bination of these therapeutic efforts. One way to determine the level of insulin production is by measur- ing C-peptide. The pancreas manufactures a large protein called pro- insulin first. A piece of this protein (C-peptide) is then snipped off by enzymes, and both C-peptide and the remaining insulin are released into the bloodstream. Injected insulin has no C-peptide, nor does the body ever produce antibodies against it, as it can against insulin. Patients with T1DM and those who have injected insulin even once are at high risk of having developed insulin antibodies, which can destroy the molecule. The benefits of measuring C-peptide are helpful for both patients with T1DM and those with T2DM, but generally more so for those with T2DM. C-peptide can uncover how much insulin the pancreas is making, which may help determine how much of a T1DM pancreas is still active. It may even sometimes make it possible, with alternative care, to stabilize the patient’s condition. In T2DM, high C-peptide levels confirm that the patient is highly insulin resistant. If the C-peptide is low, it indicates that the pancreas is so damaged that some type of insulin therapy will be required (Table 165.3).

## Physician Monitoring

Although patients with diabetes must take charge of their illness and be in control of their diet, lifestyle, and glucose monitoring, they are rarely successful without professional guidance. Numerous studies have determined that physician monitoring through laboratory mea- surements of blood glucose levels can have a major effect on a diabetic patient’s long-term health. One of the key determinants of blood glucose control is the HgbA 1c test (see earlier discussion). Unlike direct measurements of blood glu- cose, which detect the level at the moment of testing, the HgbA 1c test reflects the average level of blood glucose over the preceding 3 months. Studies have shown that the level of HgbA 1c closely correlates with the level of risk for diabetic complications. However, an HgbA 1c may not be entirely accurate. A patient may have steady, regulated blood sugars that return an HgbA 1c of 6%, or he or she may have very high numbers in combination with hypoglycemic events, which can also—because the HgbA 1c is an average, median index—show the same HgbA 1c of 6%. Having an HgbA 1c level of less than 5.5% or less is ideal and indi- cates that blood glucose levels have averaged in a range that is essen- tially nondiabetic (meaning that the patient is suffering no damage because of his or her glucose level). Owing to the great importance of adequate glucose control, all patients with diabetes should have their HgbA 1c levels measured every 3 to 4 months, depending on the sta- bility of their condition. If the HgbA 1c number is not clearly known to be the result of good control or fluctuating highs and lows, then a second laboratory test, called GlycoMark, is a good one to consider.87 The GlycoMark assay measures blood levels of 1,5-anhydroglucitol. 1,5-AG is found in nearly all foods and is ingested in a regular diet. Once ingested, 1,5-AG is nearly 100% nonmetabolized and remains in a relatively constant amount in the blood and tissues. When blood glucose exceeds 180 mg/dL for any period of time, the kidney attempts to reabsorb as much glucose back into the blood as it can. During times of glucosuria, the additional amount of glucose in the kidney blocks 1,5-AG from being reabsorbed into the blood, and 1,5-AG is excreted in the urine at a higher rate than normal. Due to the lack of 1,5-AG being reabsorbed, blood levels of 1,5-AG decrease immediately and continue to decrease until glucose values go below 180 mg/dL. It is this competitive inhibition of 1,5-AG from glucose that allows GlycoMark to accurately reflect any hyperglycemic episodes over 180 mg/dL. The GlycoMark test has been shown to be more accurate than an HgbA 1c and offers the physician a clearer picture of how well a patient’s glucose levels are being controlled and also shows postprandial spikes more clearly. Although it is clear that optimal blood glucose control is critical to the health of patients with diabetes, several other risk factors must be carefully monitored in all diabetic patients. Early detection of prob- lems through a program of regular screening and monitoring will enable preventive efforts and treatments to be put in place before seri- ous complications or catastrophic problems occur. Table 165.4 pro- vides a checklist for the proper evaluation and monitoring of patients with diabetes.

# THE COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES

In diabetes, problematic regulation of glucose levels can lead to acute complications, and long-term elevations of blood glucose cause inflammatory and oxidative damage that will lead to chronic disease progression and the development of complications (Box 165.5).

<!-- chunk -->

## Acute Complications

As described previously, the acute complications of diabetes may rep- resent a medical emergency and possibly a life-or-death situation. Any diabetic patient experiencing any symptom even remotely suggestive of an acute complication should consult medical care immediately. The major acute complications of diabetes are hypoglycemia, ketoaci- dosis, and nonketogenic hyperosmolar syndrome.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia is usually seen in T1DM. It is the result of excessive insu- lin injection, decreased or delayed food ingestion, use of alcohol or drugs that interfere with the liver’s production of glucose, or an unaccustomed increase in exercise. Severe hypoglycemia can also occur unpredictably in

## 1273CHAPTER 165 Diabetes Mellitus Types I and II

patients with “brittle” T1DM or in any patient on insulin or sulfonylurea drugs who neglects the need for the proper monitoring of blood glucose. Daytime hypoglycemic episodes are usually recognized by symptoms such as sweating, nervousness, tremor, and hunger. Nighttime hypogly- cemia may be without symptoms or manifest as night sweats, unpleasant dreams, or early-morning headache. The earliest autonomic symptom of hypoglycemia is hunger and occurs when the glucose is at or below 65 to 70 mg/dL. Patients may also experience irritability, anxiety, heart palpitations, pallor, and sweat- ing. Neuroglycopenic symptoms, which occur when the brain becomes starved of glucose, start with blurry vision and can progress to headache, tiredness, abnormal behavior, slurred speech, unconsciousness, and seizures. Treatment of hypoglycemia follows the 15-15 rule, whereby patients are told to ingest 15 g of carbohydrate and then recheck their glucose in 15 minutes. If the glucose is still below 80 mg/dL, another g of carbohydrate should be taken and the glucose rechecked in an hour. When glucose sinks below 55 mg/dL, the patient will probably need help from another person, and when it is below 20 mg/dL, a seizure is highly likely to follow, and glucagon should be injected. Any hypoglycemic event should be recorded and reported to a physician.

<!-- chunk -->

## Diabetic Ketoacidosis

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is most commonly seen in patients with newly diagnosed T1DM when they have infections; when they have deliberately or accidentally omitted their insulin; and under other cir- cumstances such as trauma, myocardial infarction or stroke, during surgery, and with dental abscess and other types of physiological stress. The lack of insulin leads to extremely high levels of blood glucose and a buildup of acidic ketone molecules as fat stores are burned to provide energy. If progressive, ketoacidosis can lead to numerous metabolic problems and even coma or death. Because ketoacidosis is a medical emergency, its prompt recognition is imperative. Patients should be taught to check for ketones in their urine or blood when their glucose is above 250 mg/dL for more than a few hours, if they are feverish or have an infection, if they do not “feel well,” and regularly during preg- nancy because DKA is usually fatal to the fetus. The symptoms of DKA include fruity breath, disorientation, abdominal tenderness, polyuria and polydipsia, hyperventilation, and signs of dehydration. Treatment of DKA depends on the severity of the situation and where the glucose level is—it can require injecting insulin, eating as well as insulin injec- tion, or referral to an emergency department.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State

The hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) occurs mostly in older patients with T2DM, usually in the seventh decade of life. It develops gradually, taking days to weeks to manifest itself. There is no ketoaci- dosis with this condition, but it has a higher mortality because it tends to occur in patients who have other serious problems, such as acute illness, recent surgery, congestive heart failure, renal dysfunction, or cardiovascular disease, or who are taking certain drugs, are victims of elder abuse or neglect, or are simply noncompliant with their diabetic therapy protocols. The diagnostic criteria include a glucose level above 600 mg/dL, profound dehydration, other changes in pH, and some alteration in consciousness. Patients may present with drowsiness, coma, visual changes, sensory deficits, and even paralysis or seizures.

<!-- chunk -->

## TABLE 165.4 Clinical Management of the

## 1274SECTION 6 Diseases

HHS is a medical emergency, and the patient must be taken to an emergency room. Injecting insulin can cause severe complications, so hospital care is best.

<!-- chunk -->

## Chronic Complications

Much more common than the acute complications of diabetes are certain long-term complications, described as follows. The main four areas of the body affected most by diabetic complications are the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and endothelial lining. These four areas do not require insulin to absorb glucose into their cells, as do the liver, muscle, and fat cells, so when glucose levels are elevated in uncontrolled diabetes, unregulated glucose floods those cells and causes significant damage. Thus they are the key sites for diabetic complications.

<!-- chunk -->

## Atherosclerosis

Atherosclerosis and other vascular lesions are the underlying fac- tors in the development of many chronic complications of diabetes. Individuals with diabetes have a four- to sixfold higher risk of dying prematurely of heart disease or stroke than do nondiabetic individuals, and 55% of deaths among patients with diabetes are caused by cardio- vascular disease. The majority of those with T2DM have hypertension, and many of the diet and lifestyle habits of patients with diabetes—such as eating poorly and not exercising—combined with nutrient deficien- cies can accelerate the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## Retinopathy

Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the United States for people between the ages of 20 and 64. In this condition, the retina is damaged by microhemorrhages, scarring, and the attachment of glucose molecules (glycosylation) to structural proteins in the ret- ina. Studies have shown that 20 years after a diagnosis of diabetes, 80% of those with T1DM and 20% of those with T2DM have significant retinopathy. Diabetic patients are also prone to developing cataracts— opacities that occur in the lens of the eye as a result of oxidative damage to the delicate protein structures of the lens.

<!-- chunk -->

## Neuropathy

Neuropathy usually involves the loss of peripheral nerve function and is characterized by tingling sensations, numbness, and a characteristic burning pain (neuropathic pain). It commonly occurs noticeably in the feet but can also spread elsewhere in the body, such as to the auto- nomic nerves of the gastrointestinal tract, causing diarrhea, constipa- tion, and/or gastroparesis. If it progresses, it can affect deeper nerves of the autonomic nervous system, resulting in disturbances in stom- ach emptying and, later, impaired cardiac function, alternating bouts of diarrhea and constipation, and an inability to empty the bladder. Impotence is a common occurrence and is caused by damage to the small blood vessels of the penis as well as neuropathy of the autonomic nerves controlling blood flow into the penis. Approximately 60% of all people with diabetes eventually develop neuropathy. The main prob- lem of peripheral neuropathy is that lack of feeling in the feet can lead patients to develop sores and lesions that they do not notice. These may then ulcerate, leading to gangrene and amputation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nephropathy

Nephropathy due to diabetes accounts for 40% of the cases of severe kidney disease and, in the United States, is the most common reason for end-stage renal disease, hemodialysis, and kidney transplantation. In addition to monitoring blood glucose levels, it is important to mon- itor kidney function with various laboratory measurements (random microalbuminuria, 24-hour urine protein, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid, creatinine and creatinine clearance, and glomerular filtration rate). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are part of standard care because they have been shown to protect the kidneys from diabetic damage.

<!-- chunk -->

## Poor Wound Healing and Foot Ulcers

Poor wound healing is common in patients with diabetes for several reasons, such as the microvascular changes leading to poor circulation and the functional deficiency of nutrients. Foot ulcers are common in individuals with diabetes because of microvasculature changes leading to a poor blood supply, peripheral neuropathy, poor wound healing, poor nutrition, and immune system dysfunction, all of which can promote chronic infections in the feet. Apart from trauma, dia- betic wounds are the leading cause of limb amputations in the United States. More than 50% of lower-limb amputations in the United States (70,000 each year) are due to diabetic foot ulcers.

<!-- chunk -->

## Immune System Dysfunction

Immune system dysfunction often begins long before a diagnosis of diabetes is made. In fact, in many cases, a recurrent yeast infection of the vagina or skin is the first clue leading to the detection of diabe- tes. Immune system problems are made worse by poor glucose con- trol, which puts the diabetic patient at risk for serious infections or complications of simple infections. Susceptibility to chronic, hidden infections in the oral cavity, blood, or respiratory tract may be a pri- mary underlying cause of the increased risk for cardiovascular disease among diabetic patients.

<!-- chunk -->

## Depression and Cognitive Difficulties

Depression and cognitive difficulties are common among those with diabetes. In fact, depression may begin to occur when the individual first starts to develop insulin resistance, decades before the onset of T2DM. The brain is more sensitive to its need for glucose than any other organ, and it appears that brain cells may suffer from some degree of glucose deprivation when insulin resistance occurs.88 Depression is also much more common among overweight and obese individuals, probably owing to the combined effect of insulin resis- tance and diminished self-esteem. Cognitive changes begin to occur after the first severe hypoglycemic episode in people with diabetes. Hypoglycemia is profoundly stressful to the brain and, if severe hypo- glycemia occurs many times, significant cognitive impairment can ensue. Uncontrolled diabetes is also associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.

## Contributors to the Long-Term Complications of Diabetes

The major contributors to the long-term complications of diabetes are listed here, followed by a brief description of each factor along with coping measures: • Poor glucose control • Glycosylation of proteins • Intracellular accumulation of sorbitol • Increased oxidative damage • Nutrient deficiency • Elevated levels of homocysteine • Hypertension • Endothelial cell dysfunction

<!-- chunk -->

## Poor Glucose Control

A large body of evidence indicates that good blood glucose control significantly reduces the development of complications. The largest and most extensive study to date in T1DM is the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, whereas the largest and longest study on patients with T2DM is the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study. Both

<!-- chunk -->

## 1275CHAPTER 165 Diabetes Mellitus Types I and II

studies conclusively demonstrated that improved blood glucose con- trol reduces the risk of developing long-term complications of diabe- tes, especially retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Maintaining HgbA 1c levels near normal (equal to or less than 7%) can dramatically help reduce the risk of eye problems (up to 76%), nerve damage (up to 60%), and kidney disease (up to 56%).

<!-- chunk -->

## Glycosylation of Proteins

As described previously, the term glycosylation refers to the binding of glucose to proteins. The poorer the glucose control, the greater the binding of glucose molecules to proteins. This binding leads to changes in the structure and function of the protein. Among the adverse effects of excessive glycosylation are inactivation of enzymes, inhibition of regulatory molecule binding, and the formation of abnormal protein structures. For example, when glucose molecules bind to cholester- ol-carrying low-density lipoprotein (LDL) molecules, they block LDL from binding to receptors on the liver that tell the liver to cease man- ufacturing cholesterol. As a result, the liver “thinks” that there is a shortage of cholesterol in the body and continues to produce more and to release it into the blood. This is one reason why diabetes is almost always associated with high cholesterol levels. In addition to keeping blood glucose levels as close to ideal as possible, high intakes of antioxidants—especially vitamins C and E, flavonoids, and alpha-lipoic acid (discussed later)—help reduce glycosylation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Intracellular Accumulation of Sorbitol

Sorbitol is a sugar molecule formed from glucose within cells. In peo- ple without diabetes, once sorbitol is formed, it is quickly broken down into fructose. This conversion to fructose is critical because it allows any excess sorbitol to be excreted from the cell, and sorbitol cannot exit the cell once it is formed. If sorbitol levels continue to increase within cells, they create an osmotic effect. When there is an increase in the concentration of soluble com- pounds (e.g., sorbitol) that the cell cannot get rid of, the cell leaks small molecules like amino acids, inositol, glutathione, niacin, vitamin C, magnesium, and potassium to maintain osmotic balance. Because these compounds function to protect cells from damage, their loss results in increased susceptibility to damage. Intracellular accumulation of sorbitol is a major factor in the devel- opment of most complications of diabetes, as evidenced by the fact that elevated sorbitol levels are found in high concentrations in the tissues commonly involved in the major diabetic complications: the lens of the eye, nerve cells, kidney cells, and the cells that line blood vessels. In addition to controlling blood glucose levels, vitamin C and fla- vonoids like quercetin, grape seed extract, and bilberry extract can help lower intracellular sorbitol levels. Sorbitol accumulation, by the way, has nothing to do with eating foods that contain sorbitol.

<!-- chunk -->

## Increased Oxidative Damage

Increased oxidative stress is a major factor in the development of the chronic complications of diabetes. As previously stated, individuals with diabetes typically have elevated levels of free radicals and oxi- dative compounds.89 These highly reactive compounds bind to and destroy cellular compounds, cause damage all over the body, and increase insulin resistance. They also greatly increase the inflamma- tory process by adding fuel to their destructive fire via the increased formation of inflammatory mediators like C-reactive protein, inter- leukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. One of the critical goals in diabetes prevention and treatment is to flood the body with a high level of antioxidant compounds to counteract the negative effects of free radicals and prooxidants. Implementation of this goal is achieved by following the dietary and supplementary strategies given, which pro- mote weight loss, establish better glucose control, and replete antioxi- dants in the body. In addition to the basic supplementation program, supplementing the diet with super antioxidants like alpha-lipoic acid and flavonoid-rich extracts is often useful in further boosting antiox- idant protection.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nutrient Deficiency

A deficiency of any one of several nutrients has been shown to contrib- ute to several chronic complications of diabetes. Studies have found that nutrient supplementation helps patients with diabetes control their glucose levels; it can also lower their blood pressure and protect their bodies from diabetic complications. In general, the risk of long- term complications of diabetes is inversely proportional to micro- nutrient status. Sometimes the symptoms of nutrient deficiency can closely mimic those of a chronic complication of diabetes. For exam- ple, vitamin B 12 deficiency is characterized by numbness, “pins and needles” sensations, or a burning feeling in the hands or feet—symp- toms virtually identical to diabetic neuropathy. Although vitamin B 12 supplementation has been used with some success in treating diabetic neuropathy, it is not clear whether this success is due to correction of a vitamin B 12 deficiency state or the normalization of the deranged vitamin B 12 metabolism seen in diabetic patients. High-potency multivitamin/multimineral supplementation is crit- ical to the management of diabetes. Supplying the diabetic patient with additional key nutrients improves blood glucose control and reduces the development of the major long-term complications of diabetes.

<!-- chunk -->

## Elevated Levels of Homocysteine

Elevated homocysteine levels constitute an independent risk factor for heart attack, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. In addition, recent research has implicated elevations of homocysteine in the devel- opment of long-term complications of diabetes, especially diabetic retinopathy.90

<!-- chunk -->

## Hypertension

Blood pressure control is essential in preventing the complications of diabetes, especially renal disease, retinopathy, and stroke. Maintaining blood pressure in the normal range (120/80–140/80 mm Hg) can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke by approximately 33% to 50% and can reduce microvascular disease (eye, kidney, and nerve dis- ease) by approximately 33%.

<!-- chunk -->

## Endothelial Cell Dysfunction

A single layer of endothelial cells lines all the body’s blood vessels, serving as a metabolically active interface between the components of blood and the blood vessel. These cells regulate many important aspects of blood flow: coagulation, clot formation, and the forma- tion of key regulatory compounds, including those that control blood pressure. Endothelial cells are susceptible to damage by oxidized LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and other free radicals—hence the importance of a high dietary intake of antioxidants, flavonoids, key supplemental antioxidants like vitamins C and E, and alpha-lipoic acid. All of these factors have been shown to improve endothelial cell function and are critical in the battle against vascular disease in diabetes.91–94

## Diet Therapy in Managing Diabetes

The optimal diet for the treatment of diabetes is virtually the same as the program presented in Chapter 44. The difference is that there must often be an even stricter avoidance of foods with a high carbohydrate

<!-- chunk -->

## 1276SECTION 6 Diseases

concentration (see Appendix 7). The strictness of the diet with regard to the intake of carbohydrates must be based on the patient’s ability to maintain satisfactory blood glucose measurements and HgbA 1c levels and to achieve/maintain ideal body weight. Obviously, the poorer the control, the more the carbohydrate intake must be restricted. Initially, some people with diabetes—especially those who have poorly con- trolled blood glucose levels—may have to avoid meals with a total GL of more than 20 and space these meals at least 3 hours apart. Higher-GL meals can be consumed if one of the special natural products designed to slow gastric emptying and blunt after-meal blood glucose levels is used (these compounds are discussed later in the chapter).

<!-- chunk -->

## Clinical Studies With Diet Therapy in Type 1 Diabetes

Numerous clinical studies have shown impressive results in improving blood glucose control when diets high in fiber and low in GL are fol- lowed. This holds true in both adults and children as well as in both T1DM and T2DM. In a study involving children, 8- to 13-year-olds in Melbourne, Australia were divided into two groups: one group fol- lowed the ADA’s exchange-program diet, and the other was instructed to eat low-GI foods.95 Although there was no change in A 1c in the exchange diet (8.6%), the group eating the low-GI diet dropped from 8.6% to 8%—an acceptable value in children. Rates of excessive blood glucose levels were 66% for the exchange diet versus 35% for those eating low-GI foods. Although these results are good, what the study really highlighted was the effect of eating a low-GI diet on the quality of life. There were significantly fewer family conflicts, fewer limitations placed on family activities, and fewer difficulties in meal selections. Furthermore, parents and children alike showed a clear preference for the low-GI diet. Similar results have been seen in adults, including pregnant women, with T1DM following a high-fiber, low-GI diet.96–99 What these studies and others indicate is that low-GI and low-GL diets are emerging as the most scientifically proved dietary support for T1DM. We have taken the proved diet to a much higher level by also considering the role of fats on insulin action. Although ketogenic diets have become popular for T2DM, they should be used with caution in T1DM. In an observational study, adults with type 1 diabetes following a ketogenic diet (<55 g carbohy- drate per day) for a mean of 2.6 years showed excellent effects on HbA 1c levels (5.3 ± 0.4%), and participants spent 74% and 3% of their time in the euglycemic and hyperglycemic ranges, respectively, with little daily glycemic variability. They did spend about 3.6% of the time with blood sugar levels of greater than 3.0 mmol/L or 54 mg/dL, and partic- ipants experienced a median (range) of 0.9 (0.0–2.0) daily episodes of hypoglycemia. In addition, total cholesterol, LDL-C, total cholesterol/ HDL-C ratio, and triglycerides were above the recommended range in 82%, 82%, 64%, and 27% of participants, respectively. These results indicate that ketogenic diets in adults with T1DM result in excellent HbA 1c levels and little glycemic variability but may also be associated with dyslipidemia and a high number of hypoglycemic episodes.100

## Clinical Studies with Diet Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes

Diet alone can often be effective as the sole factor in treating and revers- ing T2DM. Other lifestyle factors and supplements are important, but the treatment of T2DM begins with diet. The critical dietary focus based on results from clinical trials is that the diet should be low in GI and GL. The actual composition of the macronutrients is less as important as the quality of the carbohydrates consumed. A low-GI and low-GL diet is the most scientifically proven approach, especially considering not only the diet’s effect on blood glucose levels but also its effects in reducing the sequelae of diabetes, such as high cholesterol levels, car- diovascular disease, hypertension, and complications of diabetes.101 In addition to low GL, another key goal is to get the total fiber intake from foods to at least 40 g/day. In one study, the effects of two diets on blood glucose levels were compared,102 because higher fiber intake is known to lower average daily glucose levels. One diet contained 24 g of dietary fiber as 8 g of soluble fiber and 16 g of insoluble fiber on the basis of ADA recommendations, whereas the other provided a total of 50 g as 25 g of soluble fiber and 25 g of insoluble fiber. Both diets had the same calorie level and percentages of fat, carbohydrate, and protein. After 6 weeks, the average daily blood glucose levels were mg/dL lower in the group on the higher-fiber diet. Furthermore, a high-fiber diet has also been found to lower the total area under the curve for 24-hour blood glucose levels; in addition, it lowered insulin concentrations and reduced total cholesterol concentrations by 6.7%, triglyceride concentrations by 10.2%, and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) concentrations by 12.5%. This study showed that a high intake of dietary fiber, particularly of the soluble type, above the level recommended by the ADA, improves glycemic control, decreases hyperinsulinemia, and lowers plasma lipid concentrations in patients with T2DM. Similar studies looking at a low- versus a high-GI diet have clearly shown the advantages of the former.101,103 As far as specific eating plans, the Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and plant-based diets are examples of healthful eating patterns that have shown positive results in clinical research. The diabetes plate method can also be helpful. This method provides a visual guide showing how to control calories (by featuring a smaller plate) and carbohydrates (by limiting them to what fits in one-quarter of the plate) and puts an emphasis on low-carbohy- drate (or nonstarchy) vegetables. The bottom line is that there is great flexibility for patients to construct a personalized, health-promoting diet that works.104 Because weight loss is often a major goal in T2DM, please con- sult Chapter 201, Obesity, for additional recommendations. Diet and exercise combinations have shown significant effects in promot- ing weight loss and improved blood sugar control in patients with T2DM.104

## Psychological Support in Diabetes

Helping people with diabetes deal with their diagnosis, develop a sense of empowerment, and make important lifestyle changes is an extremely important aspect of proper medical care. It is imperative to analyze the emotional aspects of diabetes and manage any negativity or sense of being overwhelmed, which is very common in patients with diabetes and can impair their capacity to follow their protocols and maintain good blood sugar control. A book called Diabetes Burnout: What to Do When You Can’t Take It Anymore, by William Polonsky, published by the ADA, is highly useful reading material for patients with diabetes when they are feeling stressed by their condition. Cognitive-behavioral therapy has proven to be especially effective in helping adolescents with T1DM deal with their disease, leading to improvements in both mood and blood glucose control.105

## Dealing With Stress

Stress adversely affects blood glucose control because higher stress lev- els are associated with higher blood glucose levels in both T1DM and T2DM. There is a simple explanation for this. Exposure to stress— whether it be physical, mental, or emotional—leads to activation of the body’s “stress response” and causes increased secretion of the adrenal gland hormones adrenaline and cortisol. Among other things, these hormones cause blood glucose levels to rise and also blunt the response to insulin. In addition, they have a negative effect on the immune sys- tem. Because stress seems to be an inevitable part of modern living, it is critical to develop effective methods to deal with it. Some studies

have shown that positive methods for dealing with stress, such as yoga and relaxation training, can improve blood glucose control, especially in individuals who are anxious or are experiencing significant stress in their lives.104,106,107

## Exercise and Diabetes

Exercise is absolutely essential in the prevention and management of diabetes. Exercise directly improves insulin sensitivity and blood glu- cose control from a combination of increased lean muscle mass and an improvement in muscle cell metabolism.108 Exercise also has profound benefits for the cardiovascular system, directly as well as indirectly through improvements in blood lipids (especially an improvement in HDL-C, the “good cholesterol”). Exercise also decreases symptoms of anxiety and depression, improves sexual functioning, and improves confidence and self-esteem. Importantly, exercise has been shown to help attain and sustain weight loss.109 Three types of exercise are important for people with diabetes: aerobic, strength training, and stretching.

<!-- chunk -->

## Aerobic Exercises

Aerobic exercises, such as walking, jogging, aerobic dance classes, cycling, and swimming, produce rises in heart and respiratory rates. These sorts of activities are foundational in both the prevention and treatment of diabetes. In its simplest form, an aerobic exercise program would consist of a schedule of regular walking combined with cycling, swimming, or the use of low-impact indoor exercise equipment such as an elliptical trainer. Patients should engage in at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise five times a week.

<!-- chunk -->

## Strength Training

Strength training is important for many reasons, including that it leads to increased production of secretory molecules, called myokines, from contracting muscle fibers. Myokines are beneficial modulators of obe- sity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.40 Strength training should occur for 15 to 30 minutes five times a week. Working initially with a trainer to learn proper technique and a rotating regimen of weights is the healthiest way to go. Anaerobic weight training can burn 19 times the amount of glucose as aerobic exercise and protects against the loss of lean body mass while also increasing its size. The loss of lean muscle mass means that there is less tissue to actively absorb glucose. The more muscle one has, the easier it becomes to control blood glucose. Also, patients with diabetes are particularly prone to developing chronic musculoskeletal complaints. Most of these problems are related to increased susceptibility to inju- ries of joints, ligaments, and muscles due to the loss of muscle mass.

<!-- chunk -->

## Stretching Exercises

Stretching exercises should be done daily. Stretching is extremely important because most people with diabetes suffer from premature stiffening of the spine and joints. Stretching on a daily basis helps maintain flexibility and avoid the chronic pain problems that occur frequently in patients with diabetes due to stiff muscles and joints.


The proper treatment of diabetes with natural medicine involves trying to achieve ideal blood glucose control and to reach metabolic targets as well as to reduce the risk of complications by focusing on the following four areas: 1. Providing optimal nutrient status 2. Reducing after-meal elevations in blood glucose levels 3. Improving insulin function and sensitivity 4. Preventing nutritional and oxidative stress Even though natural products can have significant effects on their own, the proper and effective treatment of diabetes requires the care- ful integration of diet and lifestyle changes along with any required medication and then natural medicines. Furthermore, all those with T1DM and many with T2DM also require conventional medical treat- ment (with oral drugs or insulin), depending on the adequacy of pan- creatic insulin production (this can be determined by the C-peptide level) and the individual’s response to dietary and lifestyle measures. The most important determining factor as to whether or not a patient will require the use of drugs or insulin is the adequacy of blood glucose control.

<!-- chunk -->

## Providing Optimal Nutritional Status

In addition to eating a nutrient-dense diet, a high-potency multivita- min/multimineral (MV) supplement is an absolute must for people with diabetes. Follow the guidelines given in Appendix 9. The per- son with diabetes has such an increased need for many nutrients that supplementation is critical. Supplying him or her with additional key nutrients has been shown to improve blood glucose control as well as to help prevent or reduce the development of the major complications of diabetes. Taking an MV supplement has also been shown to boost immune function and reduce infections in patients with diabetes.110 The best MV is not a “one a day” but instead a high-potency product recommended by a physician who specializes in alternative medicine. Specific examples of nutrients for which the patient with diabetes has increased requirements include chromium, vitamin C, vitamin E, cer- tain B vitamins, manganese, magnesium, potassium, and zinc. Whenever a patient with diabetes adds significant nutrient, fiber, or botanical medicines to his or her protocol, glucose monitoring is recommended because oral or injectable medicines may have to be reduced. A physician should be involved in all decisions regarding nat- ural supplementation.

## Chromium

Chromium is vital to proper blood glucose control because it functions in the body as a key constituent of what is referred to as the “glucose tolerance factor.” Chromium works closely with insulin in facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells. Without chromium, insulin’s action is blocked, and glucose levels are elevated. Evidence indicates that mar- ginal chromium status is common in the United States. A chromium deficiency may be an underlying contributing factor to the tremendous number of Americans who have diabetes and hypoglycemia and are obese. More than 20 clinical studies have focused on chromium supple- mentation in diabetes. In some of these studies in T2DM, supplement- ing the diet with chromium has been shown to decrease fasting glucose levels, improve glucose tolerance, lower insulin levels, and decrease total cholesterol and triglyceride levels while increasing HDL-C lev- els. Although there are also studies that have not shown chromium to exert much effect in improving glucose tolerance in diabetes, there is no argument that chromium is an important mineral in blood glucose metabolism. However, it appears that chromium supplementation is likely to produce meaningful improvements in glycemic control only in people who are deficient in this essential trace element.111 It appears to see benefits in people with diabetes, they must sup- plement between 400 and 600 mg per day. Chromium polynicotinate and chromium picolinate may offer the best results because chromi- um-rich yeast failed to produce any significant benefit in the most recent trials.112 In contrast, several recent studies with chromium picolinate in combination with biotin at dosages of 600 mcg and mg, respectively, showed considerable benefit in helping patients with T2DM improve blood sugar control: fasting glucose levels dropped

## 1278SECTION 6 Diseases

mg/dL, and HgbA 1c levels dropped 0.54%.113 Improvements in blood lipids and atherogenic indices were also noted in other studies.114


Because the transport of vitamin C into cells is enhanced by insulin,115 many people with diabetes suffer from a relative deficiency of vitamin C within their cells even if they consume an adequate amount of vita- min C in their diets, which many do not. For many reasons, people with diabetes must take extra vitamin C as well as increase the con- sumption of vitamin C–rich, low-GI foods. In addition to its role as an antioxidant, vitamin C is required in immune functions and the manufacture of collagen, the main protein substance of the human body. Because collagen is such an important protein for the structures that hold the body together (e.g., connective tissue, cartilage, tendons), vitamin C is vital for wound repair, healthy gums, and the prevention of easy bruising. A chronic, latent vitamin C deficiency leads to a number of problems for the patient with diabetes, including increased capillary permeability, poor wound healing, elevated cholesterol levels, and a depressed immune system. Vitamin C supple- mentation has been shown to exert a mild effect in improving glucose control, as evident by a slightly lower HgbA 1c in the vitamin C group (8.5%) compared with placebo (9.3%) in one double-blind study.116 Probably more important than any significant effect on improving blood glucose control is the fact that vitamin C supplementation has been shown to reduce the formation of compounds linked to the development of diabetic complications. In one study of vitamin C supplementation in T2DM, 30 patients who were 45 to 70 years old and had not only T2DM but also hyper- tension were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to take either 500 mg of ascorbic acid by mouth or a placebo daily for 4 weeks. Vitamin C supplementation decreased systolic blood pressure from 142.1 to 132.3 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure from 83.9 to 79.5 mm Hg. Additional analytic methods designed to measure vascular resistance also demonstrated significant improvements in arterial stiff- ness in the group taking vitamin C. These results indicate that vitamin C supplementation is effective in improving the elasticity and function of blood vessels in patients with T2DM.117 The attempt to prevent sorbitol accumulation with drugs has failed because of severe side effects. In contrast, vitamin C can accomplish what these drugs could not—provide safe and effective inhibition of sorbitol accumulation. In one study comprising young adults with T1DM, the baseline measurement of sorbitol in RBCs was nearly dou- ble in these patients compared with those without diabetes despite “adequate” dietary intakes of vitamin C. Vitamin C supplementation at a dose of either 100 or 600 mg normalized RBC sorbitol within days. This correction was independent of changes in diabetic control as monitored by fasting glucose or HgbA 1c . In fact, overall diabetic con- trol during the study was moderate to poor, indicating that vitamin C’s effect was not dependent on glucose concentration. Vitamin C inhibits the enzyme aldose reductase, which converts glucose to sorbitol.118 At concentrations higher than μ mol, vita- min C reduced sorbitol production by about 30%. Levels between 600 and μ mol reduced sorbitol production by about 50%. These concentrations are attainable with vitamin C supplementation. In fact, the normal level of vitamin C in plasma and RBCs is 40 to μ mol. Supplementing with 500 to 1500 mg of vitamin C a day boosts blood levels into the higher range required to inhibit sorbitol production. Although vitamin C supplementation is necessary, patients should not rely exclusively on it to meet all their vitamin C requirements. Vitamin C–rich foods are also rich in compounds such as flavonoids and carotenes, which work to enhance the effects of vitamin C while also exerting favorable effects of their own.


Vitamin E functions primarily as an antioxidant in protecting against damage to cell membranes. Nerve cells are particularly vulnerable when vitamin E levels are low. Compounding the matter is that diabetic patients appear to have an increased requirement for vitamin E. At higher dosages in the range of 400 to 800 IU, vitamin E improves the action of insulin and has a number of beneficial effects that may aid in preventing the long-term complications of diabetes. Actions of vitamin E: • Prevents free radical damage to LDL-C and the vascular lining119–121 • Improves the functioning of blood vessels and the cells that line them122,123 • Increases the concentration of magnesium within cells124,125 • Decreases the level of C-reactive protein and other inflammatory compounds126,127 • Increases the level of glutathione—an important intracellular anti- oxidant—within cells128 • Improves the rate of conduction of electrical impulses through the nervous system129 • Improves blood flow to the eye and mitigates diabetic retinopa- thy130 • In diabetic nephropathy, it improves kidney function and leads to a significant decrease in urine protein and protein-to-creatinine ratio, serum tumor necrosis factor- α , lipid peroxides, advanced glycation end products, and insulin concentrations131 Vitamin E supplementation may be particularly helpful for patients with the haptoglobin (Hp) 2-2 genotype, a subgroup that comprises 2% to 3% of the general population. Hp, a major antioxidant protein, is a determinant of cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM. The Hp gene is polymorphic, with two common alleles, 1 and 2. The Hp 2 allelic protein product provides inferior antioxidant protection compared with the Hp 1 product. In a large study of more than 1400 patients with diabetes 55 years of age or older with the Hp 2-2 genotype randomized to vitamin E (400 IU a day) or placebo, the rates of myocardial infarc- tion, stroke, and cardiovascular death 18 months after initiating the study were significantly reduced in those receiving vitamin E (2.2%) compared with placebo (4.7%), a greater than 50% reduction.132 It should be noted that in one study in patients with T2DM, treat- ment with either 500 mg of α -tocopherol or mixed tocopherols signifi- cantly increased systolic blood pressure (approximately 6–7 mm Hg) versus placebo, indicating that some patients may have a hypertensive reaction.133 Patients should be monitored to rule out this negative effect.

## Niacin and Niacinamide

Enzymes that contain niacin (vitamin B 3 ) play an important role in energy production; fat, cholesterol, and carbohydrate metabolism; and the manufacture of many body compounds, including sex and adrenal hormones. Niacin, like chromium, is an essential component of the glucose tolerance factor, making it a key nutrient for hypoglycemia and diabetes. In addition to offering possible benefits in T1DM, niacinamide may also help in T2DM. Eighteen patients with T2DM of normal body weight who failed to respond to oral antihyperglycemic drugs were randomly assigned to one of three treatments for 6 months: (1) insulin plus nicotinamide (500 mg three times daily), (2) insulin plus placebo, or (3) an oral antihyperglycemic drug plus niacinamide (500 mg three times daily). The parameters assessed included C-peptide, HgbA 1c , and both fasting and mean daily blood glucose levels. With detailed analysis, niacinamide administration was the only significant factor accounting for the improvement of C-peptide release. The data indi- cated that niacinamide improves C-peptide release and blood glucose control in patients with T2DM who had previously failed to respond to oral antihyperglycemic drugs alone.134

## 6

Vitamin B 6 supplementation appears to offer significant protection against the development of diabetic neuropathy.135 Patients with diabetes with neuropathy have been shown to be deficient in vita- min B 6 and to benefit from supplementation.136 The neuropathy of a vitamin B 6 deficiency is indistinguishable from diabetic neuropathy. Individuals with long-standing diabetes or who are developing signs of peripheral nerve abnormalities should definitely supplement their diets with vitamin B 6 , which is also important in preventing other dia- betic complications. Vitamin B 6 supplementation can be a safe and effective treatment for gestational diabetes. When 14 women with gestational diabetes were given 100 mg of vitamin B 6 daily for 2 weeks in one study, the diagnosis was eliminated in 12 of the 14 women.137


Like manganese and chromium, magnesium is also involved in glu- cose metabolism. Considerable evidence indicates that patients with diabetes should eat foods rich in magnesium as well as take supple- mental magnesium—the reasons being that more than one half of all people with diabetes show evidence of magnesium deficiency, and magnesium may prevent some of the complications of diabetes, such as retinopathy and heart disease. Magnesium levels are usually low in patients with diabetes and lowest in those with diabetic complications like retinopathy and neuropathy. Clinical studies have shown that magnesium supplementation (usually 400–500 mg/day) improves insulin response and action, glucose tolerance, and the fluidity of the RBC membrane in patients with diabetes.138,139 Higher magnesium intake is also associated with a reduced risk of progression from pre- diabetes to diabetes.140 Magnesium supplementation is especially helpful for gestational diabetes as well as preterm labor, preeclampsia, and small for gesta- tional age or intrauterine growth restriction. In a double-blind study of 70 women aged 24 to 34 with gestational diabetes, the subjects were given either 250 mg of magnesium (oxide) or placebo daily for weeks. Results demonstrated significant improvements in several blood parameters beyond blood sugar, including homeostatic model assess- ment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and malonaldehyde (MDA). In addition, only 3 of the 35 newborns from mothers taking magnesium were afflicted with hyperbilirubinemia (8.8%) compared with 10 in the placebo group (29.4%).141

However, in a follow-up analysis in these same patients, quantitative results of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated that compared with the placebo, magnesium supplemen- tation upregulated gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR- γ ) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) and downregulated gene expression of oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). These results would indicate possible beneficial effects are not limited to either hypomagnesia or in only those with gestational diabetes.142 The recommended dietary intake (RDI) for magnesium is 400 to 420 mg/day for adult males and 300 to 320 mg/day for adult females. Patients with diabetes may need as much as twice this amount because they tend to lose excessive magnesium through their kidneys.139 Most of the magnesium should be derived from the diet. The average intake of magnesium by healthy U.S. adults ranges from 143 to 266 mg/day. This is obviously far below the RDI. Food choices are the main rea- son. Although magnesium occurs abundantly in whole foods, food processing refines out a large portion of it. The best dietary sources of magnesium are tofu, seeds, nuts, and green leafy vegetables. Fish, meat, milk, and the most commonly eaten fruits are low in magnesium. Most Americans consume a low-magnesium diet because they eat a lot of refined foods, meat, and dairy products. In addition to favoring a diet rich in magnesium, patients with diabetes should supplement it with 300 to 500 mg of magnesium. For best results, highly absorbable sources of magnesium like magnesium aspartate or citrate should be taken. Diabetic patients should also be sure to get at least 25 mg of vitamin B 6 per day because the level of vitamin B 6 within body cells appears to be intricately linked to the cells’ magnesium content. In other words, without vitamin B 6 (as well as vitamin E), magnesium will not get inside the cells and will therefore be useless.


Zinc deficiency, like chromium deficiency, has also been suggested to play a role in the development of diabetes.143 Although severe zinc deficiency is rare in developed countries, many individuals in the United States have marginal zinc deficiency. This is particularly com- mon in the elderly population as well as in people with diabetes. Zinc is involved in virtually all aspects of insulin metabolism: synthesis, secre- tion, and utilization. Zinc also has a protective effect against beta-cell destruction and has well-known antiviral effects. Patients with diabe- tes typically excrete too much zinc in the urine and therefore require supplementation (e.g., 30 mg of zinc daily). Zinc is also found in good amounts in nuts and seeds.

## Manganese

Manganese functions in many enzyme systems, including those involved in blood glucose control, energy metabolism, and thyroid hormone function. Manganese also functions in the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD). Patients with diabetes have been shown to have only one-half the manganese of normal individuals. In a large epidemiological study, dietary manganese intake was inversely proportional to type 2 diabetes incidence.144 A good daily dose of man- ganese for a patient with diabetes is 1.5 to 3 mg.

## Biotin

has been shown to enhance insulin sensitivity and increase the activity of the enzyme glucokinase—which is responsible for the first step in the utilization of glucose by the liver. Glucokinase concentrations in patients with diabetes are low. Evidently, supplementing the diet with high doses of biotin improves glucokinase activity and glucose metabolism. In one study, 16 mg of biotin daily resulted in a significant lowering of fast- ing blood glucose levels and improvements in blood glucose control in patients with T1DM. In another study in patients with T2DM, similar effects were noted with 9 mg of biotin daily. Biotin therapy has also been shown to be helpful in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy.145,146

## Omega-3 Fatty Acids From Fish Oil Supplements

Omega-3 fatty acids are vital supplements for patients with diabetes. They offer significant protection against heart disease in patients with diabetes, helping lower lipids and blood pressure. They are anti-in- flammatory and promote insulin sensitivity. Omega-3 oils are usually almost completely lacking in the basic diet of patients with diabetes. Foods that contain these oils include oily fish such as wild salmon, sar- dines, herring, trout, and mackerel; walnuts; grass-fed beef; wild game; omega-3 eggs; and ground flax, hemp, and chia seeds. Initially, there were concerns that omega-3 fatty acid supplemen- tation might adversely affect blood glucose control based on earlier studies, but many of these studies were conducted with lower-quality fish oil products that contained significant amounts of cholesterol and lipid peroxides. Two intensive investigations, one conducted at Oxford University and the other at the Mayo Clinic, analyzed data from 18 dou- ble-blind clinical trials involving 823 participants followed for an average of 12 weeks.147,148 Dosages of fish oil (18% eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and 12% docosahexanoic acid [DHA]) ranged from 3 to 18 g/day. Both evaluations came to the same conclusions. Fish oil supplementation has no adverse effect on glycemic control, but it does appear to offer the same protection against cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes that it does in people without diabetes. A more recent analysis of 45 ran- domized controlled trials involving 2674 people with T2DM, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was associated with significant reductions in LDL-C, VLDL-C, triglycerides, and HbA 1c .149 The researchers did note the heterogeneity in the studies, however, that is likely explained by the poorer quality of products used in many of the early studies. It is import- ant for patients with diabetes to ingest a high-quality fish oil product that is guaranteed not to be rancid or to contain mercury, solvents, poly- chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), or other toxins. The combined total EPA + DHA level should be approximately 1000 mg daily.

## Reducing After-Meal Elevations in Blood Glucose Levels

Elevations of blood glucose levels after a meal can wreak biochemical havoc in any patient with diabetes. In fact, an elevation in postprandial blood glucose levels is the major contributor to the development of diabetic complications, especially cardiovascular disease and diseases of the microvasculature (retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy). For example, patients who have a normal fasting blood glucose mea- surement but an average 2-hour postprandial glucose level greater than 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L) have a threefold increase in the incidence of diabetic retinopathy.150 Therefore blunting of the after-meal increase in blood glucose levels is an important goal. In addition to following low-carbohydrate dietary guidelines to reduce postprandial blood glucose levels (eating low-GI/low-GL meals), several natural products can be used. The best supplements in this regard are fiber supplements and natural glucosidase inhibitors.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fiber Supplements

Fiber supplements have been shown to enhance blood glucose control, decrease insulin levels, and reduce the number of calories absorbed by the body. The best fiber sources for reducing postprandial blood glu- cose levels, lowering cholesterol levels, and promoting weight loss are those that are rich in water-soluble fibers, such as glucomannan (from konjac root), psyllium, guar gum, defatted fenugreek seed powder or fiber, seaweed fibers (alginate and carrageenan), and pectin. Clinical studies have repeatedly shown that after-meal blood glucose levels decrease as soluble fiber viscosity increases. This rela- tionship has also been shown to hold true for the other physiological benefits produced by soluble fibers, including increased insulin sensi- tivity, diminished appetite, significant weight control, improved bowel movements, and decreased serum cholesterol.151,152 When taken with water before meals, these types of fiber bind to the water in the stomach and small intestine to form a gelatinous, viscous mass that not only slows down the absorption of glucose but also induces a sense of satiety (fullness) and reduces the absorption of calories. One of the most viscous naturally occurring dietary fibers is gluco- mannan, a soluble fiber obtained from grinding the root of konjac, a plant that has been used as a food and remedy for thousands of years in Asia. Highly refined and uniquely processed glucomannan possesses the greatest viscosity of any single dietary fiber. It is three times more viscous than guar and approximately seven times more viscous than psyllium. Konjac fiber is now easily available in the form of noodles made with konjac root. PGX is a novel natural polysaccharide matrix composed of three natural compounds (glucomannan, alginate, and xanthan gum) com- bined in a proprietary process that leads them to coalesce and form an entirely new matrix that is one of the most viscous fibers ever discov- ered.153,154 By binding glucomannan with alginate and xanthan gum, the viscosity of glucomannan can be amplified to a viscosity three to five times higher than that of glucomannan alone. PGX reduces the gly- cemic index of any food or beverage by 15% to 70% and also reduces postprandial glucose levels when added to or taken with foods.155,156 In a double-blind study with an earlier version of PGX, 3 weeks of supplementation with meals was shown to lower postprandial blood glucose by approximately 20% and insulin secretion by approximately 40%, producing a whole-body insulin-sensitivity index improvement of nearly 50%.157 It was also shown to reduce total cholesterol (12.4%), LDL-C (22.3%), the LDL-C:HDL-C ratio (15%), and serum fruc- tosamine (5%). The typical dosage for PGX is 2.5 to 5 grams before meals. PGX is discussed further in Chapter 201, Obesity.

## Natural Glucosidase Inhibitors

Starches, complex carbohydrates, and even simple sugars (disaccha- rides) like sucrose are broken down in the digestive tract into glucose by the action of certain enzymes. Among the most important of these are the α -glucosidases that line the intestines. Because these enzymes are essential for the breakdown of starches, complex carbohydrates, maltose, and sucrose into absorbable glucose molecules, their inhibi- tion can diminish the after-meal rise in both glucose and insulin. Acarbose (Precose) and miglitol (Glyset) are approved drugs for treat- ing diabetes by inhibiting α -glucosidase. Although clinical studies have shown them to be effective, they are also characterized by a high frequency of mild to moderate gastrointestinal side effects, such as flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Although these side effects generally diminish in frequency and intensity with time, few patients are willing to deal with them. Natural alternatives include berberine and mulberry extract.

## Berberine

Berberine is an alkaloid found in many plants (see Chapter 86, Hydrastis canadensis (Goldenseal) and Other Berberine-Containing Botanicals). In the early 1900s, purified berberine also emerged as a popular natural medicine in China. Berberine exerts a number of

## 1281CHAPTER 165 Diabetes Mellitus Types I and II

interesting effects beneficial in T2DM, including inhibition of gluco- sidase. A meta-analysis of 27 published clinical trials using berber- ine as a therapeutic agent in T2DM, elevated blood lipids, and high blood pressure showed quite convincingly that in the treatment of T2DM, berberine along with lifestyle intervention lowered the level of fasting blood sugar levels, after-meal blood sugar levels, and gly- cosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ) more than lifestyle intervention alone or placebo. When berberine was compared with oral hypoglycemic drugs used in T2DM, there was no statistical significance between treatment with berberine and these drugs. In other words, the clinical results seen with berberine were on par with those of the drugs.158 Much of berberine’s health benefits in T2DM may be the result of modulating the gut microbiota. One of the easy links to this line of thought is that berberine has a very low oral bioavailability. The gut absorption rate of berberine is about 9%, and systemic oral bio- availability is only about 1% of an administered dosage. With so many double-blind studies showing clinical effects, it is thought to work via the microbiome specifically by increasing level of Akkermansia muciniphila because its colonization in the gut is inversely associated with diabetes, obesity metabolic syndrome, and low-grade chronic inflammation.159

## Morus indica

The mulberry plant (Morus indica) is probably best known as food for silkworms, but it has also been highly regarded in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine for human use. It has been shown to possess significant hypoglycemic effects in animal studies, and it contains an effective α -glucosidase inhibitor along with other compounds that appear to improve blood glucose control.160 Mulberry extract has been studied in T2DM, and the results are excellent. In one study, research- ers decided to investigate its effect on blood and RBC lipids as well as to compare its blood glucose–lowering actions with those of the oral antihyperglycemic drug glyburide.161 Patients were given either dried mulberry leaves at a dosage of 3 g/day or one tablet of glyburide (5 mg/day) for 4 weeks. Mulberry therapy significantly improved diabetic control in patients with T2DM (Table 165.5). The results clearly show that fasting blood glucose concentrations were significantly lowered with mulberry therapy, suggesting that it is effective in controlling diabetes. Compared with glyburide treatment, mulberry therapy sig- nificantly reduced the fasting blood glucose concentrations of patients with diabetes (27%; P < 0.01). However, no significant differences were observed in blood glucose concentrations between pretreatments and posttreatments with glyburide (P 0.05). Mulberry extract was also superior to the approved drug in its ability to decrease HgbA 1c , total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides. It also resulted in an increase in HDL-C (the “good cholesterol”). Although these changes were not statistically significant (P > 0.05), there are strong suggestions that this natural product is clearly superior to an established pharmaceutical agent (see Table 165.5). In addition to the benefits for blood glucose levels and blood lipids, mulberry therapy was also shown to reduce the amount of lipid per- oxidation to the cell membranes of RBCs, indicating a significant anti- oxidant effect. Additionally, mulberry therapy significantly decreased membrane cholesterol in patients with T2DM.

The first step in improving insulin function and sensitivity is achieving ideal body weight and following the dietary and lifestyle recommen- dations given earlier, including taking a high-potency multivitamin/ multimineral supplement to make sure that the body has all essential vitamins and minerals required for proper insulin sensitivity. If addi- tional support is necessary to bring blood glucose levels under control, we would recommend using in isolation or in scientifically formulated combinations one or more of the following: Gymnema sylvestre extract, bitter melon, P. quinquefolius (American ginseng) or Panax ginseng, and fenugreek seed extract. We also recommend increasing the intake of onions and garlic.

## Gymnema sylvestre

Gymnema is a plant from India that has long been used as a treatment for diabetes. Recent scientific investigation has upheld its effectiveness in both T1DM and T2DM. Gymnema extracts have been shown to enhance glucose control in diabetic dogs and rabbits. Interestingly, in animals that have their pancreas removed, gymnema has no appar- ent effects, suggesting that it enhances the production or activity of insulin. There is evidence in animal studies that gymnema promotes the regeneration of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Studies in humans also seem to support the possibility of pancreatic regeneration.162 An extract of the leaves of G. sylvestre given to 27 patients with T1DM on insulin therapy was shown to reduce insulin requirements and fasting blood glucose levels as well as to improve blood glucose control.163 These results indicate that gymnema enhances the action of insulin because these patients with diabetes were not recently diag- nosed. Clinical experience also shows that gymnema has a significant benefit in decreasing cravings for carbohydrates and enabling patients to follow a lower-carbohydrate diet. With regard to T2DM, gymnema extract appears to work by enhancing the action of insulin. In one study, 22 patients with T2DM were given gymnema extract along with their oral antihyperglycemic drugs.164 All demonstrated improved blood glucose control, 21 of the 22 were able to reduce their drug dosage considerably, and 5 were able to discontinue their medication and maintain blood glucose control with the gymnema extract alone.

## Momordica charantia

In addition to being eaten as a vegetable in Asia, unripe bitter melon has been used extensively in folk medicine as a remedy for diabetes. The blood glucose–lowering action of the fresh juice or extract of the unripe fruit has been clearly established in modern scientific studies in both T1DM and T2DM. Bitter melon is composed of several compounds with confirmed blood glucose–lowering properties. Charantin, extracted by alcohol, is a hypoglycemic agent composed of mixed steroids that is more potent than the oral hypoglycemic drug tolbutamide. Bitter melon also contains an insulin-like polypeptide, polypeptide-P, which low- ers blood glucose levels when injected like insulin into patients with T1DM. Because it appears to have fewer side effects than insulin, bitter melon has been suggested as a replacement therapy for some patients, although there is little likelihood of this application ever being devel- oped. Fortunately, drinking as little as 2 oz of the juice has shown good results in clinical trials.165,166 Unripe bitter melon is available primarily at Asian grocery stores. Health food stores may have bitter melon extracts, but the fresh juice is probably the best to use because this was what was used in the studies. Bitter melon juice is difficult to make palatable. As its name implies, it is quite bitter, so it is recommended that patients plug their noses and take a 2-oz shot of the juice. The dosage of other forms should approximate this dose.

## Panax quinquefolium and Panax ginseng

Research conducted at the University of Toronto’s Risk Factor Modification Center has uncovered important properties of some ancient natural medicines. In their first studies and published reports, the group used whole powdered American ginseng root (Panax quin- quefolium) and found that a dose of about 3 g before each meal reduced postprandial blood glucose significantly in patients with T2DM.167–170 P. ginseng can also be helpful. In a double-blind controlled study, patients with non–insulin-dependent diabetes were treated for 8 weeks with ginseng extract at 100 or 200 mg or with a placebo. Ginseng ele- vated mood, improved psychophysiological performance, and reduced fasting blood glucose and body weight. The 200-mg dose improved glycated hemoglobin, serum aminoterminalpropetide concentrations, and physical activity.171

## Fenugreek

Fenugreek seeds have demonstrated significant antidiabetic effects in experimental and clinical studies. The active principles are the spe- cial soluble fiber of fenugreek along with the alkaloid trigonelline and 4-hydroxyisoleucine. Fenugreek appears to be helpful in both types of diabetes. Defatted fenugreek seed powder given twice daily at a 50-g dose to patients with T1DM led to a significant reduction in fasting blood glucose and improved the results of glucose tolerance tests.172 A 54% reduction in 24-hour urinary glucose excretion and signif- icant reductions in LDL-C and VLDL-C and triglyceride values also occurred. In patients with T2DM, the addition of 15 g of powdered fenugreek seeds soaked in water significantly reduced postprandial glucose levels during the meal tolerance test.173 However, that is a very large dose and impractical for daily supplementation. In another study, 25 patients with T2DM randomly received 1 g/day of fenugreek seed extract or placebo capsules for 2 months.174 Complex analysis of the data found that the group taking the fenugreek seed extract had improved blood glucose measurements (e.g., fasting blood glucose levels dropped from 148.3–119.9 mg/dL), but there was also a signif- icant decrease in insulin output. This finding indicates that there was a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity, an effect that is most likely due to the 4-hydroxyleucine.

## Allium cepa and Allium sativum

Onions and garlic appear to have significant blood glucose–lowering action. The active principles are believed to be the sulfur-containing compounds allyl propyl disulfide and diallyl disulfide oxide (allicin), respectively, although other constituents such as flavonoids may play a role as well. Although garlic generally has more potent effects, onions can be given at higher doses, and the active compounds appear to be more stable than allicin. Graded doses of onion extracts (1 mL of extract = g of whole onion) at levels sometimes found in the diet (i.e., 1–7 oz of onion) reduced blood glucose levels during an oral glucose tolerance test in a dose-dependent manner. The effects are similar in both raw and boiled onion extracts, indicating that the active components are probably stable.175 Garlic has a wide range of additional well-documented effects that are useful for patients with diabetes, including helping improve blood glucose control, lower cholesterol and blood pressure, and inhibit some of the factors associated with increased risk for vascular compli- cations of diabetes, such as increased fibrinogen levels.

## Preventing Nutritional and Oxidative Stress

Diabetes is characterized by increased nutritional and oxidative stress. Because individuals with diabetes typically have elevated levels of free radicals and oxidative compounds, they are much more likely to expe- rience damage. These highly reactive compounds bind to and destroy cellular compounds. They also greatly increase the inflammatory pro- cess by adding fuel to their destructive fire via increased formation of inflammatory mediators like C-reactive protein. One of the critical goals in nutritionally supporting individuals with diabetes is to flood the body with a high level of antioxidant com- pounds to counteract the negative effects of free radicals and prooxi- dants. This goal is implemented by using the recommendations given earlier, along with taking a flavonoid-rich extract and alpha-lipoic acid.

<!-- chunk -->

## Flavonoids

Flavonoids are extremely important considerations in both T1DM and T2DM, both in terms of possibly improving glycemic control and defi- nitely in the prevention of diabetes complications. A variety of individual flavonoids, like quercetin, as well as flavonoid-rich extracts such as extracts of proanthocyanidolic oligomers (see Chapter 106), Silybum marianum (see Chapter 113), Vaccinium myrtillus (see Chapter 122), and Craetagus oxyacantha (see Chapter 71), have shown favorable mechanisms in blood sugar control, insulin secretion, prevention of oxidative damage, and inhi- bition of glycosylation and sorbitol accumulation. In individuals with diabetes who are already showing signs of long- term complications, it is extremely important to take a flavonoid-rich extract. Because certain flavonoids concentrate in specific tissues, it is possible to take flavonoids that target those tissues. For example, because the flavonoids of bilberry (V. myrtillus) have an affinity for the eye, including the retina, bilberry is probably the best choice in a patient with diabetes who is already exhibiting signs of diabetic ret- inopathy. The point is to identify which flavonoid or flavonoid-rich extract is most appropriate for the patient and then to direct the patient to take it according to the recommended dosage. There is tre- mendous overlap among the mechanisms of action and benefits of fla- vonoid-rich extracts; it is important to take the one that is most specific to the individual’s needs (Table 165.6).

## Alpha-Lipoic Acid

Alpha-lipoic acid is a vitamin-like substance that is often described as “nature’s perfect antioxidant.” Alpha-lipoic acid is a small molecule that is efficiently absorbed and easily crosses cell membranes. Unlike vitamin E, which is primarily fat soluble, and vitamin C, which is water soluble, α -lipoic acid can quench either water- or fat-soluble free rad- icals both inside the cell and in the intracellular spaces. Furthermore, α -lipoic acid extends the biochemical lives of vitamins C and E as well as other antioxidants. Although α -lipoic acid’s primary benefit is as an antioxidant, it has also been shown to lead to an improvement in blood glucose metab- olism as well as blood flow to peripheral nerves and even to stimulate the regeneration of nerve fibers.176 Alpha-lipoic acid is an approved drug in Germany for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. In fact, it has been successfully used in Germany for more than 40 years. The beneficial effects of α -lipoic acid in diabetic neuropathy at a dosage of 400 to 600 mg daily have been confirmed in several double-blind studies.177,178

## Recommendations for Specific Chronic Complications

Following are additional recommendations for dealing with the spe- cific complications of diabetes. The most important method for reduc- ing the risk of these complications is achieving optimal blood glucose control.

<!-- chunk -->

## Elevated Cholesterol

Key natural products used to lower cholesterol levels in diabetes are soluble fiber, garlic, berberine, and niacin. These agents are also dis- cussed in Chapter 149. Berberine may yield the best results because it also addresses blood sugar control and hypertension. Regarding niacin, because taking niacin at higher doses (e.g., 3000 mg or more) can impair glucose tolerance, many physicians have avoided niacin therapy in patients with diabetes. However, studies with slightly lower doses (1000–2000 mg) have not shown that niacin affects the regu- lation of blood glucose adversely.179 For example, during a 16-week double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 148 patients with T2DM were randomized to placebo or 1000 or 1500 mg/day of niacin; in the nia- cin-treated groups, there was no significant loss of glycemic control, and the favorable effects on blood lipids were still apparent.180 Other studies have actually shown HgbA 1c to drop, indicating improved gly- cemic control.181 The most common blood lipid abnormality in patients with T2DM is elevated triglyceride levels; decreased HDL cholesterol levels; and a preponderance of smaller, denser LDL particles. Niacin has been shown to address all of these areas much more significantly than statins or other lipid-lowering drugs. However, one reason that niacin may not be as popular as it should be is the side effect of skin flushing—rather like a prickly heat rash—which typically occurs 20 to 30 minutes after the niacin is taken and disappears within about the same time frame. Other occasional side effects include gastric irritation, nausea, and liver damage. The risk of liver damage is especially pertinent. Patients with diabetes who are overweight often develop fatty livers, which are now considered to be as damaging as livers injured by alcoholism and hepa- titis C. Moreover, a fatty liver may facilitate the development of fibrosis and cirrhosis. Giving niacin to a patient with a fatty liver may put extra stress on that vital organ. Therefore in an overweight patient with dia- betes, high-dose niacin is to be used only under a physician’s supervi- sion. To reduce the side effect of skin flushing, an intermediate-release niacin may be prescribed, one that is identical in its dissolution pattern to the prescription product Niaspan. This product is best taken just before going to bed because most people sleep right through any flush- ing reaction that might occur. If regular niacin is being used, a dosage of 500 mg a night may be tried for 1 week. The dose can then be increased to 1000 mg the next week and 1500 mg the following week. The 1500-mg dose should be given for 2 months before checking the response, and the dose can then be adjusted up or down as needed. Time-release niacin products like Niaspan can be used at the full dosage of 1000 to 2000 mg at night from the beginning. Regardless of the form of niacin being used, periodic checking (at least every 3 months) of cholesterol, HgbA 1c , and liver function is strongly indicated.

## Retinopathy and Cataracts

Diabetic retinopathy has two forms: (1) “simple” retinopathy consist- ing of burst blood vessels, hemorrhages, and swelling and (2) prolif- erative retinopathy with newly formed vessels, scarring, more serious hemorrhage, and retinal detachment. Laser photocoagulation therapy is an important treatment for the more severe type of proliferative reti- nopathy but is still not indicated in milder forms because of the risk of vision loss. That is, there is a risk that the side effects of this treatment may outweigh the benefits. As with other complications of diabetes, prevention is the best treatment, with the key factor being the maintenance of optimal blood glucose control. HgbA 1c should be monitored frequently. Extremely important in the battle against retinopathy are flavo- noid-rich extracts, especially bilberry, pine bark, and grape seed extracts.

## TABLE 165.6 Flavonoids Used in the Treatment of Diabetes and Diabetic Complications

## 1284SECTION 6 Diseases

The flavonoids in these extracts exert many benefits in diabetes, including an ability to increase intracellular vitamin C levels, decrease the leakiness and breakage of capillaries, prevent easy bruising, and serve as potent anti- oxidants. These effects are of particular value in dealing with the micro- vascular abnormalities of diabetes. Because the flavonoids in bilberry, pine bark, and grape seed extract have an affinity for the blood vessels of the eye and improve circulation to the retina, they are particularly helpful in slow- ing the progression of diabetic retinopathy, as evidenced by positive results in more than a dozen clinical trials (see Chapters 106 and 122).

## Neuropathy

In addition to α -lipoic acid and the basic supplementation program, three additional natural medicines, along with acupuncture, deserve mention here. Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) has been shown to improve and prevent diabetic neuropathy. Diabetes is associated with a substan- tial disturbance in EFA metabolism. One of the key disturbances is the impairment in the process of converting linoleic acid to GLA. As a result, providing GLA in the form of borage, evening primrose, or black currant oil can bypass some of this disturbance. In the GLA Multicenter Trial, 111 patients with mild diabetic neuropathy were given either GLA at a dose of 480 mg/day or a placebo for 1 year. Sixteen parameters were assessed, including conduction velocities, hot and cold thresholds, sensation, tendon reflexes, and muscle strength. After 1 year, all 16 parameters improved, 13 of them to a statistically significant degree. Treatment was more effective in patients with dia- betes who were relatively well controlled than in those who were poorly controlled. The latter finding highlights the need for a comprehensive approach in controlling blood glucose levels rather than expecting a single physiological aid (i.e., GLA) to compensate for poor control.182 Benfotiamine is a fat-soluble form of thiamine, or vitamin B 1 , that is more effective in raising blood thiamine levels (up to 120%–240% vs. regular thiamine). In studies in patients with diabetes, benfotiamine decreased advanced glycosylated end-product formation, decreased the aldose reductase pathway, and reduced oxidative cellular dam- age.183 However, results in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and nephropathy in small clinical trials with benfotiamine alone have shown modest to no benefit.184,185 It is possible that benfotiamine can be usefully combined with α -lipoic acid. In a small study in patients with T1DM, treatment with 600 mg of benfotiamine plus 300 mg of α -lipoic acid produced better results in reducing the effects of hyper- glycemia than benfotiamine alone.186 Capsaicin is the active component of cayenne pepper (Capsicum frutescens), which stimulates and then blocks the small nerve fibers that transmit the pain impulse by depleting these fibers of a transmitting substance known as substance P. In numerous double-blind studies, topically applied capsaicin has been shown to be of considerable bene- fit in relieving the pain of diabetic neuropathy. Roughly 80% of people with diabetic neuropathy experience great relief in this way. Commercial ointments containing 0.025% or 0.075% capsaicin are available over the counter. The patient should apply the 0.075% cream twice daily to the affected area (the first covering his or her hand with plastic wrap to prevent the capsaicin from coming in contact with the eyes or mucous membranes). It may take a few days for the cream to start working, and it will continue to work only with regular application. Acupuncture can also be helpful in improving neuropathy. The scientific investigation of acupuncture in diabetes includes both exper- imental and clinical studies. For example, animal experiments have shown that acupuncture can act on the pancreas to enhance insulin synthesis, increase the number of receptors on target cells, and accel- erate the utilization of glucose, resulting in the lowering of blood glu- cose.187 However, the best documentation for the clinical application of acupuncture is in treating chronic painful diabetic neuropathy. In one clinical study, 77% of patients treated with acupuncture noted a significant improvement in their symptoms, with 21% noting that their symptoms were completely eliminated.188 That success rate is excellent considering the long-standing nature of the condition in most of the cases and the fact that no side effects were observed.

## Nephropathy

Many of the previous recommendations also apply to preventing dia- betic nephropathy. In fact, a strong reason for adhering to the dietary principles outlined previously is to protect the diabetic kidneys. Especially important, again, is dietary fiber. Dietary fibers (especially the water-soluble type) are fermented in the colon to produce short- chain fatty acids. These by-products are the primary fuel for colonic cells and, if present in high amounts, greatly increase the colon’s waste-removal capabilities. It has been shown that in the presence of a diet high in fermentable fiber, the colon turns into the “second kidney” as it collects nitrogenous wastes out of the blood and disposes of them via the feces. This has been shown to greatly reduce the workload and stress on the kidneys themselves.189 Highlighting just how important some basic supplement recom- mendations are in halting the progression of diabetic nephropathy are the results of a study of 30 patients with T2DM with elevated albumin in their urine. These patients received vitamin C (1250 mg) and vita- min E (680 IU) daily or a matching placebo for 4 weeks, followed by a 3-week washout period before being switched to the other arm.190 The results were that the vitamins were successful in reducing urinary albumin levels by an average of nearly 20%, indicating that antioxidant therapy may halt or slow down the progression of kidney disease in patients with diabetes. If a patient has developed serious kidney failure, then following the low-protein, low-potassium standard diet becomes necessary; unfor- tunately, that does not promote good glucose control, which can then worsen kidney function. The main goal is to prevent end-stage renal disease from developing in the first place. If drugs are necessary, the ACE inhibitors and ACE receptor block- ers offer the greatest benefits in dealing with diabetic nephropathy.191 They are now often prescribed in low doses to help prevent nephrop- athy even in the absence of high blood pressure. Alternatively, a spe- cial preparation of bonito peptides has been shown to exert anti-ACE activity (see Chapter 179 for more information) and may prevent the need for ACE-inhibitor drugs.

## Poor Wound Healing

A deficiency of virtually any essential nutrient can lead to impaired wound healing. Key nutrients include vitamin C and zinc, both of which are often deficient in patients with diabetes. Taking a high-potency multivitamin/multimineral formula should improve nutritional sta- tus and promote proper wound healing. For topical application, pure (100%) Aloe vera gel can be used. The wound-healing effects of Aloe vera are well known. It contains a number of compounds that promote wound healing, including vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc. It has been shown to stimulate many factors important to wound repair and should be applied to affected areas (not open wounds) two to three times daily. Another option is a topical ointment called Amerigel, featuring an oak extract (Quercus rubra), which contains tannins, including quercitan- nic acid, catechin, ellagitannin, and proanthocyanidin, that are readily absorbed into damaged skin.

## Foot Ulcers

Lack of blood supply, poor wound healing, and peripheral neuropathy are key factors in the development of diabetic foot ulcers. Key strategies

<!-- chunk -->

## 1285CHAPTER 165 Diabetes Mellitus Types I and II

in prevention and treatment are proper foot care (including professional care of nails and calluses), preferably by a podiatrist; regular physician’s examination of the feet; avoidance of injury; avoidance of tobacco in any form; and the use of methods to improve the local circulation. Proper foot care includes keeping the feet clean, dry, and warm and wearing well-fit- ting shoes. Tobacco use in any form constricts the peripheral blood vessels and can lead to more serious peripheral vascular disease, including severe arterial blockages. Diabetes and smoking are like nitro plus glycerin—a sure recipe for catastrophe. Circulation can be improved by exercising reg- ularly, avoiding sitting cross-legged or in other positions that compromise circulation, and massaging the feet lightly upward. Ginkgo biloba or grape seed extract can also be used to support optimal circulation.


Effective treatment of patients with diabetes requires the careful inte- gration of wide-ranging therapies and patients who are willing to sub- stantially improve their lifestyles. T2DM is usually the result of many years of chronic metabolic insult and, although treatable with the natu- ral metabolic approach presented here, requires persistence for its ulti- mate resolution. Although much of the information presented in this chapter focuses on T2DM, it is equally appropriate for T1DM, with the exception that, according to current information, the patient with T1DM will always require insulin. The first step in the therapy of either T1DM or T2DM is a thorough diagnostic workup. Of particular importance is identifying any of the complications of diabetes. The patient’s diet, environment, and life- style should be carefully studied to rule out any exposure to agents that may be inducing his or her glucose intolerance. A diet, exercise, and supplement program that meets the patient’s individual needs and his or her current level of glucose tolerance should be developed. For maximum efficacy, the patient’s ideal body weight must be achieved (see Chapter 201 for additional recommendations). In treating patients with severe or uncontrolled diabetes, a high level of awareness of the acute diabetic complications must be main- tained. If the patient is on insulin, the physician should be adept at using, changing, and adapting insulin types and doses according to the individual’s particular needs. Finally, the patient must be monitored carefully, particularly if he or she is on insulin or has relatively uncontrolled diabetes. Patient symptomatology, home glucose monitoring, and the HgbA 1c test are at present the best ways to monitor progress. It is important to recognize that as these therapies take effect, the patient’s drug dosages must be altered and that a good working relationship with the physician will greatly aid the healing process. The ultimate goal is to reestablish nor- mal glycemia and prevent the development of (or ameliorate) the com- plications of diabetes.


The optimal healthy diet detailed in Chapter 44 is clearly the diet of choice. All simple, processed, and concentrated carbohydrates must be avoided. A low-GI diet rich in high-fiber foods should be stressed, and sources of healthy fats should be ingested. Low-GI vegetables, partic- ularly onions and garlic, are useful, and their liberal ingestion should be encouraged.

effects on the immune system functions, which we will explore next, or epigenetic changes in relevant genes.

## Immune System

A growing body of information implicates the immune system in the pathophysiology of endometriosis. Abnormalities of cytokines and adhesion molecules, increased numbers and activation of peritoneal macrophages, changes in T cells and natural killer (NK) cells (which normally remove cellular debris from retrograde menstruation), and the presence of increased autoimmunity are notable findings in endo- metriosis. It is not known whether the immune system changes are pri- mary (causative) in the transformation of totipotent cells of the pelvic peritoneum or the failure to remove viable cells from retrograde men- strual effluent, or if its aberrations are secondary, that is, in response to the development and invasion of the endometrial implant.

## Estrogen Levels (Production and Metabolism) and

## Xenoestrogens

Endometriosis has long been known to be an estrogen-related disease. Men don’t get it. Women don’t get it premenarche. It occurs during the reproductive period, and the incidence increases in perimeno- pause, during the period of increased estrogen and decreased proges- terone. It regresses at menopause or with oophorectomy. It responds to estrogen-lowering agents such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH) agonists, danazol, and aromatase inhibitors.8 However, none of these drugs, although they may improve symptoms, improves fertil- ity. Endometriosis may return in menopausal women put on hormone replacement therapy, although many tolerate low-dose therapy. Because endometrial implants make their own estrogen, as many as one third of implants are out of sync with the eutopic endometrium,9–11 suggest- ing that the hormonal signals from the ovary are being overridden by the production of local estrogens. More recently, aromatase has been found to be present in endometrial implants but not in eutopic endome- trium.12 However, aromatase inhibitors have not been found as helpful in managing disease as it was once thought they would be.13 The bene- fits of oral contraceptives, long thought to prevent endometriosis and ameliorate its symptoms,14 are currently in debate. A meta-analysis in 2011 found that the apparent protective effect may have been due to the postponement of surgical evaluation and suggested that this treatment was “not sufficiently substantiated.”15 Numerous lines of research have confirmed the association of endometriosis with higher levels of endogenous, exogenous, and xeno- estrogens (polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], weed killers, plastics, detergents, household cleaners, tin can liners) and altered estrogen metabolism. Prenatal factors such as exposure to xenoestrogens have also been seen in these women.16

# ETIOLOGICAL THEORIES

The origin of endometriosis remains a mystery. Many theories have been proposed, but none fits all the findings in patients with endo- metriosis. Establishing a correct hypothesis leads to targeted research, which benefits patients. Following an incorrect hypothesis leads to confusion, expensive and misleading research, and incorrect results, which do not benefit or only partially benefit patients.17 It is possible that part of the confusion regarding the origin of endometriosis is that, as noted before, different locations of endometriosis and depth of dis- ease may represent entirely different diseases.18 It is also likely that the origin of endometriosis is multifactorial.

## Retrograde Flow

Retrograde flow, the predominant theory, first proposed in 1927 by Sampson, proposes that during menses, menstrual effluent flows backward through the fallopian tubes, and living endometrial cells implant in the pelvic cavity. The problem with this theory is that more than 90% of menstruating women without endometriosis have retro- grade flow as well. Women get endometriosis after tubal ligation and, rarely, after menopause. Finally, eutopic endometrial cells are genetically different from endometriosis cells. Thus this theory has been challenged, and questions have been raised regarding the biochemical and immuno- logical factors causing the implantation of endometrial tissue within the pelvic environment.19 The persistence of this theory, however, suggests that there may be factors in the menstrual effluent, such as inflammatory cytokines or autoantibodies, that stimulate or support endometriosis in nearby pelvic tissues. Finally, the eutopic endometrium of these women appears to be different from the endometrium of normal women.12 Alterations in apoptosis, proliferation, adhesive and invasive behav- ior, angiogenesis, neurogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, hormone produc- tion and responsiveness, and immunological regulation differ between women with and without endometriosis.20 Implants found in odd loca- tions, such as the brain, nose, and lungs, suggest the transportation of endometrial tissue through lymphatic channels and/or blood vessels.20

## Cellular Transformation

Another theory suggests that that “totipotent” (stem) cells are some- how triggered to transform. Some researchers believe the implants to be of embryological origin. Indeed, genetics specific to stem cells have been identified in endometriosis.21,22 A closely related theory suggests that pieces of the embryonic female reproductive tract (Mullerian cells) were left behind during developmental migration and that these cells, when activated, transform in some way to become endometriosis. The growing understanding of the genetics of these aberrant cells is likely to shed light on the true origin of endometriosis in the near future.

## Environmental Toxins

A recurring question is whether environmental toxins, many of which are estrogen mimics, are involved or even causative in endometriosis. Research on endometriosis in baboons suggests activation by environ- mental toxins that mimic estrogens.23 Exposure to radiation and dioxin has been associated with a higher frequency of endometriosis.24,25 The highest incidence of endometriosis appears to be in Belgium, which is also the home to the highest level of dioxin pollution in the world.26 Two studies, however, one in Belgium, found no significantly increased risk associated with dioxins or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).27 The other study, in Italy, found no significantly increased risk of endome- triosis in women who had high levels of dioxin in their blood.28 These studies also point out the difficulty of studying a fat-soluble chemical that may not show up in the blood. Although there is currently no widely accepted epidemiological evidence linking any one class of chemicals to the risk of endometriosis, there does appear to be some link with estro- gen-like compounds in the environment,29 called xenoestrogens, which can interact with the estrogen receptor and disrupt estrogen metabolism. In addition to estrogen mimetics, there are a number of environmen- tal toxins that have strong associations but for which there is no clear mechanism. For example, women with endometriosis have significantly higher levels (median 0.57 micro g/mL vs. median 0.18 micro g/mL) of high-molecular-weight Di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) than con- trols.30 However, the levels do not correlate with severity. Several studies also show a correlation with perfluorocarbon levels.31

## Immune Origins

Immunological alterations may exist in women with endometriosis. Lack of proper immune surveillance in the pelvis following men- strual retrograde flow may allow endometrial cells to implant rather than be phagocytized and removed.32 Alteration of the inflammatory response to the implanted tissue is then involved in progression and

severity of disease. These alterations may be generational and begin in utero.33 Women with endometriosis have been found to have suppressed NK-cell activity in their peritoneal fluid,34,35 high levels of immunoglobulins (Igs) IgG and IgM,36 and high levels of auto- antibodies against ovary and endometrial cells.37,38 Macrophages, cytokines, T lymphocytes, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α ) are all found in greater numbers in the peritoneal fluid in early stages of endometriosis.39 Both types of immunity, cell-mediated and humoral, have been implicated in endometriosis, with immuno- logical defects present with even minimal disease.40 Growth factors, angiogenic factors, and lipid peroxidation in the peritoneal fluid may stimulate endometrial cell growth.41–43 Targeting of these proinflam- matory compounds and blocking their action with anti-inflamma- tory antioxidants and natural compounds are being investigated as new treatment strategies.

## Oxidative Stress

The presence of high levels of iron from retrograde flow creates oxi- dative stress, another factor linked to causation in endometriosis. The contents of endometriotic cysts, especially the high concentration of free iron, are a possible cause of carcinogenesis in the cysts through the iron-induced persistent oxidative stress.44

## Genetic Origins

Endometriosis is now considered to be of multifactorial origin by most researchers.45 Grouping of endometriosis cases within families has long been found in clinical studies,46,47 population-based studies,48 and studies of twins,49-51 all of which suggest the importance of genet- ics in the origins of endometriosis. Several abnormalities in detox- ification enzymes, tumor-suppressor genes, and antioxidant genes, interacting in multistep fashion, may be involved in both the devel- opment and the progression of the disease,52 but no single genes that are primarily responsible have been identified. Epigenetic influences from the gut and the environment and prenatal influences also under- line the importance of genetics, regardless of the theory of origins we ultimately accept.

## Gut Dysfunction and Pathology

The search for a unifying theory of the origins of endometriosis that explains all the research quickly leads to the gastrointestinal tract.53 Its close proximity to the most common sites of endometriosis; the fre- quent involvement of large and small bowel; dietary approaches that ameliorate symptoms; the inflammatory nature of the disease; and the effect of higher levels of endogenous estrogens, xenoestrogens, and other toxins ingested orally make looking to the gut for origins and to find preventive and curative measures a necessity. Let’s look at the evidence implicating the gut: 1. Because family genetics is an important association, we must remember that family members share their microbiome as well as their genes. 2. The amount of pain is not proportional to the amount of disease, suggesting that both the disease and the pain come from a third cause: the gut. 3. Although associated with endometriosis, the cause or causes of infertility are not known. One theory linked tubal transport of the fertilized egg to dysbiosis. 4. Dietary interventions improve endometriosis symptoms.54 5. One of the most frequent sites of endometrial implants is the cul- de-sac between the uterus and rectum. One of the most common extraperitoneal sites is the rectovaginal septum just below the cul- de-sac. These sites, in close proximity to the rectum, would share the highest levels of toxins and toxic bacteria. 6. The gut microbiota is not only essential for physiological gastro- intestinal function but also acts as a central regulator of a variety of inflammatory and proliferative conditions. “[W]e hypothesize that the gut microbiota may be involved crucially in the onset and progression of endometriosis.”55 7. Alterations in gut bacteria and the gut-associated immune system in inflammatory bowel diseases produce an exudate that closely approximates the peritoneal fluid in early endometriosis (i.e., high levels of cytokines and macrophages). 8. Women with endometriosis are more likely to be diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease (altered bacteria likely sourced from the gut) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), both of which are associated with dysbiosis.51 9. Inflammation produces adhesions, a common finding in patients with endometriosis. 10. Eighty percent of the immune system is found in the gut. The immune response to altered contents in the gut (food, toxins, and the microbiome) produce many if not all of the altered immune system findings in endometriosis. Endometriosis and IBS share a picture of chronic inflammation.51 11. TNF- α has been shown to be in higher quantities in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. TNF- α has been shown to induce accelerated differentiation of stem cells. TNF- α is thought to be a critical factor in the induction and maintenance of endo- metrial implants.56,57 12. Autoimmunity is now both seen in patients with endometriosis and closely linked to gut pathology. 13. The pelvic peritoneum can be altered by benign and malignant forms of any of the three cell types of the female genital tract: serous (tubal) cells, endometrial cells, and mucinous (cervical) cells. These diseases are called endosalpingosis, endometriosis, and pseudomyxoma peritonei when benign and are called epithe- lial ovarian cancer (serous, endometrioid, and mucinous) when malignant. Although tubal cells might flow retrograde, cervical cells are not likely to go “upstream,” making the transformation of peritoneal cells more likely than retrograde flow as an etiology. Thus we must look for reasons for the transformation of the peri- toneal “totipotential cells.” 14. Epithelial ovarian cancer of all three types (serous/tubal, endome- trioid/endometrial, and mucinous/cervical) occurs more often in patients with endometriosis. This disease (epithelial ovarian can- cer) is deadly because it is rarely found “early.” In fact, the ovarian disease may start in multiple locations on the peritoneal surface and simply predominate in the epithelium of the ovary because the peritoneal surface reflected over the ovary is more richly sup- plied with estrogen, allowing what may start as peritoneal disease to progress more rapidly in that location. 15. Patients with endometriosis are more likely to develop endome- trioid ovarian cancer and perhaps ovarian cancer of other types, suggesting cellular transformation and issues of altered environ- ment. 16. The cells that become endometriosis are stem cells.22 17. Peritoneal stem cells are responding to something that is going on in the pelvis. Gastrointestinal immune activation is a likely candi- date.


The clinical diagnosis of endometriosis is presumptive. A definitive diagnosis requires surgical evaluation and biopsy. Endometriosis is rarely seen before menarche. Although in some cases symptoms begin with the onset of menstruation, in most patients, symptoms

## 1290SECTION 6 Diseases

begin later and worsen progressively over time, suggesting the importance of stimulation of the disease by estrogens and/or the accumulation of xenoestrogens with time. It should be noted that pre-menarche girls with abdominal pain are usually diagnosed with gut problems, not gynecological problems, unless they have signs of infection. Although the triad of symptoms of endometriosis is dys- menorrhea, dyspareunia, and infertility, two of these—dyspareunia and infertility—may not be issues for young women having men- strual cramps, so the diagnosis may be missed. Acute pain may occur for only a few hours at the onset of menses or be present throughout the month. In some women, vomiting, diarrhea, and fainting can occur concurrently, suggesting a vagal component, with the intense pelvic/abdominal cramping and pains that are likened to con- tractions in childbirth. These are largely the symptoms of a heavy menstrual flow trying to pass through a small cervical outlet and autonomic stimulation from abdominal organs. In many women, these symptoms disappear after first childbirth (especially when the cervix is dilated by labor.) Because these symptoms also occur in conditions likely to produce retrograde flow, it is hard to state which comes first: heavy, painful periods or endometriosis. Other sensations include rectal pain producing a chronic bearing-down sensation, pressure in the lower back, and pain sometimes radiating down the legs, likely related to irritation of the psoas muscle, which attaches to the lower spine and courses retroperitoneally through the pelvis and down the front side of the leg, placing it immediately under the pelvic peritoneum, where implants may cause the muscle to tighten and spasm. The correlation between pain and the extent of disease is weak. Women with fixed ovaries and large endometri- omas may report only mild discomfort, whereas those with visibly smaller lesions may report severe chronic pain. Pain therefore may be caused not by the endometriosis but by whatever causes endo- metriosis.58 Some research suggests that the severity of symptoms is correlated with the depth of the lesions rather than the number or size of lesions.59,60 Symptoms may also include pain with urination or bowel movements; bleeding from ectopic sites of endometrial implants, such as the nose or bowels; and fatigue. Endometriomas, endometroid involvement of the epithelium reflected over the ovaries, are found in two of three patients with endometriosis. It is likely that endometriosis simply grows fastest on the peritoneal surface reflecting over the estrogen-producing ovary. This may also be true of epithelial ovarian cancer, leading the diagnos- ing surgeon to conclude that epithelial cancers begin in the ovary and spread to the peritoneum when, in fact, they may begin throughout the peritoneal cavity. (No wonder we don’t “find them soon enough.”) The association of endometriosis and ovarian cancer was first reported by Sampson in 1925. The origin of ovarian cancer is unknown, but both endometriosis and certain ovarian cancers share genetic changes (loss of p53 and PTEN and ARID1A).61 Endometriosis is associated with infertility and miscarriage and is often found in women at laparoscopic evaluation for infer- tility. The amount of endometriosis does not always correlate with infertility. Some women with small peritoneal implants are infertile, whereas some women with severe disease may become pregnant. Data suggest that excessive amounts of free radicals accompany endometriosis. Tubal scarring, adhesions, and unrup- tured follicles are common findings in women with endometriosis and concurrent infertility. Alterations of eutopic endometrium are also found in patients with endometriosis. Autoantibodies, including those to sperm, have been found. All of these as well as the inflammatory environment of the pelvis may contribute to poor ovulation, tubal transport, and implantation of the fertilized egg.

## Physical Findings

Physical examination reveals one or more of the following: tenderness of the pelvic area, cul-de-sac, or both; enlarged or tender ovaries; a uterus that tips backward (and may be retroflexed as well as retro- verted) and lacks mobility due to adhesions; and other fixed pelvic structures. Endometrial tissue can be visible in surgical scars, in the vagina, and on the cervix. Physical examination during the first or sec- ond day of menses may accentuate tender areas or nodules in the cul- de-sac or in the septum between the rectum and vagina. An ultrasound examination of the pelvis can be useful in ruling out other pathology and tumors but is not a definitive tool in diagnosing endometriosis. It can detect a fluid-filled mass on the ovary and deter- mine the size, characteristics, and consistency of the cyst, suggesting endometrioma, but it often fails to identify peritoneal disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## Laboratory Findings

A blood test, CA-125, can have positive results in endometriosis but cannot differentiate among endometriosis, uterine fibroids, malignan- cies, and even normal tissue. A definitive diagnosis of endometriosis can only be accomplished with laparoscopy or laparotomy. Endometrial implants, endometrio- mas, or both are then visualized, and a presumptive diagnosis is made. Only biopsy gives the definitive answer.


Endometriosis is a multifactorial disease. Therefore therapeutic approaches must be individualized for maximum benefit to each patient. Numerous drugs, surgical procedures, and integrative approaches have been tried. Most medical approaches to date have been only mildly to moderately successful in ameliorating symptoms and consist of hormone intervention aimed at lowering estrogen effects or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aimed at decreasing inflammation. Only surgery has been successful in eradi- cating disease and stopping the feed-forward mechanisms that drive estrogen production, inflammatory cascades, and visceral hypersen- sitivity (pain).62 And only surgery has proven effective in improving fertility. Recurrence rates are high, so surgical intervention should be timed to closely precede attempts at conception. These factors suggest that we are not getting at causes—that is, we are focusing our attention too far “downstream.” Therapeutic approaches should be aimed at the following: a. Minimizing symptoms because there are significant quality-of-life issues for these women b. Slowing or arresting the progression of disease, especially before desired childbearing, to preserve fertility and avoid or delay surgery c. Improving fertility rates A multifactorial approach to causes suggests the following areas to address therapeutically: 1. Lowering estrogen levels and improving estrogen metabolism 2. Decreasing xenoestrogens and toxic exposures 3. Improving gut health 4. Approaches that decrease inflammation Approaches that have multiple effects will be starred (*).


Diet is the common denominator in a multifactorial approach to endometriosis.63 Sadly, research on diet and endometriosis is sparse.64 Several dietary principles are key in a natural medicine approach to endometriosis, as discussed in the following subsections.

## Reduce Inflammatory Foods and Increase Anti-inflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

## Foods

Perhaps the most inflammatory food is gluten*. Producing zonulin, which causes leaky gut, gluten increases the gut-associated immune system reactivity to intraluminal irritants and antigens, inducing inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and TNF- α . Additionally, removing gluten will often decrease carbohydrate consumption and help prevent insulin resistance (discussed later in the chapter). Consuming higher amounts of anti-inflammatory prostaglandin pre- cursors (omega-3* and certain omega-6 fatty acids, discussed later in the chapter) and blocking leukotrienes (with omega-3 eicosapentae- noic acid [EPA]) may be more effective and safer than NSAIDs, the current first approach for pelvic pain. Decreasing “flesh foods”* (dairy, red meat, eggs), which contain high amounts of arachidonic acid (the inflammatory prostaglandin series 2 precursor), is also recommended. This approach may also limit toxins excreted in cow’s milk and anti- gens in meat and dairy that drive the inflammatory process. Avoiding insulin resistance*, a diabetes precursor and major cause of inflamma- tion and driver of obesity, with its accompanying increase in estrogen, is critical as well. Anti-inflammatory herbs and vegetables*, discussed later in the chapter, complete the four major parts of an anti-inflam- matory diet: good fat, balanced carbohydrates, avoidance of gluten and inciting food antigens, and the addition of anti-inflammatory plants. Avoiding abdominal obesity (a stress-related disease) because of the inflammogenic properties of visceral adiposity may also be helpful.65

## Enhance Detoxification Mechanisms, Especially Estrogen

<!-- chunk -->

## Metabolism

By increasing the intake of vegetables*, specifically those that enhance Phase I and Phase II detoxification in the liver, improving metabolism of estrogen and providing methylation factors, cell damage from tox- ins and estrogen metabolites can be limited. Methylation-supporting (lipotropic factors)66 and detoxification-supporting vegetables to be increased include carrots, beets (carotene-containing vegetables; see later discussion), and cruciferous vegetables and green leafy vegetables. Indole-3-carbinol—found in broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, kale, and cauliflower—favors the production of less active 2OH metabo- lite of estrogen, thereby decreasing the more potent 16OH metabolite and the more dangerous DNA-damaging 4OH metabolite.67 Other liver-supporting foods include artichokes, lemons, dandelion greens, watercress, and burdock root. Onions, garlic, and leeks contain orga- nosulfur compounds, which enhance the immune system and induce enzymes that detoxify in the liver. They also provide the sulfate groups that modulate estrogen effects and are a major Phase II pathway for estrogens. In addition, they contain the bioflavonoid quercetin, which is known to stimulate the immune response, protect against oxidation, block the inflammatory response, and inhibit tumor growth by lowering aromatase.68 Adding a tablespoon of milk thistle seeds that have been soaked and ground can also help liver function because silymarin is known to increase Phase I detoxification. Organically grown vegeta- bles are expected to contain lower levels of pesticides and herbicides that may also mimic estrogen. In some studies, fruit was associated with increased risk (more than two servings/day). It is likely that the extra sugar is not helpful, whereas most studies show a significant benefit from vegetables. This may be mediated through beneficial effects on the microbiome.69

<!-- chunk -->

## Increase Soy/Isoflavones and Lignans

The isoflavones in soy products and the lignans in flax seeds* may also be important in a dietary approach to endometriosis. Although some claim that these phytoestrogen compounds should be avoided, think- ing that they would stimulate the growth of endometriotic implants, much as estrogen does, the evidence supports the conclusion that soy is beneficial in the diets of women with endometriosis.70 A recent study in an endometriosis model in mice showed a dramatic lower- ing of estrogen receptors; inflammatory markers; and HIF-1a, a tumor marker, in mice given genistein in various doses.71

<!-- chunk -->

## Improving Gut Function and the Microbiome

Foods high in fiber are associated with optimal transit time in the intes- tines and an optimal balance of friendly microorganisms within the large intestines (see Chapter 132). These microorganisms, better known as the microbiome, must remain healthy to crowd out flora that produces beta-glucuronidase, which deconjugates estrogens and allows them to recycle back through the body (called enterohepatic circulation). Freshly ground flax seeds*, high vegetable roughage (cellulose), and omega-3 fatty acids* all improve transit time in the large bowel, preventing absorption of some of the toxic load as well as feeding healthy bacteria. These “dual-use” foods are easily incorporated into the diet in smooth- ies, muffins, and dishes that combine fish and vegetables (fish tacos, for example). Magnesium*-rich foods, or magnesium taken as a supplement (see following discussion), are also useful for this purpose. Increased fiber content (24g/day) was shown in Women’s Heath Initiative (WHI) to lower IL-6 and TNF- α .72 Seasonings such as turmeric (curcumin) protect against environmental carcinogens, decrease inflammation, and increase bile secretion. Fresh flax seeds increase anti-inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids. Seasoning with Fucus (a seaweed) helps stimulate T-cell production and absorb toxins.73 Studies suggest that a predomi- nantly vegetarian diet emphasizing less protein and more fiber can lead to a decrease of biologically active unconjugated estrogens in the blood plasma.74 Vegetarian diets are also of greater value owing to their lower fat content. Diets containing large amounts of animal protein, especially in the form of red meat, contain large amounts of arachidonic acid, which promotes inflammatory prostaglandins and thus inflammation and pain. Being higher on the food chain, the animals that produce red meat carry a greater burden of toxins from the environment. Adding vegetable protein, soy, nut butters (e.g., almond), and salmon to our diets tips the inflammatory pathway toward the anti-inflammatory pros- taglandins that inhibit tumor growth—both benign and malignant.

<!-- chunk -->

## Increase Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Reduce Trans Fats

Omega-3 fats, in addition to their anti-inflammatory function, improve membrane function, making membranes more fluid and accommodating to receptors. Omega-3 fats are precursors for series 3 anti-inflammatory prostaglandins and block the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) enzyme as well as the lipoxygenase enzyme. The arachi- donic acid in flesh foods increases prostaglandin E 2 (PGE2) and the inflammatory series 2 prostaglandin, which increases aromatase, adding to the feed-forward production of estrogens in endometri- osis.75 Lowering fat and increasing essential fatty acids (EFAs) and short-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs)76; adding unfried, low-mercury, low-contamination fish to the diet77; and decreasing saturated fats78 have all been shown to be beneficial. The consumption of trans fats appears to increase the risk of endo- metriosis,79 whereas long-chain omega-3 fats appear to be protective. Twelve years of prospective data from the Nurses’ Health Study II, which began in 1989, were analyzed for dietary fat and its association with many health problems, including endometriosis.80 Although there was no association with total fat consumption and endometri- osis risk, those women with the highest consumption of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids were 22% less likely to be diagnosed with endo- metriosis compared with women who had the lowest intake of these fats. Those women who had the highest intake of trans unsaturated fats were 48% more likely to be diagnosed with endometriosis.

## Foods to Avoid

Foods to decrease include sugar, caffeine, dairy, red meat, and alcohol. Sugar is known to increase estrogen levels.81 A study of 50 women with endometriosis examined the effect of the reduction of higher glycemic carbohydrates, the addition of omega-3 and omega-9 fatty acids, and the elimination of foods containing caffeine and tyramine; after 8 weeks, there was a significant reduction in symptoms.82 Endometriosis is found to be specifically correlated with caffeine consumption. Women consuming 5 to 7 g of caffeine monthly had a 1.2 times greater inci- dence of endometriosis, whereas those consuming more than 7 g had a 1.6 times greater increase.83 The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 90% of human dioxin exposure is through food, primar- ily meat and dairy products.84 Cheese, particularly cottage cheese, and milk cause the lipid pathway to be tipped toward prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which cause inflammation, smooth muscle contraction, and vascular constriction. Alcohol consumption depletes stores of B vitamins in the liver and affects the metabolism of estrogen.


A number of nutritional supplements have been looked at related to the amelioration of symptoms, the development of endometriosis, and the preservation of fertility. The side effects of these supplements are minimal.

<!-- chunk -->

## Estrogen Metabolism Facilitators

A number of supplements have been studied and found to be beneficial in lowering estrogen levels and improving estrogen metabolism. Because there is a clear benefit to lowering estrogen to slow the progression of disease, this same approach is helpful in patients with endometriosis. Important areas of estrogen production and metabolism to address are as follows: (1) aromatase, the main estrogen-producing enzyme; (2) 17OH dehydrogenase, the balance between the more potent estradiol and the less potent estrone; (3) Phase I detoxification, which involves directing the metabolites away from 16OH estrone (CPY3A4) and 4OH estrone (CYP1B1) to the least toxic 2OH estrogen (CYP1A1); and (4) Phase II detoxification, which involves methylation, sulfation, and glu- curonidation to prevent DNA damage by oxidative intermediates and make the estrogens water soluble so that they can be excreted in urine or feces. There are numerous foods and natural substances that are effective in improving the overall estrogen picture in patients with endometriosis.

<!-- chunk -->

## Aromatase Inhibitors

Because estrogen is being produced locally in the endometriosis implant, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) would seem to be an effective treatment. Pharmaceutical AIs have not been as successful as expected and are reserved for patients who do not respond to first-line therapies. A number of plant substances have been shown to be aromatase inhib- itors. Because they have few if any side effects, and some do double duty (COX-2 inhibitors), they should be included in a comprehensive approach to endometriosis: COX-2 inhibitors (see discussion of Essential Fatty Acids later in the chapter) Essential fatty acids* (discussed later in the chapter)

<!-- chunk -->

## Indole-3-Carbinol

Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) or DIM (a metabolic product of I3C in the gut) have been shown to improve Phase I detoxification of estrogens favoring the less potent 2OH estrone pathway. Although the 2OH estrone can also make DNA-damaging quinones, they are less adhesive to the DNA and therefore are probably only important when levels are very high (as can be seen with certain single-nucleotide polymor- phisms [SNPs] of CYP1A1). These metabolites can be measured in the blood or urine to ensure that levels are low before starting I3C or DIM.

<!-- chunk -->

## Calcium-D-Glucarate

Calcium-d-glucarate is a beta-glucuronidase inhibitor. By preventing the action of bacterially produced beta-glucuronidase in the gut, this supplement interrupts enterohepatic circulation of estrogen, allowing it to be removed in the stool and lowering the levels of estrogen in the system. Sources of methyl groups, sulfate groups, and glucuronides are important to provide the Phase II substrates that make estrogens water soluble so that they can be excreted. Most patients can obtain these substrates from foods, as noted previously. Rarely, s-adenosyl methi- onine or NaSO4 will be needed as a supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylation Factors

Methyl groups (functional single-carbon atoms) are involved in numerous biochemical reactions in the human body. They are critical to the reading of DNA and should be considered pertinent to the acti- vation of pelvic peritoneal and immune cells in endometriosis. As noted previously, B vitamins help the liver inactivate estrogen via the Phase II methylation pathway,85 helping detoxify the DNA- damaging 4OH estrogen metabolite. Because it appears that changes in reading of the DNA in totipotent/stem cells may be critical to the development of endometriosis, attention to methylation in young women would seem to be important. Additionally, adequate meth- ylation is critical for fertility and the developing embryo and could decrease the infertility and pregnancy losses seen in women with endo- metriosis. Because several enzymes are required to convert folic acid (an inexpensive, man-made folate) to 5-methyl folate (MTHF), the key folate for donating methyl groups to the methionine/homocysteine cycle, B-vitamin supplements containing 5-methyl folate are preferred. Pyridoxine as P5P, thiamine, riboflavin, and B 12 as methyl or hydroxy cobalamine are also important in this process.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lipotropic Factors

Supplements that contain choline, betaine, and methionine, the “lipo- tropic factors,” promote the flow of fat and bile (containing estrogen metabolites) from the liver and facilitate excretion in the gut.86 Because of their prominent role in methylation, making useable single-carbon CH3 molecules available, lipotropic factors may also play a role in the epigenetics of this disease.87


A number of studies suggest that oxidative stress is a prominent feature of endometriosis.88 Antioxidants are known to work in sequence, sug- gesting that they should be taken together in to fully reduce oxidants. Studies with the use of vitamin C show increases in cellular immu- nity, decreases in autoimmune progression, and decreases in fatigue.89 It is a potent antioxidant and is a cofactor for many biosynthetic and gene regulatory enzymes. It accumulates in phagocytic cells and enhances phagocytosis such as may be needed to “clean up” the peri- toneal cavity after retrograde menstruation.90 In addition, vitamin C enhances immunity and decreases capillary fragility and tumor growth, all of which are evident at varying levels in women with endometriosis. Studies on autoimmune progression point to the effectiveness of high levels of vitamin C.90,91

<!-- chunk -->

## Beta-Carotene

Beta-carotene helps enhance immunity. Studies show that the use of beta-carotene increased T-cell levels after 7 days.92 In addition, beta-carotene was shown to be protective against early stages of tumor growth.91 Retinoids can moderate the effects of IL-6, which has been implicated in endometriosis.94 Impairment of phagocytosis is seen in vitamin A–deficient states.95 Although vitamin A was used in the latter

## 1293CHAPTER 166 Endometriosis

study, one third of beta-carotene is converted to retinol, the active form of vitamin A. Additional studies suggest that immune function is affected more by carotenoids than by vitamin A.96 A significant portion of the population has genetics limiting the conversion of beta-carotene to vitamin A and therefore requires preformed vitamin A as a supple- ment (see Chapter 57) to ensure proper immune system function.


Because parallels have been found between abnormal tumor growth in cancer and abnormal growth of lesions in endometriosis, vitamin E supplementation may be advantageous. Vitamin E helps correct abnormal progesterone:estradiol ratios in patients with mammary dysplasia (increased growth of cells).97 Vitamin E has been shown to be of benefit in women with dysmenorrhea, a common complaint in patients with endometriosis.98 When taken as a supplement, care should be taken to avoid synthetic d,l tocopherols, which could have a negative effect. Free radicals may contribute to the inflammation, damage to DNA, and excessive growth of endometrial tissue; vitamin E and N-acetyl cysteine, another antioxidant, can act to inhibit this proliferation.99,100


Selenium aids in the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes responsible for detoxification reactions within the liver. In addition, selenium stimu- lates white blood cells and thymic function.101,102 In a mouse model, decreased selenium levels are associated with suboptimal cell-mediated immunity, decreased T cells, and associ- ated inflammation.103 Individuals with low selenium are also vulner- able to yeast infections,104 a common clinical finding in patients with endometriosis.

<!-- chunk -->

## N-Acetylcysteine

The rate-limiting precursor for glutathione, the number one antioxi- dant and detoxification molecule in cells, is N-acetylcysteine (NAC). It has been shown to limit the damage of estrogen quinones and serves as an important addition to an antioxidant regimen. Additionally, many women have glutathione transferase (GSTM1) null status and are not able to use glutathione as well for detoxification. These women need higher levels to ensure utilization of alternative transferases.

<!-- chunk -->

## Resveratrol

Recently studies have shown that resveratrol, a property of red grapes in juice or wine, may have beneficial effects in endometriosis.105 Most studies to date have been in animal models, however.106 Resveratrol interacts with estrogen receptor (ER)-beta to slow growth and upregu- lates MnSOD, both of which may be helpful in endometriosis.107

<!-- chunk -->

## Pine Bark (Pycnogenol)

Pycnogenol is a special standardized extract from the bark of the French maritime pine. It is composed of polyphenols, several phenolic acids, catechins, taxifolin, and procyanidins. In laboratory research, Pycnogenol was found to selectively inhibit matrix metalloproteinases and inflammatory cells and inhibit cyclooxygenases 1 and 2. Its role in endometriosis was evaluated in a study of 58 women who were sur- gically diagnosed with endometriosis. After confirming regular men- struation and ovulation for 3 months, they were randomized to receive either Pycnogenol 30 mg twice daily for 48 weeks or a GNRH agonist, leuprorelin acetate depot, 3.75 mg intramuscularly (IM) every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. After 4 weeks on Pycnogenol, patients slowly but steadily improved, experiencing a 33% reduction in symptoms (from severe to moderate). The leuprorelin group had a greater response within the treatment period but relapsed after 24 weeks posttreatment. The Pycnogenol group had the added benefit of maintaining regular men- ses and normal estrogen levels during treatment, whereas the leupro- relin group had suppressed menstruation and drastically lowered estrogen levels during treatment. Five of the women taking Pycnogenol became pregnant.108


A number of studies have looked at the fat content in the diet and found that saturated and trans fats are detrimental in endometriosis, whereas long-chain unsaturated fats are beneficial. Long-chain unsaturated FAs provide the precursors for prostaglandins, a group of highly potent pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules. Two main groups of FAs are particu- larly important: the omega-6 group and the omega-3 group (named for the first carbon atom containing an unsaturated or double bond at the omega end of the molecule). Omega-6 fatty acids (from flaxseed, canola, pumpkin, soy, and walnuts) are precursors for gamma-linolenic acid (GLA; found in borage, black currant, and evening primrose oils), lead- ing to either the series 1 prostaglandins, which are anti-inflammatory, or to arachidonic acid (AA), which, via the COX-2 enzyme, becomes the highly inflammatory series 2 prostaglandins. Another source of AA is animal fats via the enzyme phospholipase A2. Numerous supple- ments, including Glycyrrhiza glabra and quercetin, affect phospholipase A2, blocking the release of AA from membranes. AA, via lipoxygenase, can also be a precursor for leukotrienes, which are known to increase pelvic pain during menses. The omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid (from flaxseed, canola, pumpkin, soy, and walnuts) provides the precursor for EPA and the series 3 prostaglandins, which are anti-inflammatory. EPA is both a COX-2 inhibitor and a lipoxygenase inhibitor, which might be especially effective in endometriosis. Many botanical supplements act as COX-2 inhibitors, including Zingiber officinale, Curcuma longa, quercetin , Boswellia serrata, and Withania somnifera. Lipoxygenase inhib- itors include quercetin, Allium cepa, Allium staivum, Curcuma longa, Silybum marianum, and Boswellia serrata. In a 2001 study looking at the role of EFA ratios on the viability of endometrial cells and their production of inflammatory cytokines, endometrial cells from women with and without endometriosis attend- ing an infertility clinic were studied in vitro. The culture media was supplemented with various ratios of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsat- urated fatty acids. The investigators found that the higher the ratio of inflammatory omega-6 to anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids, the longer was the survival time and secretion of IL-8 in cells from women with and without endometriosis.109 Prostaglandins can be prospasmodic or antispasmodic, depending on the prostaglandins that are being produced; can inhibit or promote tumor growth; and as noted earlier, can stimulate estrogen production via upregulation of aromatase.110 (See Chapter 57 for a more complete discussion of this complex topic.) Long-chain FAs, saturated fats, and trans fats make up a large per- centage of the lipid bilayer of cells. Polyunsaturated FAs, because of their “bent” configuration in space, allow more fluidity in the mem- brane. This facilitates the insertion of proteins such as receptors in the membrane, making it more functional. Whereas long-chain unsatu- rated FAs are “bent,” trans fats and saturated fats are “straight.” This allows them to stack tightly in the lipid bilayer, excluding proteins and receptors. Castor oil packs to the abdomen have been used successfully by many women. They are usually applied by soaking a flannel sheet in organic castor oil and applying it to the lower abdomen with a plastic covering topped with a heating pad for 15 to 30 minutes. It is pos- tulated that the castor oil may provide alterations of prostaglandin metabolism in the pelvis. In any event, the 15 to 30 minutes of “quiet time” and relaxation are beneficial to many women.

## 1294SECTION 6 Diseases


The herbs appropriate for acute pain relief in endometriosis are the same herbs commonly used for menstrual cramps, such as valerian, crampbark, and black cohosh, in addition to other traditional herbs that might be helpful, such as wild yam, chamomile, blue cohosh, gin- ger, passion flower, and false unicorn root.

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitex Agnus Castus

Vitex agnus castus, also known as chaste tree, has traditionally been used as a treatment for hormonal imbalances in women. Through its action on the pituitary gland, chaste tree increases progesterone pro- duction via an increase in luteinizing hormone. This herb is useful for fibroids, premenstrual syndrome, and perimenopausal times of increased estrogen. With its use, less estrogen is available to stimulate endometrial tissue.111

<!-- chunk -->

## Taraxacum Officinale

Taraxacum officinale, also known as dandelion root, is one of the most detoxifying herbs. It works principally on the liver and gallbladder to help remove waste products. By supporting the liver, excessive estro- gens and toxins can be deactivated. Researchers in Japan have found a link between dandelion and antitumor activity.112 Additionally, dan- delion leaf contains vitamins A, C, and K; calcium; and choline.

<!-- chunk -->

## Xanthoxylum Americanum

Xanthoxylum americanum, or prickly ash, is known for its specific effects on capillary engorgement and sluggish circulation. Prickly ash stimulates blood flow throughout the body and enhances the transport of oxygen and nutrients, in addition to removing cellular waste prod- ucts. For women with pelvic congestion, this herb enhances circulation throughout the pelvis.

<!-- chunk -->

## Leonorus Cardiaca

Leonorus, or motherwort, is antispasmodic and gently soothes the nerves. Because women with endometriosis generally experience uter- ine cramps and pain, motherwort is useful in promoting relaxation during times of extreme “bearing-down” pain in the uterus and other regions.62 As a mild sedative, motherwort helps women get needed rest during their menstrual periods.

<!-- chunk -->

## Turska’s Formula

Turska’s formula is a well-used old-time naturopathic treatment for decreasing aberrant cancer cell growth. A tincture of this formula is useful in endometriosis owing to the similarities in cell growth found in the pelvis. This formula contains Aconite napellus (monkshood), Gelsemium sempervirens (yellow jasmine), Bryonia alba (bryony), and Phytolacca americana (poke root). Monkshood and yellow jasmine contain various alkaloids that have been known to disrupt the assembly of microtubules, which eventually aid in the formation of undifferenti- ated mesenchymal cells. Quite possibly, these herbal alkaloids interfere with the induction of abnormal ectopic lesions within the pelvis (con- sistent with the theory of cells left behind in embryonic development). Bryonia is also known to provide antitumor effects. Poke root con- tains glycoproteins, which are known to stimulate lymphocyte trans- formation for immune enhancement. In addition, poke root also has anti-inflammatory properties. Owing to its toxic properties, however, this tincture can be provided only by a licensed health professional.

<!-- chunk -->

## Bioidentical Progesterone

Progesterone has the beneficial effect of downregulating estrogen receptors, thereby decreasing estrogen effects in the normal breast and endometrium. Progesterone, however, is difficult to measure in blood or urine because of its many pathways of use, metabolism, and excretion. Additionally, many, if not most, articles on progesterone are actually written about man-made progestins, which have a very differ- ent biological profile. Progesterone induces a secretory endometrium, preparing it for normal menstruation (or pregnancy). Progesterone in the form of artificial progestins has long been used to control the over- growth of eutopic endometrium when administering estrogens, so it is not surprising that progestins have been proposed as a treatment for endometriosis. The use of bioidentical progesterone in the treatment of endometriosis is not well accepted because endometriosis appears to be progesterone resistant. In eutopic endometrium, however, pro- gesterone may produce benefits for women with endometriosis. In the perimenopausal period, when estrogens are high and progesterone from the corpus luteum is low or absent, endometriosis is often seen to flourish. Balancing estrogen and progesterone would be expected to have the benefits of (1) lowering estrogen effect and decreasing menstrual flow ergo retrograde menstruation; (2) decreasing uterine cramping and pain ergo retrograde flow; and (3) improving psycho- logical distress and lowering catecholamines, thereby reducing pain. Bioidentical progesterone is usually not used alone as a treatment for endometriosis but as part of a comprehensive natural treatment plan. Bioidentical progesterone creams can be applied in various regimens. In women attempting pregnancy, application should begin after ovula- tion to avoid inhibiting ovulation or interfering with the establishment of the corpus luteum. Administration can be transdermal (15–30 mg/ day in divided doses), preferably on nonfatty areas of the skin, such as the forearm, to avoid deposition in fat. Micronized progesterone in cream or oil can be used vaginally. An oral micronized progesterone approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is avail- able if sedating effects are desired. (Note: It is delivered in peanut oil, so allergic patients will have to get an alternative from a formulating pharmacy.) An FDA-approved vaginal preparation is also available and recommended in luteal-phase defects in women attempting preg- nancy. If a luteal-phase deficiency is suspected, progesterone applica- tion should continue until the placental production of progesterone is well established (around 12 weeks) and then weaned slowly to prevent a sudden change in progesterone level, which could lead to uterine irritability. For the treatment of nonpregnant patients, antispasmodic, anticramping effectiveness may require higher doses, and the applica- tion may need to be extended into the menstrual phase of the cycle. Bioidentical progesterone is usually not used alone as a treatment for endometriosis but as part of a comprehensive natural treatment plan.

# A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO THE PATIENT

# WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS

Because very young women can have symptoms that cannot be differ- entiated from early endometriosis, such as heavy periods and cramp- ing, addressing these symptoms early may prevent or delay the onset and severity of disease as well as preserve fertility. Assessment of gastrointestinal function, the microbiome, and the diet is a critical first step that will have far-reaching effects outside of endometriosis. These are areas young women do not often wish to address, but heavy, painful periods may provide an impetus for early correction and the establishment of good habits, which can have long-lasting effects. Simplifying the recommendations may be helpful. The primary dietary recommendation is to increase the consumption of high-fiber vegetables, especially crucifers, Allium family, beta-caro- tene, and fruits high in antioxidants. Decrease sources of saturated and trans fats, and increase the consumption of foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, especially fatty fish (salmon, herring, sardines, mackerel). Sources of sugar, caffeine, and alcohol should be limited.

## 1295CHAPTER 166 Endometriosis

Pharmaceutical approaches with oral contraceptives and NSAIDs and progestin-eluting intrauterine devices (IUDs), GNRH ago- nists, and aromatase inhibitors have been the mainstay of con- ventional treatment. However, all are fraught with side effects. Oral contraceptives would be the best approach if pregnancy pre- vention is desired because they have the overall effect of lowering estrogen levels and decreasing menstrual flow with the most acceptable side- effect profile.


• An antioxidant combination containing vitamin C 500 mg, beta-caro- tene, vitamin E (as d-mixed tocopherols) 200 IU, and selenium 100 to 200 mcg. Adding these together improves the body’s ability to detoxify and remove free radicals while keeping the doses relatively low. • N-acetylcysteine 800 to 1000 mg/day • Pycnogenol: 60 to 150 mg a day and/or resveratrol • Fish oil: 1000 mg EPA + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) a day for inflam- mation and to improve bowel function and the health of gut flora • B complex: containing folate as 5-methyl folate, B6 as P5P, cobal- amin as methyl or hydroxocobalamin, thiamine, choline or beta- ine, and methionine, to improve the epigenetic health and estrogen metabolism. Dosing will be patient specific.


• Chaste tree, dandelion root, prickly ash, and motherwort tincture (equal parts): 1½ tsp to 1 tsp three times a day • Turska’s formula (Aconite 1½ drams, Bryonia 1½ drams, Gel- semium 1½ drams, Phytolacca 3 drams, and ½ dram water): five drops four times a day

## Surgery

Surgical treatment of endometriosis is both the first and last line of treatment in conventional medical practice. Laparoscopic surgery has advanced dramatically in the past 40 years. Endometriosis surgery, how- ever, can be quite difficult because of adhesions and distortion of the anatomy. The surgical approach usually includes confirmation of the presumed diagnosis with biopsy, identification of the extent and loca- tion of disease, debulking disease and lysing adhesions, removal of endo- metriomas, ablation of the uterosacral nerves by electrocautery, laser or endocoagulation, and presacral neurectomy or hysterectomy with bilat- eral salpingo-oophorectomy as a last resort. Damage to the bowel, blad- der, ureters, and blood vessels is not unusual and is commonly related to the depth of disease and the experience of the operator. The manage- ment of ovarian disease at surgery varies; some surgeons prefer to keep as much ovarian tissue as possible, and some will sacrifice severely dam- aged adnexa to allow for regular ovulation each month on the remain- ing, less damaged side. Surgery has been shown to increase pregnancy rates in the immediate postoperative period.113

## 1297CHAPTER 167 Epilepsy


Differentiating between partial or focal seizures and generalized sei- zures is of great clinical significance. Partial seizures begin focally with a specific sensory, motor, or psychic aberration that reflects the affected part of the cerebral hemisphere.5 These types of seizures may remain localized, whereas generalized seizures appear to spread from their onset and usually affect both consciousness and motor func- tion.2–5 Differentiation is important because partial seizures are usually indicative of focal brain disorders such as tumors or gliosis, whereas generalized seizures rarely have a definable etiology (although some studies now implicate metabolic disorders). An eyewitness account of a typical attack can be of great value in classifying the seizure. Past trauma, infections, and the use of drugs and alcohol should be fully explored, as should the family history. A com- plete neurological examination should be performed as a preliminary screen for neoplasms. Laboratory work should include the following4: • Serum glucose and calcium • Complete blood cell count • Liver and kidney function tests • Serological test for syphilis • Skull radiographs • An electroencephalogram (EEG) • A computed tomography (CT) scan • Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid is indicated if infection or meningeal neoplasm is suspected.1 MRI is considered the gold standard in evaluating epilepsy because the resolution is superior to that of the CT scan.6 Newer studies also employ EEG recording during functional MRI scanning to map normal and pathological brain function.10 Epilepsy should not be diagnosed on the basis of a solitary seizure. The recur- rence rate after a single seizure is approximately 27% over 3 years.11

# PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

The hallmark of the altered physiological state of epilepsy is a rhyth- mic, repetitive, synchronous discharge of many neurons in a localized area of the brain.3 This discharge pattern is easily recorded on the EEG during an attack. However, the cause of the abnormal discharges is still not known. Research shows that the synchronous depolarization of masses of neurons is the result of a combination of increased excit- atory mechanisms and decreased inhibitory mechanisms.12 Seizures can be induced in experimental models by blocking inhib- itory mechanisms. For example, agents that block the action of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are potent convulsants in humans. Conversely, the antiepileptic drugs phenobarbital and benzodiazepines enhance GABA, thus supporting the inhibitory mechanism. In some forms of chronic focal epilepsy, inhibitory terminals on neurons in areas around cortical gliotic lesions are in fact diminished.

## 1298SECTION 6 Diseases

Other research demonstrates the instability of the nerve cell mem- branes in patients with epilepsy. During seizure activity, intracellular Ca2+ stored in the cell organelles is released and moves toward the inner cell membranes, where it binds to specific Ca2+-receptive proteins, causing conformational changes in the protein’s structure. These changes cause the transmembranal Ca2+, K+, and Na+ channels to pathologically remain open, potentiating the excitatory state and hence the convulsive activity.1,2 Accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that there is a positive feedback cycle between epileptogenesis and brain inflamma- tion. Epileptic seizures increase key inflammatory mediators, which in turn cause secondary damage to the brain and increase the likelihood of recurrent seizures (Fig. 167.1). The earliest symptomatology, or aura, that is generated by a focal discharge provides the best clue to the localization and occasionally to the characterization of the responsible lesion. For example, a general- ized seizure after an aura of a peculiar abdominal sensation or ill-de- fined odor indicates a lesion in the temporal lobe. A Jacksonian seizure beginning in the fingers and spreading up the arm before becoming generalized and producing a coma indicates a focal lesion in the con- vexity of the opposite motor cortex.1

## Environmental Toxins

## Metals

Metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and aluminum can induce seizures by disrupting neural function.13 Metal toxicity should be ruled out as a possible cause in all seizures. A hair mineral analysis provides the most cost-effective screening method for the detection of heavy metals. Urine testing may be beneficial in examining the long- term, low-dose, chronic exposure to toxic compounds and qualita- tively reflect excretion of an unknown fraction of the total body pools of assimilated metals. Metal mobilization testing using a chelating agent such as calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or dimercaptosuccinic acid provides the best estimation of body burden for mercury and lead (see Chapter 35).

(a) Epileptic seizures induce the release of cytokines from glial cells, thereby (1) increasing the influx of neuronal calcium, (2) enhancing extraneuronal glutamate concentration, (3) decreasing K+ and glutamate uptake by glia, and (4) impairing the blood–brain barrier (BBB). BBB breakdown leads to albumin entry and leukocyte invasion into the brain, resulting in a fur- ther release of inflammatory cytokines. Such inflammatory responses cause an induction of neuronal hyper- excitability, reoccurrence of seizures, and finally, the development of refractory epilepsy. (b) Seizures induce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in neurons (early phase) and vascular endothelial cells (late phase) and mPGES-1 in endothelial cells. These inducible prostaglandin (PG) synthases cooperate to produce PGE2, most likely in endothelial cells. Endothelial PGE2 might cause neuronal hyperexcitability by enhancing glutamate release from astrocytes via the glial EP3 receptor, whereas neuronal PGs may protect neurons against seizures.

in the fetus and children. These adverse effects are a result of both direct and indirect action and result in cognitive, mood, and move- ment disorders and have been linked to the major chronic neurolog- ical diseases. Chlorinated pesticides, for example, impair the sodium channels in the neurons, preventing proper transmission of the nerve impulse. Solvents are fat soluble and therefore readily cross the blood– brain barrier. Once in the brain, they diminish the axonal transmission of electrical impulses along the neurons. Minimizing exposure and improving the body’s ability to eliminate neurotoxic agents become important aspects of the therapeutic approach. Chapter 35 discuss the effect of these neurotoxins.

## Dietary Considerations

<!-- chunk -->

## Hypoglycemia

Focal neurological deficits associated with hypoglycemia have been well described in adults with diabetes,14 and some researchers believe that hypoglycemia is the most important metabolic cause of seizures.13 Researchers have found the following13,15–18: • Serum glucose levels are unusually low before a seizure. • Of patients with epilepsy, 50% to 90% have constant or periodic low blood sugar. • Of patients with epilepsy, 70% or more have abnormal glucose tol- erance tests. Although the correlation of blood sugar abnormalities and epilepsy seems well documented, the mechanism of action is unknown. It has been suggested that low blood sugar could impair adenosine triphos- phate (ATP) production in nerve cells, reducing the efficacy of the sodium ATPase pump. A defective sodium pump allows for increased intracellular sodium concentrations, which depolarize the cell mem- brane and thus lowers the firing threshold. Observational studies have pointed to leptin as a factor that may help in regulating the occurrence of seizures. Animal studies have confirmed that injecting leptin reduces the occurrence and severity of seizures. It is well established that low blood sugar results in low circulating leptins levels, suggesting another possible mechanism of action.19 Single measurements of serum glucose levels are inadequate to determine glycemic status; only an extended glucose tolerance test will give a complete picture.

## Ketogenic Diet

Originally introduced by Wilder in 1921,20 the ketogenic diet (KD) has a long history of use for the reduction of seizure activity.21–23 The diet is composed of more than 90% fat by weight; low in car- bohydrates; and adequate in proteins, vitamins, and minerals. The low carbohydrate intake inhibits fat metabolism, resulting in the pro- duction of excessive levels of ketone bodies (acetone, acetoacetic acid, and beta-hydroxybutyric acid), the intermediary oxidation products. Presumably, the beneficial effects of such a diet are due to its induc- tion of metabolic acidosis, which corrects an underlying tendency of patients with epilepsy toward the spontaneous development of alkalo- sis.20–22 This acidification is thought to normalize nerve conductivity, irritability, and membrane permeability. Another possible benefit of the KD may be in augmenting ATP production by utilizing ketone bodies in place of glucose. It has been documented that many patients with epilepsy are hypoglycemic, thus compromising mitochondrial ATP production. The KD may provide an alternative route for balancing this deficit.24 The two main types of KDs are (1) the classic diet and (2) the medium-chain triglyceride diet. The classic KD produces ketosis by limiting the intake of carbohydrates and protein to less than 10% of energy combined. The medium-chain triglyceride ketogenic diet uses medium-chain triglyceride fat to produce ketosis. This allows for a larger intake of carbohydrates and protein.20 Research continues to document the efficacy of these types of dietary therapy. For example, one study of 27 children from 1 to years of age using the classic diet found that 40% experienced a reduc- tion of seizures of more than 50%, with 25% becoming seizure-free.25 However, 35% discontinued the diet owing to difficulty in following the rigorous guidelines. A review from 1996 concluded that the KD had efficacy in one third to one half of childhood epilepsy cases and was partially effective in another one third of cases.26 A review article from 1997 states that the success rate of the KD “greatly exceeds that of the medications” and that its side effects are fewer and the therapy cheaper.27 One prospective nonrandomized study measured the nutrient intakes, growth, and biochemical indexes of 30 children from 1 to years of age who had intractable epilepsy before and after a 4-month protocol using a KD. Fourteen children on the classic diet and 11 on the medium-chain triglyceride diet completed the study. The results indicated that linear growth was maintained in patients from baseline to 4 months on both therapies. However, body weight decreased for children on both diets, which could be a result of inadequate energy intake. Protein intake met recommendations for both diets. In the medium-chain triglyceride group, there was a 0.7 decrease in the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein ratios at 4 months. All biochemical indices, including albumin levels, remained within nor- mal limits.20 Longer-term evaluations may show eventual unwanted changes in these parameters. The authors concluded that the medi- um-chain triglyceride diet may be more nutritionally adequate and thus confer an advantage over the classic KD. The long-term risks of a high-fat diet are well known, and a KD may prove unhealthy for a growing child. One retrospective investiga- tion found that the linear growth of some children might be slowed.28 When treating children on a KD, clinicians should recommend ade- quate intake of energy and protein, a higher proportion of unsaturated to saturated dietary fats, and also consider vitamin and mineral supple- ments.20 Small, frequent meals may be appropriate and may decrease hypoglycemic episodes. In a study appearing in Seizure, researchers evaluated the long-term efficacy and tolerability of the KD in pediatric patients with drug-resis- tant epilepsy. The results pointed to good long-term effects of the KD on seizure frequency, EEG readings, and neurological development.29 The Atkins diet, which gained great popularity in past years as a weight-loss tool, theoretically may be useful to treat epilepsy.30 Like the KD, it, too, produces a ketotic state, but it creates this effect with less restriction on protein intake. In one pilot study, 6 patients ranging from 7 to 52 years of age were prescribed the Atkins diet for intractable focal and multifocal epilepsy. Five of the patients maintained moderate to large ketosis for periods of 6 weeks to 24 months, and 3 experienced seizure reduction. As a result, they were able to reduce their antiepi- leptic medications.31 Larger trials are necessary to explore whether the Atkins diet may be useful to treat patients with epilepsy.

## Leptin

Leptin is a protein hormone that plays a key role in regulating appe- tite and metabolism. Acting on the receptors of the hypothalamus, it inhibits hunger by counteracting the effects of neuropeptide Y and anandamide, two powerful feeding stimulants. Research demonstrates the ability of leptins to act on receptors that activate signaling proteins, which, in turn, trigger changes that reduce brain excitability and thus seizures frequency and intensity.19,32 The anticonvulsant action of leptin was tested in animal sei- zure models by either injecting leptin directly into the cortex or

## 1300SECTION 6 Diseases

administering it intranasally. Focal seizures in these animals were induced by neocortical injections of 4-aminopyridine, an inhibitor of voltage-gated K+ channels. Results showed that seizures were briefer and less frequent upon coinjection of 4-aminopyridine and leptin. In mice, intranasal administration of leptin produced elevated brain and serum leptin levels and delayed the onset of chemical convulsant pen- tylenetetrazole-induced generalized convulsive seizures.33 The theorized mechanism of action may involve leptin’s effect in activating two signaling proteins known as JAK2 (Janus kinase) and PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase). These proteins blocked nerve impulses triggered by the neurotransmitter glutamate, thus reducing the severity and frequency of seizures. PI3K is also involved in regulat- ing GLUT4, a cytoplasmic protein essential for sugar regulation. This may be another important mechanism of action of elevated leptins.33,34 Although these preliminary studies show that leptin can reduce seizures in acute settings, leptin’s usefulness in chronic cases is yet to be determined. One challenge would be the fact that leptin has a relatively short half-life (15–30 minutes), leading to dosing problems. However, creating a physiological environment that improves blood leptin levels through dietary and supplemental intervention could prove therapeutic. There appears to be a link to the KD because this diet increases the amount of circulating leptins, perhaps another plausible mechanism of action of KD. Future research may involve testing foods that have a propensity to increase circulating leptins and examining their effect on seizure frequency and intensity.34 Another link to the anticonvulsant action of leptin is hypoglyce- mia. It has been established that low blood sugar is associated with an increase in seizure formation, and hypoglycemic individuals also have low leptin levels. This may explain in part why hypoglycemia is associ- ated with the occurrence of seizures. Although the use of leptin as an anticonvulsant is in its early stages of research, the strategy of increasing blood levels of leptin to reduce seizure formation warrants consideration.

## Food Allergy

There has been little research into the correlation between food allergy and epilepsy, with only anecdotal case histories35,36; single-case, dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled studies37,38; and uncontrolled studies being reported. It is postulated that patients with epilepsy may have allergic reactions in the brain that are similar to the swelling, anoxia, and inflammatory chemical reactions seen at other sites of local allergic reactions.35 One uncontrolled study evaluated oligoantigenic diets in 63 chil- dren with epilepsy. Of 45 children with recurrent headaches, hyper- kinetic behavior, or abdominal symptoms, 25 ceased to have seizures during diet therapy, and 11 had fewer seizures. Headaches, abdom- inal pain, and hyperkinetic behavior resolved in all patients whose seizures ceased and in some of those whose seizures did not cease. Reintroduction of foods reproduced symptoms. Of 24 children with generalized epilepsy, 18 recovered or improved, as did 18 of 21 children with partial epilepsy. In double-blind provocation, 15 of 16 children experienced recurrence of symptoms, including seizures in 8, whereas none improved in the placebo group. Another group of 18 children who had epilepsy alone had no improvement with dietary change.39 This study suggests that food allergy should be suspected in patients with epilepsy who suffer from multiple other symptoms of food allergy (see Chapter 15). Another study evaluated two females, 5 and 23 years of age, who had focal occipital epilepsy with cerebral calcifications and were not responding well to antiepileptic therapy. Both had celiac disease as well as documented folic acid deficiency (a common side effect of most antiepileptic drugs). A gluten-free diet combined with supple- mentation with folic acid (dosage not reported) led to complete nor- malization of the EEG in the 5-year-old and cessation of seizures. The 23-year-old experienced significant improvement in her EEG and enhanced seizure control. Folic acid returned to the normal range within several months.40 A larger study looked more closely at the association between celiac disease and epilepsy. A total of 43 patients (15 male) between 4 and 31 years of age were evaluated for the association between celiac dis- ease, epilepsy, and cerebral calcifications. Intestinal biopsy on the patients with cerebral calcifications of unexplained origin and epilepsy found a flat intestinal mucosa in 24, suggesting celiac disease. CT scans showed cerebral calcifications in 5 of the 12 patients with celiac disease and epilepsy. Antibodies to gluten and folic acid serum concentrations were measured, and histocompatibility leukocyte antigen typing was done in most patients. Only two patients with cerebral calcifications and epilepsy had gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of biopsy. A gluten-free diet in epilepsy was found to be inversely related to the duration of epilepsy before the diet and to the patient’s age at the beginning of the diet. Celiac disease should be considered in all cases of epilepsy and cere- bral calcifications of unexplained origin, especially when the epilepsy is characterized by occipital seizures and the calcification is located bilat- erally in the posterior regions.41 One work involving 72 children with epilepsy and 202 controls revealed significantly higher rates of eczema in the mothers and rhinitis in the siblings of the patients with epilepsy, as well as a generally higher incidence of allergic pathologies in both of these groups compared with the controls. Additionally, a significantly higher incidence of allergy to cow’s milk as well as asthma was docu- mented in the children with epilepsy with respect to the control group. Prick tests gave a significantly higher rate of positive results for cow’s milk proteins in the patients with epilepsy versus controls.42

## Mitochondrial ATP

Direct research into the possible benefits, with regard to seizure formation, of optimizing mitochondrial ATP production is mini- mal. However, there is peripheral evidence supporting this idea. For example, it is well accepted that individuals with mitochondrial dis- eases compromising ATP production have an increase in seizure fre- quency. This may be related to ATP production and the importance of this respiratory chain substrate in controlling the stability of cell membranes.43 In one observational study, 37 family members with a genetic mito- chondrial disease (a mild defect in the NADH-ubiquinone oxidore- ductase step) showed a significant increase in seizures (22% of the group developed epilepsy).44 Studies of subjects with mitochondrial encephalopathies have consistently shown epileptic seizures as a main recognized symptom. Partial seizures, chiefly with elementary motor symptoms, and focal or multifocal EEG epileptiform activity characterized the epileptic pre- sentation in 71% of these patients.45 These results support the possibility that compromised ATP pro- duction may be playing a role in provoking seizures. Supplementation with ubiquinone has shown positive effects in improving symptomatology produced by mitochondrial encephalopa- thies. A study of patients with mitochondrial encephalopathies (which can lead to seizures) showed a significant improvement in fatigability and muscle endurance after the administration of supplemental ubi- quinone. Ubiquinone has been shown to have significant benefits in several neurological disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s chorea). Thus using this agent as part of the anticonvulsant protocol may have some merit.46–48

Even the positive effects of the KD may have some relationship to mitochondrial functionality. One study showed that animals placed on a KD had a 46% increase in the density of mitochondria in neuronal tissues. KD has been hypothesized to work on several levels, and it is plausible that increasing mitochondrial density, and thus ATP produc- tion, could be one possible mechanism.49,50

## Microbiome

The gut–brain axis is a two-way communication system between the central nervous system (CNS) and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It is becoming increasingly recognized that the presence of a healthy and diverse gut microbiome is important to cognitive and emotional well-being. Recent research is showing that a relationship may exist between GI disorders, particularly those with an immunological patho- genesis, and neurological diseases, pointing to a probable new patho- genic pathway involving the microbiome and the gut–brain axis.51,52 Some hypotheses propose blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption leading to inflammation through autoimmune mechanisms. This may involve etiologies from food allergens and bacteria disrupting the “gut barrier” and imparting systemic consequences through the transloca- tion of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and other molecular entities. Interestingly, in a recent publication in the Journal of Pediatric Neurosciences, the authors review the case of a 10-month-old infant admitted for drug-resistant epilepsy associated with GI discomfort, secondary to a milk allergy. They noted seizure frequency up 15 to episodes daily with no effective anticonvulsant drug therapy. The only effective intervention turned out to be a diet free of cow’s milk, initi- ated due to gastroenteritis and surprisingly stopping the seizures. This case demonstrated the exposure of the BBB to neurological episodes related to systemic inflammation, again highlighting the gut–brain axis.53 The human intestinal microbiome consists of trillions of bacte- ria affecting human health on various levels and, interestingly, hav- ing numerous dynamic interactions with our immune systems. It has been well established that gut microbes control pathogenic microbial growth, assist in digestive function, and support the functionality of the important intestinal epithelium (gut–blood barrier). The relation- ship is definitely cooperative and one that has far-reaching effects.54,55 Evidence continues to mount supporting the premise that the gut microbiome and immune system are closely connected and can influ- ence each other. An important observation is that immune modula- tion by the microbiome is not exclusive to the GI environment but, rather, affects other systems in a variety of ways.56,57 Therefore it is not surprising that gut-residing bacteria are involved in the pathogenicity of autoimmune disorders. For example, patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis presented abnormal intestinal microbiome, characterized by depletion of two bacterial genera—the phyla Firmicutes and the Bacteroidetes.58 In other words, the alteration of the microbiome may turn out to be an important treatment consid- eration for Crohn’s. This research has led scientists to continue evaluating the relation- ships between the gut microbiome and epileptic seizures. In that vein, a recent study looked at the relationship between the microbiome and patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. The question was whether or not an altered microbiome (dysbiosis) was involved in the mechanism of drug-resistant epilepsy. Patients were grouped into drug-resistant (n = 42) and drug-sensitive (n = 49) groups, and another 65 were used as healthy controls. Fecal samples were collected from all the study partic- ipants, and the microbiome composition was analyzed. The researchers found that the gut microbiome of the drug-resistant epilepsy group was significantly altered, with an abnormal increased level of rare bacteria. Conversely, the gut microbiome makeup of the drug-sensitive epilepsy group was similar to that of the healthy con- trols. Also, patients with four seizures per year or fewer showed an increase in Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus compared with those with more than four seizures per year.59 The researchers concluded that dysbiosis or an altered gut microbiome may be involved in the mecha- nism of drug-resistant epilepsy, and thus restoring the gut microbiome may be a novel therapeutic approach for drug-resistant epilepsy. In another study appearing in Beneficial Microbes, researchers examined the effectiveness of probiotics for controlling seizures in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. The study patients were given a probiotic mixture for 4 months. Assessment of the participants was carried out before and after the administration of probiotics; including number of seizures; patient’s quality of life; and levels of CD-14, inter- leukin 6, and γ -aminobutyric acid. Of the patients, 28.9% showed a reduction of greater than 50% in the number of epileptic seizures and a significant improvement in quality of life. The researchers concluded that probiotics may contribute to improving seizure control and qual- ity of life in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.60 An area that is gaining significant recognition in the treatment of the challenging Clostridium difficille infections of the GI tract is fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT). FMT is another exciting and promising field in gut microbiome research that involves the recon- struction of the gut microbial environment by the transplantation of healthy bacteria from a human donor. In a recently published report, FMT cured epilepsy in the case of a patient with Crohn’s disease. This was the first case to not only achieve remission of Crohn’s disease but also resolve neurological symptoms in a girl with a 17-year history of epilepsy. More impressive was the fact that after a 20-month follow-up, FMT therapy had proven its efficacy in preventing relapse of seizures, even after withdrawing the antiepi- leptic drugs. This again highlights the role of the microbiome–gut– brain axis and hints at a potential new treatment for epilepsy through reconstruction of the gut microbiome.

## Nutritional Considerations

## Pyridoxine

Two types of vitamin B 6 –related seizures are known in newborns and infants younger than 18 months of age: vitamin B 6 -deficient and vitamin B 6 -dependent. They cause similar neurologic symptoms and EEG abnormalities; if not treated, they carry a prognosis of significant developmental disabilities.62 Pyridoxine-dependent seizure is an autosomal, recessively inher- ited inborn error of metabolism. In affected patients, long-lasting sei- zures usually begin in infancy, but they may also appear up to 3 years of age and recur. They are resistant to conventional anticonvulsants. The condition ends fatally if diagnosis and administration of pyridox- ine in pharmacological doses are delayed too long.63 The diagnosis of pyridoxine dependency should be suspected in every infant with con- vulsions in the first 18 months of life. Certain clinical features may be especially suggestive, including the following: • Seizures of unknown origin in a previously normal infant without an abnormal gestational or perinatal history • A history of severe convulsive disorders • The occurrence of long-lasting focal or unilateral seizures, often with partial preservation of consciousness • Irritability, restlessness, crying, and vomiting preceding the actual seizure MRI with spectroscopy may be a useful tool in the neuroimag- ing evaluation of parenchymal changes, despite a normal-appearing brain MRI in patients with pyridoxine-dependent seizures.64 Because atypical presentations of pyridoxine-responsive seizures have been

## 1302SECTION 6 Diseases

reported, it has been recommended that an empiric trial of parenteral pyridoxine be tried in any neonate or infant with long-lasting convul- sions, especially when no clear-cut etiology is present.62,65 A 100- to 200-mg intravenous dose or 20-mg dose every 5 minutes to a total of 200 mg is recommended. If the seizures stop, it is likely that the child has pyridoxine-responsive seizures.62,65 The chance to identify a pyri- doxine-responsive seizure is lost if pyridoxine is given together with or after most anticonvulsant drugs.65 Although vitamin B 6 -deficient seizures are promptly corrected by the administration of dietary amounts of pyridoxine, vitamin B 6 - dependent seizures require continuous high-dose supplementation in the range of 25 to 50 mg/day.62,65-67 Although the mechanism by which pyridoxine decreases seizure activity is not fully understood, it is undoubtedly related to its role as a necessary cofactor in the metabolism of various neurotransmitters, the production of which depends on amino acid decarboxylation. Once absorbed, pyridoxine is phosphorylated to pyridoxal-5-phos- phate, a coenzyme in the reaction converting glutamic acid to GABA (Fig. 167.2). GABA, as mentioned earlier, is an important inhibitory neurotransmitter. One proposed mechanism for pyridoxine dependency is that pyr- idoxal phosphate does not bind with its usual affinity to glutamic acid decarboxylase, resulting in reduced GABA production. In these patients, higher-than-normal levels of pyridoxine are required to allow for the activity of this enzyme.62,65-67 One study of infants and children with uncontrollable infantile spasms or their sequelae found improvement in 2 to 14 days using oral pyridoxine phosphate (20–50 mg/kg). Of the 17 total subjects, had complete relief, 6 showed transient relief, and 8 showed a marked reduction in seizures and improvement in their EEGs.67 Some adverse reactions were seen, including elevated transaminases, nausea, and vomiting. Administration of vitamin B 6 to patients with epilepsy must be strictly monitored. Although some improvements have been noted, daily doses in the range of 80 to 400 mg have been shown to interfere with commonly used anticonvulsants.68

## Folic Acid

Serum and red blood cell folate levels are reduced in up to 90% of patients receiving phenytoin, carbamazepine, or barbiturates. These drugs interfere with the intestinal uptake of folic acid at the mucosal level. Lamotrigine and zonisamide appear to not be associated with low levels of folic acid. Most reports state that valproate does not reduce folate levels, although some of the literature is inconsistent. A convinc- ing argument now suggests that routine folic acid supplementation is important for adults receiving antiepileptic medication.69 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has directed that oral tablets of folic acid not exceed 1 mg because of concerns brought forward more than 30 years ago that larger amounts might counteract the antiseizure effects of antiepileptic drugs and increase the frequency of seizures in some children.70 Although that concern is no longer con- sidered valid by epilepsy specialists, the dose restriction has not been lifted. Supplementation with folic acid appears safe even up to doses as high as 15 mg/day69 and can protect both against birth defects for women of childbearing potential and also lower homocysteine levels, a risk factor for cardiac disease for adults using antiepileptic medications.

## Thiamine

In an interesting study, 16 of 50 consecutive neurological patients with a diagnosis of thiamine deficiency showed epileptic manifestations. It is possible that thiamine deficiency may promote epileptic episodes in those who have a subclinical predisposition to seizures. For example, the stimulation of nerve fibers in vitro causes them to lose significant amounts of thiamine pyrophosphate in the surrounding fluid, suggest- ing a significant role for thiamine in nerve-to-nerve conduction. In addition, thiamine deficiency may be accompanied by low concentra- tions of GABA, which, as noted earlier, is significant in seizure disor- ders. The authors suggested that, in patients with late-onset epilepsy, thiamine deficiency may be considered one of the possible causes.71

## Taurine

Taurine is one of the most abundant amino acids in the mammalian brain.72,73 It is involved in hyperpolarizing neurons by changing ion permeability and may mimic the effects of GABA and glycine. Since the early 1970s, considerable clinical and experimental evi- dence has accumulated supporting the anticonvulsive activity of tau- rine.72-85 The primary mode of action responsible for taurine’s activity in epilepsy is its membrane-stabilizing effects (i.e., it seems to normal- ize the flow of Na+, K+, and Ca2+ into and out of the cell).72-74 In addition to acting as a GABA-like neurotransmitter,72-75 tau- rine may also help decrease seizure activity by increasing GABA levels through the enhancement of glutamic acid decarboxylase. Patients with epilepsy have been shown to have significantly lower levels of taurine in platelets than control patients.76 Although several studies have shown lower taurine levels in the plasma, serum, and urine of patients with epilepsy, other research has yielded disparate results.77-80 The cellular concentration of taurine as determined by platelet level is thought to be of much greater significance. The first clinical trials of taurine were undertaken by Barbeau and Donaldson81 in 1973 and Bergamini and colleagues82 in 1974. The results were encouraging, and several additional reports have con- firmed taurine’s anticonvulsant effects.72,74,81-87 However, the rate of effectiveness of taurine is far below the level where it could be recom- mended as a standard treatment for epilepsy. At this time, there is no consensus on the seizure types for which taurine is most suitable, nor is there agreement on an appropriate dose. Even more, it is questionable whether taurine may even have the ability to effectively traverse the blood–brain barrier to gain an effect.88 At a daily oral dose of 0.05 to 0.3 g/kg in one study and 750 mg in another, taurine has demonstrated efficacy in some cases of intractable epilepsy, decreasing seizures by more than 30% in 11 of 34 subjects.86,87 This is highly significant because these patients were unresponsive to any other anticonvulsants. Patients with partial epilepsy demonstrated the best results, with those achieving the highest taurine concentra- tions showing the best response. The positive clinical response of some patients with epilepsy to sup- plemental taurine and the apparent cellular deficiency of taurine sug- gest that taurine supplementation be tried in most patients. Therapeutic monitoring of platelet or plasma taurine levels may prove useful.


Patients with epilepsy have been shown to have significantly lower serum magnesium levels, with seizure severity correlating with the level of hypomagnesemia.89-92 Although the mechanism of action is not fully understood, in uncontrolled trials, magnesium has been shown to be of benefit in the control of seizures.89,93 It has also been postulated that like those of folic acid, magnesium levels may be low- ered by antiepileptic medications.92 L-Glutamic acidGABA Glutamic acid decarboxylase (vitamin B 6 complex dependent)

## Manganese

The link between epilepsy and manganese was first suggested in 1963, when Hurley and associates94 observed that manganese-deficient rats were more susceptible to seizures than manganese-replete animals and that manganese-deficient animals exhibit an epileptic-like EEG. This prompted researchers to measure manganese concentrations in patients with epilepsy. Low manganese levels in whole blood and hair have been found in patients with epilepsy, and those with the lowest levels typically have the highest seizure activity.95-99 Manganese plays a significant role in cerebral function, as it is a critical cofactor for glucose utilization within the neuron, adenylate cyclase activity, and neurotransmitter control. Optimal central ner- vous system function requires proper manganese levels. Manganese supplementation may be helpful in controlling seizure activity in some patients.100


Children with epilepsy have been found to have significantly lower levels of serum zinc, especially those with West’s or Lennox syn- drome.91,101 More importantly, it appears that patients with epilepsy may have an elevated copper:zinc ratio.101 Seizures may be triggered when zinc levels fall, as in the absence of adequate taurine. Although the exact role of zinc or the copper:zinc ratio is not clearly understood, it appears to involve either the storage or binding of GABA.101 Zinc supplementation appears to be warranted, especially in light of the observation that anticonvulsants may cause zinc deficiency.102

## Choline, Betaine, Dimethylglycine, and Sarcosine

Choline, betaine (N,N,N,-trimethylglycine), dimethylglycine (DMG), and sarcosine have exhibited some anticonvulsant activity in human and animal studies. Choline is converted to betaine when it acts as a methyl donor, whereas betaine is converted to DMG when it donates a methyl group. This is most evident in the transformation of homocys- teine to methionine. Supplemental betaine has also been shown to be effective in preventing various induced seizures in rats and in alleviat- ing seizures in humans with homocystinuria.103-107 DMG has also been shown to block induced seizures in rats and mice.105,106 Roach and Carlin108 reported a striking decrease in seizure frequency in a patient with long-standing mental retardation when mg of DMG was administered twice daily. Despite treatment with phe- nobarbital and carbamazepine, the patient had an average of 16 to generalized seizures each week. Within 1 week of starting DMG, sei- zure frequency dropped to three per week. Two attempts to withdraw the DMG caused dramatic increases in seizure frequency. It has been suggested that glycine and betaine may act indirectly on glycine metabolism and glycine-mediated neuronal inhibition, enhance GABA activity, or may have a nonspecific effect on biological membranes.


The association of anticonvulsant drugs with disorders of mineral metabolism—including hypocalcemia, rickets, and osteomalacia—is well documented.109 Conflicting results have been published concern- ing the serum levels of vitamin D in patients with epilepsy. Studies have reported increased,110 normal,111 and decreased levels.112 Supplemental vitamin D intake is recommended when climatic conditions or the patient’s lifestyle do not allow adequate exposure to sunlight.113 Supplementing the diets of 23 patients with epilepsy with 4000 to 16,000 IUs of vitamin D resulted in a significant decrease in the number of seizures, indicating a possible therapeutic effect.114 Doses of this magnitude can, however, be toxic, requiring careful monitoring.

## Vitamin E, Selenium, and Antioxidants

Vitamin E and selenium function synergistically in many physiolog- ical functions. Vitamin E deficiency is known to produce seizures,115 and antiepileptic drugs have been shown to decrease the levels of vita- min E116,117 as well as those of other antioxidants, like beta-carotene. Studies have shown both vitamin E and selenium to be low in patients with epilepsy.115,118 Phosphate diesters of vitamins E and C have been shown to prevent the formation of epileptogenic foci and to attenuate seizure activity in animal models of epilepsy.119 Supplementation with vitamin E and selenium may result in improved control of seizures.115 A double-blind placebo-controlled study of 24 children with epi- lepsy unresponsive to antiepileptic drugs found that supplementation with 400 IU/day of vitamin E provided a significant reduction in the number of seizures in 10 of 12 children. The 2 unresponsive children were noncompliant. All the children continued their normal doses of antiepileptic drugs. No benefit was seen in the 12 placebo children, and, as expected, no negative side effects resulted from the vitamin E therapy.120 One report described four children with reduced glutathione per- oxidase activity, intractable seizures, multiple infections, and resis- tance to anticonvulsant treatment. All had seizures within the first 6 months of life. There was no evidence of known inborn errors of metabolism; however, all four patients had low intracellular levels of glutathione peroxidase. Two had normal whole-blood selenium levels, whereas the other two had low levels. Once anticonvulsant therapy was stopped and selenium administered, all four patients experienced clin- ical improvement.121 For epileptic discharges induced in animal models, other anti- oxidants, such as alpha-lipoic acid and those found in green tea, have been shown to scavenge radical oxygen species and may be prophylactic.119,122


Animal studies have demonstrated that long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids may alleviate or prevent cerebrovascular pathophysiology and can improve the competence of the blood–brain barrier.123 One human 5-patient study using 5 g/day of a 65% omega-3 fatty acid spread demon- strated a marked reduction in both the frequency and strength of epilep- tic seizures.124 However, three hospitalized patients with schizophrenia treated with gamma-linolenic acid and linoleic acid in the form of eve- ning primrose oil developed temporal lobe epilepsy following ingestion of the oil. This epilepsy ceased once carbamazepine treatment was initi- ated.125 It may be important to monitor the use of oils and fatty acids in closely treating epilepsy; also, more research is needed to determine which agents are most beneficial. At this point, omega-3 fatty acids seem to be the best choice, and evening primrose oil should be used with caution.

## Melatonin

It is well documented that melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a powerful antioxidant. Melatonin is often used to treat abnormalities in sleep–wake cycles, jet lag, cancer, and Parkinson’s disease. Children with epilepsy have a higher incidence of sleep problems, and epilepsy is exacerbated by sleep deprivation.126 Animal studies have demonstrated melatonin to have antiepileptic activity. Although not entirely clear, it is possible that melatonin exerts an antiexcitotoxic neuroprotective effect by lowering lipid peroxidation and raising coenzyme Q 10 levels within the central nervous system.127

## 1304SECTION 6 Diseases

One randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 31 children 3 to 12 years of age who had been taking sodium valproate (10 mg/kg per day) for 6 months and were seizure-free. Of these chil- dren, 16 received a fast-release 3-mg melatonin tablet and 15 received a placebo, all 1 hour before bedtime. Using standard Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy scales, it was revealed that attention, memory, lan- guage, anxiety, behavior, and other cognitive processes all improved in the group receiving melatonin. The general health score also improved marginally. Although not objectively assessed, perceptible increases in appetite and the quality of sleep were reported by most in the mela- tonin group.128 Given that high doses have been well tolerated in adults (up to 300 mg/day),129 it may be possible to slowly increase the 3-mg dose of melatonin for even better results.

## Chinese Herbal Medicines

Botanical medicines have played a significant role in the treatment of epilepsy in both the Eastern and Western healing arts. Western sci- entific methodologies have been used to evaluate the efficacy of the Chinese herbal medicine combination known as saiko-keishi-to (SK).130 SK demonstrated dramatic therapeutic effects on some dif- ficult cases of epilepsy that had long been unsuccessfully treated with standard allopathic anticonvulsive drugs. SK is a combination of nine botanical drugs: • Bupleuri radix (5 g) • Scutellaria radix (3 g) • Pinelliae tuber (5 g) • Paeoniae radix (6 g) • Cinnamon cortex (2 g) • Zizyphi fructus (4 g) • Ginseng radix (30 g) • Glycyrrhizae radix (1.5 g) • Zingiber rhizoma (2 g) In one experiment, seizure-like activity was induced in snail neu- rons by the drug pentylenetetrazol.131,132 SK was found to do the following: • Inhibit the intracellular shift of Ca2+ toward the cell membrane • Inhibit the binding of Ca2+ to Ca2+-receptive membrane proteins and the Ca2+-calmodulin complex • Inhibit the conformational changes of the Ca2+-receptive mem- brane proteins • Inhibit the pathological transmembrane current of Na+, K+, and Ca2+ The researchers presumed that SK’s experimental effects were sim- ilar to its mode of action in humans. When an attempt was made to isolate purified chemicals from the component herbs, the crude drug’s efficacy was lost. This suggests a synergistic effect between the compo- nent botanical agents. Clinical research has shown some benefit in patients with epilepsy. One study reported that 8 of 28 patients with epilepsy experienced a 25% decrease in the number of seizures after 8 weeks of treatment.132 More recent research has shown that SK also has a protective effect on neuron damage produced by various factors, including stress. This may point to possible antioxidant-specific compounds within the for- mula, affecting the central nervous system. Supporting this hypothesis is the fact that the same researchers found SK to have preventive effects on abnormal expression of one of the seizure-related genes.133 Research showing that the cyclic nucleotides involved in the pathophysiology of seizures has elucidated a possible mechanism for the action of several botanical medicines used in the treatment of seizure activity.134 Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) has been demonstrated to depress electrical activity in cat hippocampal slices, whereas cyclic guanosine monophosphate can produce seizure-like discharge in the same tis- sues.135 In addition, cAMP inhibits Ca2+ from binding to intracellular proteins like calmodulin, resulting in a decrease in the extrusion of neurotransmitters into the synapse.

## Coleus forskolii. The botanical Coleus forskolii, an important

plant medicine in the Ayurvedic treatment of epilepsy, activates adenylate cyclase, thus increasing the levels of cAMP.136,137 This action is thought to be due to forskolin, a diterpene, which has been found to increase adenylate cyclase activity by 530%.137 This is the greatest activity found in 100 plants studied for the ability to increase cAMP. The same study found that seven of the nine botanicals in SK—B. radix, C. cortex, G. radix, P. radix, G. radix, S. radix, and Z. rhizoma—were found to display significant cAMP enhancement, either by enhancing adenylate cyclase or inhibiting cAMP phosphodiesterase.137 B. radix, a key component of the SK formula, was found to increase cAMP by 170%.

## Ginkgo biloba. Ginkgo biloba is well known for its usefulness as a

memory aid, for cerebral insufficiency, and for its powerful antioxidant properties. However, some of the literature has cited the possibility that it may be responsible for precipitating seizures in two individuals with prior well-controlled seizures. In both patients (78 and 84 years of age), seizures commenced after taking gingko, and they were both seizure- free after the ginkgo was discontinued. The flavonoid components in gingko have been shown to exert GABAergic activity as partial agonists at benzodiazepine receptor sites, and this activity could play a role.138 As a prudent measure, patients with a seizure history should probably stay away from this botanical until more research has been conducted.

## Cannabinoids

There has been interest in the use of cannabis for the treatment of epileptic seizures for hundreds of years. In fact, the first studies on the medical use of cannabis actually date back thousands of years; Sumerian and Akkadian records indicate the use of a medicinal plant (probably cannabis) for nocturnal convulsions.139-141 Records in the Arabic and Islamic literature also identify cannabis as a treatment for seizures and epilepsy.142 The first detailed descriptions of the efficacy of cannabis as an anti- seizure medication were reported by W.B. O’Shaughnessy, a physi- cian at the Medical College of Calcutta. Dr. O’Shaughnessy tested the behavioral effects of various preparations of cannabis on healthy ani- mals and military assistants. It was during this period that he reported the impressive antiseizure effect on an infant girl with recurrent con- vulsive seizures.143 During the 20th century, the interest in the use of cannabis declined because of the illegality of the plant and thus the inability to carry out proper clinical trials. However, in recent years, interest in canna- bis-based products has shifted dramatically, and we are now beginning to see the evidence beyond just anecdotal reports. With more than 100 different cannabinoids and numerous ter- penes, the plant has a plethora of active components adding to its vast therapeutic potential and complexity. It has been established that the cannabinoids interact with numerous cellular pathways implicated in a range of diseases. In a nutshell, cannabinoids act as ligands, modulat- ing numerous receptors and, consequently, their downstream biolog- ical pathways. Interestingly, although cannabinoids may have similar structures, their actions vary significantly. In general, research surrounding epileptic seizures has focused on nonpsychotropic cannabinoids; these are cannabinoid extracts void of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) because this psychotropic cannabinoid is not suitable for seizure treatment. Instead, researchers have focused on cannabidiol (CBD), a nonpsychotropic cannabinoid with an impres- sive anticonvulsant profile and devoid of adverse psychoactive effects.

## Endocannabinoid System

To better understand cannabinoids and their effect on human phys- iology, it is important to have an overview of the endocannabinoid system (ECS). The ECS has been extensively studied in regards to its biochemistry and physiology. It is a complex system made up of recep- tors, ligands, and enzymes, with far-reaching effects. Regarded as one of the largest receptor systems in the human body, the ECS is able to send and deliver important information to numerous cell types and impart important downstream physiological actions. Research over the years has revealed that modulating the activity of the ECS through cannabinoids plant compounds found in cannabis, like CBD, holds therapeutic promise for a number conditions, ranging from anxiety disorders to Parkinson’s, Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, glaucoma, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, and probably one of the most exciting and best-studied areas, epileptic seizures.144,145

## Endocannabinoid Receptors, Ligands, and Enzymes

The ECS includes a group of endogenous cannabinoid receptors, ligands, and enzymes that are found in both the CNS and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and throughout most organ systems in the body. Cannabis contains compounds similar to these ligands known as cannabinoids, with an affiliation not only with these receptors but also affecting G-protein–coupled receptor 55 (GPR55), adenosine recep- tor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α ), transient receptor potential of vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1), and others. Some of the cannabinoids found in cannabis are well known, whereas others are just starting to gain attention. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabidivarin (CBDV), and cannabichromene (CBC) are just some of the interesting active components. New research is giving us valuable information about the possibilities of these cannabinoids being used as medicines. The two main endocannabinoid receptors are cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) receptors, found in the CNS as well as peripheral organs and tissues, and cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) receptors, pre- dominantly present in the immune system and associated structures. Both of these receptors are the main molecular targets of the endocan- nabinoid ligands, anandamide and 2-arachidonoglycerol (2-AG). Although endocannabinoid receptors and ligands are often what we associate with the ECS, there is actually more. Enzymes also play an important role in the process. For example, the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) breaks down anandamide, pulling it out of circulation. Anandamide is an important endocannabinoid that helps reduce the feelings of anxiety and stress. Elevated levels of FAAH will reduce the levels of anandamide, leading to amplified feelings of anx- iety. Interestingly, it may be a deficiency in endocannabinoid activity that is a contributing factor in seizure disorders and other conditions like multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, migraines, irri- table bowel syndrome (IBS), and others.146 This deficiency could be due to lifestyle, drug abuse, genetic predisposition, poor diet, omega-3 imbalance, and possible environmental toxins. In 2003 Ethan Russo, MD, coined the term clinical endocannabinoid deficiency syndrome (CEDS), reflecting the observations seen in clinical research.147 There are numerous chronic conditions where symptomatic suc- cess has been difficult to achieve and often involves using a plethora of prescription medications. The concept of toning the ECS opens up a whole new arena of treatment possibilities involving not only seizure disorders but other conditions as well.

## CBD for Seizures

For centuries, there have been numerous cases treated with canna- bis for epileptic seizures. Unfortunately, the lack of properly con- trolled clinical trials has clouded the outcomes and understanding of mechanisms of action. However, recent research has given rise to high-quality placebo-controlled trials of purified CBD extracts show- ing significantly better outcomes than placebo in treating specific types of seizure disorders. For example, in a large, prospective, single-center, open-label study recently published in Epilepsy Behavior, 72 children and 60 adults with treatment-resistant epilepsy (TRE) were given CBD at 5 mg/kg/day and titrated up to a maximum dosage of 50 mg/kg/day (most patients landed at treatment dosages between 20 and 30 mg/ kg/day) The objective of this study was to characterize the changes in adverse events, seizure severity, and frequency in response to a phar- maceutical formulation of highly purified cannabidiol (CBD). Data evaluation of the pediatric and adult subgroups revealed similar outcomes. Both groups showed significant improvements in both seizure frequency and severity by week 12 that sustained over the 48-week treatment period.148 What can be called a breakthrough study in CBD use for seizures was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in May 2017. This was the first randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of CBD in Dravet syndrome (a rare genetic epileptic encephalopathy). One hun- dred and twenty patients with Dravet syndrome participated in the study that involved 23 centers in the USA and Europe. These patients varied in ages from 2.3 to 18.4 years (mean age 9.8 years) and were randomized to receive either 20 mg/kg/day of CBD in two divided doses or placebo. The baseline was set to include patients who had at least four con- vulsive seizures during a preceding 4-week period. Duration of treat- ment was 14 weeks, including a 2-week titration phase. Compared with the start of the treatment, the median monthly frequency of convulsive seizures (defined as the sum of tonic-clonic, tonic, clonic, and atonic seizures) decreased from 12.4 to 5.9 in the CBD group and from 14.9 to 14.1 in the placebo group.149 This trial was considered a “game-changer” because, for the first time, we had robust evidence that CBD added on to preexisting antie- pileptic drug treatment reduced the frequency of convulsive seizures in children and young adults with Dravet syndrome. Another study appearing in the Lancet—titled “Cannabidiol in Patients with Seizures Associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome [LGS; LGS is characterized by two or more types of seizures, mental retardation, and a particular EEG pattern with a slow spike-and-waves pattern], a Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 3”—also showed positive outcomes. This study demonstrated that CBD, given as an adjunct treatment to patients with LGS taking anticonvulsant drugs, significantly decreased the frequency of monthly drop seizures com- pared with placebo. The multicenter study enlisted 171 patients with LGS (mean age years) whose seizures failed to respond to treatment with antiepilep- tic drugs. Patients were randomized to receive either 20 mg/kg of oral CBD (86 patients) or placebo (85 patients) for 14 weeks. A key study objective was to measure the baseline change in the number of atonic, tonic, and tonic-clonic seizures (drop seizures) recorded during the treatment period in those randomized to receive CBD compared with those receiving placebo. Before the treatment, patients had a baseline median frequency of 74 drop seizures per month. Compared with placebo-treated patients, those on CBD had a significantly higher median decrease in drop sei- zures—22% versus 44%, respectively. Importantly, improvements in drop seizure rates in patients on CBD were detected in the first month of treatment and maintained.

## 1306SECTION 6 Diseases

Additional (secondary) endpoints also supported CBD’s efficacy: 44% of the patients had a 50% or higher reduction in drop seizures compared with 24% of placebo controls, and the total seizure fre- quency was significantly reduced in 41% of CBD-treated patients ver- sus 14% in placebo. Also important to note is that CBD was generally well tolerated and safe.150

# SUMMARY

After centuries of anecdotal reports, there is now conclusive evidence that cannabinoids have a place in treating seizure disorders. Double- blind, randomized clinical trials have shown CBD to be effective in treating two difficult epileptic disorders: Dravet and LGS. In fact, the FDA has approved CBD (Epidolex) oral solution for the treatment of these two epileptic disorders for patients 2 years of age and older. This is the first FDA-approved drug that contains a purified natural drug substance derived from cannabis. These are very exciting times for cannabinoid research because this approval will open the doors to expand research into more epileptic seizure disorders. In many ways, we are just beginning to scratch the surface in uncovering the incredible treasure chest that lies within the family of cannabinoid molecules. The advantages of using CBD to treat certain forms of epileptic seizures are that they have fewer side effects than common antiepileptic drugs and are generally considered safe even at high doses. This has been proven by the clinical trials and supports the premise that many effective natural plant products have fewer side effects. It appears we have entered into a new era in seizure treatments where cannabinoids may become the treatment of choice.


From work on animal models, it has been suggested that the mech- anism of acupuncture in suppressing epileptic seizures involves the release of neurotransmitters such as endogenous opioid peptides, sero- tonin, and GABA.151 Other studies have shown possible seizure inhi- bition through decreasing neuronal nitric oxide synthase transcription in the hippocampus.152,153 In humans, effective use of acupuncture, scalp needling, electroacu- puncture, and embedding of acupuncture points to treat epilepsy and status epilepticus has been reported. However, one sham-controlled study of 34 patients found no benefit.154 This research group reported similar results with a study of 29 patients. In a second study, many of the patients reported changes in their sense of well-being.155 In both clinical trials, drug-resistant patients who had been considered intrac- table were given nearly identical treatments save one or two points, also without benefit. Given the individualized nature of traditional Chinese medicine, this may not be a reasonable representation of the acupunc- ture modality. Additionally, it may be possible that more benign cases of epilepsy may be more responsive, even if intractable cases are not. Auricular, or ear, acupuncture was developed by Nogier, a French neurologist, in the 1950s. Unlike traditional Chinese acupuncture, which uses the meridian system, ear acupuncture uses points on the ear that represent different areas on the body, similar to the way reflex- ology works with points on the foot. In one study, epileptiform behav- iors in rats were induced by intrahippocampal injection of penicillin. Radioimmunoassay techniques demonstrated that levels of somatosta- tin, aspartic acid, glutamine, and GABA were increased. One hour later, the lower-half auricular lobules of seizure rats, containing the ear-points Pizhixia and Shenmen, were electrically stimulated. After auricular treatment, the convulsion behaviors of the rats improved. Concomitantly, the content of the somatostatin, aspartic acid, and glutamine in the seizure rats’ hippocampi was significantly decreased, whereas the content of glycine, taurine, and GABA had increased. These results suggest that ear-point electrical stimulation has antie- pilepsy effects. Physiologically, given that amino acid concentrations may be involved in the pathogenesis of an epileptic seizure, auricular treatment might be involved in decreasing the content of the soma- tostatin, aspartic acid, and glutamine and increasing that of glycine, taurine, and GABA in the hippocampi of seizure rats.156,157 Ear acupuncture may then be more effective than traditional body acupuncture. More studies are necessary to determine the effectiveness of both auricular and body acupuncture in the treatment of epilepsy. The negative side effect profile of acupuncture is low, although one case report describes an episode of convulsive syncope, which occurred immediately after the insertion of acupuncture needles into the bilat- eral ST-36 acupuncture point.158 Given the extraordinarily common use of these points and the extremely rare appearance of side effects due to acupuncture, this case report should be considered an anomaly.

## Yoga and Meditation

Yoga teaches a variety of physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation techniques with the goal of improving both physical and mental health. There are a number of types of yoga emphasizing har- mony between the physical and energetic aspects of the body. It has been documented that yoga has a physiological effect that may offer benefit to the patient with epilepsy.159 Research has indicated that the meditative types of yoga (e.g., Sahajaea yoga) have the most benefits in reducing the intensity and occurrence of seizures. A Cochrane Review of yoga among patients with epilepsy showed significant improvement in one particular study involving 32 patients with epilepsy divided into an active group and two control groups. The results showed that the active group had a 50% reduction in the number of seizures at 1-year follow-up. Although these results are statistically significant, the authors concluded that fur- ther research with larger numbers was needed.159-161

## Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation

Intractable epilepsy, which affects more than 1 million Americans and is often resistant to drug treatment, may be ameliorated by a procedure known as trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS). The trigeminal nerve, which extends into the brain from the face and forehead, is known to play a role in the inhibition of seizures, and it has been shown that stimulating this nerve can reduce their occurrence.162 TNS involves using a stimulator the size of a cell phone that fits into a pocket; its wires are connected to the forehead with adhesives. Electrical impulses are transmitted to the nerve, resulting in reduced seizure frequency.162 In a completed clinical trial, patients experienced significant reduc- tions in seizure occurrence. The study demonstrated that those partici- pating in the study experienced a 66% reduction of seizures in the first 3 months, a 56% reduction after 6 months, and a 59% reduction after 12 months, and one of the subjects experienced a nearly 90% reduction in seizures after 1 year. The therapy shows promise as an alternative mode of neurostimulation, especially because it is not invasive (com- pared with vagus nerve stimulation, which requires surgery).163,164


There has been understandable caution in recommending exercise to patients with epilepsy, owing to fear of injury and the possibility of seizure induction. However, a review of the literature shows that there is no increase in the frequency of seizures with exercise. Some stud- ies have shown that exercise reduces seizure frequency, specifically in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. In one study, 15 women resistant to drug therapy engaged in 1-hour physical exercise sessions twice a week for 15 weeks. Seven patients had 27 seizures during the 30 exer- cise sessions; the self-reported seizure rate was significantly reduced

## 1307CHAPTER 167 Epilepsy

by the end of the 15-week period (2.9 seizures per week had dropped to 1.7 seizures per week). There were also other benefits to the exer- cise program, including reduced muscle spasms, improved sleep, and increased energy.165 In a review study, the authors discuss the positive effects of physical exercise programs in experimental models of epilepsy. Findings from animal studies show that exercise seems to modulate neuronal vulner- ability to epileptic insults. The review also concludes that metabolic, electrophysiologic, and immunohistochemical evaluations have con- firmed the positive influence of exercise on the patient with epilepsy.166 These findings seem to suggest that physical exercise should be con- sidered and integrated into the therapeutic approach for reducing the intensity and frequency of seizures. Patients with epilepsy should be advised to avoid situations that could provoke further seizures or could pose dangers in the event that a seizure should occur. Also, they should be made aware of state laws regarding epilepsy and driving. Patients with epilepsy should avoid known initiators of seizure activity (e.g., bright flashing lights, sudden loud sounds). Therapy should continue at full dose until the patient has been seizure-free for at least 2 years. Dosage reduction should then be gradual over a period of several months. Patients with epilepsy who are not controlled with natural therapies require drug therapy. Patients should eliminate pyridoxine antagonists (isoniazid, cycloserine, hydralazine, dopamine, penicillamine), oral contracep- tives, alcohol, and hydrazine dyes (Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act yel- low no. 5). Note: Status epilepticus, a prolonged seizure lasting longer than minutes that is not likely to stop spontaneously, is a medical emer- gency that inevitably results in serious neurological damage or death if untreated. Immediate hospitalization is required, preferably with ambulance or aid car transport, with the necessary equipment to main- tain the patient’s airway, assist in ventilation, and administer intrave- nous glucose and antiepileptic drugs. Because endogenous depression is more prevalent in persons with epilepsy than in the general population,167 monitoring for depressive illness is important in patients with epilepsy.


All sugar and other refined carbohydrates should be eliminated, and pro- tein levels should be moderated. Food allergens should be identified and eliminated. Small frequent meals are best. If a ketotic effect is desired, all carbohydrates should be strictly limited and fat intake increased. Furthermore, adequate intake of energy and protein, plus a higher propor- tion of omega-3 unsaturated to saturated dietary fats, should be assured. Finally, vitamin and mineral supplements should be used with ketotic diets (ketotic diets should be used only under professional supervision).


Regular sleep patterns should be encouraged, along with some form of physical exercise.

## 1309CHAPTER 168 Erythema Multiforme

Clinical studies have documented dramatic success with potassium iodide.9–11 The mechanism is apparently related to the suppression of the generation of oxygen intermediates such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals by stimulated neutrophils.12 Importantly, iodine therapy has occasionally been associated with various adverse skin reactions and gastrointestinal discomfort; it should never be used in pregnant women in the last trimester owing to its effect in suppressing the fetal thyroid.13,14


Zinc sulfate (0.025%–0.05%) has been used locally at the site of her- petic infection and to prevent the relapse of postherpetic EM.15

## Topical Vitamin A

Ocular involvement of EM can be treated with topical vitamin A ointment.16


A careful search should be made to determine the initiating factor. Underlying infections should be treated, all unnecessary medications stopped, and an anti-inflammatory program initiated. In herpes-as- sociated EM, antiviral treatment initiated after EM has erupted has shown no benefit. Symptomatic treatment—including local skin care, analgesics, and soothing mouthwashes—is important. Liquid anti- septics help prevent superinfection. In the severe form of EM, there may be extensive lesions and an inability to ingest foods. A liquid diet may be necessary. Intravenous fluid replacement with electrolytes and nutrients should be started as early as possible. The use of systemic cor- ticosteroids is controversial, with some believing that it may increase the risk of complications.


• Potassium iodide: 100 mg three times daily for 4 to 6 weeks, to be discontinued if there are adverse reactions • Zinc sulfate: 0.025% to 0.05% solution applied locally to posther- petic lesions • Topical vitamin A ointment for ocular lesions

## 1311CHAPTER 169 Fibrocystic Breast Disease

experience premenstrual discomfort and fullness of the breasts. When bilateral, cyclic, and repetitive and occurring in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, these symptoms are clearly hormonally related and suggest an effect of both estrogen and progesterone or, more specif- ically, the balance of the two. Symmetrical nodularity, particularly in the upper outer quadrant, is extremely common on physical exam- ination. These areas may be so tender that palpation is difficult. An asymmetrical (unilateral) mass that can be clearly described (size, shape, distance from the nipple and quadrant of the breast) is a “dom- inant mass” and must be diagnosed or followed until a firm diagno- sis is made by examination under a microscope, resolution (by either spontaneous resolution after one or more menstrual periods or by aspiration of a cyst without recurrence), or occasionally by a history of its presence without change for many years. It is the role of the prac- titioner to keep any dominant mass on his or her radar screen until convinced of its continuing benign nature. A fixed or changing mass or one accompanied by skin changes, tissue edema, or axillary nodes is clearly problematic and should be examined by mammography and diagnosed by biopsy. Fibrocystic changes in the breast are so common (estimates vary, sometimes as high as 64%12 in symptomatic women, although found in up to 54% of asymptomatic women in one autopsy study13) that they should not be labeled a “disease.” Because these changes are frequent even in older women at a subclinical level, they should be considered a “functional change.”12 It is likely that fibrocystic changes are a common response to the interactions of this unique organ with its environment. Because many women have symptoms that wax and wane and resolve with strategies that lower estrogen or improve at menopause, and because there is a significant placebo effect in studies, FCC has not received much study or interest. But ask any woman about the discomfort of a mammogram or the annoyance of having to wear a “supportive” bra to bed or the recommendation that she consider psy- chotherapy, and she will tell you she would like answers and treatment.

# ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE BREAST

Breasts exist for two reasons: to feed babies and to feel good to their owner (releasing oxytocin) during sex. (The fact that they are extraor- dinarily interesting to the opposite sex should have a secondary place in how we care for them.) Both functions require a sensitive nipple, which will cause the release of oxytocin from the pituitary when stimulated. The nipple has 8 to 10 lactiferous ducts connecting to lactiferous sinuses or ampullae underneath the pigmented areola. These dilated areas of the duct collect small amounts of milk to be expressed by the action of the nursing infant’s tongue and jaws. The ducts are connected to 15 to 20 lobes composed of lobules of milk-producing alveoli or acini, with each lobe functioning semiautonomously to reproduce the amount of milk removed at each nursing before the next feeding. Additionally, the breast creates a formula ideal for the gestational age of the infant at birth and later to provide the nutritional needs for the growing infant.14 (Contemplate how the same breast can completely feed a 2-lb prema- ture newborn and a 1-year old toddler 10 times that size without appre- ciably changing the size or number of lobules.). The “growing edge” of the ductal system is the ducts within the lobule, which connect to the milk-producing acini (terminal duct lobular unit [TDLU]). These are the most cellularly active parts of the breast. It is in this location that cancers most often begin. The immature ductal system is stimulated to grow into lobules under the influence of increasing levels of estrogen and progesterone at menarche and to mature into milk-producing or mature lobules during pregnancy. Breast duct cells that have never undergone this maturation divide 20 times more often than cells that have acquired the mature phenotype.15 Once the lobule has matured, it will remain rel- atively well differentiated under the influence of monthly progesterone until menopause when it regresses, leaving the more “at-risk” undifferen- tiated ductal system. The differentiated or mature lobule is less frequently the site of cancer, but when it occurs here, it can be more aggressive (lob- ular breast cancer). The breast is also composed of connective tissue or stroma sur- rounding the acini (shown in the accompanying figure in light pink) and more dense stroma surrounding the lobules (shown in dark pink). This tissue is laid down by fibroblasts, which are sensitive to inflamma- tion from various causes. Each duct and its acinus are surrounded by myoepithelial cells that contract under the influence of oxytocin, pushing the milk to the lactiferous sinuses and allowing the infant to empty virtually the entire breast while suckling and compressing only the areola. The myoepithelial cells also rest upon a basement membrane around the ducts, which ductal cancers and lobular cancers must either break through or be allowed through, and are considered “natural tumor suppressors.”16

## Extracellular Matrix and Fibrosis

The TDLU is embedded in a myxomatous stroma containing fibro- blasts, adipocytes, lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells, as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) containing collagen; glycosami- noglycans, such as hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratin sulfate, heparin sulfate, and other polar molecules17; and soluble factors (minerals, hormones, cytokines, growth factors and enzymes) at a specific pH and oxygen content. This partly liquid/partly solid matrix both supports the milk-producing lobules and ducts and allows them to expand and contract during milk production and stor- age. The development of the normal breast and the development of breast cancer depend on the “cross-talk” between these stromal and epithelial elements.18 The stromal elements surround, nourish, and communicate with the ductal and milk-producing cells.19 They are subject to epigenetic changes that have been shown to determine both the development of cancer and its ability to invade and metastasize.20 Fibrocytes in the ECM respond to chronic inflammatory signals.6 Fibrosis is defined by the overgrowth, hardening, and/or scarring of various tissues and is attributed to excess deposition of ECM compo- nents, including collagen.21 In other words, fibrosis is a response of the ECM to chronic inflammation. “Fibrosis is the end result of chronic inflammatory reactions induced by a variety of stimuli including

## 1312SECTION 6 Diseases

persistent infections, autoimmune reactions, allergic responses, chem- ical insults, radiation, and tissue injury.”22 This fibrous “scar” tissue, laid down in response to inflammatory signals, both compresses the ducts and obstructs them, producing cysts of various sizes, and through cross-talk and epigenetic changes, it produces alterations in the ductal and lobular epithelium. When these alterations are proliferative, the character of the cysts is different than when the epithelium is flattened, and the risk of breast cancer increases. (See later discussion of cysts.) Only fibrosis with involution of the lobules and nonproliferative changes in the epithelium qualifies as the type of fibrocystic change that does not increase the risk of breast cancer. It is likely that benign epithelium in a background of abnor- mal ECM, proliferative epithelium, and proliferative epithelium with atypia represents a continuum leading to cancer. The stromal tissue, especially fibroblasts and immune cells, responds to the environment, which arrives via the blood supply and exits via the lymphatics. It also responds to the contents of the ductal lumen, consisting of the milk being produced, excreted immune cells, and the breast microbiome. The ductal cells also respond to both the ECM and the luminal environment, which, when hostile, can induce metaplastic changes (apocrine metaplasia23–25), hyperplasia, atypia, and ultimately, cancer. “Most chronic fibrotic disorders have in com- mon a persistent irritant that sustains the production of growth fac- tors, proteolytic enzymes, angiogenic factors, and fibrogenic cytokines, which stimulate the deposition of connective tissue elements that pro- gressively remodel and destroy normal tissue architecture.”19 In fibro- cystic breasts, these chronic irritant signals are likely arriving at the ECM via both the blood and the luminal contents.

## Breast Cysts

The breast makes and reabsorbs small amounts of fluid in the ducts throughout life. If the duct is obstructed or scarred by infection or injury, or if fibrosis or fibrotic extracellular matrix is laid down, cysts can form behind the scarred or compressed portion of the duct.26 Cysts can also form due to excessive secretions created by hyper-cellularity of the ducts and by poor drainage.27 The former, called type 228 (com- pressed ducts), occurs in ∼ 45% of cases and usually do not recur after needle aspiration. They have fluid that is a transudate of serum with a low K+/Na+ ratio. The latter, called type 1 (excessive secretions), occurs in ∼ 55% of cases. They are more likely multiple, associated with apo- crine metaplasia, often recur after aspiration, and have a high K+/Na+ ratio.20,29,30 This is the classic picture of fibrocystic changes. Because both types of cysts can coexist in the same patient and one has an increased risk of breast cancer but the other does not, studies of fibro- cystic breasts have shown conflicting results with regard to the risk of breast cancer. The current consensus is that breast cancer risk is related to the degree of cellular proliferation and atypia of the ductal cells.

## Breast Microbiome

Breast tissue has its own microbiome.31 Studies have recently been done looking at whether a bacterial population exists in the normal uninfected breast and whether that tissue microbiome changes or is different in women with infection or cancer.30,32,33 Not surprisingly, both are true. Researchers found higher numbers of bacteria that are able to cause DNA damage and fewer Lactobacillus in the patients with breast cancer.31 Helicobacter pylori, a known initiator of carcinogen production, has been found in the 4/66 breast milk samples.34 There is evidence that some bacteria “prepare suitable microenvironments for tumor cell growth.”35 The breast is one of the tissues “open” to the environment in the female (as are the nasopharynx, cervix/uterus, and bladder), so it should not be surprising to find bacteria and viruses (and occasion- ally parasites) in the ducts. Its microbiome, however, is different from the gut, mouth, or overlying skin. Mastitis is now thought to be due to dysbiosis or imbalance of the breast microbiome rather than the simple invasion of bacteria.36 Acute mastitis is caused by pathological organisms (usually staph or strep). It occurs most often at the initia- tion of breastfeeding when previously unused ducts must dilate and acini and lobules must contract and clear the colostrum and milk being produced. (This early risk may be in part the reason that colos- trum is composed primarily of immune cells and immunoglobulins.) Acute mastitis often goes untreated and clears spontaneously. When severe, it is usually treated with oral antibiotics. Recently, it has been shown that acute mastitis can be treated with an oral probiotic contain- ing Lactobacillus salivarius CECT 5713 or Lactobacillus gasseri CECT 5714. With no other treatment than continuing to nurse, the probiotic group had complete resolution by 14 days.37 A second study compared the Lactobacillus fermentum CECT 5716 and L. salivarius CECT with antibiotics. The probiotic groups showed both significant low- ering of pathogenic bacteria in the milk and better improvement in pain compared with antibiotics.38 Another study prevented mastitis by pretreatment with L. salivarius in late pregnancy.39 How do oral probi- otics reach the breast? It may be the same way the breast microbiome is established: via immune cells from the gut that carry live bacteria through the bloodstream to the ECM and deliver them to the lumen of the acini and ducts.35 Completing the loop of connection between the breast microbiome and fibrocystic changes, treatment of H. pylori in the gut has been found to be successful in the resolution of FCC symptoms in the breast.32 A much less common entity, “plasma cell mastitis”40 is thought to be caused by chronic irritation of the ducts from secretory prod- ucts that can produce an autoimmune reaction with infiltration of plasma cells.41 Because it is most often seen in multiparous women, it may be an immune reaction to antigens seen in previous episodes of lactation. Free fatty acids are known to produce a marked inflam- matory response in breast trauma, mimicking cancer as a hard, spic- ulated mass with microcalcifications on mammogram. Fat-laden macrophages differentiate its microscopical appearance from that of cancer (also thought to be an aberration of the healing process by some42). These “open” channels to the outside world (oropharynx, cervix/ uterus, rectum/anus, and bladder/prostate) are protected by locally increased lymphatics; by metaplasia of the interfacing epithelium; by iodine43; and in the breast, by lactoperoxidase, lysozyme, and a num- ber of proteins secreted in the milk.44 Dysbiosis of the breast, like that of the gut,45 is a likely source of inflammatory signals32 that can induce changes in the fibroblasts of the ECM,18,46 causing both fibrocystic changes and potentially cancers. Because fibrosis (a tissue response to inflammation) is found almost universally in the breast (if autopsy studies are to be believed), it would appear that fibrocystic changes are a normal or at least common response to the degree of inflammation in the environment. A number of additional protective mechanisms exist to prevent infection from the outside from entering the body via the duc- tal system. The ends of the ducts at the nipple are often sealed by desquamated epithelial cells producing a plug. When removed by the suckling infant or during sex, oral bacteria are more likely to enter, and the microbiome changes. Properties of the milk (lacto- ferrin, white blood cells [WBCs], various iodinated proteins, and immunoglobulins) act as antibacterial agents in the duct and in the milk being produced. If these fail, infection in the duct can produce oxidative stress, tissue damage, ductal scarring, and ultimately, cysts and fibrosis.

## Hormonal Milieu

The relationship of fibrocystic changes to cyclic mastalgia, increased lumpiness before menses, PMS, increased symptoms in perimeno- pause, and the resolution of most symptoms after menopause strongly suggest that fibrocystic changes are related to elevated estrogen and, in some cases, the decreased or unbalanced progesterone found at these times.47,48 FCC has also been related to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a syndrome related to increased estrogen and insulin resis- tance.49,50 The relationship between FCC and estrogen is so strong that many early studies implied that this hormone milieu was caus- ative of FCC. It is more likely that it is important but ancillary. Both the immune system and the ductal system are under the influence of estrogen, progesterone, and estrogen and chemicals from the environ- ment. Some of these environmental toxins are preferentially secreted in the milk.51 Prolactin has been shown to be normal or mildly elevated in serum but also chronobiological (i.e., related to time of day, day of cycle, and also sleep related).52 Differences in response to prolac- tin between normal patients and patients with FCC have been docu- mented.53 When breast symptoms are cyclic and present throughout the breast, more often than not, they are caused by or exacerbated by too much estrogen effect. Possible causes are listed in Table 169.1. High levels of estrogen and progesterone in pregnancy or during the first few weeks of oral contraceptive use produce growth and dif- ferentiation of the milk-producing alveoli, which can also be uncom- fortable for some women. These symptoms usually subside as the pregnancy progresses or the endogenous estrogen levels fall with oral contraceptive pill (OCP) suppression. Because hormones are closely linked to FCC and breast symptoms, they offer considerable opportu- nity for prevention and treatment. Although the traditional approach to hormonal treatment for FCC has been estrogen or prolactin-lower- ing drugs, which have substantial side effects, each of the noted causes of excess estrogen effect can be addressed with diet, supplements, and herbal therapies.

## Environmental Toxins

A growing number of new-to-nature-chemicals in the environment that negatively affect humans are xenoestrogens. The breasts are partic- ularly susceptible. Xenoestrogens can exert both genomic and nonge- nomic (cell-surface–receptor) effects.54 Bisphenol A,55 Glyphosate, plastics,56 pesticides, (herbicides, insecticides, rodenticides),57 chem- icals used in hydraulic fracturing,58 a panoply of chemicals in personal care products,59 and more importantly, combinations of chemicals in doses considered unimportant when taken individually60 are shown to create cellular changes in susceptible tissues such as the breast. These chemicals are now showing up in groundwater. We are all exposed. In addition to man-made chemicals, environmental contamina- tion with metalloestrogens, which are small ionic metals that activate the estrogen receptor (ER), are becoming a problem. Breast cysts can be induced by aluminum, a common component of underarm deodorant.61 Aluminum can cause genomic instability and prolifera- tion in breast epithelial cells. At lower levels, methyl mercury promotes the proliferation of breast cancer cells.62 Other metalloestrogens, such as cadmium, are used in many everyday products, such as cosmetics, household items, and processed foods.63 Prenatal exposure to arsenic has been shown to increase the number of mammosphere-forming cells and increase branching, epithelial cells, and density of the breast at puberty.64,65 Approaches that help a woman limit her exposure to chemicals in cosmetics, food additives, and household cleaning fluids, such as water filtration and the like, would be expected to have a positive effect if started early enough.

# DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Benign breast lesions include benign neoplastic and nonneoplastic groups. The critical factor in the differential diagnosis is the identifica- tion of premalignant and malignant lesions.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mass

The management of a breast mass is critical to the early and accurate diagnosis of benign versus malignant breast disease. Proper diagnosis and management of a breast mass should include the following: 1. A careful examination looking for dominant masses. Examination of a suspicious mass should preferably be done in the first week after a period when hormone levels are low. 2. A dominant mass is cancer until proven otherwise by its disappear- ance, its removal and microscopical diagnosis, by aspiration and resolution, or occasionally by long-term follow-up without change. The practitioner’s job is not done until he or she is satisfied that there is no cancer. This does not mean every lump has to be surgi- cally removed. 3. Breast symptoms while on hormone therapy of any sort should not be ignored. Practitioners commonly get the blame if there is a can- cer or one develops. 4. Unilateral or asymmetrical masses or symptoms unrelated to men- ses require careful evaluation even though they are most often benign. 5. Never tell the patient “everything is fine” when she presents with a complaint even if you feel no mass. Tell her that you don’t see any- thing to worry about, but if things change or she continues to have concern, she should be sure to return until you are both satisfied there is nothing to worry about. Encourage a return visit. Women know things about their bodies they can’t always verbalize. Lumps in the breast due to FCC are often difficult to describe because they meld with the dense areas of fibrosis. The fibrocystic breast is, by definition, lumpy. Because the fibrous component makes them tender and dense and the cystic component makes them lumpy, and these symptoms often get worse after ovulation, it is best to exam- ine the breasts on day 4 to 9 of the menstrual cycle. If the examination is not reassuring and the examination is in the luteal phase, a return visit or an ultrasound is reasonable. Other benign masses include fibroadenoma; phyllodes tumor, which can be benign, borderline, or malignant; hamartoma; fibromatosis; and cysts of various sizes. Cysts that are proliferative have a 1.5 to 2.0 times higher risk of becoming cancers, and cysts with atypia have a relative risk of developing cancer as high as 3.9 to 13.66

## 1314SECTION 6 Diseases

radiation, and trauma can all produce inflammation, which may incite fibroblast activity. Inflammation in the breast can present as pain, red- ness, or a mass, which should be addressed and treated.

<!-- chunk -->

## Pain

Mastalgia refers to any breast pain severe enough to cause concern. Breast pain is categorized as cyclic (related to hormones) or noncyclic (related to drugs, pathology, or extramammary causes). Cyclic breast pain, because it is related to higher estrogen/progesterone effect, has been shown to be a risk factor for later breast cancer.67 A careful his- tory and physical can help rule out extramammary or nonhormonal causes of pain, such as costochondritis, cervical radiculopathy, myo- cardial ischemia, pneumonia, esophageal spasm, pleuritis, rib fracture, or shingles.68

# HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Five major findings in benign breast disease that should be carefully evaluated are as follows: 1. Mass (size, shape, consistency, dominant, how long there, tender- ness, history of trauma); cystic or solid 2. Pain (localized or general, constant or cyclic, drug or supplement related), which suggests inflammation 3. Discharge from nipple (spontaneous or expressed, history of breastfeeding, color, smell, volume) 4. Enlargement/swelling of the breast (related to menses, localized or unilateral, painful), suggesting tumor, edema, or lymphedema 5. Skin changes (dimpling, nipple retraction, peau d’orange, redness), suggesting underlying disease These features should be carefully documented in the chart. A common trap is the belief that the practitioner can differenti- ate benign from malignant disease on physical examination. Although the history and physical examination, mammogram, and ultrasound can increase or decrease the level of suspicion of malignancy, only his- tology on a specimen obtained by fine-needle biopsy, core biopsy, or open excision of suspicious lesions can determine whether a lesion is malignant, and even these methods are not perfect.69 Mammography is an appropriate way to obtain further informa- tion in women with a question of fibrocystic changes or a dominant mass. As stated before, dense fibrous areas make mammographic diag- nosis difficult. In this situation, ultrasound of a mass can be helpful in differentiating a fibrocystic area from a cystic or solid lesion. Findings on routine mammogram, the risk of mammography, and whether and when to perform screening mammograms are important topics for discussion elsewhere. Thermography can be useful in women with dense fibrocystic breasts. It is important to remember that increased temperature is a sign of inflammation and therefore an upstream indicator of potential risk. Thermograms have not been shown to be as accurate as mam- mography for identifying early cancers (which may be a benefit from the standpoint of overdiagnosis in the perimenopause) and therefore provide a different type of information (about inflammation) that may be helpful in decision making.


From the foregoing discussion, it should be clear that there are at least three areas that should be addressed in the treatment of fibrocystic symptoms: estrogen effect, inflammation, and the microbiome. Because excessive estrogen or altered sensitivity to estrogen is the dominant theory of etiology,70,71 interventions that modulate endogenous estrogens or limit exposure to exogenous estrogen or estrogen-like substances warrant consideration as potential treatments for symptomatic fibrocystic breast conditions and will be discussed first. Premenstrual syndrome, which shares a common hormonal pic- ture, is discussed elsewhere (see Chapter 212). In fact, breast pain is often a part of the PMS complex of symptoms. The factors discussed here are not covered in depth in Chapter 212 and are particularly rele- vant to fibrocystic breast disease. Approaches that address excessive production or poor metabolism of estrogen include the following: 1. Inhibition of aromatase with diet and treatment of inflammation with curcumin, omega-3 fatty acids, and an anti-inflammatory diet (gluten-free and low in arachidonate) 2. Improved metabolism of estrogen by CYP-450 enzymes aimed at discouraging the 16OH and 4OH pathways, improving Phase II detoxification and preventing DNA adduct formation with ade- quate intracellular glutathione. Discouraging alcohol; preventing insulin resistance; addressing obesity; and encouraging crucifers, allium-containing vegetables, and B vitamins are all effective strat- egies. 3. Protection of glucuronidated estrogens from beta-glucuronidase in the gut (calcium-d-glucarate) preventing reabsorption of partially metabolized estrogens 4. Attention to regular excretion using fiber, especially freshly ground organic flax seed and omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, and so forth 5. Blocking estrogen receptors with weaker estrogens, such as estriol21 or phytoestrogens Once elevated estrogens have been addressed, balancing estrogen with adequate progesterone can be helpful. Progesterone appears to improve iodine absorption,42 in addition to its antiestrogen and pro-differentiation effects. Addition of progesterone before addressing estrogen, however, can put the breast in a pseudopregnancy or contin- uous luteal phase in which pain and cysts get worse.

## Inflammation

Because the ECM responds to inflammatory signals from the blood- stream as well as from the bacteria that make up the breast micro- biome, and because inflammation is known to increase estrogen production by increasing the activity of aromatase, a number of nutri- tional, supplemental, and herbal preparations would be expected to be useful in the treatment of FCC. Needless to say, the earlier they are instituted, the more likely they are to be successful; once significant fibrosis occurs, treatment is more difficult.

<!-- chunk -->

## Treating the Breast Microbiome

Because the breast microbiome is a relatively new concept, therapies have not been established that might affect it. From the studies of treatment of mastitis with probiotics, however, it is apparent that oral probiotics have an effect on the breast microbiome and should be con- sidered. Bacterial species that have been cultured from normal breasts may be beneficial and include L. salivarius CECT 5713, L. gasseri CECT 5714, L. fermentum CECT 5716, and possibly other friendly bacteria cultured from human milk.

## Dietary Considerations

Although the literature is confusing with regard to whether dietary changes have a significant role in prevention and treatment,22 this is likely due to the complexity of causes of FCC; the diversity of genet- ics involved in estrogen effect and inflammation in a given woman; and the likelihood that there is a long latent period between fibrosis, cyst formation, proliferative changes, and cancers.72 There are, how- ever, general principles in lowering the estrogen effect and reducing

inflammation that should be effective in most women (see previous suggestions). Additionally, the Mediterranean-type diet has been shown to positively affect the breast microbiome.73 Obesity74 and type 2 diabetes are both associated with breast pathology and later breast cancer, so dietary changes in these patients should be included in therapy for FCC.

## Methylxanthines

Epidemiologically,21,75,76 experimentally,77–80 and clinically,81 there is strong evidence supporting an association between methylxan- thine consumption and fibrocystic symptoms, although little research appears to have been done since 1996.82 The methylxanthines— caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine—are all known to be com- petitive inhibitors of cyclic mononucleotide phosphodiesterase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis (removal) of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), thereby elevating its level in breast tissue. In turn, increased levels of cAMP (a so-called second messenger) stimulate protein-ki- nase activities and causes the overproduction of epithelial elements and fibrous tissue.21 Minton et al. found that levels of cAMP in fibro- cystic breasts were higher than normal and even higher in women with breast cancer.83 In one study, limiting methylxanthines (coffee, tea, cola, choc- olate, and caffeinated medications) in the diet resulted in improve- ment in 97.5% of the 45 women who completely abstained and in 75% of the 28 who limited their consumption. Those who con- tinued with little change in their methylxanthine consumption showed little improvement.84 According to this study, women may have varying thresholds of response to methylxanthines. Other studies have shown no association between methylxanthines and fibrocystic breast disease.85–87 This disparity may have to do with the difference between causation, which is unlikely, and symptom exacerbation, which is likely, as well as genetic susceptibility in a given woman.

## Fiber

Fiber is both anti-inflammatory by virtue of its support of a healthy gut microbiome and antiestrogen by virtue of its effect on estrogen excre- tion. A comparison between the diets of 354 women with “benign pro- liferative epithelial disorders of the breast” and those of 354 matched controls and 189 unmatched controls found an inverse association between dietary fiber and the risk of benign proliferative epithelial disorders of the breast.88 An increased intake of dietary fiber may be associated with a reduced risk of both benign breast disease and breast cancer.89

## Soy

It is likely that soy, when metabolized to equol, presents a weak estro- gen to the receptor in high numbers, which displace the stronger estra- diol and estrone, effectively decreasing the estrogen effect.90 An uncontrolled study of 64 premenopausal women with FCC who consumed soy protein for 1 year used breast-enhanced scintigra- phy testing (BEST) to evaluate change in inflammation, using angio- genesis and mitochondrial activity, which vary with tissue metabolic activity. The women and their physicians reported subjective and objective reduction in both breast tenderness and FCC. Evaluation by BEST also showed that a nonstatistical reduction occurred in both the average and maximal breast tissue activity. There was a statisti- cally significant reduction (P < 0.01) in the variability of tissue activ- ity, however.91 A study of the concentrations of the plasma isoflavones genistein and daidzein and the risk of benign breast disease in China showed an inverse relationship for both benign and malignant breast diseases.92

## Fats and Essential Fatty Acids

Increased calories, fat intake, and saturated fat are associated with benign breast disease.93,94 Because these are older studies, it is not known whether the increased risk is associated with fat intake per se or the intake of foods containing more xenoestrogens. Because of their anti-inflammatory properties as well as their effects on bowel regu- larity, omega-3 fatty acids in the diet and as supplements have been shown to be helpful in fibrocystic breasts.95,96

## Evening Primrose Oil

Studies of evening primrose oil (EPO) are contradictory.97 This may point to the difference between measuring essential fatty acids versus measuring ratios of fatty acids, as well as the function of the delta 5, 6, and 9 desaturases. Studies of the omega-3 fats appear consistent in showing a lower incidence of symptoms. The omega-6 fatty acids, such as EPO, may be confusing based upon whether they are converted to anti-inflammatory prostaglandins or converted to inflammatory arachidonate. Because EPA inhibits the pathway of arachidonate to prostaglandin E2 as a COX-2 inhibitor, it should always be given con- currently with EPO. Several studies have examined EPO for both mastalgia and breast cysts. In general, these studies are old and included small numbers of subjects.98–102 A more recent meta-analysis showed no difference between EPO-treated patients and controls.103 A single study done looking at breast cyst response to EPO was also disappointing. Two hundred women with breast cysts were ran- domly assigned either six capsules per day of EPO or placebo for 1 year. Although there were fewer cysts in the EPO group (92 vs. 113), this difference was not statistically significant.104 These studies demonstrate the importance of adequately powered studies using the correct essential fats at the correct dosage for a long enough time to accomplish change in both symptoms and disease. It is logical to assume that dietary fats and EPO would be more likely to prevent fibrosis and cyst formation when started at a young age and possibly to inhibit progression than to be effective in relieving symp- toms or reversing well-established fibrosis and cyst formation.


Studies of vitamin E were generally small and of poor quality due to the failure to differentiate between the available forms of tocopherols. The mode of action remains unclear but is likely related to the effect of tocopherols on the inflammatory effects of oxidative stress in the ECM or ductal system.105 A very small (23 patients) study of alpha-tocopherol in the 1980s was shown to relieve many PMS symptoms, particularly FCC.106,107 The same authors demonstrated that vitamin E is clinically useful in relieving pain and tenderness, whether cyclic or noncyclic.108 When larger numbers of women were studied by the same authors, vitamin E did not fare so well, showing no significant effects either subjectively or objectively.109,110 In 2004 Bespalov et al. studied the effects of supplementation with a combination of beta-carotene 5 mg/d, vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol 5 mg), vitamin C (30 mg), and garlic powder (150 mg) in 66 women. There was a reduction in the severity of mastalgia, PMS, infrequent menses, and menstrual cramping as well as a reduction in “palpable symptoms of fibromatosis” in 75% of the women compared with 45% of women on placebo.111 In 2009 another small double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin E supplementation (200 mg) in 150 women in Iran, chewable tablets containing either vitamin E (200 mg) or placebo were given twice daily for 4 months. The results at 2 months were dramatically

better for 70% of the group receiving vitamin E than for those on pla- cebo, but there was no further improvement at 4 months.112 More recently (2015), a brief study (2 months) of 80 patients with cyclic mastalgia was done by Shobeiri et al. This study compared vita- min E and vitamin B 6 . A trend toward improvement in symptoms was found in both groups.113 Although there is a suggestion that vitamin E is effective for the symptoms of fibrocystic breasts, much more work needs to be done to confirm this. It is unlikely this will happen. However, the safety profile of this treatment is excellent.


A review in 2004 points out the difficulty in studying the relationship of vitamin intake, vitamin levels, levels in breast tissue, and outcome. Their review of the research is inconclusive with regard to vitamin A and breast cancer, let alone benign breast disease, which is often used as the “control.”114 Vitamin A is involved in cellular proliferation and differentia- tion.115 The carotenoids additionally have antioxidant properties.116 Vitamin A has been only minimally studied for fibrocystic breasts. However, there are retinoid receptors in breast tissue, which can mod- ulate breast changes, including their effect on iodine processing.42 In a study of 12 women with fibrocystic breast disease, women were given 150,000 IU of vitamin A daily for 3 months (by current standards, a massive dose). Five of the nine patients who completed the study had full or partial remission of their fibrocystic breast disease. However, some patients developed mild side effects, leading 2 of the original to withdraw because of headaches, and 1 patient required a reduction in dosage.117 Beta-carotene would appear to be a safer approach (see Chapter 127). However, genetic inability to convert beta-carotene to retinol must be considered because a significant portion of the popu- lation has genomic variations that impair the conversion of beta-caro- tene to vitamin A (see Chapters 57 and 125).

## Thyroid and Iodine

The breast is a site that concentrates iodine (a known antimicrobial) and contains both the NIS (sodium iodide symporter) and lactoper- oxidase (oxidizing iodide to iodine). Both the milk produced and the tissue producing it show increased concentrations of iodine,118 pre- sumably to protect the nursing infant as well as the breast tissue itself from pathogenic bacteria and the ravages of inflammation. Experimental iodine deficiency in rats resulted in a mammary dys- plasia histologically similar to human FCC when either estrogen or testosterone was administered.119 In animals treated with perchlorate to block the NIS, treatment with thyroxin did not improve the breast abnormalities, suggesting that the cause was iodine deficiency and not hypothyroidism.120 In humans, benign breast disease, including cysts and fibrocystic changes, were associated with nodular thyroid disease and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis in 54.9% and 47.4%, respectively, ver- sus 29.2% in a control group121 and has been shown to improve with thyroid treatment,122 possibly due to the breast’s ability to deiodinate T3 and T4 and use the iodine.42 Thyroid hormone replacement ther- apy in women with mastodynia resulted in improvement based upon a thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH)–induced prolactin response.123 More recent studies show that the antineoplastic effects of iodine require either elemental iodine (I2 ) or a tissue that can both absorb iodide (NIS) and convert it to iodine via peroxidases such as lactop- eroxidase.124,125 These results suggest that subclinical hypothyroidism, iodine deficiency, or both may be etiological factors in both FCC and breast cancer.126 Iodine absorption increases in pregnancy and lacta- tion. This may explain the decrease in density of fibrocystic appearance after pregnancy and lactation.127 In studies in rats and humans, it was shown that there is a hierar- chical response to the type of iodine compound used in correcting the abnormalities in mammary tissue due to iodine deprivation. Although iodide corrects the cystic spaces and partially corrects the ductal cell proliferation, it produces more side effects and more disruption of thy- roid function. Iodine in its elemental form corrects the entire disease process, including the fibrosis. Additionally, iodide or iodine, excreted in the milk or into the ductal lumen, may change the microbiome of the milk. Both the beneficial effects on the microbiome and the direct effects on the ECM influence the cause of FCC. Since 1975, four clinical trials of iodide or iodine have been per- formed in women with FCC6: • An uncontrolled study with sodium iodide (Lugol’s, which con- tains only ∼ 5% iodine) and a protein-bound iodide (iodine casein- ate or I-) • A prospective controlled crossover study of patients failing iodide treatment who switched to molecular iodine (aqueous molecular iodine-I2, 0.08 mg/kg) • A prospective, controlled, double-blind study with molecular iodine (aqueous iodine-I2, 0.07–0.09 mg/kg) • A controlled study of IoGen (an iodide/iodate combination that produces approximately 50% iodine in the stomach) The results from these studies indicate that although treatment with iodides was effective in about 70% of subjects, it was associated with a high rate of side effects (e.g., altered thyroid function in 4%, iodinism in 3%, and acne in 15%). Results with elemental iodine were equally if not more effective but were not associated with significant side effects. The most significant side effect with molecular iodine was a short-term increase in breast pain, which seemed to correspond to a softening of the breast and disappearance of fibrous tissue plaques on physical examination. The more recent study using IoGen (a mix of sodium iodide and sodium iodate that generates approximately 50% molecular iodine in the stomach resulted in 7 of 28 patients in the 3.0 mg group and 5 of 27 in the 6.0-mg group exhibiting a reduction in physi- cian-assessed symptoms and findings compared with none of the 1.5- mg or placebo groups. Over 50% of the women on the drug reported a reduction in pain compared with only 8.3% of the placebo group.128 The dose of molecular iodine was 0.07 to 0.09 mg/kg/d in the first three studies and a somewhat lower dose of 3 to 6 mg (1.5–3 mg of iodine) of IoGen in the fourth. These doses appear to be safe and effective in the treatment for FCC. Although iodine (I2) may be an effective treatment for FCC,6,129 it has been shown that iodine stimulates the transcriptional activity of estrogen receptor alpha in breast cancer cells,130 and because of the induction of lactoperoxidase or perhaps as an oxidant itself,131 iodine may increase 4OH estrone production. Other researchers believe that lactoperoxidase is not present in cancer cells, and therefore the pres- ence of higher amounts of iodide in tumors is unimportant.42 More recent studies show that elemental iodine induces a caspase-indepen- dent and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway.132 These con- flicting studies make the use of iodine in the population most at risk (perimenopausal women) problematic. The iodine supplements used in these studies are no longer clini- cally available in the United States. Although there appear to be some elemental iodine products on the market, none has been studied. If iodine is to be used clinically, care must be taken to select the cor- rect form of iodine and not overdose with iodides, which affect the thyroid or induce iodism. Women at increased risk of breast cancer may not be candidates for iodine (I2) therapy until further studies are available to identify who benefits and who does not. Increased iodine intake via seaweed uncontaminated by I131 should, however, be safe and is supported by both the lower risk of breast cancer both pre- and

## Vitex Agnus-Castus (Chasteberry)

Chaste tree berry has been a very important plant for the treatment of PMS, including breast complaints and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The evidence for the use of chaste tree berry in the treatment of mastal- gia has been reported in both randomized and nonrandomized studies. A large open study (no control group) of 1634 women who experienced cyclic mastalgia as part of their PMS reported that 81% of participants rated it as a very good treatment for their mastalgia after 3 months of therapy.136 In a prospective, multicenter trial using chaste tree in patients with premenstrual cyclic mastalgia, 43 women were treated daily with chaste tree for three consecutive menstrual cycles. By the end of the study period, cyclic mastalgia decreased significantly, along with a smaller degree of improvement even 3 months after stopping the plant. Thirty-eight women rated the effectiveness as moderate to excel- lent, with five reporting no effect.137 In a randomized controlled trial, women with cyclic mastalgia showed a significant decrease in the inten- sity and duration of pain after one or two treatment cycles compared with placebo.138 In a randomized trial of premenstrual dysphoric disor- der, comparing chaste tree with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), 58% of patients being treated with chaste tree had an improve- ment in their cyclic mastalgia, and 68% of patients had improvements in their psychological symptoms.139 In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 170 women were given chaste tree or placebo for three consecutive cycles. The improvement in breast pain was greater in the chaste tree group (52%) compared with the placebo group (24%).140 Vitex agnus castus is well tolerated. The most frequent adverse events are nausea, headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, menstrual disorders, acne, pruritus, and erythematous rash; however, all are mild and reversible.141

## Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla)

A small, randomized placebo-controlled study of chamomile tincture (5 gtts tid) in 60 patients showed a significant reduction of symptoms in women with cyclic mastalgia.142 Chamomile has been reported to be both a galactogog143 and to inhibit lactation.98 The mode of action is unknown; however, Matricaria chamomilla has been shown to have antibacterial and antioxidant potential.144 Chamomile is generally safe, although gastroin- testinal side effects have been seen,145 and allergic reactions and can occur, showing cross-reactivity with echinacea, feverfew, and milk thistle.146

## Other Considerations

<!-- chunk -->

## Liver Function

Because FCC may be related to an increased level of and sensitivity to estrogen and the liver is the primary site of estrogen clearance, any factor (e.g., cholestasis, alcohol intake, environmental pollution, or other hepatic compromise) that interferes with proper liver function may lead to an increased estrogen effect and worse symptoms. The pre- viously discussed approaches to lower estrogens should be systemati- cally addressed in these patients.

<!-- chunk -->

## Colon Function

Breast disease has been linked to the Western diet and bowel function. There is an association between epithelial dysplasia in the nipple aspi- rates of breast fluid and the frequency of bowel movements. Women having fewer than three bowel movements per week have a risk of FCC that is 4.5 times greater than those having at least one a day.151 This association is probably due to reabsorption of deconjugated estrogens; the bacterial flora in the large intestine transforming endog- enous and exogenous sterols and fatty acids into various toxic metab- olites, and the effect on the gut microbiome.152 Fecal microorganisms are capable of synthesizing estrone, estradiol, and 17-methoxyestradiol as well as metabolizing estrogen sulfate and glucuronate conjugates, resulting in the absorption of bacteria-derived estrogens and reabsorp- tion of previously conjugated human estrogens. Diet plays a major role in determining colonic microflora, transit time, and the concentration of absorbable metabolites.153 Recent studies of the breast microbiome suggest that taking pro- biotics orally can alter the breast microbiome in beneficial ways and should be considered. (See earlier discussion of the microbiome.) Women on vegetarian diets excrete two to three times more conju- gated estrogens via the gut than those who are omnivorous, who also reabsorb more estrogens.104 Omnivorous women have 50% higher mean levels of unconjugated estrogens. Supplementation with L. aci- dophilus has been shown to lower fecal β -glucuronidase.154 Calcium-d- glucarate blocks β -glucuronidase, improving the excretion of estrogens conjugated with glucuronide. Both should be beneficial to women with FCC.

## Pharmaceuticals

Pharmaceutical approaches to benign breast symptoms, including oral contraceptives, Tamoxifen, Danazol,155 Centchroman (ormel- oxifene),156 and Goserelin (luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone [LHRH] analog), are all aimed at reducing estrogen effect. All have significant side effects. Bromocriptine and Lisuride maleate are dopa- mine agonists aimed at blocking the release of prolactin. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been used by mouth and top- ically for breast pain.157 Their anti-inflammatory effects both locally as a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor and as an aromatase inhib- itor have been reported. Although the reports on some drugs (e.g., Tamoxifen) indicating effectiveness in preventing breast cancer are encouraging, little is reported on reducing cysts or fibrosis.

# NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPEUTIC APPROACH

Because the origins of FCC are likely related to the causes of fibro- sis (inflammation, autoimmune issues, and genetics) in relationship to the environment (breast microbiome, radiation, and trauma) and stimulated by estrogen excess (estrogen/progesterone imbalance, genetics, xenoestrogens), treatment should be aimed at early avoidance of inflammation and improved gut function and ongoing treatments that lower and balance estrogen levels. The use of these approaches is likely to decrease both symptoms problematic to the patient and diag- nostic dilemmas problematic to the practitioner. Some women have noncyclic FCC, and others have cyclic premen- strual breast tenderness and lumpiness, so the therapeutic approach outlined in Chapter 212 may be more appropriate for individual needs.

## 1318SECTION 6 Diseases

The therapy recommended here also includes some of the key factors discussed in Chapter 212.


Dietary changes should be aimed at avoiding the development of obesity158 and insulin resistance (a known cause of inflammation), improving the microbiome of the gut and the breast, and improving disturbed steroid metabolism. Avoidance of sugar, caffeine, and alco- hol at least during the luteal phase of the cycle is helpful. Avoiding glu- ten in the diet as an inflammagen can be beneficial for some. Avoiding dairy, which contains both high levels of estrogens from the pregnant cows included among the milk suppliers and high level of toxins from the environment, can be useful. The diet should be primarily vege- tarian (replete with aromatase inhibitors and phytoestrogens from vegetables, with large amounts of dietary fiber to encourage bowel reg- ularity. All methylxanthines should be eliminated until symptoms are relieved. At that point, methylxanthines can be reintroduced in small amounts because they are tolerated by many patients. Reducing the saturated fat content of the diet while increasing the consumption of complex carbohydrates has been shown to reduce the severity of premenstrual breast tenderness and swelling as well as the nodularity in some women in one very old study.159 Reducing the dietary fat intake to 20% of total calories results in significant decreases in circu- lating estrogens in women with benign breast disease in one study,160 but other studies have not shown an effect of a diet of increased vegetables and fruit, low fat, and higher grains on benign proliferative breast dis- ease161 or when breast cancer was the end point.162 Recommendations on fat intake should emphasize the quality and origins of the fat rather than the total amount, especially in prediabetic women who will likely substitute fat with higher sugar and carbs, to their detriment. Emphasis should be placed on increased vegetable rather than fruit intake. The diet should emphasize organic, whole, unprocessed foods (whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds) to limit food con- taminated with herbicides, such as glyphosate, and insecticides, which are xenoestrogens. Patients should be encouraged to drink at least 48 oz of water daily to facilitate the excretion of estrogens and xenoestrogens. Exogenous estrogens (hormone replacement therapy and envi- ronmental toxins)163,164 should be avoided if possible, as they may exacerbate the condition (hormone replacement therapy163 and envi- ronmental toxins164). Birth control pills have been used to lower the ovarian output of estrogen and are helpful in some once the increased estrogen period (first 1–3 months) is past.165 However, the effect on the breast of the progestins in the pill is likely negative.


• B vitamins containing 5-methylfolate and B 12 (preferably in a form not containing cyanide). Doses should be individualized. • Lipotropic factors: choline 1000 mg and methionine 1000 mg • Betaine: 175 mg bid • NAC: 1000 mg/day as an antioxidant • Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) or Di-indoylmethane (DIM), provided 2OH estrogen metabolites are not already high • Calcium d-glucarate: 200 to 500 mg bid • Vitamin E: 400 to 800 IU/day of d-alpha-tocopherol (take care to avoid synthetic dL forms) • Beta-carotene: 50,000 to 300,000 IU/day • Iodine (aqueous molecular iodine): 0.07 to 0.09 mg/kg (a pre- scription item) or Lugol’s iodine (95% iodide and 5% iodine 5–10 gtts/d; iodine caseinate [iodized casein I-] 10 mg/d; see earlier precautions) • Evening primrose oil: 1500 mg twice a day in combination with omega-3 fatty acids • Omega-3 fatty acids 1000 mg/day of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)/ docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) • Probiotics containing a mixture of lactobacillius species with guar- anteed live organisms at the date of expiration • Magnesium: to bowel tolerance for constipation and PMS symp- toms other than breast • Fiber as organic ground flax seeds: 1 to 2 tsp/day


• Vitex (chaste berry): The usual dosage of chaste berry extract (often standardized to contain 0.5% agnuside) in tablet or capsule form is 175 to 225 mg per day. If using the liquid extract, the typical dosage is 2 to 4 mL (½–1 tsp) a day. • Boswellia serrata (resin) standardized to 60%; boswellic acid: 200 mg/day • Chamomile as tea or extracted • Curcumin as a spice added to food or a bioavailable supplement (200–600 mg/day)

## Mechanical

Breast self-massage can be amazingly helpful in women with painful breasts. A lymphatic massage technique of gentle manipulation of the breast from the areola outward and sweeping up into the armpit fol- lowed by a circular motion with hands on either side of the breast, usu- ally in the prone position, relieves the congestion of the breast due to hormonal imbalance.166 Practitioners of thermography have found that this also decreases some of the signs of inflammation and congestion in the tail of the breast and the underarm area (personal communica- tion). Herbalist Susan Weed recommends using essential oils and com- bining massage with breast self-examination. (http://www.susunweed .com/herbal_ezine/April09/breasthealth.htm). Avoid using progester- one or other hormone creams directly on the breast.

# SURGICAL INTERVENTION

Treatment of asymptomatic, fluid-filled cysts with aspiration is no lon- ger recommended.167 Surgical treatment should be reserved for sus- picious dominant masses and used liberally in this situation to avoid failure to diagnose breast cancers. Surgical treatment of fibrocystic breasts with subcutaneous mastectomy should be a last resort and used only when pain is severe and the breast tissue has been almost com- pletely replaced with fibrosis.

## 1321CHAPTER 170 Fibromyalgia Syndrome

The theorists’ argument does not apply to other medical disorders, however, and is refuted by two lines of evidence.17 First, studies have not established that chronic widespread pain and multiple TnPs are features of other medical disorders. Second, many patients with rheu- matoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, Lyme disease, systemic lupus erythe- matosus, Chiari malformation, and spinal stenosis also meet the ACR criteria for FMS, but when these other disorders are effectively treated, the patients still meet the criteria for FMS.18–20 The argument is false, then, that chronic widespread pain and tender- ness are features of many medical disorders. Nonetheless, the argument highlights the need to differentiate FMS from other disorders with simi- lar symptoms that may lead the clinician to misdiagnose FMS. The main disorders the clinician should distinguish from FMS are arthritis, myop- athy, polymyalgia rheumatica, diabetic polyneuropathy, ankylosing spondylitis, discopathy, cardiac or pleural pain,21 multiple muscle myo- fascial pain syndromes,22 and lupus erythematosus. A given patient may, of course, concurrently meet the criteria for FMS and one or more other disorders with overlapping symptoms. FMS can usually be distinguished from medical disorders other than hypothyroidism and cellular resis- tance to thyroid hormone by careful pathognomy. However, diagnostic scrutiny will show that the symptoms and signs of most FMS patients are indistinguishable from those of the subclass of hypothyroid and thyroid hormone–resistant patients for whom pain is a predominant symptom.

# GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

## Focus of the Conventional Fibromyalgia Research

<!-- chunk -->

## Community

The serotonin deficiency hypothesis is the oldest proposed mecha- nism of FMS.23–25 As a research-inspiring concept, it constituted the core theoretical underpinning of the rheumatology paradigm of FMS. This hypothesis proposed that a central nervous system (CNS) sero- tonin deficiency reduced the efficiency of the brainstem–spinal cord descending antinociceptive system, lowering the threshold for pain perception.26 By 2000, the serotonin deficiency hypothesis had been effectively refuted16 by three lines of evidence: First, the only site of low serotonin among FMS patients was their platelets.26–28 Second, serotonin-increasing drugs were no more effective than placebos29,30–34 and exacerbated some patients’ FMS status.35 And third, the low brain blood flow of FMS patients36,37 contradicts a serotonin deficiency; sero- tonin is a potent vasoconstrictor,38 and a low CNS level would produce cerebral vasodilation and increased blood flow. This was further documented in the 2005 publication of the state of that paradigm.39 The central theoretical viewpoint of the former par- adigm had shifted from a serotonin deficiency to a generalized prob- lem of augmented pain processing resulting in a hyperalgesic state,39,40 which is plausibly explained by the extraordinarily high levels of sub- stance P in patients with FMS.41 But researchers espousing the former paradigm have failed to address the most plausible mechanism of the patients’ high levels of substance P (see the following section). Instead, their main efforts have been in developing pharmaceuticals to manage FMS pain. This has led to the approval of several drugs by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for FMS and the recommendation that patients undergo education about FMS as well as psychotherapy and aerobic, strength, and flexibility training.40

## Environmental Toxicants

More than 50% of FMS patients reported adverse reactions to various chemicals. It has been suggested that an elevated total burden of toxic metals, such as cadmium and mercury, may induce worsening of diverse muscle pains with various etiologies. One study evaluated the frequency and clinical relevance of metal allergy in fibromyalgia (FM) patients.42 Fifteen female FM patients and 10 healthy age-matched women (con- trols) were included in the study. Metal allergy was measured by a lym- phocyte transformation test, MELISA. All FM patients tested positive for at least one of the metals tested. The most frequent reactions were to nickel, followed by inorganic mercury, cadmium, and lead. Some healthy controls responded to inorganic mercury in vitro, but most of the tests were negative. Dental metal restorations and avoidance of known sources of toxic metals were recommended, implemented, and achieved to reduce metal exposure. An objective health assessment was performed 5 years after treatment, which showed that half of the patients no lon- ger fulfilled the FM diagnosis, 20% had improved, and the remaining 30% still had FM. All patients reported subjective health improvement. Additionally, mercury and other toxic elements may interfere with the bioavailability of essential nutrients, which may aggravate symptoms.

## Hypometabolism Hypothesis of Fibromyalgia Syndrome

The hypometabolism hypothesis posits that FMS is chronic hyperalgesia and other symptoms and signs of hypometabolism due to hypothyroid- ism, partial cellular resistance to thyroid hormone, or other metabo- lism-impeding factors. Among the other factors said to be responsible are pernicious diet, nutritional deficiencies, low physical fitness, and metabolism-impeding drugs. The term hypometabolism refers to the global impact on the patient of the underlying factors, most of which are catabolic and inhibitory, although some are anabolic or excitatory.16 Considerable evidence indicates that inadequate thyroid hormone reg- ulation (ITHR) due to hypothyroidism or cellular resistance to thyroid hormone is the underlying mechanism of the two main features of FMS: chronic widespread pain and abnormal tenderness. ITHR of metabolic processes in cells of the brainstem–spinal cord descending antinociceptive system can result in chronically enhanced pain perception. Impairment of the antinociceptive system in FMS patients results in the following: • Spontaneous or ongoing pain • Tenderness (lowering of the pain threshold to mechanical stimuli) • Hyperalgesia (increased responsiveness to noxious stimuli)43,44 From Lowe JC.

## 1322SECTION 6 Diseases

ITHR can impair the antinociceptive system by two mechanisms. First, ITHR can severely increase the production of substance P, which is extremely high in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of tested FMS patients.41 Substance P is released from the terminals of nociceptive neurons45 and assists the summation of slow nociceptive signals.46 This facilitation amplifies the transmission of nociceptive signals in the spinal cord.47 Thyroid hormone normally inhibits the synthesis and secretion of substance P in many CNS cells. It does so by repressing the transcription of the preprotachykinin-A gene. Preprotachykinin-A is the precursor of substance P and its cognate substance P receptor.48,49 Lowering thyroid hormone levels by thyroidectomy increased the sub- stance P level in astrocytes,49 the anterior pituitary,50–52 many brain nuclei,53 and, most relevant to pain, the dorsal horns of the lumbar spinal cord. The increase in dorsal horn substance P was highly ele- vated (100%),54,55 as in FMS patients.41 Thyroid hormone treatment lowered the substance P level in the anterior pituitary,51 brain nuclei,56 and dorsal horns.55 Excess thyroid hormone reduced substance P to subnormal levels.52 The second mechanism by which ITHR can reduce the effectiveness of the antinociceptive system is by reducing the synthesis and secre- tion of norepinephrine (NE) in cells of the brainstem locus ceruleus. Adequate NE is essential to the normal function of the descending ant- inociceptive system.57,58 The antinociceptive pathways that descend from the brainstem to the dorsal horns contain two types of neurons: those that secrete serotonin and others that secrete NE.20,57,59,60 Serotonin secretion by the neurons is tonically augmented by NE secretion. Normal sero- tonin secretion is therefore dependent on NE secretion.55 The sero- tonin stimulates interneurons to secrete opiates.57,59,61 These then inhibit transmission partly by blocking the release of neurotrans- mitter substances such as glutamate and substance P from the affer- ent neurons.62 They also block calcium influx and potassium efflux from the afferent terminals,63 mainly those of types C and A delta fibers.64 The decreased potassium efflux hyperpolarizes terminals, inhibiting the transmission of nociceptive signals to spinothalamic neurons that otherwise would transmit the signals to the brain.65 Low NE secretion by descending neurons, however, may reduce the secretion of serotonin selectively at dorsal horn interneurons and secondarily reduce opiate secretion. As a result, the transmission of nociceptive signals in the CNS will increase, thus heightening pain perception. That decreased NE production is involved in the heightened pain perception of FMS patients is indicated by low metabolites of both dopamine and NE in patients’ CSF.27 That inadequate T 3 regulation of locus ceruleus neurons accounts for the low NE production is sug- gested by the crucial role T 3 plays in the synthesis of both dopamine and NE. The locus ceruleus is the brain site with the heaviest concen- tration of T 3 .66–68 Thyroid hormone regulates the activity levels of two rate-limiting enzymes in dopamine and NE synthesis.69 One enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase, catalyzes the conversion of tyrosine to levodopa, which in turn is converted to dopamine.70 Tyrosine hydroxylase activ- ity in the noradrenergic neurons of the locus ceruleus is low in hypo- thyroidism.71 Low activity of the enzyme and reduced conversion of levodopa to dopamine may be responsible for low dopamine levels in the striatum, hypothalamus, and superior cervical ganglia in hypothy- roidism.69 Thyroid hormone therapy increases the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase.71 The second enzyme, dopamine- β -hydroxylase, cata- lyzes the conversion of dopamine to NE. Low activity of the enzyme in hypothyroidism can reduce NE levels.69 Unfortunately, NE levels in the antinociceptive system and other tissues in thyroid disorders have not been studied extensively72 enough to support this putative mechanism. By raising substance P levels and possibly lowering NE levels in the spinal cord, ITHR can thus plausibly heighten FMS patients’ pain perception. Patients’ pain, however, is probably compounded by other factors. First, most FMS patients are physically inactive because of their pain,73,74 although low motor drive from low dopamine levels27 prob- ably contribute to their inactivity. Their low physical activity level may further contribute to the inefficiency of the antinociceptive system.75–77 ITHR can also plausibly account for the other symptoms and objectively verified abnormalities of FMS: muscle and joint pain, par- esthesias, cognitive dysfunction, depression, cold intolerance, exercise intolerance, weakness and fatigue, dry skin and mucous membranes, constipation, dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia,78,79 increased plate- let α2 -adrenergic receptor density,80,81 reduced brain blood flow,82 reduced peripheral blood flow,83 sleep disturbance,84 deficient slow- wave sleep,85 hypotension,86 blunted sympathetic response to stress,87 stiffness and swelling,88 irritable bowel syndrome,89 excessive uri- nation,84 high serum hyaluronic acid,90 low procollagen III,91 high ground substance proteoglycans,92 low pyridinoline93 and hydroxy- proline,94 glycolysis abnormalities,95 low concentrations of high-energy phosphates in erythrocytes and muscle cells,96,97 and low growth hor- mone and somatomedin C levels.98 The cellular and genomic actions of thyroid hormone can explain the hormone’s relationship to all of these factors.16 Especially important is thyroid hormone’s effect on the adrenergic system. If the hypometabolism hypothesis is verified at some point in the future, the definition of fibromyalgia will include an expla- nation of FMS as a condition of α -adrenergic dominance.

## Experimental Support for the Hypometabolism Hypothesis of

## Fibromyalgia Syndrome

The hypothesis that ITHR is an underlying mechanism of FMS has considerable experimental support.99 Many researchers have noted the virtually identical features of FMS, hypothyroidism, and the peripheral form of cellular resistance to thyroid hormone.16,100–115 Several research groups have used thyroid function testing to deter- mine the incidence of thyroid disease among FMS patients. Each group has reported an incidence higher than in the general population.100–110 A thorough analysis of all the available evidence indicates that approx- imately 90% of FMS patients have some form of thyroid disease, either primary or central hypothyroidism or cellular resistance to thyroid hormone.116,117 In two studies, 15 female FMS patients had low resting meta- bolic rates (RMRs) and basal axillary temperatures compared with matched healthy controls. In both studies, the controls’ mean RMR was within the reference range predicted by equations. However, in the first study, the mean RMR of FMS patients was 29.2% below normal based on their gender, age, height, and weight.118 In the second study, FMS patients’ mean RMR was 32.5% below normal.119 In both studies, FMS patients’ basal temperatures were significantly lower than those of controls. In the first study,118 FMS patients’ mean basal temperature was 96.95°F (36.08°C). In the second study,119 the mean temperature of FMS patients was 96.38°F (35.77°C).

## Thyroid Supplementation

The only clinical trials in which patients have been fully relieved of FMS have involved orally administered thyroid hormone. It should be noted, however, that in each study patients also used other metabolism-regulating therapies (see later discussion on metabolism-regulating therapies other than thyroid hormone). Euthyroid and hypothyroid FMS patients fully recovered in five open but highly systematic trials6–10; three double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trials11–13; and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.14 In another randomized, double-blind trial, patients with FMS had limited improvement with the use of transdermal

T 3 .120 A 1- to 5-year follow-up study compared the status of control patients with FMS with patients with FMS who had either hypothyroid- ism or cellular resistance to thyroid hormone and underwent metabolic therapy, including the use of thyroid hormone. Although control patients’ FMS status deteriorated, treated patients recovered and maintained their recovery throughout the follow-up period. The results of this study were the first to demonstrate the long-term effectiveness of an FMS treatment.15

## Metabolism-Regulating Therapies Other Than Thyroid

<!-- chunk -->

## Hormone

Thyroid hormone therapy is necessary in most cases of FMS to ensure recovery, but it is not sufficient. For example, in a study of 77 euthy- roid patients with FMS,6 those who declined to adopt a wholesome diet, take nutritional supplements, and exercise to tolerance were among the 25% who failed to benefit from T 3 therapy. This result is consistent with years of clinical experience supporting the necessity for patients to use other metabolism-regulating therapies in addition to thyroid hormone. A common experience, for example, is a recovered patient stopping the use of B complex vitamins only to suffer a partial recurrence of FMS symptoms. The symptoms are again relieved when the vitamin use resumes. The most common other metabolism-regulating therapies that patients must use are a wholesome diet, nutritional supplementa- tion, and exercise to tolerance. These therapies are necessary for most patients to recover fully. However, in most cases, they are not suffi- cient and must be used along with thyroid hormone therapy. This is shown by studies indicating that these therapies alone provide some improvement but that patients do not recover fully (i.e., they continue to meet the criteria for FMS). In addition to the metabolic therapies, most FMS patients also require some physical treatment for full relief of their FMS pain.

## Wholesome Diet

Various diets and dietary supplements have been tested as FMS treatments. Mild-to-moderate improvements in FMS status have been reported for vegetarian diets121,122; elimination of the exci- totoxins monosodium glutamate and aspartame123; Chlorella pyrenoidosa (a unicellular freshwater green alga rich in proteins, vitamins, and minerals)124,125; an uncooked vegan diet consisting of berries, fruits, vegetables, roots, nuts, and germinated seeds and sprouts126; and a strict, low-salt, uncooked vegan diet rich in lactobacteria.127

<!-- chunk -->

## Nutritional Therapies

Long clinical experience shows that a wide array of nutritional sup- plements is necessary if FMS patients are to improve significantly or recover (Fig. 170.3). As the sole treatment, however, supplements pro- vide only mild improvement except for the rare patient. Studies indicate that vitamins B 1 , B 6 , B 12 ,56,128–136 C,137–141 and E and beta-carotene142 have antinociceptive properties. Other reports indicate that various nutritional supplements improve FMS sta- tus: the Myers’ cocktail (intravenous formula of B vitamins, vita- min C, calcium, and magnesium)143; 5-hydroxytryptophan144,145; S-adenosylmethionine146–149; magnesium and malic acid150,151; com- bined aloe vera extracts, plant saccharides, freeze-dried fruits and vegetables, Dioscorea, and a vitamin/mineral complex152; collagen hydrolysat153; and a blend of ascorbigen and broccoli powder.154

## Exercise to Tolerance

The results of studies of exercise in the treatment of FMS have been mixed: some have shown no improvement in FMS status35,69,155–158 or only minimal improvement.159–164 Cardiovascular exercise has pro- vided the most improvement,161–164 especially low-intensity endurance training.164,165 Endurance exercise is important in reducing the physi- cal limitations associated with FMS.166 The importance of physical fit- ness and the high metabolic efficiency it provides167,168 was shown by deficient slow-wave sleep, inducing FMS-like symptoms in sedentary and not aerobically fit students.23 This finding suggests that low met- abolic efficiency due to ITHR renders some individuals susceptible to FMS.16 Nutrition deficiency Malnutrition F M m u s cl e p ai n Nutritional supplementation Oxidative stress Deficiency of certain vitamins and minerals Diets deficient in amino acids Plant-based diets high in antioxidants Adequately correct nutritional supplementation Optimally adjust the ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 PUFA Fig. 170.3 The Relationship Between Nutrition and Fibromyalgia-Related Musculoskeletal Pain.

## 1324SECTION 6 Diseases

Vigorous exercise tends to exacerbate patients’ FMS symp- toms.72,73 As a result, some patients avoid exercise altogether and consequently are not physically fit.166,169–171 The most plausible explanation for the exacerbations of vigorous exercise is the high density of α2 -adrenergic receptors on FMS patients’ platelets.172 The platelet density of α2 -adrenergic receptors is a reliable indicator of the receptor density in the CNS.173 Binding of catecholamines to a high density of the receptors on cells of most tissues inhibits energy metabolism. The inhibition of energy metabolism during vigorous exercise, mediated by the high density of the receptors, appears to worsen symptoms severely. During the early phase of treatment, then, exercise should be mild enough to avoid or minimize catecholamine secretion.16 With effective thyroid hormone therapy, the density of α2 -adrenergic receptors decreases and the density of β -adrenergic receptors increases, enabling cells to respond appropriately to high levels of catecholamines. The shift away from α2 -adrenergic receptor dominance probably explains, in part, the FMS patient’s ability to engage in vigorous physical activity after receiving thyroid hormone therapy.6,7,8,11–13,15

<!-- chunk -->

## Physical Treatment

Extensive clinical experience and clinical trials7,8,11–13 show that despite the use of integrated metabolic therapies, many patients require physi- cal treatment to fully relieve their FMS pain.174–177 Several studies have shown that spinal manipulation, soft tissue manipulation, and trigger point therapy provide palliative improvement in some FMS symp- toms, especially pain.178–181 The most common lesions that exacerbate FMS symptoms are myofascial trigger points and spinal joint fixations.16,175,182 However, any nociception-generating neuromusculoskeletal lesion may exacer- bate FMS patients’ pain, probably owing to their high levels of sub- stance P.40 Neuromusculoskeletal lesions can also disturb sleep.183–185 This can, in turn, increase FMS symptoms.23 It appears, then, that for most FMS patients to improve or recover, integrated metabolic therapies that include the use of thyroid hormone are necessary and sufficient, whereas no single metabolic therapy is sufficient in itself. In addition, physical treatment may be necessary to eliminate most FMS patients’ pain completely.


As fully discussed previously, because metabolic hypofunction is pri- marily driven by thyroid dysfunction, fully understanding the patient’s cellular thyroid function underlies the therapeutic approach.

## Laboratory Testing for Thyroid Status

<!-- chunk -->

## Thyroid Function Tests

Before beginning the treatment for a patient with FMS, his or her thy- roid status should be determined with thyroid function tests. Primary hypothyroidism (thyroid hormone deficiency due to subnormal func- tion of the thyroid gland) in most patients can be determined with the standard thyroid panel: • Free T 3 , free T 4 , and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) In untreated primary hypothyroidism, the TSH is elevated. The recently revised upper limit of the serum TSH reference range is 2.5 μ IU/mL.186

<!-- chunk -->

## Thyroid Antibodies

The most common cause of primary hypothyroidism is autoimmune thyroiditis. The presence of this disorder can be determined by the patient’s titer of thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase (microsomal) antibodies. It is especially important to order tests of antibody levels in patients with FMS. Many patients who have elevated thyroid anti- bodies have also had thyroid function test results within the refer- ence ranges for many years.187,188 However, compared with people without chronic widespread musculoskeletal complaints, those with such complaints were found to have a significantly higher incidence of thyroid microsomal antibodies (16% vs. 7.3%, P <0.01). The prev- alence of antibodies was also significantly higher in women than men (20.4% vs. 11.6%, P < 0.02), but thyroid function test results did not differ significantly between those with and without musculoskeletal complaints.120 This study indicates that in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis, thyroid hormone levels too low to properly regulate the CNS antinociceptive system and properly inhibit the production of substance P can escape detection by thyroid function tests, including the TSH.

## Thyroid Hormone Therapy Based on Initial Thyroid

<!-- chunk -->

## Status

Patients with FMS whose test results indicate hypothyroidism should begin therapy with a thyroid hormone preparation containing both T 4 and T 3 . Many hypothyroid FMS patients do not benefit from T 4 alone no matter how high the dosage.189 Most do benefit, however, from the use of T 4 /T 3 preparations in a 4:1 ratio. The dosage range at which most patients improve or recover with T 4 /T 3 preparations is that which was used throughout the 20th century, without harmful effects,190 before TSH assays came into widespread use in the early 1970s: 76 mcgT 4 and 18 mcg T 3 to 152 mcg T 4 and 36 mcg T 3 .16,191 The thyroid hormone therapy used in studies in which hypo- thyroid and euthyroid FMS patients recovered6–14 was not con- ventional T 4 -replacement therapy. Although T 4 was used in some studies,9,10,14,15 it was T 4 /T 3 preparations and T 3 alone used in a way that violated the mandates of T 4 replacement. Specifically, patients were permitted to use thyroid hormone despite laboratory test results indicating that they were euthyroid, and doses were not titrated according to TSH levels but by patients’ clinical responses to partic- ular doses. Effective doses usually suppressed TSH levels. Despite this, patients did not have symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, nor did they have evidence of thyrotoxicosis according to electrocardiography, bone densitome- try, or serum and urine biochemical test results. Patients with FMS whose laboratory test results indicate euthy- roidism should begin with T 3 . In studies of the thyroid status of FMS patients at intake, approximately 33% were euthyroid according to thyroid function testing.192,193 Of these patients, approximately 75% have partial peripheral cellular resistance to thyroid hormone accord- ing to four criteria115,116: 1. The patients are euthyroid (according to laboratory thyroid func- tion test results) before beginning the use of T 3 . 2. The patients recover from their hypothyroid-like FMS symptoms and signs with supraphysiological doses of T 3 . 3. The patients have high serum-free T 3 levels after beginning T 3 ther- apy. 4. The patients have no evidence of tissue thyrotoxicosis, according to the results of serial electrocardiograms (ECGs), serum and urine biochemical tests, and bone densitometry. These patients usually benefit only from immediate-release T 3 (not sustained-release T 3 ) in a single daily dose.16 They are likely to respond only to supraphysiological doses of T 3 . Effective T 3 dosages for most patients are between 25 and 125 mcg. For some patients, however, safe and effective doses are far higher.16 Some FMS patients have both hypothyroidism and cellular resis- tance to thyroid hormone.8 Most of these patients improve or recover only with T 3 therapy, typically supraphysiological doses.

## The Basis of Dosage Adjustments

After a patient’s thyroid status has been determined and thyroid hor- mone therapy has begun, dosage changes should be titrated according to symptom status and physiological measures, not according to thy- roid function test results. Thyroid function tests are of no value in find- ing the safest and most effective dosage for any particular patient.194 There is no scientific justification for inferring the metabolic status of cells (other than the thyrotrophs of the anterior pituitary) from thy- roid function test results. The belief that tissue metabolic status can be accurately inferred from TSH or thyroid hormone levels is a postulate, not a research-derived conclusion. This postulate was found to be false, at least for rats, by studies showing that the levels of T 3 and T 4 in the cells of different tissues cannot be accurately predicted from plasma levels of TSH, T 3 , or T 4 .195,196 Moreover, some studies show that TSH levels correlate poorly with measures of the tissue effects of thyroid hormone, such as the speed of the relaxation phase of the Achilles reflex.197 Conversely, other studies show that the patient’s symptoms and signs are far more accurate and reliable indicators of tissue meta- bolic status than are the results of thyroid function tests.194,198 The resting metabolic rate (RMR) measured with indirect calorim- etry is the most reliable measurement of oxidative metabolism, which is strongly regulated by thyroid hormone. In a study designed to find a correlation between patients’ RMRs and their TSH levels, a significant correlation was obtained only by log-transforming the TSH values.199 The lack of a significant correlation without log transformation means that the TSH is not a useful tool for determining whether an individual patient’s thyroid hormone dosage is providing him or her with suffi- cient oxidative metabolism. Preferably, clinicians will include indirect calorimetry in their clinical practices. However, this instrument is not necessary for finding patients’ safe and effective dosages.

## Rehabilitation Model: Data-Driven Clinical Decisions

The clinician should distinguish as clearly as possible all the various factors impairing the individual patient’s metabolism. Next, the clini- cian should provide the patient with an individualized treatment reg- imen designed to correct, eliminate, or compensate for the causative factors. The treatment regimen that is most effective for guiding the FMS patient to recovery conforms to a rehabilitation model, which requires baseline and repeated monitoring of the patient’s clinical status through objective assessment methods. Thus clinical decisions, such as thyroid hormone dosage adjustments, are data driven.

## Objective Assessment of Patient Status

In patients with FMS, recovery of normal metabolism, a symptom-free state, and full function occurs gradually over a range of 2 to 6 months. Because of the time involved, it is best for the clinician to quantify the patient’s clinical status through objective measures at weekly or biweekly intervals. Scores from these measures should be posted as data points to line graphs after each evaluation. The patient’s baseline score on each measure (taken before therapy is begun) is the initial data point on each graph. Next, a line should be drawn through the data points to create a trend line that makes obvious, on visual inspection, changes in the patient’s clinical status. The trend lines of the data points on the graphs thus help the clinician assess the effectiveness of the patient’s regimen at any point during treatment. In this way, the lines enable the clinician to make informed, data-driven decisions about any treatment changes needed to optimize clinical results. The five line graphs in Fig. 170.4 show the changes in FMS measures during metabolic rehabilitation of a euthyroid FMS patient reported by Honeyman-Lowe.9 Typically, all measures change together in the direction of improvement, no improvement, or worse. The patient’s subjective status usually corresponds closely to what the trend lines indicate. During the course of the rehabilitation process, patients and cli- nicians often lose sight of the severity of the patient’s clinical status before treatment. When patients occasionally experience a brief or mild exacerbation of symptoms, they are especially prone to forget the progress they have made. For some, this state of mind can lead to the false conclusion that they have made no progress at all. This false conclusion is quickly corrected, however, by a review of the patients’ graphs, which show visually and objectively their real progress. The five objective assessment methods that should be used at each patient evaluation are described as outlined in the following discussion. The clinician should also perform a physical examination at each eval- uation to further assess the patient’s changing tissue metabolic status.

## Pain Distribution Body Form

Four studies have shown that the most sensitive indicator for changes in FMS status is the pain distribution as a percentage of the body in pain.11–13,163,200 This is convenient in that chronic widespread pain is one of the two major criteria for the assessment of FMS status.1 Small changes in pain distribution are assessed by using a form containing drawings of the body. The patient precisely shades in where he or she has had aching, pain, soreness, or tenderness since the last evaluation. Next, a template is placed over the patient’s shaded form, which shows the body form divided into 36 areas. Each of the 36 divisions has a percentage value.16,11–13 To obtain the patient’s pain distribution, the values of the shaded divisions are totaled. This percentage number is placed on a graph as a data point. The data points for each evaluation are connected by a line showing the trend of the pain distribution over time.

## Mean Pressure/Pain Threshold of Tender Point Sites

The second major criterion for the assessment of FMS is the pres- ence of tender point sites (TnPs).1 A modified version of the TnP examination measures the pressure/pain threshold of TnPs with algometry (numeric values in kilograms per square centimeter). This provides more precise quantification than the 1990 ACR method and enables the clinician to make more objective, evi- dence-based decisions.201 The mean of the threshold values is cal- culated and posted to a line graph.

## FibroQuest Symptoms Survey

The FibroQuest Symptoms Survey assessment form consists of 100- mm visual analog scales (VASs), 1 for each of the 13 most common associated FMS symptoms.2 These symptoms are also characteristic symptoms of hypothyroidism and the peripheral form of cellular resis- tance to thyroid hormone (see Box 170.1).16 The patient estimates the intensity of each symptom by marking the appropriate point on the scale (1–10). The values for each marked symptom are added, and this total symptom intensity is then divided by the number of symptoms the patient marked at intake (baseline). The mean score is then posted to a line graph.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire

The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ)202 is a measure of the patient’s functional status. The total score from the FIQ is posted as a data point to a line graph. The assessment of functional ability is highly pertinent to the care of FMS patients. For example, in a study of the functional abilities of 1735 female FMS patients ages 31 to 78, researchers concluded that the average patient had less ability in activ- ities of daily living than the average community-dwelling woman in her 80s.203

## Zung’s Self-Rating Depression Scale

Depression is so common among FMS patients that an assessment specific for the presence and severity of depression is used in addi- tion to the VAS scale for depression. Zung’s is one such assess- ment tool.204 The score from the depression scale is posted to a line graph.

<!-- chunk -->

## Physical Examination

When the treatment for the patient with FMS includes thyroid hormone, the five FMS measures should be used in conjunction with physiological tests that assess tissue responses to the hormone. The most convenient physiological tests are the relaxation phase of the Achilles’ reflex, basal pulse rate, and basal body temperature. A combination of physiological measurements is a more reliable indicator of tissue metabolic status than are the results of labora- tory thyroid function tests. In the early 20th century, indirect calorimeters came into use to measure patients’ RMRs.205 Based on the patient’s measured oxy- gen consumption, the instrument calculates the patient’s estimated 24-hour resting energy expenditure. Thyroid hormone potently and exquisitely regulates oxidative metabolism. Because of this, during the mid-20th century, indirect calorimeters were used as the most relevant instrument for the diagnosis of hypometabolism (subnormal oxida- tive metabolism) due to hypothyroidism and thyroid hormone resis- tance. In recent years, handheld and other types of convenient-to-use, affordable, and accurate indirect calorimeters have become available for clinical use. Two studies have shown that patients with FMS have abnormally low RMRs compared with matched controls.118,119 100 Feb. 12Mar. 14Mar. 21Apr. 2Apr. 9Apr. 17May 5May 0 20 40 60 80 100 A 4 3 2 1 0 Feb. 12Mar. 14Mar. 21Apr. 2Apr. 9Apr. 17May 5May 1.13 1.34 2 2.993.23 B Fig. 170.4 (A) Pain distribution.

## Patients With Fibromyalgia Syndrome

The majority of patients with FMS must control or eliminate at least four metabolism-impeding factors. First, for the approximately 90% of FMS patients who have some form of thyroid disease,116,117 the proper preparation and dosage of thyroid hormone are necessary for the patient’s recovery. Second, most patients must also modify their diets so that they minimize the intake of arachidonic acid. A high intake of arachidonic acid can increase body levels of both the proinflammatory eicosa- noids prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4,206 which can contribute to chronic pain.207 Patients must also reduce their intake of refined carbohydrate. ITHR of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain results in low production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine phosphate. Dysglycemia and insulin resistance due to the intake of refined carbohydrates can worsen the low production of high-energy phosphates due to ITHR.16 Third, most patients must take a wide array of nutritional sup- plements. Various nutrients are synergistic to thyroid hormone in providing optimal intracellular metabolism, and patients must provide themselves with optimal amounts. For example, a defi- ciency of vitamin B 1 can render patients intolerant of even low dosages of thyroid hormone—dosages too low to be therapeu- tic.208 In addition, supplemental thyroid hormone can increase the expenditure of vitamin B 1 in cells. If a patient has a marginal deficiency of the vitamin, supplemental thyroid hormone could induce a frank deficiency. This can result in a beriberi-type of cardiomyopathy.208 Fourth, most patients must also exercise to tolerance. Biochemical treatments such as thyroid hormone, optimal diet, and nutritional supplements provide the patient with increased metabolic capacity. Sufficiently vigorous physical activity, however, is necessary for opti- mizing metabolism in most tissues and for priming the descending nociceptive inhibitory system of the CNS. 8 6 10 4 2 0 Feb. 12Mar. 14Mar. 21Apr. 2Apr. 9Apr. 17May 5May 7.78 7.66 7 1.21 2.92 4.41 C 0 10 20 30 40 55.24 53.94 32.47 16.39 7.77 5.63 7.2 50 60 70 80 Mar. 14Feb. 12Mar. 21Apr. 2Apr. 9Apr. 17May 5May 22D Fig. 170.4, cont’d (C) Decreases in mean intensity of fibromyalgia syndrome symptoms as calculated from the FibroQuest form.

## Adrenocortical Hypofunction

Some patients must be treated for adrenocortical hypofunction. Low cortisol levels can produce some symptoms that are the same as those associated with FMS. These include weakness, fatigue, exagger- ated responses to stress, exercise intolerance, hypotension, and low nociception threshold. Low cortisol levels can also render the patient intolerant of a dosage of thyroid hormone high enough to be fully therapeutic. The reason is that a minimally effective dosage of thy- roid hormone is likely to accelerate the hepatic clearance of corti- sol.209 This typically exacerbates the symptoms of cortisol deficiency symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

## Metabolism-Impairing Medications

Several classes of medications may be significant in the development or perpetuation of FMS symptoms. Because of this, some patients must cease taking some metabolism-impairing medications, and they must convert from the maintenance to as-needed use of others. Beta blockers impair metabolism directly by reducing the density of β -adrenergic receptors on cell membranes and rendering α2 -adren- ergic receptors predominant in the regulation of cell function, exactly as hypothyroidism does. In some patients, this shift in adrenoceptor isoform balance creates a general mental and physical inhibitory state that may be indistinguishable from hypothyroidism or the associated symptoms of FMS.210 The shift in adrenergic receptor isoform may also impair the function of the CNS’s descending antinociceptive sys- tem, resulting in the pain and tenderness characteristic of FMS. Narcotics, tranquilizers, and muscle relaxants are commonly pre- scribed as FMS treatments. Patients should be weaned from these as soon as possible because they can render patients disinclined to engage in vigorous physical activity. As the patient’s physical fitness level declines, anergia and pain perception increase. Some antidepressants (also commonly prescribed for FMS) and decongestants can cause tachycardia when they are used simultane- ously with exogenous thyroid hormone. Because of this, patients using these drugs must reduce the dosages or stop their use to be able to take a dosage of thyroid hormone high enough to be therapeutic.


<!-- chunk -->

## Assessment of Fibromyalgia Syndrome Status

The patient’s FMS status should be evaluated before treatment is begun and at intervals throughout the course of treatment. Reevaluations are best performed weekly to biweekly and before each increase in thyroid hormone dosage. If patients have taken measurements at home, such as the basal temperature, they should provide the clinicians with a record of these measurements. A phys- ical examination and five FMS measures should be used at each evaluation: • Pain distribution as the percentage of 36 body divisions containing pain, according to a body drawing • Mean TnP score in kg/cm2 measured by algometry • Symptom intensity estimate according to visual analog scales (FibroQuest Symptoms Survey) • Functional status according to the Fibromyalgia Impact Question- naire • Depression according to the Zung’s Self-Rating Depression Scale Scores for each assessment instrument should be posted to a line graph so that the trend of the scores is obvious on visual inspection. Changes in the patient’s individualized treatment regimen should be based on the trend of scores on the line graphs combined with the physical examination and the clinician’s and patient’s subjective assessments. This process is continued (usually for 2–6 months) until the scores on the line graphs are representative of normal, the patient no longer meets the ACR criteria for FMS, and the patient is symp- tom-free and fully functional.

## Patient Safety

All patients must have an electrocardiogram before beginning met- abolic rehabilitation and, if appropriate, at intervals throughout the treatment process. Although dysrhythmic conditions are usually not obstacles to metabolic treatment, it is essential to be aware of them before treatment with thyroid hormone. Patients should be educated extensively on the possible signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis and its management should overstim- ulation occur. When a patient’s history indicates, he or she should 0 10 20 30 40 50 515151 41 35 292929 60 70 80 Mar. 14Feb. 12Mar. 21Apr. 2Apr. 9Apr. 17May 5May 22E

be tested for possible adrenocortical hypofunction. If testing reveals decreased cortisol production, the patient should be treated with phys- iological doses of cortisol at least temporarily before the use of thyroid hormone is initiated.

<!-- chunk -->

## Thyroid Hormone Therapy

If the FMS patient is hypothyroid, he or she should begin treatment with 60 mg of desiccated thyroid or a synthetic T4/T3 preparation with a 4:1 ratio. The dosage should be increased by 60 mg of desiccated thyroid at approximately 3- to 4-week intervals until an optimal dosage has been reached. If the patient is euthyroid, he or she should begin treatment with immediate-release T3, usually with a starting dosage of 50 mcg. The dosage is increased at weekly to biweekly intervals by 12.5 mcg. Dosage increases should continue until the patient is symptom-free, no lon- ger meets the ACR criteria for FMS, is fully functional, and has refer- ence-range physiological measures such as the basal body temperature and basal pulse rate.

<!-- chunk -->

## Wholesome Diet

If they have not done so already, patients should adopt a diet that both stabilizes blood sugar regulation and insulin levels and reduces pain perception. Such a diet involves lean meats—especially poultry—fish, fruits, vegetables, and minimal intake of whole grains. It also mini- mizes the intake of foods high in arachidonic acid (which increases the production of the proinflammatory eicosanoids prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4194) and additive excitotoxins such as monosodium glutamate and aspartame. The author recommends that patients use organic foods and purified drinking water to decrease the quantity of chemical contaminants ingested.


Patients should take, at minimum, the following nutrients in the approximate dosages given: High-potency multiple vitamin and mineral Vitamin B 12 : 3000 to 5000 mcg a day of methylcobalamin Vitamin C: 500 mg to 1 g three times a day Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols): 800 to 1600 IU a day Carotenoids (mixed): 15 mg a day Calcium: 2000 mcg a day in divided dosages Magnesium (preferably as aspartate, citrate, malate, or glycinate): mg a day in divided dosages Fish oils: 1000 to 2000 mg EPA+DHA a day

## Exercise to Tolerance

Exercise is essential to help normalize metabolism. It is recommended that patients engage in forms of exercise that they enjoy and gradu- ally increase the intensity as their symptoms diminish. Weight-bearing exercise is encouraged because it supports bone health. Aerobic exer- cise is essential to strengthen the cardiovascular and pulmonary sys- tems. Toning activities build lean muscle mass, which in turn improves metabolism. A combination of these forms of exercise is best. Many patients who have become severely deconditioned owing to their FMS symptoms find warm-water exercise an ideal way to begin.

<!-- chunk -->

## Physical Treatment

Myofascial therapy to eliminate trigger points in muscles and spinal manipulation to regain flexibility of the spine and other joints are essen- tial for completely eliminating some patients’ FMS pain. Both trigger points and spinal lesions can be perpetuated by self-sustaining skeletal muscle contractures. The contractures may result from deficient intra- muscular high-energy phosphate production due to ITHR.20,22,196 Both forms of treatment may raise the nociceptive threshold and increase mobility. If an examination indicates the need, orthotics should be prescribed to relieve pain-inducing chronic postural muscle tension. The thera- peutic aim is to reduce nociceptive input of somatic origin to the CNS.

• Gastrointestinal diseases (especially Crohn’s disease and cystic fibrosis) • Drugs • Age The role of a low-fiber, high-fat diet in the development of gall- stones, as well as other dietary factors, is discussed later. The other fac- tors are briefly discussed here.

## Gender

The frequency of gallstones is two to four times greater in women than in men. Women are thought to be predisposed to gallstones because of either increased cholesterol synthesis or suppression of bile acids by estrogens. Pregnancy, the use of oral contraceptives or other causes of elevated estrogen levels, and tamoxifen use greatly increase the inci- dence of gallstones.

## Genetic and Ethnic

The prevalence of gallstones appears to have some genetic aspects. Gallstones are most common in Native American women over age 30. Nearly 70% of this group have gallstones. In contrast, only 10% of black women over 30 have gallstones. The difference in the prevalence rate between ethnic and genetic groups reflects the extent of choles- terol saturation of the bile. The degree to which dietary factors affect this value probably outweighs genetic factors.9

## Obesity

Obese subjects are at risk of developing gallstones by being overweight and when initially losing weight.10 Obesity causes increased activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, with increased secretion of cholesterol in the bile as a result of increased cholesterol synthesis. Therefore obesity is associated with a significantly increased incidence of gallstones due to biliary cholesterol saturation. It is important to note that during active weight reduction, changes in body fat and diet can promote gallstone problems. During the first stages of weight loss, biliary cholesterol saturation initially increases.4 The secretion of all biliary lipids is reduced during weight loss, but the secretion of bile acids decreases more than that of cholesterol. Once the weight is stabilized, bile acid output returns to normal levels, whereas the cholesterol output remains low. The net effect is a signif- icant reduction in cholesterol saturation. In prescribing diet therapies for obese patients with a high risk of gallstones, it should be recognized that prolonged dietary fat reduction can also promote biliary stasis,1 thus contributing to cholesterol saturation. Studies show that at least 10 g of fat per day is necessary to assure proper gallbladder emptying.11

## Gastrointestinal Tract Diseases

Malabsorption of bile acids from the terminal ileum disturbs the enterohepatic circulation, thereby reducing the bile acid pool and the rate of secretion of bile. Diseases associated with this phenomenon include Crohn’s disease and cystic fibrosis.

## Drugs

Tamoxifen treatment in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer greatly increases gallstones. One retrospective cohort study of women demonstrated that after 5 years, the incidence of stone forma- tion in the tamoxifen-treated patients was 37.4%, whereas it was 2% in patients who did not receive tamoxifen.12 Most gallstones became apparent after 3 years. In addition to oral contraceptives and other estrogens, other drugs that increase the risk of gallstones include the cephalosporin ceftriax- one, octreotide, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors,1 and possibly other lipid-lowering drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

## Age

Gallstones have been reported from fetal age to extreme old age, but the average patient is 40 to 50 years old. A decline in the activity of cholesterol 7- α -hydroxylase with age1 leads to an increase in biliary cholesterol hypersecretion13 and thus cholesterol saturation, with an accelerated formation of gallstones.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hypothyroidism

Patients with hypothyroidism are more prone to have high serum cholesterol levels. The mechanisms of thyroid hormones on choles- terol are multifactorial, including influencing the synthesis, absorp- tion, and usage of cholesterol. Disturbances in lipid metabolism that occur during hypothyroidism, particularly in the cholesterol pathway, change the rate of bile excretion and lead to the formation of gall- stones. In regression multivariate analysis, it has been concluded that the level of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was an inde- pendent factor that could be considered a risk factor for the formation of common bile duct stones (odds ratio [OR] = 3.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.51–6.3).14

## Environmental Pollutants

Metal contamination of both natural and anthropogenic origin has an adverse effect on human health. A study explored the effects of metal contamination on gallstone formation by comparing two environmentally contrasting populations in the Huelva Province of Southwest Spain.15 The study population resided in an area with high metal abundance derived from the naturally metal-enriched bedrock and historical mining activities in the region of the Iberian Pyrite Belt, whereas the control population resided in the National Park of Sierra de Aracena and Picos de Aroche. The patients from the study group had a higher risk of metal exposure through contaminated soil, parti- cle matter in the air, and consumption of local water and food prod- ucts. Results demonstrated that metal exposure was related to a higher tendency of forming black-pigment gallstones in the study group compared with the control group, and the gallstones from the study group contained more abundant metal components, such as copper, iron, nickel, and zinc. In addition, a study in India identified a positive correlation between nickel, cadmium, and chromium in water and a high prevalence of gallbladder disease in adjacent villages in Vaishali District, Bihar.16 Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are persistent organic pollut- ants (POPs) historically used in the agricultural control of pests. A case-control study from China showed that high levels of p,p ′ -DDE and p,p ′ -DDT residues were risk factors for gallstone formation.17 Because of their lipophilic property, OCPs can accumulate in adipose tissue and other organs. β -HCH and p ′ ,p ′ -DDE levels in adipose tissues were found to be higher in patients with gallstones and strongly related to gallstone disease.18

## Risk Factors for Pigmented Gallstones

Risk factors for pigmented gallstones are not related to diet as much as they are to geography, sun exposure, and severe diseases. Pigmented gallstones are more common in Asia because of the higher incidence of parasitical infections of the liver and gallbladder by various organisms, including the liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis. Bacteria and protozoa can cause stasis or act as nucleating agents. In the United States, pigmented stones are usually caused by chronic hemolysis or alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver.


Gallstones are easier to prevent than to reverse. Primary treatment, therefore, involves reducing the controllable risk factors discussed ear- lier. Once gallstones have formed, therapeutic intervention involves avoiding aggravating foods and employing measures that increase the solubility of cholesterol in bile. If symptoms persist or worsen, chole- cystectomy should be considered. A number of dietary factors are important in the prevention and treatment of gallstones. Foremost is the elimination of foods that can produce symptoms. Also important are increasing dietary fiber, elimi- nating food allergies, and reducing the intake of refined carbohydrates and animal protein.

against gallbladder cancer, and red meat (beef and mutton) was found to be associated with an increased risk of gallbladder carcinogenesis.19 Because gallstones are a risk factor for gallbladder cancer,6,7,19 appro- priate nonlithogenic dietary practices will protect against both cancer and the development of gallstones. Other treatment measures involve the use of nutritional lipotropic compounds, herbal choleretics, and other natural compounds in an attempt to increase the solubility of bile. Biliary cholesterol concentration and serum cholesterol levels do not seem to correlate.20 Although some authors have reported an inverse correlation between high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and bile saturation and a direct correlation between low-density-lipopro- tein cholesterol and bile saturation,21,22 more detailed research does not appear to support these correlations.20 There does, however, seem to be an association between increased levels of serum triglycerides and bile saturation.23

<!-- chunk -->

## Asymptomatic Gallstones

The natural history of silent or asymptomatic gallstones supports the contention that elective cholecystectomy is not warranted. Although there is a cumulative chance of developing symptoms—10% at 5 years, 15% at 10 years, and 18% at 15 years—a patient should never experi- ence discomfort if controllable risk factors are eliminated or reduced.3


<!-- chunk -->

## Dietary Fiber

The hypothesis that the main cause of gallstones is the consumption of fiber-depleted refined foods has considerable research support.4,5 As mentioned earlier, in population studies, gallstones are associated with the Western diet. Such a diet, high in refined carbohydrates and fat and low in fiber, leads to a reduction in the synthesis of bile acids by the liver and a lower bile acid concentration in the gallbladder. Another way in which fiber may prevent gallstone formation is by reducing the absorption of deoxycholic acid.4,5 This compound is pro- duced from bile acids by bacteria in the intestine. Deoxycholic acid greatly lessens the solubility of cholesterol in bile. Dietary fiber has been shown both to decrease the formation of deoxycholic acid and to bind deoxycholic acid and promote its excre- tion in the feces. This greatly increases the solubility of cholesterol in the bile. A diet high in fiber, especially those fibers capable of binding to deoxycholic acid (e.g., predominantly the water-soluble fibers found in vegetables and fruits, pectin, oat bran, and guar gum), is extremely important in both the prevention and reversal of most gallstones.5 Interestingly, diets rich in legumes with high concentrations of water-soluble fibers are associated with an increased risk for gall- stones.9 Chileans, Pima Indians, and other North American Indians have the highest prevalence rates for cholesterol gallstones, and all consume a diet rich in legumes. Evidently, legume intake increases biliary cholesterol saturation because of legumes’ saponin content.9 A study conducted in the Netherlands showed just the opposite because legume intake was shown to offer significant protection against gall- stones.24 Until this issue is clarified, it might be best to restrict legume intake in individuals with existing gallstones.

## Vegetarian Diet

A vegetarian diet has been shown to protect against gallstone forma- tion.5,25 A recent study in England compared a large group of healthy nonvegetarian women with a group of vegetarian women. Ultrasound diagnosis showed that gallstones occurred significantly less frequently in the vegetarian group. Although this may simply be a result of the increased fiber con- tent of the vegetarian diet, other factors may be equally important. Animal proteins, such as casein from dairy products, have been shown to increase the formation of gallstones in animals, whereas vegetable proteins, such as soy, were shown to be preventive against gallstone formation.4,5,26

<!-- chunk -->

## Food Allergies

Since 1948, J. C. Breneman, author of Basics of Food Allergy, has used a successful therapeutic regimen to prevent gallbladder attacks: allergy elimination diets. The idea that food allergies cause gallbladder pain has some support in the scientific literature.27–30 A 1968 study revealed that 100% of a group of patients were free from symptoms while they were on a basic elimination diet (beef, rye, soybean, rice, cherry, peach, apricot, beet, and spinach).27 Foods inducing symptoms, in decreasing order of their occurrence, were as follows: • Egg • Pork • Onion • Fowl • Milk • Coffee • Citrus • Corn • Beans • Nuts The addition of eggs to the diet caused gallbladder attacks in 93% of the patients. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the associa- tion of food allergy and gallbladder attacks. Breneman believes that the ingestion of allergy-causing substances causes swelling of the bile ducts, resulting in impairment of bile flow from the gallbladder.

## Buckwheat

Buckwheat is a well-known alternative for those avoiding wheat for hypoallergenic purposes. When three groups of eight hamsters were given a buckwheat-, soy-, or casein-based diet, a Japanese research group demonstrated that buckwheat can significantly decrease gall- stone formation and reduce the concentration of cholesterol in the gallbladder, plasma, and liver of hamsters compared with the casein diet.31 Even though soy is a known potent gallstone attenuator itself,32 these researchers found that the positive effects of buckwheat were far stronger than those of soy. Gallstones were clearly visible in all eight hamsters fed the casein diet, whereas two of seven hamsters fed the soy diet (29%) and none of the buckwheat-fed animals had gallstones. Studies in rats have also corroborated these findings.33 Rats consuming high-protein buckwheat flour (PBF) had a 33% decrease in serum cho- lesterol and a significant decrease in liver cholesterol compared with rats consuming casein.34 In addition, consumption of PBF for 10 days significantly suppressed adipose tissue weight and the hepatic activity of fatty acid synthase in rats fed cholesterol-free diets compared with the consumption of casein, and PBF significantly decreased the incidence of cholesterol gallstones and the lithogenic index in mice fed cholester- ol-enriched diets for 37 days. The authors suggest that buckwheat can enhance bile acid synthesis and fecal excretion of steroidal compounds, and PBF has strong activities against hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and gallstone formation. Buckwheat may be useful to treat patients with both high cholesterol and gallstones and may reduce the proliferation of colon cancer cells.35 The authors also postulated that higher levels of arginine and glycine may play a role in buckwheat’s protective function.

## Sugar

A 4-year study evaluated 111 cases of biliary tract cancer and com- pared them with 480 controls for various dietary parameters, including

<!-- chunk -->

## 1334SECTION 6 Diseases

sugar intake. The major finding was an increased risk associated with the intake of sugars, either monosaccharides or disaccharides, inde- pendent of other energy sources. Sugar may be a risk factor for biliary tract cancer based on the relationship among sugars, blood lipids, and gallstone formation. The author also noted an association between the intake of sugar and gallstones. Diets high in refined carbohydrates have been found to be associated with increased cholesterol saturation of the bile.36,37 A 25-year follow-up study of 860 men, 54 of whom developed symptomatic gallstones, also found a positive association between sugar consumption and gallstones.38

<!-- chunk -->

## Caloric Restriction

In a case-controlled study in which 200 patients with gallstones were compared with 98 controls, total caloric and carbohydrate intake and serum triglyceride levels were higher in the patients with gall- stones. Dietary intake of refined carbohydrates was higher in female patients with gallstones, whereas male patients with gallstones had an increased fat intake.39 In another study, 76 patients whose gallstones were detected by ultrasound were matched to control subjects without cholelithiasis. It was found that high caloric intake of greater than kcal/day and diets rich in carbohydrates and saturated fats significantly increased gallstone risk.40 One intriguing note to this study was the finding that alcohol consumption of 20 to 40 g/day was protective. However, caloric restriction must be instituted carefully, because rapid weight loss41 and fasting42 increase the risk of gallstones (see earlier section on obesity). For example, in 179 obese patients, 9% of whom had preexisting gallstones, a low-calorie (605 kcal) diet resulted in 11% of the patients developing gallstones either during or within 6 months of completing the diet.41 Another study of a 925-kcal diet found that 12.8% of the 47 female patients displayed gallstones at week 17 as determined by sonography. Those who developed gallstones had significantly higher baseline triglyceride and total cholesterol levels than those who did not. They also had a significantly greater rate of weight loss.43 A 1-year matched cohort study of consecutively enrolled adults in a commercial weight-loss program using very low-calorie diets (VLCDs) or a low-calorie diet (LCD) assessed the risk of symp- tomatic gallstones requiring hospital care and/or cholecystectomy.44 During the 6361 person-years, 48 and 14 gallstones requiring hospital care occurred in the VLCD and LCD groups, respectively, and of the 62 gallstone events, 38 (61%) resulted in cholecystectomy. Albeit low, the risk of symptomatic gallstones requiring hospitalization or cho- lecystectomy was threefold greater with VLCD than LCD during the 1-year weight-loss program.

## Coffee

Although coffee can promote symptoms of gallstones, it may also inhibit their formation. In one study, 400 mL of regular coffee and mL of regular and decaffeinated coffee were assessed for their effect on cholecystokinin secretion. Regular coffee at both dosages and decaf- feinated coffee caused significant gallbladder contractions compared with the control sodium chloride in six healthy regular coffee drink- ers.45 Another study of 80,898 female nurses between the ages of and 59 years found that drinking four cups of caffeinated coffee per day was associated with a 28% lowered risk of developing symptoms of gallstones. Even one to three cups seemed to have some protective effect.46 Five prospective cohort studies involving 227,749 participants and 11,477 gallstone disease cases found that coffee consumption was significantly associated with a reduced risk of gallstone disease in a dose–response relationship.47 It may be that women who began to drink coffee regularly before or during early gallstone formation were able to either inhibit the development of stones or clear any small stones due to the enhanced gallbladder contractions from multiple daily coffee doses. In women who already have large stones present, increased contractions from coffee may exacerbate their condition and cause untoward symptoms.

## Lecithin (Phosphatidylcholine)

As the main cholesterol solubilizer in bile, lecithin in low concentra- tions may be a causative factor for many individuals with gallstones. For example, a pure bile salt micelle requires 50 molecules to enclose a single molecule of cholesterol, whereas a mixed bile salt/phospho- lipid micelle requires only seven molecules.8 Studies have shown that the ingestion of lecithin can have the direct effect of solubilizing cholesterol.48 As little as 100 mg of lecithin taken three times a day will increase the concentration of lecithin in the bile, whereas larger doses (up to 10 g) produce even greater increases.49,50 This is signif- icant because an increased lecithin content of bile usually increases the solubility of cholesterol. However, no significant effects on gall- stone dissolution have been obtained using lecithin supplementation alone.

## Nutrient Deficiencies

Deficiencies of either vitamin E or C have been shown to cause gall- stones in experimental studies in animals.51,52

<!-- chunk -->

## Olive Oil

A popular lay remedy for gallstones is the olive oil “liver flush.” There are several variations. A typical one involves drinking 1 cup of unre- fined olive oil with the juice of two lemons in the morning for several days. Many people tell tales of passing huge stones while on the liver flush. However, what they think are gallstones are simply soft, saponi- fied complexes of minerals, olive oil, and lemon juice produced within the gastrointestinal tract.53 The olive oil liver flush is undesirable for patients with gallstones for several reasons. First, consuming a large quantity of any oil results in contraction of the gallbladder, which may increase the likelihood that a stone will block the bile duct. This may result in cholecystitis, requiring immediate surgery to prevent death. Second, oleic acid, the main component of olive oil, has been shown to increase the devel- opment of gallstones in rabbits and rats by increasing the content of cholesterol in the gallbladder.54,55 Although this effect has not yet been observed in humans, the animal research suggests that it is unwise to use an olive oil liver flush as a treatment for gallbladder disease.56 This recommendation is not meant to obviate the use of the liver flush as a viable method of liver detoxification. Rather, it is a caution against its use in patients with gallstones.

## Fish Oils

Although human studies appear not to be available at this time, some provocative animal studies exist. For example, one study compared a diet high in lard with a diet high in fish oils in 21 male African green monkeys. One group was fed 0.8 mg cholesterol per kilocalorie and 42% of the calories as fat, with one half of the fat calories derived from lard, whereas the other group was fed a similar diet with an isocaloric substitution of menhaden oil instead of the lard. After 2 to 3 years, necropsies were performed, and it was found that 67% of the animals fed the lard diet had cholesterol gallstones compared with 22% of the animals fed the fish oil. The cholesterol saturation index of the gall- bladder bile was also higher in the lard-fed group, although there was no difference in bile acids. There was a significantly greater rate of bil- iary phospholipid secretion in the fish oil–fed animals compared with the lard-fed animals.57

## 1335CHAPTER 171 Gallstones

A study found similar effects in a prairie dog model using a diet more typical of human habits: 12 animals consumed a standard con- trol diet, whereas 16 consumed a lithogenic 1.2% cholesterol diet. Half the animals in each group were supplemented with 200 mg/kg/day of omega-3 fatty acids from eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids. After 14 days, those fed the diet with added fish oil showed an inhi- bition of gallstone formation accompanied by a significant decrease in biliary calcium and total protein concentration. This antilithogenic effect may be due to an enhancement in the stability of biliary phos- pholipid-cholesterol vesicles.58 In mice, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids attenuated gallstone formation through increasing the levels of bile phospholipids and suppressing bile mucin formation.59

## Lipotropic Factors and Botanical Choleretics

The naturopathic approach to the treatment of gallstones has typically involved the use of lipotropic and choleretic formulas. Lipotropic fac- tors are, by definition, substances that hasten the removal or decrease the deposition of fat in the liver through their interaction with fat metabolism. Compounds commonly employed as lipotropic agents include choline, methionine, betaine, folic acid, and vitamin B 12 . These nutritional factors are often used with herbal cholagogues and choleretics. Cholagogues stimulate gallbladder contraction to pro- mote bile flow, whereas choleretics increase bile secretion by the liver. Many herbal choleretics have a favorable effect on the solubility of bile. Choleretics that are appropriate to use in the treatment of gallstones include Taraxacum officinale, silymarin from Silybum marianum, Cynara scolymus, and Curcuma longa. In addition, Peumus boldo contains alka- loids, such as boldine, that are useful in the treatment of gallstones. One study in rats given a diet that promoted gallstones demon- strated that the animals supplemented with 0.5% dietary curcumin for 10 weeks had only a 26% incidence of gallstone formation compared with a 100% incidence in the group fed the lithogenic diet alone.60 This effect was found to be dose dependent.

## Chemical Dissolution of Gallstones

Several successful nonsurgical alternatives for the treatment of gallstones now exist. These entail using a complex of plant terpenes alone or, pref- erably, in combination with oral bile acids. Because the formation of the stone depends on either increased accumulation of cholesterol or reduced levels of bile acids or lecithin, decreasing gallbladder cholesterol levels or increasing bile acid or lecithin levels should result in the disso- lution of the stone. Chemical dissolution is especially indicated in the treatment of gallstones in the elderly, who cannot withstand the stress of surgery, and in other cases where surgery is contraindicated.

<!-- chunk -->

## Bile Acids

The use of bile acids, such as ursodeoxycholic acid and tauroursode- oxycholic acid, is effective in dissolving small, uncalcified cholesterol gallstones. About 15% of all patients with cholesterol gallstones meet these criteria. Treatment with bile acids will lead to complete dissolu- tion in about 90% of cases after 6 months of therapy. Once dissolved, it is important to follow the recommendations for gallstone prevention to reduce the risk for recurrence. Bile acid preparations are available by prescription only and represent a safe and effective nonsurgical alter- native for many people with gallstones.60,61 The typical dosage is 12 mg per kg body weight daily.

<!-- chunk -->

## Terpenes

Gallstone dissolution by a natural terpene combination of menthol, menthone, pinene, borneol, cineol, and camphene has been demon- strated in several studies.62 This nonsurgical approach to gallstone removal offers an effective alternative to surgery and has been demon- strated to be safe even when it has been implemented for prolonged periods of time (up to 4 years).

<!-- chunk -->

## Combined Therapy

Although terpenes are effective alone, the best results appear to be achieved when plant terpene complexes are used in combination with bile acid therapy.63–65 This combined approach offers better results than either bile acids or plant terpenes used alone.64,65 Furthermore, because a lower dose of bile acid can be used, there is a significant reduction in the risk of complications or side effects and in the cost of bile acid therapy. Because menthol is the major component of this formula, peppermint oil, especially enteric-coated capsules, may offer similar results.


<!-- chunk -->

## Sunbathing

Because most cholesterol gallstones contain a central pigmented nucleus with radial or lamellar pigmented bands alternating with layers of crystalline cholesterol, one researcher speculated that acti- vation of the pigmentary system by ultraviolet light might lead to increased concentrations of indole metabolites in the bile, triggering their polymerization. In a case-controlled study of 206 white-skinned individuals, a positive attitude toward sunbathing was associated with twice the risk of cholelithiasis as a negative attitude. When the effect of sunbathing attitude was considered for individual skin pigmenta- tion types, the association was found to be almost entirely restricted to those who always burn after long sunbathing. In this group, the relative risk was a remarkable 25.6% for a positive attitude toward sunbathing versus a negative one.66

<!-- chunk -->

## Social Stress

Using a fish model, one research experiment examined the effect of stress on the gallbladder function. In this work, fish were subjected to prolonged cohabitation with dominant individuals. It was found that this chronic social stress could increase bile retention, increase gall- bladder hypertrophy, and inhibit gallbladder emptying.67 This study suggests that chronic stress may be a predictor of gallbladder dysfunc- tion and eventual gallstone formation.


As is typical of most diseases, gallstones are much easier to prevent than to reverse. The risk factors and causes of gallstones are well known, and in most cases, a healthy diet rich in fiber, with a limitation of excess calories and saturated fats, is adequate prevention. Once gallstones have developed, measures to avoid gallbladder attacks and increase the solubility of the bile are necessary. To limit the incidence of symptoms, the foods to which an individual is intolerant or allergic must be determined (see Chapter 14) and, along with fatty foods, avoided. The solubility of the bile can be increased by follow- ing the dietary guidelines and using the nutritional and herbal supple- ments recommended here.


Patients should increase their intake of vegetables, fruits, dietary fiber (especially the gel-forming or mucilaginous fibers such as flaxseed, oat bran, guar gum, and pectin), and buckwheat. They should reduce their consumption of saturated fats, refined carbohydrates, cholesterol, sugar, and animal proteins. All fried foods should be avoided. An allergy elimination diet can be used to reduce gallbladder attacks.

pregnancy); medications (e.g., nitrates, calcium channel blockers); foods (e.g., high-fat meals); and voluntary habits like smoking, caffeine, and alcohol (Fig. 172.1). Symptoms may be particularly bad when the individ- ual is lying down. Studies in healthy volunteers have identified reflux epi- sodes during sleep and the postprandial period resulting from an increased number of inappropriate LES relaxations.9 During the night, LES relax- ation and esophageal reflux occurred only during transient arousals from sleep or when the subjects were fully awake but not during stable sleep. Reduced salivation during or immediately before sleep accounts for mark- edly prolonged acid clearance times and increased esophageal acid expo- sure and thus may be a significant causative factor in GERD.10 The process of esophageal acid clearance involves peristalsis as well as the swallowing of bicarbonate and is an important protective mechanism against the development of GERD. Impaired esophageal clearance can be caused by an increase in the volume of the refluxate and occasionally by an underlying condition such as scleroderma. In experimentally induced or spontaneous reflux, patients with GERD have been found to present acid clearance times that are two to three times longer than those of subjects without GERD.11 Hiatal hernia has been shown to be present in ≥ 90% of patients with reflux esophagitis.12 A study assessing the role of hiatal hernia in patients with Barrett’s esophagus found a 2-cm or longer hernia in 96% of the patients and 72% of the patients with short segment Barrett’s esophagus.13 It is unclear if hiatal hernias are an initiating fac- tor in GERD. However, hernias clearly play a role in sustaining GERD, accounting for the chronicity of the disease. A hiatal hernia may act as a reservoir for acid-containing material that is subsequently refluxed into the esophagus when the patient swallows, leading to the delayed acid clearance observed in patients with GERD with hiatal hernia.14 A traditional naturopathic understanding of reflux suggests that hypochlorhydria (i.e., low stomach acid) is a significant etiological factor in the development of GERD. It is hypothesized that food is inadequately broken down and stays in the stomach for longer peri- ods of time, leading to an increase in gastric pressure and reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. In many cases, clinical experience has shown that hydrochloric acid supplementation may benefit rather than aggravate GERD. The ability of the esophageal mucosa to withstand injury is a deter- mining factor in the development of GERD, and the major defense of the epithelium relies solely on the epithelium itself. The epithelial defense consists of three main components: (1) the cell membranes and the intercellular junction complex, which limit the rate of hydro- gen ion penetration into the intercellular space or cell cytosol; (2) the presence of cellular and intercellular buffers (e.g., bicarbonate, pro- teins, phosphate) that neutralize back-diffusing luminal acid; and (3) the presence of cell membrane ion transporters that serve to extrude acid from the cell cytosol when intracellular pH falls to acidic lev- els.15 When aggravating factors, such as alcohol, heat, osmolarity, or smoke-derived chemicals, overwhelm the esophageal defense, mucosal injury occurs. The severity of GERD varies from nonerosive disease to signifi- cant esophageal damage. Barrett’s esophagus, erosive esophagitis, and esophageal carcinoma are severe complications associated with GERD. Endoscopy reveals that most symptomatic patients do not have muco- sal breaks or other esophageal injuries. Therefore the terms “nonero- sive reflux disease” and “functional heartburn” have been introduced to redefine and characterize GERD into separate entities rather than a continuous spectrum.16 Model of GORD Pathogenesis in Adults

## Microbiota

Esophageal inflammation is associated with an altered microbiota in GERD, Barret’s esophagus, eosinophilic esophagitis, and cancer. Despite numerous observations by scientists from the late 19th century describing bacteria in the acidic environment of the stomach, there was a widely held view that the gastric secretions of hydrochloric acid and the proteolytic enzyme pepsin, as well as the reflux of bile acids in the stomach, the thickness of the mucus layer, and the effectiveness of gas- tric peristalsis, ensured a sterile stomach.17 Helicobacter pylori was once believed to be the only species able to colonize the human stomach. H. pylori is the most common chronic infection in the world and disrupts the normal gastric physiology and morphology. Research surrounding H. pylori has increased the understanding of how it can modify its own microclimate, and further investigations with modern techniques have shown that the microbiota of the stomach involves hundreds of phy- lotypes with a microbial density between 101 and 103 colony-forming units (CFU)/g.18 Similar to the rest of the intestinal microbiome. This is a dynamic situation, with significant fluctuations in microbial den- sity resulting from many factors, including ingestion of foods and gastric pH. A study of the bacterial flora of the oral cavity and lower esopha- gus, obtained by esophageal brushings and biopsy samplings, revealed that Streptococcus viridans is the most common bacterium, with an occurrence rate of 95% to 98%.19 The pathogenesis of GERD might be driven by increasing gram-negative bacteria of the esophageal microbiome because lipopolysaccharide upregulates gene expression and increases proinflammatory cytokine production.20 In patients with severe GERD, histological changes have been reported charac- terized by T-lymphocyte–predominant inflammation with hyperpla- sia of papillary and basal cells, suggesting the inflammation may be cytokine mediated rather than the result of the usually attributed acid chemical injury.21 Bacterial diversity decreases with the transition from nonatrophic gastritis to intestinal metaplasia and then to gastric can- cer, with a decrease in the number of Porphyromonas, Neisseria, and Streptococcus sinensis but with a relative increase in Lactobacillus coleo- hominis and Lachnospiraceae.22 Further study into the microbiota of the stomach and esophagus, including exploration of host immunity and dysbiosis of the microbiota, would be especially productive.

## Medications

The use of certain medications can lead to the emergence of GERD and can also exacerbate existing reflux symptoms. For example, the com- bination of calcium channel blockers and warfarin is an independent risk factor for GERD.23 Mechanisms by which drugs cause or aggravate reflux include a reduction in LES pressure, delayed gastric emptying, and inducing/facilitating esophageal inflammation and damage (Table 172.1).24


The diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease based on subjective evaluation symptoms alone can be difficult. Heartburn is a reasonably sensitive symptom for the diagnosis of GERD, although it does not reliably predict esophagitis. In the absence of alarm symptoms, empiric treatment with acid suppression is warranted. Researchers have devel- oped multiple questionnaires to improve the accuracy of GERD diagnosis, but many have limited sensitivity and specificity.25 The dou- ble-contrast barium swallow has a low sensitivity to diagnose GERD but may be beneficial to identify complications of GERD.26 The role of esophageal manometry is limited to accurate placement of a pH-mea- suring device and should not be used to make or confirm a diagnosis of GERD. pH testing has reasonable sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of GERD. The sensitivity of upper endoscopy to diagnose GERD is lower than that of pH tests.27


Most individuals who suffer heartburn and acid reflux self-treat their symptoms, and it is only when the condition becomes intractable or chronic that professional help is sought.28 A variety of over-the- counter products is currently available in the United States and worldwide for the symptomatic treatment of heartburn, acid indiges- tion, and acid reflux disorders. These include numerous liquid and tablet antacid formulations, antacid/alginates, histamine H 2 -receptor antagonists (H 2 RAs), proton-pump inhibitors, and bismuth-contain- ing formulations. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the mainstay of both acute and chronic reflux treatment, and they have a clear advan- tage over H 2 RAs because they can increase gastric pH for as long as 15 to 21 hours compared with 8 hours for H 2 RAs.29 Although these products may be necessary when symptoms persist, most individuals improve with diet and lifestyle changes. Natural medicines are worthy of use before implementing additional pharmaceutical interventions.

## Diet and Lifestyle Factors

Although it is generally recommended to advise lifestyle changes, the evidence for the efficacy of these recommendations in the manage- ment of GERD is mostly anecdotal. Yet many people note symptom aggravation after consuming certain foods, such as chocolate, coffee, alcohol, fatty foods, citrus fruits, spicy foods, and other acidic agents. Considering individual uniqueness, it is prudent to limit recommen- dations to a generally healthy diet and avoidance of (or limited use of) specific food items or activities that, in the experience of the patient, evoke symptoms. Weight reduction is an important goal in the treatment of GERD. A structured weight-loss program can lead to complete resolution of symptoms in most overweight individuals with GERD. A decrease in the body mass index (BMI) of as little as 3.5 kg/m2 has been shown to lead to a nearly 40% reduction in the risk for GERD.30 A prospective cohort

Overall, 81% of the subjects had a reduction in GERD symptom scores, 65% had a complete resolution of reflux symptoms, and 15% had a partial resolution of reflux symptoms.

## Alginates

Alginates are natural polysaccharide polymers isolated from brown seaweed (Phacophycae) and can be classified as dietary fiber. Alginates are block copolymers of L-guluronic and d-mannuronic acid resi- dues connected by 1:4 glycosidic linkages. The relative proportions of d-mannuronic and L-guluronic acids are species dependent and can be influenced by growth conditions (Fig. 172.2). For decades, formulations containing alginate have been marketed worldwide for the symptomatic treatment of heartburn and esophagi- tis. Alginate should be combined with calcium carbonate because both the calcium and carbonate serve essential functions in the beneficial effect. When the alginate formulation reaches the acidic environment of the stomach, the alginate forms a pliable gel. At the same time, the calcium carbonate mixes with gastric acid to produce carbon dioxide bubbles that get trapped in the gel, causing it to float to the top of the stomach contents. The free calcium ions released bind with alginic acid, providing strength to raft formation. The resultant alginate com- plex literally is like a foam raft sitting on top of the stomach contents. Several studies have demonstrated that the alginate raft can preferen- tially move into the esophagus in place, or ahead, of acidic gastric con- tents during episodes of GERD.32 The raft literally acts as a physical barrier to block reflux episodes. The raft-forming process takes less than a minute, and the raft can survive in the stomach for as long as 4 hours.33 As the alginate complex makes its way through the intesti- nal tract, the alginate is partially digested and behaves as other dietary fibers until it is finally passed out of the body. Fourteen human clinical trials and detailed meta-analyses have demonstrated alginate formulations to be a well-proven treatment for GERD. The most recent meta-analysis showed that alginate-based products were clearly more effective than placebo or antacids.34 Pooling the data from these studies produced a high degree of statistical signif- icance (P = .001). Subjects taking alginate were 4.42 times more likely to have complete resolution of their symptoms compared with those taking placebo or antacids. The comparison to stronger acid-blocking medications, such as PPIs and H 2 -receptor antagonists, was less clear and did not reach statistical significance largely because most studies were using alginate in conjunction with a PPI. Table 172.2 summarizes the studies used in the meta-analysis. In one of the more recent double-blind studies, 110 patients with symptoms of GERD were given either alginate chewable tablets or a pla- cebo for 7 consecutive days.35 The primary endpoint compared the change in overall Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ) symptom score (com- bined heartburn/regurgitation/dyspepsia). After 7 days, there was a highly statistically significant greater decrease in overall RDQ symptom score in the alginate group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.0033), as well as a statistically significant greater decrease for each of the symptoms inde- pendently. These results were achieved without any side effects. When comparing alginate with a PPI, it is important to distinguish between the two basic forms of GERD. The first is characterized by erosion of the esophagus (ERD), and the second involves no esophageal erosion (NERD). The differentiation is important because patients with NERD do not respond well to PPIs. Around the world, the NERD form is the most common. Patients suffering from NERD are ideal candidates for alginate therapy. However, even in the erosive form, alginate is effective. In a detailed open-label study that included patients with either ERD or NERD, alginate, given as the only treatment, was found to be “well-tol- erated and effective in reducing heartburn by modifying esophageal acid exposure time, number of acid refluxes and their proximal migration.”36 A double-blind study evaluated the efficacy and safety of algi- nate compared with omeprazole (Prilosec) in 195 adult subjects with NERD.37 Subjects were given either alginate three times a day or ome- prazole once daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving adequate heartburn or regurgitation relief at day 28. Results showed no difference in effectiveness between the two treatments, and although the average symptom score was slightly lower in the alginate group, it was not statistically significant. Considering the confirmed efficacy, remarkable safety profile, and lack of side effects, alginate therapy should be considered as a first-line approach to symptomatic relief. It is also safe for use during pregnancy.

## Melatonin

Melatonin may block the production of nitric oxide synthase, which may help lower the degree of LES relaxation. Melatonin also stimu- lates the production of bicarbonate, which protects against the action of gastric acid production. Several studies suggest melatonin is of therapeutic value in patients with GERD. In one study, 36 individuals with GERD were selected and placed into four groups: control; 3 mg melatonin at bedtime; 20 mg of omeprazole twice daily; and 3 mg of melatonin and 20 mg of omeprazole twice daily for 2 months.38 After 8 weeks, those using

the melatonin alone had a significant reduction in GERD symptoms, increase in LES pressure (i.e., better LES tone), increase in serum gas- trin, a reduction in gastric basal acid output, and an increase in serum melatonin levels. Although omeprazole was also effective in reducing GERD symptoms, it did not significantly alter LES tone. A randomized clinical trial evaluated the effects of 6 mg melatonin plus vitamin B 6 (25 mg), vitamin B 12 (50 mcg), folic acid (10 mg), tryptophan (100 mg), methionine (100 mg), and betaine (100 mg) or 1 capsule (20 mg) omeprazole per day in the evening for 40 days in individuals (141 men, 210 women; mean age 44 years) with at least one episode of moderate to severe heartburn.39 After 40 days, individ- uals using the natural product combination had a 100% reduction in symptoms as measured by a five-point severity scale, compared with a 65.7% reduction in symptoms in the omeprazole group. As an obser- vation, the 34.3% of the subjects who experienced persistence of their GERD symptoms with the use of omeprazole had complete resolution of their symptoms after 40 days with the natural combination of vita- mins, melatonin, and amino acids.

## Limonene

d-limonene is a major constituent of citrus oils and is used as a fra- grance and flavoring agent in a variety of products. Because of its gas- tric acid–neutralizing effect and its support of normal peristalsis, it has been used for relief of heartburn and GERD.40 In a pilot study, patients with GERD or chronic heartburn were given 1000 mg d-lim- onene daily or every other day. After 14 days, 89% of patients reported a complete remission of symptoms. As a follow-up to this pilot study, 13 participants with GERD or chronic heartburn were randomized to 1000 mg d-limonene once daily, 1000 mg d-limonene every other day, or placebo; 29% of participants in the treatment group experienced significant relief by day 4, and 86% experienced complete relief of all symptoms by day 14.41


Demulcent herbs soothe irritated tissue. In the gastrointestinal tract, these substances may help relieve irritation in the esophagus and stom- ach associated with GERD. Botanical medicines that may help include Ulmus fulva, Althea officinalis, Plantago major, Pistacia lentiscus, Aloe vera, and Glycyrrhiza glabra.

## Glycyrrhiza glabra (Licorice)

Licorice has a mucoprotective effect because it stimulates or acceler- ates the differentiation of glandular cells and increases mucus forma- tion and secretion from the gastric mucosa.42 Because glycyrrhizinic acid (GA) has aldosterone-like side effects, a procedure was developed to remove GA from licorice, resulting in deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL). Licorice is also anti-inflammatory and prevents ulcer forma- tion. Clinical studies have demonstrated no significant differences in recurrence rates of symptoms between cimetidine and DGL drug regimens.43 GutsyGum is a chewing gum developed to alleviate the symptoms of GERD that contains calcium carbonate and a propri- etary blend of licorice extract, papain, and apple cider vinegar. A dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study examined the efficacy of GutsyGum in alleviating the symptoms of GERD after a refluxogenic meal compared with placebo gum.44 Although many of the second- ary symptoms, such as pain, nausea, and belching, were lower after GutsyGum, the difference was not statistically significant. However, the primary symptoms of heartburn and acid reflux were significantly lower in GutsyGum than in placebo treatment. The standard dosage for DGL is two to four 380-mg chewable tablets between meals or minutes before meals. DGL therapy should be continued for at least to 16 weeks after a full therapeutic response.

## Althea officinalis (Marshmallow)

Although no clinical trials have investigated the effects of marshmal- low on GERD, marshmallow contains 5% to 10% polysaccharides that provide a soothing and protective barrier on the mucous membranes of the esophagus and stomach, which may provide benefit.

## Ulmus fulva (Slippery elm)

Slippery elm acts as a demulcent that produces a soothing film that extends over mucous membranes as well as acting as an anti-inflam- matory agent. The bark of slippery elm is thought to be responsible for the healing effects due to the high percentage of mucilaginous polysac- charides. It is used to alleviate pain from irritated and inflamed mucosa lining the esophagus and gastrointestinal tract.45

## Pistacia lentiscus (Mastic)

Mastic is a resin obtained from the mastic tree (Pistacia lentiscus). Originally liquid, it is sun-dried into drops of hard, brittle, translu- cent resin. When chewed, the resin softens and becomes a bright white, opaque gum. The flavor is bitter at first, but after chewing, the gum releases a refreshing, slightly piney or cedar flavor. People in the Mediterranean region have used mastic gum as a medicine for gas- trointestinal ailments for several thousand years. Although no human studies are currently available, animal studies have demonstrated that mastic significantly reduced the intensity of gastric mucosal damage induced by pyloric ligation, aspirin, and phenylbutazone.46


Physicians should be judicious in prescribing acid-suppressing med- ications because these medications cause immune dysfunction that persists after discontinuation of the drug.47 The use of PPIs in infants should be closely monitored in the light of changes in the gut micro- biota and the oropharyngeal and respiratory tract colonization, poten- tially with pathogenic flora.

# GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

General therapeutic objectives include symptom relief, reducing the risk of Barrett’s esophagus and cancer, and improving quality of life. Many individuals experience heartburn nocturnally, when recumbent, and elevating the head of the bed to physically reduce gastroesophageal reflux is a standard medical recommendation in these cases. Lying on the left side while sleeping is also recommended because this position appears to alleviate reflux. Smoking and alcohol should be eliminated. An exercise program may be implemented, as physical activity has some protective effect.48


Foods that precipitate attacks or aggravate symptoms should be identi- fied and eliminated. The evening meal should be consumed 2-3 hours before retiring, as going to bed with a full stomach increases the likeli- hood of reflux. Overeating causes the stomach to distend, which may also increase symptoms. If necessary, a weight-reduction program may be implemented.


• Alginate preparations are available as liquids and chewable tablets. The general recommendation is that the formula should provide a dosage of 500 to 1000 mg of alginate. The preparation is to be taken after meals and at nighttime as needed up to four times daily. For nighttime use, it is recommended to take 30 minutes before bed- time and avoid lying down for 30 minutes.

in the United States. Because elevated IOP is not a factor in normal- tension glaucoma, other factors must be responsible for the optic nerve damage. Suggested causes include: • Reduced blood flow • Early nerve cell death • Nerve irritation • Excess glutamate production • Autoimmune disease Normotensive glaucoma is more common in women than in men and affects adults averaging 60 years of age. A common risk factor for normotensive glaucoma is low blood pressure.

## Toxic Metals

Toxic metals, such as lead, are known to increase the risk of hyperten- sion by multiple mechanisms, including renal and oxidative damage, reducing available nitric oxide, and increasing circulating vasoconstric- tive prostaglandins. It has been hypothesized that toxic metals in the blood may accumulate in the eyes, which may result in the elevation of intraocular pressure.3 A study evaluating the relationship between toxic metals and intraocular pressure found that blood lead and blood mercury levels were associated with a 14% to 21% increase in IOP.4 A cross-sectional study of 5198 participants older than 19 years of age examined the association between toxic metal levels and open-angle glaucoma (OAG) with low- and high-teen baseline intraocular pres- sure.5 After adjusting for potential confounders, the low-teen OAG was positively associated with log-transformed blood cadmium levels (odds ratio [OR] = 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03–1.93). However, in this study, blood lead and blood mercury were not asso- ciated with disease prevalence. Although further studies are needed to better assess the significance of toxic metals in glaucoma, the toxic metal body load should be explored as a potential contributing factor in patients with IOP.


Patients with OAG initially have no symptoms, which is why this dis- ease can be so insidious. Physical examination may reveal slight cup- ping of the optic disc and narrowing of the visual fields (Fig. 173.1). Tonometry is key to confirmation of the diagnosis. The primary challenge with acute glaucoma is early recognition because a delay in referral for surgical intervention increases the risk of blindness. Table 173.1 provides an overview of the differential diagno- sis of the inflamed eye.


Treatment and prevention of both acute and chronic glaucoma depend on the reduction of IOP and improvement of collagen metabolism, particularly in the optic disc and trabecular meshwork. The optic disc is composed of the lamina cribrosa, optic nerve fibers, and blood vessels. The lamina cribrosa is a meshlike network rich in collagen through which the optic nerves and blood vessels must pass (Fig. 173.2). The morphological changes in the collagen of the eye (i.e., lamina cribrosa, papillary vessels, and trabecular meshwork) precede pressure changes. Therefore primary prevention of the break- down of the ground substance and collagen framework is important here, as it is in other conditions involving collagen abnormalities (i.e., atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and periodontal disease).

## Corticosteroids

The importance of collagen destruction in the etiology of glaucoma is apparent in corticosteroid-induced glaucoma.2 Corticosteroid use should be discouraged in the patient with glaucoma because it is known to inhibit the biosynthesis of collagen and glycosaminoglycans, thereby worsening the patient’s glaucoma.2

## Diet, Supplements, Botanicals, and Lifestyle


Of foremost importance in achieving collagen integrity are optimal tissue concentrations of ascorbic acid (AA). Furthermore, AA has been demonstrated to lower IOP levels in many clinical studies.6–9 A daily dose of 0.5 g/kg, whether in single or divided doses, reduces the IOP by an average of 16 mm Hg.9 Near-normal tension levels were achieved in some patients unresponsive to acetazolamide (a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) and 2% pilocarpine (a miotic agent).10 Note, however, that oral supplementation at this dosage will likely cause osmotic diarrhea. The hypotonic action of AA on the eye is long-lasting if supple- mentation is continued, and intravenous administration results in an even greater initial reduction in IOP. The patient must be monitored to determine the appropriate individual dose because some patients respond to as little as 2 g/day, whereas others will respond only to extremely high doses (e.g., 35 g/day). Abdominal discomfort as a side effect of high doses is common but usually resolves after 3 to 4 days.9 The proposed mechanisms by which AA lowers IOP include the following: • Increased blood osmolarity • Diminished production of aqueous fluid by the ciliary epithelium • Improved outflow of aqueous fluid However, the role of AA in collagen formation may be the key to its antiglaucomatous action.

## Flavonoids

To further aid normal collagen metabolism, flavonoids should be supplemented, particularly anthocyanosides (the blue-red pigments found in berries) and proanthocyanosides. These compounds elicit an AA-sparing effect, improve capillary integrity, and stabilize the collagen matrix by preventing free radical damage, inhibiting enzymatic cleavage of the collagen matrix, and cross-linking with collagen fibers directly to form a more stable collagen matrix.11Vaccinium myrtillus (European bil- berry) extract is particularly rich in these flavonoid and anthocyanidin compounds and has been used in Europe, with good results in reducing myopia, improving nocturnal vision, and reversing diabetic retinopathy.

## 1346SECTION 6 Diseases

Mirtogenol, a combination of bilberry anthocyanoside extract (160 mg Mirtoselect) and pine bark extract (80 mg Pycnogenol), was studied in asymptomatic subjects with intraocular hypertension. Patients were given either Mirtogenol (20 subjects) or were not treated (18 subjects). After months of supplementation with Mirtogenol, the mean IOP decreased from a baseline of 25.2 to 22.2 mm Hg. After 3 months of treatment with Mirtogenol, the IOP was significantly lowered compared with that of untreated controls (P < 0.05) to 22 mm Hg. No further improvement was found after 6 months. Of the 20 patients taking Mirtogenol, 19 had a decreased IOP after 3 months. Only marginal effects on the IOP were found in the 18 control subjects. No side effects were observed. Ocular blood flow (central retinal, ophthalmic, and posterior ciliary arteries) improved both in the systolic and diastolic components as measured by ultrasound. After 3 months of treatment, the improvement in ocular blood flow was significant compared with both baseline and the control group.10 Rutin has also been demonstrated to lower IOP when used as an adjunct in patients unresponsive to miotics alone.12 In patients with normotensive glaucoma (NTG), Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) may be helpful, based on the results of two double-blind studies. In the first study, which comprised healthy human volunteers, GBE (120 mg daily) significantly increased end-diastolic velocity in the ophthalmic artery (23% change), with no change in the placebo group. GBE did not alter arterial blood pressure, heart rate, or IOP.13 In the second study, patients with NTG received either 40 mg GBE or pla- cebo three times daily for 4 weeks, followed by a washout period of weeks, then 4 weeks of the opposite treatment.

## Allergen Avoidance

The successful treatment of chronic glaucoma by antiallergy measures has been reported in the literature.15 In one study, many of the patients demonstrated an immediate rise in IOP of up to 20 mm Hg (in addition to other typical allergic symptoms) when challenged with the appropriate allergen, whether foodborne or environmental. The author speculated that the known allergic responses of altered vascular permeability and vasospasm could result in the congestion and edema characteristic of glaucoma.


Because channel-blocking drugs benefit some glaucoma patients, a group of researchers at the University Eye Clinic in Basel, Switzerland, decided to evaluate the effect of supplemental magnesium, which has been referred to as “nature’s physiological calcium-channel blocker.” The trial included 10 glaucoma patients (6 with primary open-angle glaucoma and 4 with normal-tension glaucoma). All patients had dig- ital cold-induced vasospasm. Magnesium was given at a dose of 121.5 mg twice daily for 1 month. After 4 weeks of treatment, the visual fields improved, as noted by a decrease in the mean defect and square root of loss variance scores. All three nail fold–capillaroscopic parameters improved, as well as digital temperature. These results demonstrate that magnesium supplementation improves the peripheral circulation and seems to have a beneficial effect on the visual field in patients with glaucoma.16 To evaluate the effect of oral magnesium therapy on ocular blood flow and visual field perimetry indices in patients with normotensive glaucoma (NTG), 15 patients with NTG (the study group) received 300 mg of oral magnesium (citrate) for 1 month, whereas 15 patients with NTG (the control group) received no treatment. In the study group, significant improvements were noted in visual field measure- ments (e.g., mean deviation improved from –3.7 at baseline to –2.5 and pattern standard deviation improved from 3.6 baseline to 2.8). There was no change in ocular blood flow, so the exact mechanism of magnesium’s effect is not known.17

## Chromium

A case-controlled study of 400 consecutive eye patients, 52 of whom had ocular hypertension glaucoma, or both, found that primary open-angle glaucoma was strongly associated with a deficiency of erythrocyte chromium and average daily intake of ascorbic acid, and elevations of erythrocyte vanadium, which is chromium’s principal antagonist. Ascorbic acid and chromium potentiate insulin receptors, which help sustain strong focusing activity in the ciliary muscle. Deficiencies of either ascorbic acid or chromium were associated with elevated intraocular pressure, which tends to stretch the normal eye, thereby reducing focusing power.18

## Fish Oil

In an interesting exploratory study, rabbits were fed food soaked with cod liver oil, resulting in a drop in IOP from 25 to 11 mm Hg. Intramuscular injections of cod liver oil produced a dose-dependent reduction in IOP. When the animals were taken off cod liver oil, their IOP returned to baseline. Control animals given liquid lard or safflower oil experienced no change in IOP.19 Preliminary studies in humans with docosahexaenoic acid have had encouraging results.20

## Caffeine

Many physicians instruct patients with glaucoma to avoid coffee, although clinical data supporting this practice are insufficient. To estimate the effect of coffee drinking on IOP, the effects of the con- sumption of regular coffee (180 mg caffeine in 200 mL of coffee) and decaffeinated coffee (3.6 mg caffeine in 200 mL of coffee) were com- pared in patients with normotensive glaucoma or ocular hypertension in a double-blind crossover study. IOP was monitored in both groups at 30, 60, and 90 minutes after coffee ingestion. In patients with nor- motensive glaucoma who drank regular caffeine-containing coffee, the mean changes in IOP at 30, 60, and 90 minutes were 0.9, 3.6, and 2.3 mm Hg, respectively; in those who drank decaffeinated coffee, they were 0.75, 0.70, and 0.4 mm Hg, respectively. The corresponding val- ues in patients with ocular hypertension were as follows: after regular coffee, 1.1, 3.4, and 3 mm Hg; and after decaffeinated coffee, 0.6, 0.9, and 0.5 mm Hg, respectively. This study showed clearly that subjects who drank regular coffee experienced a greater elevation in IOP, which may be clinically significant.21


Exercise can lead to an immediate and prolonged reduction in IOP. Within 5 minutes of starting exercise, IOP initially increases and then gradually decreases to its lowest level 60 minutes after exer- cise. The drop in IOP is approximately 23% in normal individuals, whereas people with glaucoma usually experience a greater drop and longer duration of postexercise recovery than do those with normal eyes.22 Specifically, the drop in IOP for glaucoma patients after walking/jogging and running was 7.2% and 12.7%, respec- tively, more than the decrease in IOP experienced by persons with normal eyes. Similarly, the mean duration of the IOP-lowering effect after running was approximately 84 minutes in glaucomatous eyes and 63 minutes in normal eyes. The mechanism of acute low- ering of IOP is independent of systemic blood pressure and level of sympathetic stimulation but may be partly due to increased serum osmolarity. Exercise appears to be effective in lowering IOP in sedentary sub- jects engaging in moderate to heavy exercise but is somewhat less effec- tive in physically fit subjects.23 However, individuals who are more physically fit tend to have lower IOP. If one stops exercising, the effect wears off in 3 weeks. Although exercise may not be effective in lower- ing IOP in everyone, it can lead to significant improvements in many. One study found that IOP was lowered by at least 2 mm Hg by exercise in 34% of subjects; however, 57% had no change in IOP, whereas 9% had an IOP elevation.24

## Coleus forskohlii

In clinical studies, forskolin from Coleus forskohlii was shown to greatly reduce IOP when it was applied directly to the eyes (see Chapter 69, Coleus forskohlii). Oral administration might prove effective as well. In an open-label pilot study, 16 patients with OAG and stable IOP under- went treatment with different topical drugs and were given a supple- ment containing 15 mg of forskolin along with rutin (200 mg), thiamin (0.7 mg), and riboflavin (0.8 mg) for 40 days, which produced a further decrease in IOP by roughly 20% of the initial value.25,26

## Helicobacter pylori

Several studies have found an association between Helicobacter pylori infection and OAG.26 A particularly interesting 2-year study found that successful eradication of H. pylori resulted in decreased IOP.27 See Chapter 198 for a discussion of the treatment of H. pylori.

Acute closed-angle glaucoma is an ocular emergency; such patients should be referred immediately to an ophthalmologist or emergency room. Unless adequately treated within 12 to 48 hours, the patient will become permanently blind within 2 to 5 days. An asymptomatic eye with a narrow anterior chamber angle may convert spontaneously to angle-closure glaucoma. The process can be precipitated by anything that dilates the pupil, such as atropine and epinephrine-like drugs. Typical signs and symptoms include extreme pain; blurring of vision; conjunctivitis; and a fixed, dilated pupil. Agents that dilate the pupils must be strictly avoided in any patient suspected of having glaucoma.


All patients who are sedentary should be advised to exercise. However, their IOP must be regularly monitored to determine whether they are in the small percentage that will experience an elevation in IOP.


• Vitamin C: 0.1 to 0.5 g/kg per day in divided doses • Bioflavonoids (mixed): 1000 mg/day • Magnesium: 300 mg/day • Chromium: 100 mcg/day


For the prevention and treatment of chronic open-angle glaucoma, either bilberry extract or a proanthocyanoside extract, alone or in com- bination, is indicated as follows: • V. myrtillus extract (25% anthocyanidin content): 160 to 240 mg a day • Pine bark extract (Pycnogenol) or grape seed extract (95% proan- thocyanidin content): 150 to 300 mg a day For normotensive glaucoma: • Ginkgo biloba extract: 120 to 320 mg a day For open-angle glaucoma: • C. forskohlii: • Forskolin: 5 to 10 mg two to three times a day • Standardized extract (10% forskolin): 250 mg one to two times a day

## 1350SECTION 6 Diseases

Uric acid is a highly insoluble molecule; at pH 7.4 and body tem- perature, the serum is saturated at 6.4 to 7 mg/100 mL. Although higher concentrations do not necessarily result in urate deposition (some unknown factor in serum appears to inhibit urate precipita- tion), the chance of an acute attack is greater than 90% when the level is above 9 mg/100 mL (Table 174.1). Lower temperatures decrease the saturation point of uric acid, which may explain why urate deposits tend to form in areas such as the pinna of the ear, where the tempera- ture is lower than the mean body temperature (Table 174.2). Uric acid is insoluble below pH 6 and can precipitate as the urine is concentrated in the collecting ducts and passed to the renal pelvis.

## Signs and Symptoms

The first attack of gout is characterized by intense pain, usually involving only one joint. The first joint of the big toe is affected in nearly one half of the first attacks and is at some time involved in more than 90% of individ- uals with gout. If the attack progresses, fever and chills will appear. The first attacks usually occur at night and are generally preceded by a specific event, such as dietary excess, alcohol ingestion, trauma, certain drugs, or surgery. The classic description of gout was offered in 1683 by Sydenham, an English physician who suffered from gout. Little has changed in the clinical picture of gout in more than 300 years. Sydenham’s classic description is as follows: The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About two o’clock in the morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; Phosphoribosylamine Isoninic acidXanthylic acidAdenylosuccinic acidAMPBody constitutents GMPBody Constituents GuanineHypoxanthine Xanthine Uric acid Adenine Glycine Formate CO 2 Glutamine Aspartate ATP Aminotransferase Feedback inhibition Feedback inhibition Xanthine oxidase Xanthine oxidase HGPRT salvage pathway HGPRT salvage pathway

more rarely in the heel, ankle, or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation, and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers, and a little fever. The pain which at first was moderate, becomes more intense. With its inten- sity the chills and fever increase. After a time this comes to a height, accommodating itself to the bones and ligaments of the tarsus and metatarsus. Now it is a violent stretching and tearing of the liga- ments—now it is a gnawing pain and now a pressure and tight- ening. So exquisite and lively meanwhile is the feeling of the part affected, that it cannot bear the weight of bedclothes nor the jar of a person walking in the room. The night is passed in torture, sleep- lessness, turning the part affected, and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of the body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint, and being worse as the fit comes on. Hence the vain effort by change of posture, both in the body and the limb affected, to obtain an abatement of pain. Subsequent attacks are common, with the majority of such indi- viduals having another attack within 1 year. However, nearly 7% never have a second attack. Chronic gout rarely is an issue, owing to the advent of dietary therapy and drugs that lower uric acid levels. When it does occur, chronic gout is due to poor compliance or inadequate response to treatment, or it may arise in patients with high flare fre- quency, tophi, and the inability to maintain serum urate levels below 6 mg/dL.2 Some degree of kidney dysfunction occurs in nearly 90% of subjects with gout, and there is a higher risk of kidney stones.


The current standard medical treatment of acute gout is the admin- istration of colchicine, the anti-inflammatory drug originally isolated from the plant Colchicum autumnale (autumn crocus, meadow saf- fron). Colchicine has no effect on uric acid levels; rather, it stops the inflammatory process by inhibiting neutrophil migration into areas of inflammation. More than 75% of patients with gout show a major improvement in symptoms within the first 12 hours after receiving colchicine. However, up to 80% of patients are unable to tolerate an optimal dose because of gastrointestinal side effects, which may precede or coincide with clinical improvement. Colchicine may also cause bone marrow depression, hair loss, liver damage, depression, seizures, respiratory depression, and even death. Other anti-inflammatory agents are also used in acute gout, including various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), indometha- cin, phenylbutazone, naproxen, and fenoprofen. Once the acute episode has resolved, a number of measures are taken to reduce the likelihood of recurrence: • Drugs like allopurinol or febuxostat to keep uric acid levels within a normal range • Controlled weight loss in obese individuals • Avoidance of known precipitating factors, such as heavy alcohol consumption or a diet rich in purines or refined carbohydrates • Low doses of colchicine to prevent further acute attacks Several dietary factors are known to cause gout: consumption of alcohol, especially beer and hard liquor; foods high in purine content (e.g., organ meats, meat, yeast, poultry); fats; refined carbohydrates, especially high-fructose corn syrup; and overconsumption of calories.5 Individuals with gout are typically obese; they are prone to hyperten- sion, the metabolic syndrome, and diabetes and are at a greater risk for cardiovascular disease. Obesity is probably the most important dietary factor. Thiazide and loop diuretics are also associated with a higher risk of incident gout and a higher rate of gout flares.5 In concept, the naturopathic approach for chronic gout does not differ substantially from the standard medical approach. However, naturopaths focus on dietary and herbal measures to keep uric acid levels within the normal range rather than on the use of drugs. In the conventional medical treatment of gout, drugs that inhibit xanthine oxidase are too often relied upon. Allopurinol, a structural isomer of hypoxanthine (a naturally occurring purine in the body), has been the mainstay treatment for decades. However, in February 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved febuxostat (Uloric), another xanthine oxidase inhibitor; it is a more effective treatment for lowering and maintaining serum urate levels.6 Febuxostat is beginning to sup- plant allopurinol in the conventional management of gout. Uricosuric agents (probenecid, sulfinpyrazone, and benzbromarone) are used as second-line therapy for patients with underexcretion of uric acid.

## Xenobiotics

The risk of hyperuricemia is increased in subjects with higher serum concentrations of organochlorine (OC) pesticides, polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).7 Chronic low-level arsenic exposure is associated with hyper- uricemia and gout. In men, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for hyper- uricemia comparing highest to lowest quartiles of total arsenic was 1.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26–2.68), and in women, the OR was 1.26 (95% CI, 0.77–2.07).8 Serum uric acid increases in propor- tion to body load of perfluorinated hydrocarbons (PFOA and PFOS).9 Interestingly, low levels of PFOA or PFOS show little effect initially and then rapid elevation of uric acid levels. An additional item of concern relates to lead toxicity. A second- ary type of gout, sometimes called saturnine gout, can result from lead toxicity. Historically, saturnine gout was due to the consumption of alcoholic beverages stored in containers with lead in them. An unex- pected and fairly common source of lead appears to be leaded crys- tal because port wine elutes lead when stored in a crystal decanter.10 Lead concentration increases with storage time, reaching toxic levels

after several months. Even a few minutes in a crystal glass results in a measurable increase in the level of lead in the wine. Lead promotes hyperuricemia as a result of decreasing renal urate excretion. Among patients in the highest blood lead level (BLL) quartile (mean, 3.95 μ g/dL), the prevalence of gout was 6.05% (95% CI, 4.49%–7.62%) compared with 1.76% (CI, 1.10%–2.42%) among those in the lowest quartile (mean, 0.89 μ g/dL).11 Each doubling of BLL was associated with an unadjusted OR of 1.74 (CI, 1.47–2.05) for gout and 1.25 (CI, 1.12–1.40) for hyperuricemia.

## Dietary Considerations

The dietary treatment of gout involves the following guidelines: • Elimination of alcohol intake • Low purine intake • Achievement of ideal body weight • Liberal consumption of complex carbohydrates • Low fat intake • Low protein intake • Liberal fluid intake

<!-- chunk -->

## Alcohol

Alcohol increases uric acid production by accelerating purine nucle- otide degradation; it also reduces uric acid excretion by increasing lactate production (a result of ethanol oxidation), which impairs kid- ney function. The net effect is a significant increase in serum uric acid levels. This explains why alcohol consumption is often a precipitat- ing factor in acute attacks of gout. Using a 24-hour diet recall, beer consumption was significantly associated with hyperuricemia, with an adjusted OR of 1.28 for men who consumed five or more cans of beer daily compared with those who did not drink.12 In many individuals, the elimination of alcohol is all that is necessary to reduce uric acid levels and prevent gouty arthritis.

## Low-Purine Alkaline-Ash Diet

A low-purine diet has been the mainstay of the dietary therapy of gout for many years. However, with the advent of potent drugs that lower uric acid levels, many physicians lower serum urate levels with- out subjecting the patient to the inconvenience and deprivation asso- ciated with a purine-free diet. However, dietary restriction of purines is recommended to reduce metabolic stress. Foods with high purine levels should be entirely omitted. These include organ meats, meats, shellfish, yeast (brewer’s and baker’s), herring, sardines, mackerel, and anchovies. Foods with moderate levels of protein should be curtailed as well. These include dried legumes, spinach, asparagus, fish, poultry, and mushrooms. In an analysis of 1247 recurrent gout attacks occurring over a 1-year period in 633 participants, the mul- tivariate OR for recurrent gout attacks for each increasing quintile of purine consumption were 1.17 (95% CI 0.88, 1.55). 1.38 (95% CI 1.02, 1.87), 2.21 (95% CI 1.62, 3.01), and 4.76 (95% CI 3.37, 6.74), respectively.13 An alkaline-ash diet is recommended in the dietary treatment of gout because a more alkaline pH increases uric acid solubility. An alka- line-ash diet was shown to increase uric acid excretion from 302 mg/ day at pH 5.9 to 413 mg/day at pH 6.5.14

<!-- chunk -->

## Weight Reduction

Excess weight is associated with an increased rate of gout. Weight reduction in obese individuals significantly reduces levels of serum uric acid levels.15 Weight reduction should involve the use of a low-glycemic diet designed to improve insulin sensitivity. Such a diet also helps manage the elevated cholesterol and triglycerides that are common in obesity.

<!-- chunk -->

## Carbohydrates, Fats, and Protein

Refined carbohydrates and saturated fats should be kept to a mini- mum because the former increases uric acid production, whereas the latter increases uric acid retention. In addition, one of the key dietary goals in the treatment of gout appears to be the enhancement of insu- lin sensitivity.15 Acute and hypercaloric ingestion of fructose raises serum urate levels via the unregulated phosphorylation of fructose by fructokinase, leading to local ATP depletion and increased AMP pro- duction. Exposure to two or more sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) per day is associated with a 1.78-fold increased risk of gout in men and a 3.05-fold increased risk in women.16,17 Fructose consumption is associated with an increased risk of gout (relative risk [RR] = 1.62, 95% CI, 1.28–2.03) when comparing the highest and lowest quantiles of consumption.18 Protein intake should not be excessive (i.e., >0.8 g/kg per day) because it has been shown that uric acid synthesis may be accelerated in both normal and gouty patients by a high protein intake. After adjusting for confounders, men in the highest quintiles of total meat and seafood intake have an increased risk of incident gout of 41% and 51%, respectfully.19 Adequate protein is necessary (0.8 g/kg daily). However, amino acids decrease the resorption of uric acid in the renal tubules, thus increasing uric acid excretion and reducing serum uric acid concentrations.

## Fluid Intake

Liberal fluid intake keeps the urine dilute and promotes the excretion of uric acid. Furthermore, dilution of the urine reduces the risk of kid- ney stones.


<!-- chunk -->

## Eicosapentaenoic Acid

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) supplementation may prove useful in the treatment of gout. EPA limits the production of the proinflammatory leukotrienes, the mediators of much of the inflammation and tissue damage observed in gout.

<!-- chunk -->

## Folic Acid

Folic acid has been shown to inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for producing uric acid.20 Research has demonstrated that a derivative of folic acid is an even greater inhibitor of xanthine oxi- dase than allopurinol, suggesting that folic acid at pharmacological doses may be an effective treatment for gout.21 Positive results in the treatment of gout have been reported, but the data are incomplete and uncontrolled.22

<!-- chunk -->

## Quercetin

The bioflavonoid quercetin has demonstrated several effects in exper- imental studies, indicating its possible benefit to individuals with gout.23,24 Quercetin may offer significant protection by inhibiting the following: • Xanthine oxidase in a similar fashion to the drug allopurinol25 • Leukotriene synthesis and release • Neutrophil accumulation and enzyme release One clinical study evaluated the effect of 4 weeks of oral supplemen- tation of quercetin on plasma uric acid levels.24 Twenty-two healthy males (19–60 years) with baseline plasma uric acid concentration in the higher, but still considered healthy, range (339 (SD 51) μ mol/l) were enrolled in the randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. The intervention included one tablet containing mg quercetin daily for 4 weeks, compared with placebo, with a 4-week washout period between treatments. After quercetin treatment, plasma

uric acid concentrations were significantly lowered by –26•5 μ mol/l (95% CI, –7•6, –45•5; P = 0.008). These results are quite promising and indicate a possible preventive effect against recurrent gout attacks. For more information on the pharmacology of quercetin, see Chapter 81.


Megadoses of vitamin C are probably contraindicated in individuals with gout because vitamin C may increase uric acid levels in a small number of individuals. A single large dose (4 gm) of vitamin C resulted in a significant increase in urate excretion, but no change in the serum urate concentration, in 10 patients (5 with gout).25 Although there are reports that moderate dosages of vitamin C may lower serum uric acid levels by increasing uric acid excretion, neither effect was seen in patients with gout taking vitamin C at a dosage of 500 mg/day. No clinically significant effect was seen on either measurement in either patients taking allopurinol or not.26

<!-- chunk -->

## Niacin

High doses of niacin (i.e., above 50 mg/day) are probably contraindi- cated in the treatment of gout because niacin competes with uric acid for excretion.27


<!-- chunk -->

## Cherries

Consuming one-half pound of fresh or canned cherries per day has been long recommended in lowering uric acid levels and preventing attacks of gout based upon historical use and early clinical investi- gation. In a more recent analysis to assess this use, a study was con- ducted by researchers from the Boston University School of Medicine in 633 people with gout who were recruited and followed online for a year. Participants answered questions about gout onset, symptoms, risk factors, medications, and whether they ate cherries or took cherry extract, and for how long. When the researchers analyzed the partici- pant responses, they found that cherry intake (defined as one-half cup or 10–12 cherries or the equivalent in extract form) over a 2-day period was associated with a 35% lower risk for gout attacks and that cherry extract intake was associated with a 45% lower risk. The risk for gout attacks was reduced by 75% when cherry intake was combined with allopurinol. These benefits persisted even after taking into account fac- tors that can affect gout risk, such as gender, obesity, purine intake (in foods that can increase gout risk), plus the use of alcohol, diuretics, and antigout medications.28 These results are consistent with a series of pilot studies conducted by one group of researchers using a cherry juice concentrate.29 In the first randomized controlled trial (RCT), presented in 2007, patients with gout experienced a significant decrease in the number of acute gout attacks within 4 months of initiating ingestion of the cherry juice concentrate (P < 0.05), an effect that was not seen in the control group ingesting pomegranate juice concentrate. Of patients ingesting cherry juice concentrate, 55% were attack-free and stopped their regular intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs within 60 days of ini- tiating consumption of cherry juice concentrate. None of the patients in the group ingesting pomegranate juice discontinued any of their medications. Similar results were shown in the three other trials, lead- ing the researchers to conclude “Our studies suggest that cherry juice concentrate reduces acute attacks of gout when it is consumed over a period of 4 months.”30 Although some studies have not shown an effect on serum urate lev- els, one study showed a clear effect on urate metabolism. Researchers measured plasma urate, antioxidant, and inflammatory markers in healthy women who consumed two servings (280 g) of cherries after an overnight fast.31 Blood and urine samples were taken before the cherry dose and at 1.5, 3, and 5 hours afterward. Plasma urate decreased hours after the cherry consumption by an average of 30 mmol/L. This reduction correlated with an increase in urine urate excretion. Plasma C-reactive protein and nitric oxide concentrations decreased slightly after the 3-hour mark. Cherries, hawthorn berries, blueberries, and other dark red and blue berries are rich sources of anthocyanidins and proanthocyanidins. These compounds are flavonoid molecules, which give these fruits their deep red-blue color, and are remarkable in their ability to prevent collagen destruction. Anthocyanidins and other flavonoids affect col- lagen metabolism in many ways: • They have the unique ability to actually cross-link collagen fibers, resulting in reinforcement of the natural cross-linking of collagen that forms the collagen matrix of connective tissue (e.g., ground substance, cartilage, tendon). • They prevent free radical damage through their potent antioxidant and free-radical–scavenging action. • They inhibit enzymatic cleavage of collagen from enzymes secreted by leukocytes during inflammation. • They prevent the release and synthesis of compounds that promote inflammation, such as histamine, serine proteases, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes.

## Zingiber officinalis (Ginger)

Ginger has important anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties (see Chapter 130, Zingiber officinale (Ginger)). In a study involving mono- sodium urate crystal-induced joint inflammation in mice, adminis- tration of 6-shogaol, an isolated active principle from ginger, reduced lysosomal enzymes, reduced lipid peroxidation, and decreased the activity of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α ).32


As stated earlier, the naturopathic approach to the prevention and treatment of gout does not differ substantially from the standard med- ical approach. The basic approach involves the following: • Dietary and herbal measures that maintain uric acid levels within the normal range • Controlled weight loss in obese individuals • Avoidance of known precipitating factors (e.g., heavy alcohol con- sumption and a high-purine diet) • The use of nutritional substances to prevent further acute attacks • The use of herbal and nutritional substances to inhibit the inflam- matory process


Patients should be advised to eliminate alcohol intake, maintain a low-purine diet, increase consumption of complex carbohydrates, decrease consumption of simple carbohydrates, maintain a low-fat intake, optimize protein intake (0.8 g/kg daily), and consume liberal quantities of fluid. Urinary 24-hour uric acid levels can be used to monitor compliance with a purine-free diet (maintained below 0.8 g/ day). In addition, liberal amounts (250–500 g/day) of cherries, blue- berries, and other anthocyanoside-rich (i.e., red-blue) berries (or extracts), should be consumed.


• Fish oils: 3000 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) per day • Folic acid: 1 to 4 mg/day

men (and presumably women) with male-pattern baldness.7 This appears to be due to lower levels of glutathione. The use of gluta- thione-sparing antioxidants like vitamin C and flavonoids seems appropriate. Saw palmetto extract is a popular recommendation for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Its effects in BPH occur via several mech- anisms, including an ability to inhibit the formation and transport of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This potent androgen is formed from testosterone by the action of the enzyme 5- α -reductase. The activ- ity of this enzyme is increased in BPH, as well as in both male- and female-pattern baldness.8 Saw palmetto extract may offer some ben- efit in androgen-related alopecia by reducing the formation of DHT. This is the same mechanism as the drug finasteride (Propecia), which is often used in the treatment of female-pattern hair loss.11 Saw palmetto extract also inhibits the transport of DHT to nuclear receptor sites and therefore may prove even more useful. The dosage for the extract stan- dardized to contain 85% to 95% fatty acids and sterols is 320 mg/day.

## Drug-Induced Hair Loss

A long list of drugs can cause hair loss, but it should not be assumed that simply because a woman is complaining of hair loss and taking one of these drugs that the drug is the single cause. Some drugs, most notably chemotherapy agents like fluorouracil, are certainly causative because they are such powerful inhibitors of hair growth. When med- ically appropriate, natural alternatives to the suspected drug or drugs should be employed (Table 175.1).

## Nutritional Deficiency

A deficiency of any number of nutrients can lead to significant hair loss. Deficiency of vitamin C manifests as scurvy and can present with corkscrew hairs.12 Telogen effluvium and alopecia areata have been associated with deficiencies of iron and zinc,13,14 and generalized hair loss occurs in conjunc- tion with deficiencies in selenium, iron, biotin, and essential fatty acids.15 In addition, serum vitamin D and folate levels tend to be lower in patients with alopecia areata compared with controls.16 The patient’s nails should be examined for the characteristic white lines indicating poor wound healing of the nail bed even with the most minor of trauma, which may be a sign of a low zinc level. The backs of the arms should be examined for hyperkeratosis, a common sign of vitamin A deficiency. The skin of the elbows and general health of the skin should also be evaluated, looking for the dry skin associated with a deficiency of essential fatty acids. To determine iron status, a serum ferritin evaluation is recommended. In evaluating serum ferritin levels, it is important to know that many reference laboratories report low ferritin levels (e.g., 10–30 mg/L) to be within the normal range. If the serum ferritin is less than 30 mg/L, iron replacement is indicated. When serum ferritin levels fall below this, hair growth and regeneration are impaired because the body seeks to conserve the remaining iron.17 There is a very strong association between low body iron stores and diffuse hair loss in women when the serum ferritin level is at or below 30 mg/L.18,19 Women with noticeable generalized hair loss typically suffer from deficiencies of all these nutrients. The treatment of hair loss second- ary to nutritional deficiency is straightforward—the dietary intake of these nutrients must be increased through appropriate supplementa- tion. One caveat is that many of these women turn out to be hypoch- lorhydric. In these cases, hydrochloric acid supplementation at meals may be all that is necessary. A general recommendation for women with hair loss related to nutritional status is to take a high-potency multivitamin/multimineral formula that contains iron along with tablespoon of flaxseed oil per day. If their serum ferritin levels are below 30 mg/L, such women can consume iron-rich foods and sup- plement with additional iron, either 30 mg of iron bound to succi- nate, fumarate, or other chelate twice daily between meals. If this recommendation results in abdominal discomfort, 30 mg taken with meals three times daily can be suggested. After 2 months, serum ferri- tin levels should be reassessed. Improvements in serum ferritin often correlate with improved health of the hair and the halting of excessive hair loss. Type IType IIType III Fig. 175.1 Ludwig pattern of hair loss in women.

## Hypothyroidism

It is well known that hair loss is one of the cardinal signs of hypothy- roidism. Using blood levels of thyroid hormones as the criterion, an estimated 1% to 4% of the adult population has moderate to severe hypothyroidism, and another 10% to 12% has mild hypothyroidism.20 The prevalence of hypothyroidism in American women is estimated to be as high as 20%, even among practitioners of conventional medicine.

## Antigliadin Antibodies

The protein gluten and its polypeptide derivative, gliadin, are found primarily in wheat, barley, and rye. It appears that antibodies to gliadin can elicit cross-reacting antibodies that attack the hair follicles, leading to alopecia areata—an autoimmune disease characterized by areas of virtually complete hair loss.21 Celiac disease, also known as nontropical sprue, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, or celiac sprue, is characterized by malabsorption and an abnormal small intestinal structure that reverts to normal on the removal of dietary gluten. Evidence is growing that many people with gluten intolerance do not have overt gastrointestinal symptoms. Instead, they may demonstrate gluten intolerance insidiously as hair loss. Rather than testing for antigliadin antibodies in patients with gen- eral hair loss or alopecia areata, the test for human antitissue transglu- taminase antibodies (IgA anti-tTG) is recommended because it is more sensitive than the test for antigliadin antibodies (see Chapter 157). This recommendation is especially important in the presence of any gastrointestinal symptoms pointing to celiac disease (Box 175.1).

## Toxicant Exposure

Toxin metal poisoning can also lead to alopecia or thinning of the hair. Excess intake of the trace element selenium can cause increased hair fragility and global hair loss.22 Hair loss has also resulted from expo- sure to mercury,23 arsenic,24 copper, and lead.25 Alopecia is often one of the distinctive clinical manifestations of thallium toxicity.26 A case report of a man who developed severe alopecia during 12 of his years as a glassworker determined the cause to be chronic poisoning by cadmium and bismuth compounds.27

# CONCLUSION

Hair loss in women should not be dismissed. Although some hair loss is a natural part of the aging process, complaints of excessive or accelerated hair loss should be investigated and treated appropriately. Clinical studies have investigated the psychological impact of increasing hair loss in women and found that it is a significant source of anxiety, fear, and depression.2,5 Conversely, increasing the health of the hair results in an improvement in the general health, especially the mental health, of these patients.

## 1359CHAPTER 176 Hepatitis


A diagnosis of hepatitis is made via a combination of a thorough history; physical examination; laboratory tests, including serial liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT], which are known together as transaminases); hepatitis-specific serologies; and in some instances, imaging studies. Because these eval- uations typically do not accurately correlate with the extent of dam- age done to the liver, a liver biopsy is often necessary in chronic cases to determine the grade (degree of inflammation) and stage (degree of fibrosis) of the disease, as well as the need for therapy.10,11

## Prevention

All people with chronic liver disease or chronic hepatitis of any etiology should receive immunizations for hepatitis A and B if they have not already been exposed to these viruses. The hepati- tis A vaccination was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1995, and since its implementation, the incidence has significantly declined. The development of the hep- atitis B vaccine represents one of the most important advances in medicine. This is the first and only vaccine in history that can simul- taneously prevent liver cancer, cirrhosis, and a sexually transmitted disease, hepatitis B. The FDA approved the hepatitis B vaccine in 1981, and the improved version has been available since 1986. It is considered safe to administer the hepatitis B vaccine to pregnant women if needed. Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should receive both the hepatitis B vaccination and the hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. See Box 176.1 for a list of those at increased risk for hepatitis B and who therefore should receive the hepatitis B vaccination.5,12 There is currently no vaccine available to prevent HCV. Many barriers exist, slowing the vaccine development, including the not- well-defined immune responses that prevent persistence, the lack of immune correlates, and one of the major barriers, the complex HCV population of mutant strains, known as quasispecies, that can exist in a person infected with hepatitis C.13 The hepatitis A virus can be killed by heating foods to º F (85 º C) for 1 minute and by disinfecting surfaces with a 1:100 household bleach solution. It is best to avoid eating raw or partially cooked mol- lusks (clams, oysters, mussels, and scallops) because these fish often live in HAV-contaminated rivers and seas. When traveling to areas of the world known to have a high incidence of hepatitis A, it is especially important to eat well-cooked foods and to drink only bottled water. Sanitizing diaper-changing tables is also important because hepatitis A–infected infants are typically a silent source for the spread of hepa- titis A infection. Meticulous hand washing is of great importance after using the bathroom, before eating a meal, and before preparing food for others.1 The avoidance of unprotected sex and injection drug use will greatly reduce the likelihood of infection with HBV or HCV. Employing a barrier such as a condom, dental dam, female con- dom, or finger cot will decrease the risk of transmission and acqui- sition of both viruses. Although the risk of sexual transmission of Fig. 176.1 Features of different types of viral hepatitis. (From Saleem A, Akhtar MF, Mushtag MF, Saleem M, Muhammad ST, Akhtar B, Sharif A, Peerzada S.

## 1360SECTION 6 Diseases

HCV is rare, protected sex is recommended if a person engages in anal sex, has multiple sex partners, has frequent prostate infections, has open cuts or sores on the genitalia, or is menstruating. People with hepatitis B or C should avoid sharing anything that may con- tain even the tiniest amount of their blood, including toothbrushes, needles, razors, and nail clippers. A drop of blood so minuscule that it cannot be seen by the human eye may contain hundreds or even thousands of HBV and/or HCV particles. Even meticulous cleaning may not totally eradicate the virus from a needle. If a person needs unused needles but cannot obtain them, he or she should seek out a needle-exchange program. Alternatively, needle use can be limited to autodestruct syringes, which are designed to self-destruct after one use. Of course, the best advice for a person who continues to use illicit drugs is to discontinue this activity immediately and seek help at a drug rehabilitation center. Also, anyone who intends to get a tattoo or have a body part pierced should deal only with estab- lishments that are clean and that adhere to meticulous sterilization practices.

## Conventional Therapies

The goals for treatment of chronic hepatitis include sustained viral suppression or total elimination of the virus to slow or prevent pro- gression to cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, HCC, and to prevent transmission to others. Although not curable, conventional treatment options for hepatitis B include either nucleoside/nucleotide analogs (NAs) or pegylated interferon. Interferons (IFNs) are a family of pro- teins made naturally by the body that have antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory properties (Fig. 176.2). IFN and pegylated IFN have both been shown to be effective in reducing HBV replica- tion and inducing disease remission, although pegylated IFN is pre- ferred due to its increased effectiveness and similar side-effect profile. However, the efficacy of IFN is limited to a narrow population of HBV patients. In addition, its numerous side effects, difficult subcu- taneous route of administration, cost, and associated high relapse rate after medication is discontinued have hampered its use for patients with chronic HBV. There are currently five FDA-approved NAs for the treatment of chronic HBV. NAs are quite effective for suppressing HBV replication, induction of disease remission, and the improvement of long-term outcomes. However, the length of time during which patients are treated is not predefined and is determined by specific parameters that may differ from one patient to another, and treatment may be indefinite for some. Furthermore, long-term use of NAs can be complicated by the selection of antiviral-resistant mutations.4 In contrast to hepatitis B, hepatitis C can be cured, resulting in improved survival, reduced morbidity, and higher quality of life. The goal of treatment is a sustained virologic response (SVR), or an absence of the virus in the blood 12 weeks after the completion of a treatment regimen. Treatment choice is based on multiple factors, including genotype, efficacy, duration, side-effect profile, drug interactions, his- tory of prior treatment, and stage of fibrosis.14 The length and suc- cess of HCV treatment are also dependent on a variety of factors (Box 176.2). With the approval of new interferon-free regimens in 2014, a major advance in the treatment of HCV occurred, leading to SVR in over 90% of HCV-infected individuals. Interferon-free regimens have helped reduce the number of adverse events (AEs), complex treatment regimens, and the potential for the development of drug-resistance, Fig. 176.2 TLR7 stimulation mediates an endogenous type I interferon response.

but one barrier still exists: the high price tag associated with each reg- imen. This change in treatment underscores the need for clinicians to be aware of the effects of natural and integrative therapies on the pro- gression of HCV, potential interactions, and of the potential benefits of these therapies for chronic hepatitis C.6 Several nutrients and herbs, discussed later, have been shown to inhibit viral reproduction, improve immune system function, and stimulate regeneration of the damaged liver cells.

## Lifestyle Recommendations

<!-- chunk -->

## Sleep

Experimental studies have demonstrated that sleep deprivation results in poorer immune function, such as reduced natural killer cell activity, suppressed interleukin-2 production, and increased levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines.15,16 One study showed that survival was inversely associated with sleep disturbance among patients with cirrhosis. The study’s authors suggested that tailored behavioral interventions might help improve overall health-related quality of life and could potentially improve patient outcomes.17 Sleep problems and chronic fatigue have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C, with about 50% to 70% of individuals reporting such complaints. Subjects administered IFN- α demon- strated increased waking after sleep onset, decreased sleep efficiency, and reduced stage 3 and/or 4 sleep.18,19 Evidence also suggests that impairments in sleep quality exist independent of antiviral therapy with IFN- α and before the advanced stages of liver disease.20 Sleep deprivation has also been found to attenuate antibody response to hepatitis A and B immunization.21,22 In terms of sleep duration, individuals with less than 7 hours of regular sleep are approximately three times more likely to develop a cold when exposed to nasally introduced rhinovirus than those with 8 hours or more of sleep.23 It may therefore be prudent to encourage proper sleep habits and a duration of 8 hours or more to optimize immune and antiviral bene- fits in the patient with hepatitis as well. In a 2017 study, resveratrol, at a dose of 19.8 mg/day, was deter- mined to reduce sleep disturbance in patients receiving pegylated- IFN-a-2b and Ribavirin therapy. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 60 participants with chronic hepatitis C; 30 receiving resveratrol and 30 receiving a placebo (N-acetylcysteine (NAC) 600 mg and lactoferrin 23.6 g). Addition of resveratrol signifi- cantly reduced anxiety; depression; sleep disturbance; serum inflam- matory markers, including AST, ALT, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α ), and interleukin (IL)-6; and histological characteristics, including steatosis and fibrosis. At this time, the mechanism of action for resveratrol is speculative, but it is thought that the phenolic content of resveratrol can alter cellular metabolism to reduce cellular inflammation and improve function. Reduction of inflammatory cytokines likely improves sleep modula- tion. Consumption of polyphenols likely alters microbial metabolism and alters the composition of microflora, affecting anxiety, depression, and fatigue. It is unknown if resveratrol alone would have the same benefits in the absence of lactoferrin and NAC.24


Light to moderate exercise has been shown to be well tolerated and beneficial for direct and indirect (extrahepatic) symptoms associ- ated with acute and chronic liver disease.25,26 Studies demonstrating the incorporation of exercise into the standard of care (SOC) treat- ment plan for HCV showed that patients can safely participate in an exercise program, create clear changes in the way they perceive their bodies and its capacities, and improve their self-confidence, all of which can lead to far-reaching changes in the way this disease and the constraints of treatment are perceived.27 Exercise has also been shown to improve symptoms of fatigue, one of the most common and bothersome symptoms affecting people with chronic hepatitis; enhance cardiovascular function; and reduce total body fat, which is important to all people with liver disease. When total body fat is reduced, the fat content of the liver is also reduced, often resulting in a significant reduction in elevated liver enzymes.27 Thus it is rec- ommended that all patients with chronic hepatitis incorporate an exercise program combining weight training and aerobics into their daily routine, as tolerated, once they have been medically cleared by their physicians.


Nutritional treatment decisions for hepatitis should be based on modifiable factors associated with accelerated liver disease, includ- ing alcohol consumption, obesity, fluid retention, and insulin resis- tance.28–30 The most recommended, and researched, dietary pattern for hepatitis is the Mediterranean diet because of its well-documented effects on cardio-metabolic health. Individual components of this diet include reduced carbohydrate intake; increased monounsaturated and omega-3 fatty acid intake; and an increase in whole foods, including whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. The consumption of a diet high in saturated fats, simple carbohydrates (e.g., sugar, white flour, fruit juice, honey), oxidized fatty acids (fried oils), sodium, and animal products has been shown to be detrimental.31,32 Alcohol should be completely avoided. The gut–liver–axis (GLA), a relatively novel concept, has been strongly implicated in the progression of hepatitis.33 The GLA is char- acterized by the movement of nutrients and metabolites between the small intestine, portal circulation, and bile acid.33 When there is microbial dysbiosis and disruption of the intestinal barrier, bacteria and their products (including endotoxins) travel to the liver, causing liver damage.33,34 Elevated bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes metabolic endotoxemia and liver inflammation. This both causes and worsens liver disease.33,34 HCV infection alters the gut microbial composition.35,36 It is unknown exactly how this occurs, but it is likely (1) from the direct interaction of HCV and the microbiota and/or (2) mediated via the immune system.35,36 One study in patients with chronic HBV or HCV has shown that increased microbial translocation and LPS-induced inflammation is predictive of the progression of liver disease34 The most concerning sequelae of altered GLA function is an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).37 To reduce the risk of HCC by influencing the GLA, it is important to eat a diet that supports the growth of diverse microflora, repairs the intestinal barrier, and decreases LPS levels. Although most research in this field has been performed on mice, eating a high-fat diet (the standard American diet) increases LPS levels and metabolic endo- toxemia.38 Likewise, a high-sugar diet drastically modifies the gut

microbial composition, increases gut permeability, elevates blood endotoxins, and increases liver inflammation.38,39 Both diets reduce the diversity of the gut flora, which has been linked to a decrease in health.39–41 To promote the growth of a diverse microflora, eating a diet rich in polyphenols, fiber, and resistant starches is important.42–44 Probiotic foods including kefir, yogurt, kimchi, miso, and sauerkraut may improve dysbiosis, improve microflora composition, and reduce LPS levels.45,46 Additionally, the avoidance of xenobiotics in foods should be emphasized.40 Patients presenting with liver cirrhosis are likely to be undernour- ished and sarcopenic.47 These qualities lead to a decreased quality of life and poor prognosis. Nutritional therapy should support liver regeneration and prevention and correction of nutritional deficiencies. Common nutritional deficiencies with cirrhosis include vitamins A, B, D, E, K, zinc, branched-chain amino acids, and carnitine. Adequate nutrition and prevention of muscle wasting help improve a patient’s ability to perform daily activities and reduce complications associated with cirrhosis and HCC.47

## Flavonoids

Flavonoids are a class of secondary plant metabolites, including com- mon fruits and vegetables, that have been shown to exhibit anti-inflam- matory, antithrombogenic, antidiabetic, anticancer, neuroprotective, and antiviral activities. There are a number of ongoing studies looking at the effects flavonoids have on viral infections, including hepatitis B and C. One such flavonoid, proanthocyandin, found in the blueberry fruit and leaves, has been found to inhibit the replication of HCV,48 and rats fed diets high in blueberries were protected from develop- ing acute hepatitis.49 Naringenin, a flavonoid found in grapefruit and other citrus fruits, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiviral, and lipid-lowering properties.50 Its lip- id-lowering properties are specific for very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol; it is suspected that the hepatitis C virus may “hitch a ride” on cholesterol. Studies have demonstrated that nar- ingenin can inhibit or reduce steatosis (the deposition of fat in the liver)51,52 in addition to inhibiting HCV viral replication.53,54 It is important to remember that grapefruit contains furanocoumarins and flavonoids, which can inhibit components of the cytochrome P450 drug metabolism pathway, leading to toxic levels of many medications.55,56

## Caffeine

The mechanisms by which caffeine exerts its hepatoprotective effects are still under investigation, but a growing number of studies are demonstrating a multifactorial etiology, including detoxification, antioxidation, and antifibrinogenesis properties.57 Although the research is early, there does appear to be dose-dependent response between coffee intake (up to 4 cups daily) and reduced mortality from chronic liver disease. Two population-based studies demon- strated that those who consumed 2 cups of coffee a day were less likely to have elevated serum liver enzymes and were less likely to have chronic liver disease, compared with those who did not drink coffee.58,59 The protective effect of coffee drinking on the develop- ment of cirrhosis and its complications, including HCC, has also been well documented.60–65 Higher coffee consumption was associated with less hepatic steato- sis, a lower ratio of serum AST/ALT, and lower α -fetoprotein levels in patients with hepatitis C. Patients who drank more than 2 to 3 cups of coffee a day had a lower incidence of disease progression and less fibrosis on histological evaluation compared with patients with HCV who drank less coffee.60,66 Similar results were not seen in patients who got caffeine from other sources or who consumed decaffeinated cof- fee. Caffeine may also reduce the fatigue associated with HCV and/ or chronic liver disease. Although the exact coffee intake necessary to obtain benefits is unclear, it appears reasonable for patients with hepa- titis C to drink 2 to 4 cups of regular coffee daily.

## Whey Protein

A by-product of the cheese-making process, whey contains biolog- ically active ingredients that have been shown to enhance immune function, protect against free-radical damage, improve cellular glu- tathione levels, and reduce overall viral load.67 A preliminary trial found that 24 g of whey protein daily reduced serum ALT levels and increased plasma glutathione levels in people with hepatitis B but not those with hepatitis C.68 In a pilot study where whey protein con- centrate was supplemented daily in patients with chronic HCV, a significant decrease was noted in viral load, inflammatory markers, and serum ALT and AST. Unfortunately, this study did not disclose an optimal dose, duration, or potential for interaction with ongoing therapy.67

## Vitamins C and E

Patients with hepatitis C treated with pegylated interferon and ribavi- rin were found to have higher SVRs and to be less likely to experience ribavirin-associated anemia when they supplemented this antiviral treatment with vitamins C and E.69,70 It should be kept in mind that vitamin C increases iron absorption, and many patients with hepatitis C already have elevated iron stores. Vitamin E levels have been shown to be lower in the serum and liver tissue of people with active hepatitis and those who later develop liver cancer from chronic hepatitis.71,72 In one preliminary trial of adults with hepatitis C, administering 1200 IU/day of vitamin E for 8 weeks appeared to reduce liver damage.73 In another study, 544 IU of vitamin E/day for 24 weeks improved the response to interferon/ antioxidant therapy, although the results did not reach statistical significance.74


Zinc is essential to the normal functioning of the immune system and may protect the liver from oxidative damage. Some research- ers believe that zinc may protect the body from viruses, including the common cold. A deficiency of this trace element is common in patients with active HCV, HCC, and/or cirrhosis, and serum levels of zinc are inversely correlated with the progression of HCV. Therefore, due to zinc’s complex antioxidant effects and the known deficiency state in patients with HCV, zinc supplementation is seen as a viable adjunctive therapy.75 Oral zinc supplementation (150 mg/day) may slow HCV progression and reduce the incidence of HCC in these patients.76,77 Zinc supplementation has also been shown to improve functional hepatic reserve, hepatic encephalopathy, and general nutritional status.47 In addition, zinc supplementation may improve the response to interferon treatment in patients with chronic hep- atitis C.78,79 One study using 17 mg of zinc twice daily (in the form of a zinc complex of L-carnosine) enhanced the response to inter- feron therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C.80 However, it is not clear whether this benefit was due primarily to the zinc or the carnosine. Although daily doses up to 100 mg of zinc may boost the immune system and improve the response to interferon, an excess of this amount may be immunosuppressive. There are also adverse effects associated with excessive zinc consumption, including nau- sea, vomiting, and diarrhea—all possible side effects of HCV antiviral SOC therapy.

## 1363CHAPTER 176 Hepatitis


Patients with chronic hepatitis C often have lower serum levels of hydroxy (OH) vitamin D than individuals without hepatitis C, and approximately one third of these patients are severely vitamin D– deficient.81 Decreased vitamin D levels have been independently cor- related with both the severity of inflammation and hepatic fibrosis on histological evaluation and a reduced incidence of SVRs to therapy with pegylated interferon (PI) plus ribavirin (RBV).82–85 Additional preliminary findings have suggested that supplementation with vita- min D (1000–4000 IU/day), with the goal of achieving a serum level greater than 32 ng/mL, may improve SVRs in some patients with HCV treated with antiviral therapy. These results suggest that the immu- nomodulatory properties of vitamin D may act in synergy with this antiviral therapy. Further evaluation revealed that tissue expression of cytochrome P450 25-hydroxylating liver enzymes CYP27A1 paralleled with vitamin D levels and inversely correlated with hepatic necroin- flammatory activity. Although further research is expected, because population-based studies have concluded that up to 75% of Americans are deficient in vitamin D,182 it seems reasonable for all patients with hepatitis C to add vitamin D to their antiviral regimens.

## Branched-Chain Amino Acids

In advanced liver disease, such as cirrhosis, patients are often unable to maintain adequate levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) due to increased demand from ammonia detoxification and energy production.47 Inadequate BCAA availability causes a reduction of protein synthesis in the liver, resulting in hypoalbuminemia, sarcope- nia, edema, and ascites.86 Supplementing with BCAA has been shown to improve hypoalbuminemia, insulin resistance, immune function, and fatty-acid metabolism; reduce complications of cirrhosis (e.g., esophageal varices, ascites); ameliorate oxidative stress; and inhibit angiogenesis and hepatocarcinogenesis.47,87 A multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 622 patients with HCV-related liver cirrho- sis showed that oral BCAA supplementation, at a dose of 12 g/day, inhibited hepatocarcinogenesis in obese (body mass index [BMI] >25) patients.86 The BCAA granules studied contained L-valine, L-leucine, and L-isoleucine at a 1.2:2:1 ratio.47 General recommendations for the administration of BCAA varies between Japanese, American, and European treatment guidelines.86

## Acetyl-


<!-- chunk -->

## -Carnitine

l-carnitine is required for the transportation of fatty acids into the mitochondria of cells. HCV has been found to alter fatty-acid metab- olism in hepatocytes by inducing adipogenesis, enhancing lipid drop- let formation, and then using these lipids for viral assembly.88 In vitro studies have shown the inhibition of lipid droplet formation using l-carnitine, suggesting it may have antiviral properties and inhibit the HCV replication process. Additionally, l-carnitine is a well-known antioxidant that has been proven to help decrease hepatocyte damage from HCV.88 A 2008, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study of 125 cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis B or C showed that l-carnitine is able to reduce serum ammonia levels and improve neuropsychological functions compared with placebo.89 Studies by the same group have demonstrated additional benefits of acetyl-l-carni- tine supplementation in patients with HCV, including reduction of fatigue and depression, improved cognition, and an increase in quality of life.90–92


Selenium is an essential trace element that plays a pivotal role in immune function, including activation of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, a well-known mediator of oxidative stress. In a deficient state, general immune dysfunction, cancer, and liver cirrhosis have all been documented, the latter showing a proportional decline with the severity of liver injury.93,94 These findings help confirm that selenium supplementation may be an important addition to current viral hepa- titis therapies.95 Whole-blood and plasma selenium levels in 59 patients with chronic liver pathologies, including alcoholic and viral liver cirrho- sis, were found to be significantly lower than in healthy controls.96 Another study of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines reveals that liver cancer cells are able to acquire a selective survival advantage that is prominent under conditions of selenium deficiency and oxidative stress.97 Oxidative stress is a well-known feature in late-stage cirrhotic liver disease, and subsequent studies have found it to occur much ear- lier than previously thought.98 Yu and colleagues found that selenium deficiency correlated with the development of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis B, and those who supplemented with 200 mcg of sele- nium daily were less likely to develop HCC compared with nonsup- plemented individuals.99,100 Given this information and the safety of selenium, it is reasonable to employ a supplementary dose of 50 to mg of selenium/day in a hepatitis protocol.101

## S-Adenosyl Methionine

S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) functions mainly as a methyl group donor but is less known for its regulation of hepatocyte growth, death, and differentiation. It has been hypothesized that lower hepatic methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) activity may play a role in the pathogenesis and progression of cirrhosis as well as predisposi- tion to HCC.102 In a mouse model, SAMe has been shown to enhance interferon’s antiviral properties.103 In a small pilot study performed on G1 HCV nonresponders to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin, it was demonstrated that those patients who were retreated with the same regimen but supplemented with 400 mg SAMe tablets per day displayed both improved early viral kinetics and interferon signaling. This led to enhanced interferon responsiveness and resulted in a higher percentage of patients achieving SVR.104 SAMe, at an oral dose of 1600 mg/day, has also been shown to sub- jectively reduce pruritis and fatigue related to intrahepatic cholestasis due to viral hepatitis.105


Probiotics and the gut microbiota seem to be playing a larger role in liver health than previously thought. The GLA, a relatively new con- cept, helps us better understand the pathophysiology of several hepa- topathies, including viral hepatitis. Studies have demonstrated a direct relationship between HBV and HCV and an overproduction of proin- flammatory cytokines and hepatic inflammation. One study demon- strated the direct effects of lactitol, a prebiotic known to increase the number of beneficial bacteria species (e.g., Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus), on the reduction of endotoxins in patients with hepatitis B or C.106 Another study looking at the GLA found that those infected with HCV had an increased risk for intestinal permeability, the inciting factor of gut dysbiosis and the proinflammatory effects of liver cirrho- sis and HCC.107 More research is needed to completely understand the effects of probiotics on liver disease, but the link between gut dysbiosis and endotoxemia has been well documented, and any therapies used to treat dysbiosis should be considered when treating those patients with hepatitis.108

## Liver Extracts

The oral administration of liver extracts has been used in the treatment of many chronic liver diseases since 1896. Numerous investigations

<!-- chunk -->

## 1364SECTION 6 Diseases

into the therapeutic efficacy of liver extracts have demonstrated that these extracts promote hepatic regeneration and are quite effective in the treatment of chronic liver disease, including chronic active hepa- titis.109–111 For example, in one double-blind study, 556 patients with chronic hepatitis were given either 70 mg of a liver extract or a placebo three times daily.111 At the end of 3 months, the group receiving the liver extract had far lower liver enzyme (aminotransaminase) levels, suggesting that liver extract may have an anti-inflammatory effect on the liver. This study must be interpreted with caution because the cause of chronic hepatitis was not clearly stated.

<!-- chunk -->

## Thymus Extracts

The effectiveness of orally administered bovine thymus in viral hep- atitis is reflective of broad-spectrum immune system enhancement, presumably mediated by improved thymus gland activity. Several double-blind studies in both acute and chronic hepatitis B have shown thymus extracts to be moderately effective at best. In these studies, a therapeutic effect was noted by accelerated decreases of liver enzymes (transaminases), elimination of the virus, and a higher rate of serocon- version to anti-HBe112,113 (see Chapter 136 for additional information on the thymus gland).


The use of botanical medicine, in conjunction with other forms of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), has been increas- ing among patients with liver disease even though long-term clini- cal trials have yet to confirm the safety and efficacy of many of these treatments. It is due to this increased public interest, as well as known historical uses and lack of quality research, that the scientific commu- nity has taken an interest in botanical medicine. Unfortunately, among the several hundred plants that have been examined, there are only a handful of quality studies looking at safety, therapeutic effectiveness, and mechanisms of action. Of all those herbs studied, the most prom- ising for the treatment of viral hepatitis include licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), silymarin (the flavonoid complex from milk thistle, Silybum marianum), and an ayurvedic herbal combination Liv-52 (contain- ing Capparis spinosa, Cichorium intybus, Soalnum nigrum, Terminalia arjuna, Cassia occidentalis, Achillea millefolium, Tamarix gallica, and Phyllanthus amarus).114–116,183

## Glycyrrhiza glabra (Licorice Root)

Many hepatitis trials have looked at the triterpenoid saponin, glycyr- rhizin, found in the roots of the licorice plant. Licorice, and its main constituent glycyrrhizin, has been suggested to exert many pharmaco- logical actions beneficial to the treatment of acute and chronic hep- atitis, including antioxidant, antihepatotoxic, choleretic, antiviral, and immune-modulating actions. These actions have been proven to reduce serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase values, inhibit immune-mediated cytotoxicity against hepatocytes, suppress hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) secretion, and antagonize nuclear factor-kappa B (NF- κ B), a transcription factor that activates genes encoding inflammatory cytokines.80,115,116 Licorice has been shown to stimulate the production of the body’s natural supply of interferon. This may account for its popularity in Japan, where it has been used in the treatment of chronic viral hep- atitis for more than 20 years.117–122 When used intravenously, lic- orice has been demonstrated to lower liver enzymes, suggesting a potential benefit in the treatment of hepatitis C, and decrease the risk of HCV-associated HCC.123–125 A product by the name Stronger Neominophagen C (SNMC) consists of 200 mg of glycyrrhizin, 100 mg of cysteine, and 2000 mg of glycine in 100 mL of physiological saline. When administered intravenously, liver enzymes were decreased in approximately 40% of patients, but with little to no change in HCV load.117–121 Furthermore, the beneficial effect of SNMC on the reduc- tion of liver enzymes was short-lived: after discontinuation of this sup- plement, ALT elevations returned. A similar outcome was found by others.123 In a study of 453 Japanese patients diagnosed with chronic hepa- titis C, 84 were treated with SNMC at a dosage of 100 mL/day for weeks, followed by treatments two to seven times weekly for periods up to 16 years. The rates of cumulative HCC and cirrhosis in year were 7% and 12%, respectively; in year 15, they were 12% and 21%, respectively. And in a cohort of patients with HCV who were unre- sponsive to interferon therapy, intravenous glycyrrhizin decreased the risk of progression to HCC.126 Unfortunately, the beneficial results of glycyrrhizin in hepatitis are not consistent. When lower doses of oral glycyrrhizin were used, significant reductions in ALT levels were not observed. Many have concluded that although licorice may reduce ALT elevations, long-term beneficial effects on HCV-associated fibro- sis have not been shown.127 The main adverse effect of licorice administration is the production of its aldosterone-like effects, including fluid retention, hypokalemia, and hypertension; thus, licorice should be avoided in patients with a history of ascites, hypertension, or renal failure and those using digi- talis preparations.115,116

## Silybum marianum (Milk Thistle)

The origins of the effects of milk thistle on the liver can be traced back to ancient Roman times when Pliny the Elder (ad 23–79) referred to the milky juice of this plant as being excellent for “carrying off bile.” John Gerard, a 16th-century British herbalist, recommended milk this- tle for “expelling melancholy,” a symptom attributed to liver disease during that era. In Germany, during the 19th century, doctors com- monly treated jaundice and other liver diseases with an extract from milk thistle seeds. In 1949 German researchers found that milk thistle appeared to protect the livers of animals exposed to high doses of car- bon tetrachloride, a potent hepatotoxin.128 In 1968 it was found that the active ingredients in milk thistle, a mixture of flavolignans and a flavonoid, are in the seed and consists of silybin, silydianin, and silychristin, collectively referred to as sily- marin. Due to its cytoprotectant, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic properties, silymarin is the most used natural compound for hepatic disorders worldwide.129 In the United States, milk thistle is most commonly used for treating viral hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver. Unfortunately, the trials that have been completed have pro- duced conflicting results, even with the standardization (between 70% and 80%) of silymarin.130 It is hypothesized that silymarin’s hepato- protective properties come from the following: • Acting as an antioxidant and reducing reactive oxygen species • Increasing the intracellular content of glutathione, superoxide dis- mutase, and catalase • Inhibiting the formation of leukotrienes and cellular damage • Stimulating hepatocyte regeneration Silymarin has been used to treat both acute and chronic hepatitis of varying etiologies. In a study with 29 patients with acute viral hep- atitis, those treated with silymarin showed greater improvements in serum levels of bilirubin and liver enzymes compared with the placebo group.131 Other investigators specifically evaluating the antiviral effect of sily- marin on patients with hepatitis C concluded that improvements in some symptoms occurred when silymarin was administered orally but that it failed to exert an antiviral effect or result in significant reduc- tions in ALT or improvements in ultrasound abnormalities related to hepatitis C.132–134

## 1365CHAPTER 176 Hepatitis

In humans, flavonoids have a low bioavailability, owing to exten- sive first-pass metabolism; thus, the plasma levels needed to exert an antiviral effect may not be possible. Discrepant results reported by var- ious investigators may be due to a lack of homogeneity among doses and routes of administration. A newer form of silymarin that binds it to phosphatidylcholine (referred to as silymarin phytosome) may provide greater benefit. A growing body of research indicates that phosphatidylcholine-bound silymarin is better absorbed and produces better clinical results than the unbound variety.135–140 These benefits were demonstrated in a study involving 232 patients with chronic hepatitis (viral, alcoholic, or chemically induced) treated with silymarin phytosome at either mg twice a day or 120 mg three times a day for up to 120 days.140 Liver function returned to normal faster in patients given silymarin phyto- some compared with both the commercially available silymarin and a placebo. Intravenous silibinin is capable of the greatest suppression of hep- atitis C viral replication. The first study that provided clear evidence of the antiviral effects of silymarin in humans with hepatitis C was published in 2008 by Ferenci and colleagues.141 These investigators found that such patients who were nonresponders to SOC treatment were able to achieve undetectable HCV RNA levels after intravenous administration of silibinin for 15 days. Although these results proved to be temporary, the antiviral effect of intravenous silibinin was per- manent for one patient with hepatitis C who received this treatment for 2 weeks after liver transplantation. This suggests that silibinin may be capable of preventing graft reinfection with HCV.142 Further studies are needed to confirm these promising results.

## Phyllanthus amarus

Phyllanthus amarus is an important herb in the Ayurvedic system of medicine commonly used for liver disorders. An array of phytochem- ical studies looking at this herb demonstrated a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities, including antiviral, antibacterial, anti-in- flammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, antioxidant, and hepatopro- tective.143 A preliminary report from 1988 demonstrated that 59% of patients with hepatitis B had lost the hepatitis B surface antigen when tested 15 to 20 days after treatment with a preparation of P. amarus (200 mg of the dried, powdered, sterilized plant in capsules three times a day).144 In a 2011 in vitro study looking at the correlation between P. amarus (root and leaf) extracts and HCV replication, there were two HCV enzymes that were shown to be inhibited by the extracts, there- fore also inhibiting HCV replication.143 At this time, these results have not been confirmed by other researchers, indicating the need for more research in this field.145–148

## Combination Approach with Antioxidants and Botanical

<!-- chunk -->

## Therapy

It has been well documented that the pathogenesis of chronic HCV is associated with a suboptimal immune response and intrahepatic oxidative stress. Therefore the addition of antioxidant therapies in the treatment of HCV may have beneficial effects on the prognosis and outcome of this disease.149,150 A report by Berkson describes three patients with advanced cirrho- sis, portal hypertension, and esophageal varices secondary to chronic hepatitis C infection who were effectively treated with a low-cost combination program. Although these patients were originally given extremely poor prognoses, all “recovered quickly,” showed improved liver enzymes, and were able to resume their normal daily activities. One patient revealed a substantial improvement in her condition within only 2 weeks. The other patients progressed to health within to 7 months.151 Berkson’s regimen was composed of oral supplementation of α -li- poic acid (600 mg/day in two divided doses), selenium (as selenome- thionine at 400 mcg/day in two divided doses), and silymarin (900 mg/day in three divided doses). The subjects were also asked to take a B-complex vitamin, eat a diet high in fruits and vegetables, consume 4 oz or less of meat per meal, and drink eight glasses of water per day. They also took between 1000 and 6000 mg of vitamin C daily and IU/day of vitamin E. They were encouraged to walk 1 mile three times a week. Only the α -lipoic acid/selenium/silymarin portion of the pro- tocol was verified, and it is not known how strictly the other nutri- tional and lifestyle suggestions were followed.151 Although this protocol is documented in only three cases, it makes reasonable sense from a naturopathic standpoint, given the excellent safety record, reasonable cost, and known efficacy of the individual treatment options and is certainly worth trying, especially in patients failing to respond to conventional therapies. It is hoped that stringent clinical trials of this type of multiantioxidant/lifestyle combination protocol will be conducted soon. One such study, by Melhem et al., in which 50 patients with chronic HCV were treated with oral (glycyrrhizin, schisandra, silymarin, ascorbic acid, lipoic acid, l-glutathione, and alpha-tocopherol) and intravenous preparations (glycyrrhizin, ascorbic acid, l-glutathione, b-complex) demonstrated an enhanced response rate when looking at HCV RNA levels, liver enzymes, liver histology, and quality of life.152

## Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine Herbs

The Chinese medicine diagnosis for hepatitis often includes consid- eration of damp heat in the liver and spleen channels. Acupuncture points and herbal formulas are often directed at clearing heat and damp to cool and drain these channels. Often efforts are made to also nourish liver blood and tone the liver and spleen. In a study of 60 patients with hepatitis B, 30 were prescribed minutes of acupuncture once a day for 4 to 6 weeks, whereas the other 30, the control group, continued their conventional treatment. Those in the treatment group had significantly shorter recovery times, greater symptom improvement, and lower interleukin-8 levels.153 Studies have also investigated the use of acupuncture to improve secondary and comorbid symptoms, such as depression and myalgias. One 6-week trial categorized 28 patients: group 1 comprised 13 patients with high depression and myalgia scores, group 2 was made up of 11 patients with low depression but high myalgia scores, and group 3 consisted of 4 patients with high depression but low myalgia scores. Compared with baseline levels, significant improvement was shown in end-treat- ment depression and myalgia scores.142 Although no positive outcomes regarding improved viral load using acupuncture have been shown, acupuncture may help other symptoms, improve immune balance, and lower comorbidities in patients with hepatitis. In a meta-analysis done by Zhao et al. in 2011, a positive correlation was found between interferon along with the use of Chinese herbal formulas and a higher sustained virologic response.154 More studies are needed, but given the possible benefit and low risk, acupuncture and Chinese herbs may be reasonable therapies for patients with viral hepatitis. Because the standard operating procedure for acupuncture man- dates the use of clean-needle technique, the risk of hepatitis from acupuncture is considered extremely low.155 Acupuncture may help improve symptoms and hepatic function. A patient should look for a practitioner who uses only disposable needles as opposed to rester- ilized needles.

and gastrointestinal disorders.156 This formula has been shown in ani- mal models to prevent liver injury and promote liver regeneration by inhibiting oxidative stress on lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells157,158 and, in human trials, to prevent the progres- sion of cirrhosis to HCC.159 One prospective study of 260 patients also found that it increased the survival of those with chronic viral hepatitis by reducing progression to HCC.160–162 A Phase II trial at Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center showed that sho- saiko-to may improve liver pathology in patients with HCV who are unable or choose not to receive interferon therapy.163 In this open-la- bel trial, 24 subjects were given 2.5 g granulated powder, three times daily, for 12 months. After 12 months of treatment, 38% of subjects had improved liver histology on fine-needle biopsy, 67% had reduced AST levels, and 75% had reduced ALT levels. Of note, this treatment is contraindicated with interferon drug therapy because there is an increased risk of pneumonitis,164 and Sho-saiko-to has been reported to cause acute hepatitis.165

## Hepatotoxic Supplements

The use of nutritional and herbal supplements has dramatically increased in popularity since the 1990s, especially in certain sub- groups, including affluent societies, elderly individuals, nonsmoking females, and those with higher education levels. With such an increase in supplementation and limited oversight from either the FDA or prac- titioners, there is also more concern for toxicity due to unknown addi- tives, dosage, and incorrect or off-label uses.166 Niacin, a supplement used mostly for hyperlipidemia, known to cause flushing, headache, and stomachache, may cause hepatotoxic- ity, depending on form and dosage. Immediate-release, or crystalline, niacin at doses above 500 mg and/or sustained-release forms at doses of 2 g/day or higher have been shown to contribute to hepatotoxicity and should be avoided in patients with hepatitis.167–169 Other forms of niacin, including extended release (ER) and niacinamide, appear less likely to induce hepatic abnormalities and may be considered safer options.170,171 Vitamin A belongs to a group of compounds known as retinoids. About 80% to 90% of total-body stores of retinoids are found in hepatic stellate cells. Excessive consumption of vitamin A (acute doses of over 100,000 IU or chronic doses of 25,000–100,000 IU daily for over a year) may cause hypervitaminosis A; individual tolerability may vary. Hypervitaminosis A has been well documented to cause hepatotoxic- ity, including elevation of serum liver enzymes, cholestatic hepatitis, noncirrhotic portal hypertension, fibrosis, and cirrhosis.166,172 Vitamin A’s potential to cause liver toxicity has been shown to be enhanced with increased alcohol consumption, excessive intake of other fat-sol- uble vitamins, and vitamin C deficiency. Iron has been demonstrated to generate reactive oxygen species, leading to point mutations, chromosomal damage, and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes such a p53; therefore it is a direct hepatotoxin. Unless a patient is found to be iron deficient, iron supplementation should be avoided because iron has been shown to speed the progres- sion and worsen the course of many liver diseases. This is especially true for alcoholic liver disease because alcohol and excess iron have been shown to have an additive harmful effect on the liver.173

## Hepatotoxic Botanicals

Given the pharmacological nature of plant medicines, it is important to remember that some commonly used botanicals may be hepato- toxic and should be avoided in patients with hepatitis. Perhaps the most researched is Symphytum officinale (comfrey), which contains hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), such as lasiocarpine and symphytine, and their related N-oxides.174 Although Symphytum is most commonly used as a topical vulnerary, the PAs may still be absorbed through the skin, and their use should be avoided in patients with liver disease. Piper methysticum (kava kava) has also been implicated in hepatic liver damage.175 A number of these reported cases of kava toxicity seemed to involve poor documenta- tion, preexisting conditions, kava overdose, or concomitant poly- pharmacy. Although considered safe at normal doses for people without liver disease, those with hepatic conditions should avoid kava kava as a precaution.176 There is a long list of other potentially hepatotoxic botanicals that should be discussed due to past and emerging research (Box 176.3). Many of these herbs are found in formulas that are known to be hep- atotoxic, and others have been included based on constituent actions. Until more quality research is done to confirm the role of these botan- icals in the pathophysiology of liver damage/disease, they should be used with caution in those with hepatitis.177,178


During the contagious phase (2–3 weeks before symptoms appear to 3 weeks after), good hygiene and avoiding close contact with others is important. Once a diagnosis has been made, work in a daycare cen- ter, restaurant, or other similar employment is not recommended. Chronic hepatitis requires a multifactorial, integrative approach that will include lifestyle and dietary measures, as well as possibly a combi- nation of nutrients, botanicals, and conventional pharmaceuticals, as needed on an individual basis.


In the acute phase, bed rest is important, with a slow resumption of activities as health improves. At least 8 hours of sleep is rec- ommended during the acute and recovery phases. Exercise is rec- ommended at the level of intensity safest for each patient, a level that may vary from person to person. Strenuous exercise should be avoided. Weight loss is recommended for those who are overweight or obese. Smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol should be com- pletely avoided.179,180


A low-caloric, whole-foods, high-fiber diet low in saturated fats, oxi- dized fatty acids (fried oils), and simple carbohydrates (e.g., sugar, white flour, and fruit juice) is recommended.179 Consumption of veg- etable broths, diluted vegetable juices (diluted with 50% water), and herbal teas is helpful to avoid dehydration, especially in the presence of diarrhea. Foods such as flavonoid-rich blueberry, coffee, and grape- fruit (if there are no interactions with medication) may be beneficial to the patient with chronic hepatitis. Prebiotic and probiotic foods should be emphasized to improve the GLA and reduce liver inflammation.181

## 1367CHAPTER 176 Hepatitis


Vitamin C: to bowel tolerance (10–50 g/day) in acute cases; 1000 mg three times/day in chronic cases. Caution in cases of iron overload when taken with iron sources. Vitamin D: 1000 to 4000 IU a day Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols): 1200 IU a day Selenium: 50 to 200 mcg a day Whey protein: for hepatitis B at 24 g a day Liver extracts: 70 mg three times a day Thymus extracts: equivalent to 120 mg pure polypeptides with molec- ular weights of less than 10,000 or roughly 750 mg of the crude polypeptide fraction a day


<!-- chunk -->

## Glycyrrhiza glabra (Licorice)

Powdered root: 1 to 2 g three times daily Fluid extract (1:1): 2 to 4 mL (1–2 g) three times daily Solid (dry powdered) extract (5% glycyrrhetinic acid content): 250 to 500 mg three times daily. Intravenous administration may be the most effective form. Note: chronic licorice administration may call for an increased intake of potassium-rich foods.

<!-- chunk -->

## Silybum marianum (Milk Thistle)

Standardized extract: 70 to 210 mg three times daily, based on its sily- marin content. The best results are achieved at higher dosages (i.e., 150–300 mg three times daily). For this reason, standardized extracts are preferred. Silybin bound to phosphatidylcholine: 120 mg two to three times daily between meals. Intravenous silibinin may be the most effective form.

## Immunological Aspects

Because not everyone exposed to HSV develops clinical infection, it appears that host defense mechanisms are paramount in protecting against infection. Chronic, persistent labial and genital infections are seen in immunosuppressed individuals. The cell-mediated immune system is undoubtedly the major factor in determining the outcome of herpes exposure—that is, whether it leads to resistance, latent infec- tion, or clinical disease.


Isolation of HSV from tissue scrapings is the gold standard for diag- nosis. The availability of type-specific serology using surface glycopro- teins (gG2 and gG1 for HSV-2 and HSV-1, respectively) to distinguish HSV-1 and HSV-2 enables the clinician to determine whether the patient is at risk of acquisition or has evidence of prior infection with either subtype.5 A positive serology indicates present or past infection. Positive serological testing for HSV-2 indicates anogenital infection, Nucleus Concatemeric DNA Late proteins Late mRNAs Infectious Cycle Circularized HSV-1 DNA Latent infection LAT mRNAs Immediate- early mRNA Early mRNA Early proteins Intermediate proteins LAT Proteins ER Golgi Late, envelope proteins Cytoplasm Virion host shutoff factor (Vhs) and VP16 Extracellular matrix Herpes viruses: life cycle Virus can bind several host receptors Envelope fuses with plasma membrane Capsid moves to nucleus Uses host polymerse to replicate Lytic infection mRNA moves to cytoplasm Proteins built, assembled Virus exocytosed from plasma membrane – – – – – • • •

but positive serological testing for HSV-1 can be consistent with either anogenital or orolabial infection.6


Prevention of recurrent herpes is recommended to decrease the num- ber and severity of outbreaks, reduce asymptomatic viral shedding, and prevent transmission to a partner and/or fetus. Three or more people may benefit when one person takes preventive measures. Education regarding transmission and asymptomatic viral shedding is imperative. Enhancement of the host’s immunological status is a key goal in the control of herpes infection. In addition to general immune support (for a complete discussion, see Chapter 136), one of the key natural measures to strengthen cell-mediated immunity is the use of polypep- tide-rich bovine thymus extracts. These have been shown to be effective in preventing both the number and severity of recurrent infections in immune-suppressed individuals.7 Thymus extract appears to increase the lymphoproliferative response to HSV, natural killer cell activity, and interferon production, thus preventing viral activation by potenti- ating these cell-mediated immune responses. To date, no clinical trials have been published on thymus extract and the prevention or treat- ment of HSV infections.


Oral supplementation with zinc (50 mg/day) has been shown to be effective in laboratory studies.8 Although zinc is an effective inhibitor of HSV replication in vitro, its effect in vivo is probably related to its role in enhancing cell-mediated immunity. The topical application of 0.01% to 0.025% zinc sulfate solutions has also been shown to be effec- tive in both ameliorating symptoms and inhibiting recurrences of HSV infection.9


Both the oral consumption and topical application of vitamin C increase the rate of healing of herpetic ulcers. In a randomized, double-blind study, an ascorbic acid–containing pharmaceutical for- mulation (Ascoxal) applied with a soaked cotton-wool pad three times daily for 2 minutes resulted in patients reporting fewer days with scabs and fewer cases of worsening of symptoms. Cultures yielded herpes complex viruses significantly less frequently in the treatment group.10 In another study, 20 patients with herpes labialis were treated with a complex of 600 mg of water-soluble bioflavonoids and 600 mg of vitamin C given orally in equal increments three times daily. Twenty episodes of herpes labialis were treated with a complex of 1000 mg of water-soluble bioflavonoids and 1000 mg of vitamin C in equal incre- ments five times daily. Ten episodes were treated with a lactose prepa- ration. This approach was maintained for 3 days after the recognition of symptoms. The water-soluble bioflavonoid–vitamin C complex was shown to reduce vesiculation and to prevent disruption of the vesicular membrane. The therapy was most beneficial when it was initiated at the beginning of the disease. Those treated with the 1000-mg regimen saw their blisters heal in 4.4 days, compared with 10 days for the pla- cebo group. Optimal remission of symptoms was observed in 4.2 ± 1.7 days with the 600-mg dosage of the water-soluble bioflavonoid/ascor- bic acid complex.11 Vitamin C has also been employed intravenously with benefit in the treatment of patients with HSV infection, including patients with AIDS.12

## Lysine and Arginine

A lysine-rich/arginine-poor diet has become a popular treatment for HSV infections. This approach came from research showing that lysine has antiviral activity in vitro because of its antagonism of arginine metabolism.13 HSV replication requires the synthesis of arginine-rich proteins, and arginine itself is suggested to be an operon coordinate inducer.14 A preponderance of lysine over arginine is believed to act as either an allosteric enzyme inhibitor or an operon coordinate repressor. Double-blind studies on the effectiveness of lysine supplementa- tion with uncontrolled avoidance of arginine-rich foods have shown inconsistent results.14–17 These outcomes may be due to the relatively low levels of lysine used (1200 mg/day) and the severity of the cases in some of the studies (placebo and treated groups had lesions for 40% of the time in one negative study).14,15 In one study, lysine was given at a larger dosage (1 g three times daily) along with the dietary restric- tion of nuts, chocolate, and gelatin.16 At 6 months, lysine was rated as effective or very effective by 74% of those receiving lysine compared with only 28% of those receiving the placebo. The mean number of outbreaks was 3.1 in the lysine group compared with 4.2 in the placebo group. Theoretically, this approach should be effective because in vitro studies have shown that HSV replication depends on adequate levels of arginine and low levels of lysine.17 As dibasic amino acids, they com- pete with each other for intestinal transport, and rats fed a lysine-rich diet displayed a 60% decrease in brain arginine levels, although there was no change in serum levels.12 Because HSV is believed to reside in the ganglia during latency, lysine supplementation seems appropriate. In some patients, withdrawal from lysine is followed by relapse within 1 to 4 weeks.17 However, there are no published data to support the avoidance of arginine-rich foods to prevent or treat HSV. In fact, in one study, the opposite was shown to be true: arginine inactivated HSV-2 and inhibited genital HSV infection in mice.18

## Topical Preparations

## Melissa officinalis

One of the most widely used topical preparations in the treatment and prevention of herpes outbreaks is a concentrated extract (70:1) of Melissa officinalis (lemon balm). Rather than a single antiviral chem- ical, Melissa contains several components that work together to pre- vent the virus from infecting human cells. When Melissa cream was used in patients with an initial herpes infection, results from com- prehensive trials in three German hospitals and a dermatology clinic demonstrated that there was not a single recurrence.19 In other words, by using the cream, not a single patient with a first herpes outbreak developed another cold sore. Furthermore, it was noted in these studies that the Melissa cream produced an interruption of the infection and promoted healing of the herpes blisters much faster than normal. The control group receiv- ing other topical creams had a healing period of 10 days, whereas the group receiving the Melissa cream healed completely within 5 days.

## 1371CHAPTER 177 Herpes Simplex

The Melissa cream was also studied in patients suffering from recur- rent cold sores. Researchers found that if subjects used this cream regularly, they would either stop having recurrences or experience a tremendous reduction in the frequency of recurrences (an average cold sore–free period of >3.5 months).20 The Melissa cream should be applied to the lips two to four times daily during an active recurrence.20 It can be applied fairly thickly (1–2 mm). Detailed toxicology studies have demonstrated that it is extremely safe and suitable for long-term use. Extracts of other spe- cies of the Lamiaceae family have also shown in vitro efficacy against the adsorption, but not replication, of HSV-1 and HSV-2, including Mentha piperita, Prunella vulgaris, Rosmarinus officialis, Salvia officina- lis, and Thymus vulgaris.21

## Salvia officinalis

A combination of topical Salvia officinalis extract and rhubarb root extract proved to be as effective as topical acyclovir cream in a German double-blind, comparative, randomized trial of 149 patients with her- pes labialis, and the herbal combination was more effective in relieving HSV-associated pain.22

## Glycyrrhiza glabra

Another popular ingredient for the topical treatment and preven- tion of herpes outbreaks is glycyrrhetinic acid. This triterpenoid component of Glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice root) inhibits both the growth and cytopathic effects of herpes simplex as well as vaccinia, Newcastle disease, and vesicular stomatitis viruses.23 Topical gly- cyrrhetinic acid has been shown in clinical studies to be helpful in reducing the healing time and pain associated with cold sores and genital herpes.24–26

## Resveratrol

Resveratrol (3,5,4 ′ -trihydroxy-transstilbene) is a natural component of certain foods such as grape skins; it has been shown to have anti- HSV activity in vitro. Intriguing research in mice has shown that the topical application of a cream rich in resveratrol (12.5%–25%) effec- tively blocked replication of the virus and stopped lesion eruption if applied early and frequently.5,27 No human studies have been reported; however, subsequent in vitro studies have yielded data indicating that resveratrol suppresses HSV-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF)- kappaB within the nucleus and impairs the expression of essential immediate-early, early, and late HSV genes and the synthesis of viral DNA.28

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin E and Other Antioxidants

In two uncontrolled trials, topical vitamin E decreased pain and heal- ing time in oral herpes. Lesions responded best when the content of a vitamin E capsule was applied every 4 hours.29 In a clinical trial, a combination of oral acyclovir with alpha-tocopherol, selenium, L-methionine, and coenzyme Q 10 induced significantly faster healing with significantly reduced incidence of relapse compared to the con- trol group that received acyclovir alone, confirmed by decreased viral load and increased antiviral cytokine and peroxynitrite plasma levels. Plasma antioxidant capacity was also significantly higher in the com- bination group.30


The therapeutic aim is to shorten the current attack and prevent recurrences. Support of the immune system is of primary importance, necessitating control of food allergens and the optimization of nutri- ents necessary for cell-mediated immunity. Inhibition of HSV replica- tion through lysine supplementation may be useful. Strengthening the immune system can be effective in reducing the frequency, duration, and severity of recurrences.


A diet that avoids major food allergens and is rich in antioxidants is recommended.

## 1373CHAPTER 178 HIV/AIDS: Naturopathic Medical Principles and Practice

the perspective, treatment principles, and some of the treatment sug- gestions helpful. The field of HIV/AIDS medicine is rapidly changing. HIV/AIDS was only first reported to the CDC in 1981, and it has since exploded into an international pandemic. Highly active antiretrovi- ral drug therapy (HAART), introduced in 1996, is the use of multi- ple drugs in combination, with the goal of decreasing viral load and increasing CD4+ T-cell counts, thereby prolonging life and preventing the onset of complicating conditions related to the immune system decline. Although this innovation resulted in a dramatic slowing in the death rate from AIDS, with it came complicated drug side effects, drug interactions, and unique symptoms that require frequent follow-up between the patient and physician and affect the quality of life of indi- viduals on those regimens. These complications from HIV treatment have become less and less common over the past several years with the advent of new, safer, and more effective medications. In addition, changing treatment guidelines that include starting treatment on diag- nosis (vs. the older guideline of waiting until the CD4+ count drops to a low level) have resulted in patients being in a much healthier state and making actual AIDS diagnoses less and less common. Studies indicate that more than 79% of HIV+ persons are using some form of complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) in their treatment, resulting in improvements in their quality of life and bet- ter outcomes.1 The goal of this chapter is to help the physician better understand the condition and to appropriately guide this affected pop- ulation with unique and complicated health issues.

# BIOLOGY OF HIV

Two types of HIV have been identified. HIV-1 is found throughout the world. The majority of infections in the United States are caused by HIV-1. HIV-2 was first identified in West Africa in 1986 and has been found to have a genetic sequence approximately 50% similar to HIV-1. HIV-2 is considered less virulent than HIV-1 and shows lower rates of sexual and perinatal transmission and a lower viral load with a slower rate of CD4 cell decline. This results in a slower rate of disease pro- gression in infected people.2 Research shows that the virus is mutating, and multiple subtypes or clades are spreading throughout the world.1 The existence of multiple clades raises the theoretical possibility that a single individual could become infected with multiple subtypes of the virus. Research has not conclusively demonstrated the existence of a “superinfection,” but the possibility of this phenomenon would significantly enhance virulence as well as increase resistance to present treatments. Existing research has failed to isolate an intact HIV entity, although fragments believed to belong to the HIV virus have been isolated and identified. Despite this shortcoming, the virus is believed to consist of a bilayer lipid envelope covered with envelope glycoproteins (gp120 receptor and gp41 transmembrane), a viral core containing two single strands of RNA and the reverse transcriptase enzyme (needed to trans- late the viral RNA into DNA that can affect human cells), and struc- tural core proteins (p24 capsid protein and p18 matrix protein). It is believed that HIV binds to CD4-expressing cells of the immune system and, through a series of steps, is brought into the cell, replicates itself, and incorporates its genome into the host cell’s genome. The various classes of antiretroviral medications have been devel- oped to interrupt viral replication during various steps in this process. The key to understanding the mechanisms of action of the various medications is to understand those steps. Fusion is the process by which the HIV particle contacts and binds to the target cell. This occurs through the interaction of the viral gp120 and gp41 transmembrane proteins with CD4 and chemokine receptors on the cell’s membrane. Entry inhibitors are designed to inhibit this process by altering the cellular receptor sites or the process that takes the virion into the cell. Transcription occurs when the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme translates the viral RNA into a double strand of DNA. Nucleoside/ nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are designed to disrupt this process. Integration occurs when the double strand of proviral DNA migrates to the cell’s nucleus and is inserted into the host’s chromosome via the integrase enzyme. The provirus is then permanently integrated into the host DNA. It can remain essentially dormant (equilibrium of viral pro- duction and destruction) or become activated and initiate the produc- tion of large chains of new viral RNA subunits independent of the host cell’s replication process. Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (ISTIs) prevent the integrase enzyme from inserting the viral DNA into the host DNA; thus it is unable to produce new virus material. After a period of normal cell function, the infected cell becomes activated, initiating transcription of the proviral DNA into mRNA, which is then translated in the cytoplasm to produce long chains of viral polypeptides. Cleavage occurs when the protease enzyme cuts up these viral polypeptides. The pieces are then joined together to form new retroviruses. Protease inhibitors block the action of the protease enzyme and thereby prevent the reassembly of new viral polypeptides. Packaging is a poorly understood step in this process, where the new RNA viruses are wound up tightly and encapsulated into new viral particles. Budding occurs when the HIV nucleocapsid containing the new viral RNA moves to the host cell’s membrane and binds to the inside of the membrane. It is then enveloped by the membrane as it leaves the cell. As of yet, there are not any approved medications that target these steps of viral replication.

# TRANSMISSION

HIV has been found in body fluids and tissues that contain lympho- cytes. This includes blood and blood products, semen, vaginal fluids, breast milk, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, amniotic fluid, and infected tissues. It has also been found in small amounts in saliva, tears, feces, and urine. According to the CDC, the only doc- umented cases of transmission are via blood, semen, vaginal secre- tions, breast milk, and transplanted organs from an infected person. Variables affecting transmission rates include the infectivity of the source partner (higher viral load), the presence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (especially with ulcerations), and the type of contact (increased risk with anal intercourse or vaginal intercourse during menses because blood is present). The most significant routes of transmission are via sexual contact (vaginal, anal, and less frequently, oral intercourse), intravenous drug use (sharing contaminated needles and syringes), transfusion of blood or blood products (highest risk before May 1985 when screening of the blood supply in the United States for HIV began), and from an HIV- infected mother to her baby (before or during birth or through breast- feeding). Transmission can also potentially occur via percutaneous needlestick, mucous membrane exposure, or exposure of infected fluid into an open wound. Studies show the risk of seroconversion after a needlestick from an HIV+ source to be 0.25% per exposure. They also show that there have been no known seroconverters after splash expo- sure. The CDC has identified one documented case of transmission from acupuncture. There is no evidence that HIV can be transmitted via air, water, insects, or dried body fluids. Universal infection control precautions as developed by the CDC should always be employed by health care

workers to minimize the risk of HIV transmission in the health care setting. Always assume that all blood and body fluids are potentially hazardous and that all patients are potentially infected.3

# THE IMMUNE SYSTEM’S RESPONSE

Both the humoral and cellular immune systems have a role in the body’s response to HIV infection. The humoral response involves the initial production of transient immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to viral core and envelope proteins. Permanent immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies are subsequently established (this may take several weeks) to core p24 and envelop gp160, gp120, and gp41, correspond- ing to the resolution of clinical symptoms. The development of these IgG antibodies results in a rapid decrease in circulating virions and p24 antigen titers. Seroconversion occurs when the body starts making antibodies to HIV antigens and those antibodies become detectable by conventionally used laboratory tests (enzyme-linked immunoassays). There is a window of time between initial infection (when patients remain antibody-negative or seronegative as measured by EIA tests) and when seroconversion (antibody-positive or seropositive by EIA) occurs. The length of this window varies depending on the individual and can range from 10 to 14 days to 6 months. The cellular immune response is characterized by the elevation of various cytokines (includ- ing interferons and tumor necrosis factor), CD4+ lymphopenia, and CD8+ lymphocytosis. Cytotoxic T cells reduce the plasma viremia, whereas natural killer (NK) cells may be involved with killing infected T cells.

# CLINICAL PROGRESSION TO AIDS

The progression of HIV in an untreated state is broken down into three stages: stage 1 is acute HIV infection, stage 2 is clinical latency (or HIV inactivity/dormancy), and stage 3 is AIDS. The overall natural progression of HIV infection can be broken up into three types: rapid (AIDS develops within 3 years of infection and seroconversion), intermediate (AIDS develops more slowly, between 3–10 years after infection), and long-term non-progression (AIDS does not develop for >8–10 years after infection). Assuming no antiretroviral treatment, a typical scenario of HIV infection might unfold as follows: Starting with stage 1, within 2 to weeks of initial infection with the virus, an acute retroviral syndrome occurs. This resembles a common flu and is often missed in individuals without obvious risk factors or awareness about HIV. Recovery and seroconversion usually follow in 2 to 3 weeks. After recovery from the initial acute syndrome, HIV plasma concentrations decline to a viral “set point,” and equilibrium is established between the production and destruction of CD4+ cells, which denotes the beginning of stage 2 or clinical latency. The level of viral replication after acute infection and seroconversion coupled with the CD4+ count is predictive of long- term prognosis. A lower level of replication with a higher CD4+ count indicates a longer asymptomatic course. Conversely, a higher level of replication with lower CD4+ counts generally indicates a shorter asymptomatic course. Over time, a gradual decline in T-cell numbers begins with a concurrent gradual increase in the amount of virus in the body. This period can last 5 to 15 years. Eventually there are not enough T cells for the body’s immune system to function properly, and stage 3 or AIDS is the result. This is when the risk of OIs and other so-called AIDS indicator conditions increases, with the ultimate result being death.4 There are two unique groups of patients that do not follow this typi- cal scenario. The first group is termed long-term non-progressors. These individuals are thought to make up less than 5% of the total HIV+ population. They are antiretroviral naïve, their viral load remains <5000 copies/mm3, and CD4 count remains in a normal range, and they never manifest any AIDS-defining illness or OI. The second group is a subset of the long-term non-progressors called elite controllers. These individuals maintain even lower viral loads and higher CD4 counts and are thought to number approximately 1 in 200 HIV+ indi- viduals. The reasons for why these individuals are able to maintain this status are unclear (and may even be different between the two groups), but they likely involve some sort of interplay between genetic factors in the individual host and the genetics of the specific virus. Both of these groups are getting considerable attention from researchers who are working on finding a cure for HIV. Box 178.1 lists the CDC’s 2014 revised surveillance case defini- tion of AIDS for adults and children (6 years of age or older). Note that the criteria are different both for children less than 1 year old and children who are 1 to 5 years old. This definition creates stages of HIV infection based on CD4+ cell counts/percentages and/or clinical symptoms. The primary criterion used is positive serology (i.e., positive for antibodies to HIV or the presence of p24 antigen via fourth-generation HIV 1/0/2 antigen/ antibody test and/or pos- itive HIV antigen detection via polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or another specific HIV antigen test). Given a positive serology, a diag- nosis of stage 3 HIV or AIDS is given when CD4+ counts fall below 200/mm3 (<14%), any of the noted AIDS-defining conditions occurs, or both.5 Clinically, patients tend to be susceptible to certain complications (both infectious and noninfectious) on the basis of their CD4+ cell counts.6 Although there is always individual variation, these data are helpful in predicting probable clinical presentations. Generally, lower CD4+ cell count and/or a higher viral load represents a greater risk for complications and should always be factored into any such consider- ation. It is notable that these issues are becoming less and less com- mon, given the current standard of care and the use of antiretroviral medications by most patients. • When the CD4+ cell count is greater than 500/mm3, a patient could manifest acute retroviral syndrome, candidal vaginitis, persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL), Guillain–Barré syndrome, myopathy, or aseptic meningitis. • When the CD4+ count is between 200 and 500/mm3, possible com- plications include pneumococcal or other bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, herpes zoster, oropharyngeal candidiasis/ thrush, cryptosporidiosis (self-limited), Kaposi sarcoma, oral hairy leukoplakia, cervical and anal dysplasia/cancer, B-cell lymphoma, anemia, mononeuritis multiplex, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or lymphocytic interstitial pneu- monitis. • When the CD4+ count is below 200/mm3, complications might include Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (previously known as PCP pneumonia), disseminated histoplasmosis and coccidioi- domycosis, miliary/extrapulmonary tuberculosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), wasting, peripheral neu- ropathy, HIV-associated dementia, cardiomyopathy, vacuolar myelopathy, progressive polyradiculopathy, or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. • When the CD4+ count is below 100/mm3, complications might include disseminated herpes simplex, toxoplasmosis, cryptococco- sis, chronic cryptosporidiosis, microsporidiosis, or candidal esoph- agitis. • When the CD4+ count is below 50/mm3, complications might include disseminated cytomegalovirus (CMV), disseminated Myco- bacterium avium complex (MAC), or central nervous system lym- phoma.

# DIAGNOSIS AND WORKUP

<!-- chunk -->

## Diagnostic Testing

Box 178.2 lists the most recent CDC guidelines for HIV testing (from 2006 and 2017).7,8 These guidelines advise routine HIV screening of adults, adolescents, and pregnant women in health care settings in the United States. The recommendations also call for reducing barriers to HIV testing. In April 2013 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued similar recommendations. Standard serological testing for the presence of HIV begins with the fourth-generation HIV 1/0/2 antigen/antibody test that uses synthetic peptide or recombinant protein antigens to detect IgM and IgG anti- bodies (via enzyme-linked immunoassay technique) and monoclonal antibodies to detect the presence of p24 antigen. If this is positive, then a reflex test is done to distinguish HIV-1 from HIV-2 infection. The inclusion of p24 antigen detection in HIV screening has allowed for a positive result to be found 3 to 5 days before seroconversion (when HIV-specific antibodies begin to appear), thus allowing for earlier detection of an infection than was previously possible with the earlier test methods. This test has a sensitivity of between 99.76% and 100% for HIV-1 and 100% for HIV-2.9 A number of rapid HIV tests have been developed and are currently approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They all use similar technology to detect antibodies and vary in cate- gory assigned by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) from “waived” to “moderately complex.” Options include Chembio DPP HIV-1/2, Chembio Sure Check HIV1/2 Assag, Clearview HIV 1/2 Stat-Pak, Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo Test, INSTI HIV-1/HIV-2 Rapid Antibody Test, MedMira Reveal G3 Rapid HIV-1 Antibody Test, OraQuick Advance Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test, and Uni-Gold Recombigen HIV.10,11 Additionally, there are self-administered tests that have been FDA approved.

Health Corp. (www.HomeAccess.com/shop) produces a kit to detect HIV-1 where the specimen is self-obtained at home and mailed in for analysis. Results are available by phone as soon as the next business day. The OraQuick In-Home HIV Test provides results at home in minutes. These tests use either whole blood, serum, plasma, or oral fluids and have sensitivity and specificity rates of 99% to 100%.12–14 If an HIV screening test is negative and risk factors suggest likely infection, the test should be repeated at 6-week, 3-month, and 6-month intervals. There is no reason to repeat if one of those tests comes back positive. Although routine testing is now recommended, HIV testing remains voluntary and should be performed only with the patient’s knowledge and understanding. Patients should be informed either orally or in writing of testing recommendations and that testing will be performed unless they decline (termed “opt-out” screening). A patient’s decision to decline an HIV test should be documented in the medical record. It is recommended that HIV screening consent be incorporated into the patient’s general informed consent for medical care form in the same way other screening or diagnostic tests are. A separate consent form for HIV testing is not recommended. Risk screening should be incorporated into routine primary care and risk reduction counseling offered as applicable. All states require that newly diagnosed cases of HIV/AIDS be reported to local health departments and that providers have case reporting forms available.

## Medical History

Initiation of care of an HIV+ patient should begin with a standard medical history, including a detailed diet history, exercise patterns, and a complete review of systems. A number of additional historical details should be obtained as well (Box 178.3).

## Laboratory Assessment and Monitoring

Basic initial screening tests for all HIV+ patients should include a com- plete blood count (CBC) and a fasting serum chemistry panel (to mon- itor liver, kidney, and pancreatic function; electrolytes; blood proteins; glucose; and lipids). The baseline serum albumin level can serve as an independent predictor of prognosis in HIV+ women.15 Additional testing should include a urinalysis, screening for STDs (syphilis, herpes simplex, Chlamydia, and gonorrhea—including oral/urinary/rectal areas), hepatitis (A, B, and C), toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and vari- cella (if unknown history of chickenpox or shingles). An optional test is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (based on risk factors).13 Female patients should have regular Pap smears with initial testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) because there is a significant increase in cervical cancer rates in HIV+ women.16 A recent development is the use of the anal Pap smear in male patients engaging in anal sex. Anal squamous cell cancer is similar to cervical cancer in that it is caused by HPV infec- tion, and rates are significantly increased in HIV+ men compared with the general population. Currently, there continues to be controversy about the use of this test, with no clear consensus on whether to make it part of routine screening.13 Studies are ongoing, which should help clarify this. One such study is the multicenter Anchor Study, begun in 2017 and involving 5058 participants over an 8-year study period. The goal of the study is to determine whether routine anal screening, detection, and removal of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) will reduce the occurrence of more severe anal cancers in HIV+ men.17 HIV-specific testing includes measurement of viral load and T-cell counts as part of the initial evaluation and then at 3- to 6-month intervals. The viral load test detects the presence of viral RNA in the plasma or DNA in white blood cells (WBCs) and uses PCR branched- chain DNA (bDNA) or nucleic acid sequence–based amplification technology. A number of viral load tests exist, with varying levels of sensitivity. The most sensitive test currently available detects virus to 20 copies per cubic millimeter of plasma.18 Below any specific test’s threshold, the viral load is deemed “undetectable.” This means that the virus may still exist but in concentrations in the blood below the ability of the given test to detect. Additionally, note that these assays are not reflective of viral presence or concentration in body compart- ments beyond the blood (e.g., tissues, cerebrospinal fluid, breast milk, seminal fluid, vaginal fluid). Other key tests involve T-cell counts. CD4+ helper cells and CD8+ suppressor cells are quantified (absolute numbers and relative CMV, Cytomegalovirus; EBV, Epstein–Barr virus; HAART, highly active antiretroviral drug therapy; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; HPV, human papillomavirus; IV, intravenous; OI, opportunistic infection.

percentages), along with the CD4:CD8 ratio. These tests are known as CD4:CD8 ratio panels. This information is used to stage HIV, pre- dict susceptibility to various OIs, and monitor response to antiretro- viral therapy. Many factors can influence CD4+ cell counts, including total WBCs, acute infection, certain medications (e.g., corticosteroids, interferon), and other medical conditions. There are also seasonal and diurnal variations in these counts. In 2014, the guidelines on HIV-specific testing were altered as a reflection of the success of HAART. Once a person’s CD4+ count is above 500 cells/mm3, his or her immune system is thought to be fully reconstituted and functional. As long as the CD4+ count has remained above 500 cells/mm3 and he or she has had an undetectable viral load for 2 years, then continuing to check the CD4+ count is now consid- ered optional. From this time on, all that is now checked is HIV viral load once yearly, and as long as this remains undetectable, then the CD4+ is expected to stay stable and in a safe range. If the viral load becomes consistently detectable, then it would become necessary to check CD4+ cell counts again.19 Resistance to antiretroviral medications is a growing problem in treatment-naive patients and remains a potential problem in patients already undergoing this therapy. Therefore resistance testing is now recommended at the time of diagnosis as part of baseline screening as well as before changing therapy because of the failure of a current regi- men. Two types of tests are available: genotypic and phenotypic. There are advantages and disadvantages to each, but in general, this testing can help identify antiviral medications that the patient might be either resistant or susceptible to and thereby allow the physician to formulate the most effective medication regimen.13

## Medical Management of HIV and AIDS

The medical understanding and treatment of HIV/AIDS continue to evolve. AIDS is a complex, multifactorial disease that has both immunodeficiency and autoimmune inflammatory aspects involving virtually every system of the body. HIV enters the body and infects CD4+-expressing cells of the immune system. It inserts itself into cellu- lar DNA and can lie dormant indefinitely. Those cells can be activated for the reproduction and multiplication of HIV virions by antigens, oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokines, and overstressed liver detoxification and immune systems. Conventional medical management of HIV/AIDS revolves around the following treatment principles: • Frequent monitoring, including laboratory and physical examina- tion • Vaccinations administered as appropriate (may include hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, mumps-measles-rubella [MMR], pneu- monia tetanus-diphtheria, varicella, HPV, and travel-related vac- cines)13 • HAART for inactivation or slowing HIV replication and increasing CD4+ cell counts • Antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with abnormally low CD4 lym- phocyte counts • Antimicrobial treatment of OIs • Symptomatic care of HIV- or HAART-induced adverse drug reac- tions • Radiation, chemotherapy, or both for HIV-related neoplasms • Psychosocial support via counseling, clinical social work, and med- ication Up-to-date resources should always be consulted before mak- ing any management decisions. The AIDS information website, administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (https://aidsinfo.nih.gov), provides an excellent resource for under- standing all aspects of HIV/AIDS, including determining the most up-to-date conventional treatment guidelines as well as information on prevention, FDA-approved and investigational drugs, clinical trials, and vaccinations. Another fine resource is the Johns Hopkins HIV Guide (https://www.hopkinsguides.com/hopkins/index/Johns _Hopkins_HIV_Guide). This HIV guide provides detailed infor- mation on the diagnosis and management of HIV and its associated OIs, medications, and resistance. Note that some areas of the site require a subscription for access. Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine/Knowledge Source Solutions LLC also publishes a helpful text called the Medical Management of HIV Infection (2012, 16th ed, by J. G. Bartlett, J. E. Gallant, and P. A. Pham). It can be ordered online. Excellent resources also exist for both clinician and patient education. These include the websites www.positivelyaware.com, www.poz.com, and www.thebody.com. These sites each have their strengths, but all have valuable information on various aspects of HIV, including signs, symptoms, conventional treatments, detailed drug information, some patient-centered complementary treatments, as well as future possibil- ities for treatment.

## HIV Prevention Strategy and the Continuum of Care

Over the past several years, with the success and availability of HAART medications throughout the world, there has been a shift in focus in HIV care and management from how to cope with so many very sick people to thinking about how we can prevent of the further spread of HIV. This has resulted in a strategy known as “treatment as preven- tion.” It is based on recent studies showing that if a person’s HIV viral load is undetectable, then there is an extremely low risk of that per- son having enough free virus in his or her system to infect someone else.20 Worldwide, the strategy for prevention of HIV spread is known as “90/90/90,” and the goal is to have it implemented by the year 2020. This means that 90% of people who are HIV+ will know it. And of those, 90% will be on antiretroviral therapy. And of those, 90% will have an undetectable viral load. Therefore those HIV+ individuals who are being treated and undetectable will not be vectors for the further spread of the disease. This will ultimately result in far fewer new infections. In the United States this prevention strategy is effectively being implemented by targeting at-risk populations with education about transmission, getting at-risk people tested regularly (to identify indi- viduals who are positive), and then getting into care when there is a positive test result. The National HIV Care Continuum has identified and monitors the steps required from the time a person is diagnosed with HIV to achieve viral suppression. It involves testing to achieve the diagnosis; linking them to care; and making sure they are engaged in and retained in care, that they are prescribed and take antiretroviral therapy, and they get to the point where they are virally suppressed and remain that way.21 The other key piece of the worldwide prevention strategy is the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). In the United States the CDC first issued guidelines about PrEP use in 2012, and they have since gone through some minor revisions, but the principle and use are unchanged. The concept is that a person who is HIV negative but at risk for contracting HIV takes a daily antiretroviral medication (initially approved with Truvada and now Descovy is an option as well; both are discussed in the section on antiretroviral therapy that follows) that prevents them from becoming infected should they be exposed to the virus. This implementation of this strategy was initially based on four key studies, the iPrEx, TDF2, Partners PrEP, and Bangkok Tenofovir studies.22–25 These studies variously followed both heterosexual and homosexual discordant couples and men and women using intrave- nous drugs in multiple locations. All the studies showed a significant

## 1378SECTION 6 Diseases

reduction in risk of acquiring a new HIV infection—up to 92%, with the best results coming with rigorous adherence to the regime of daily use. Based on this, PrEP has become a key HIV prevention recom- mendation in high-risk individuals. The CDC maintains excellent resources with regard to PrEP for both consumers and providers. This includes detailed instructions on how to administer Truvada and how to monitor patients.24 Note that regular HIV testing (every 3 months) is part of the process because it is critical that any individual who has contracted the virus despite the PrEP be identified so that they can be placed on effective HAART treatment (Truvada alone is insufficient and is likely to lead to resistance issues). Note also that the use of bar- rier methods such as condoms is still recommended to protect against other sexually transmitted infections as well as further lower the risk of HIV transmission. On October 3, 2019 the FDA approved a second medication, Descovy, for PrEP. Descovy is similar to Truvada in that it contains two similar medications but with one of them being a safer variant. The approval was based on preliminary data from the ongoing DISCOVER trial. In this multi-year phase 3 trail, 5300 HIV at-risk cisgender men having sex with men and transgender women having sex with men were provided with PrEP with either Truvada or Descovy. After weeks, Descovy was found to be non-inferior to Truvada in preventing HIV infection. Efficacy was strongly correlated with daily dosing. Note that Descovy also has advantages over Truvada in areas of renal safety and bone density. While Truvada will end up being more economical than Descovy due to its age, Descovy could be an excellent option for any individual with renal or bone density issues.26 For the naturopathic physician, practical actions toward preven- tion can include the following: • Talk to patients about sex to determine risk factors, educate about how HIV and other sexually transmitted infections are transmitted, and educate about safer sex practices. • Recommend HIV testing at appropriate intervals based on individ- ual risk factors and CDC guidelines. • Recommend PrEP as appropriate. This includes helping patients to access the medication should they desire to use it.

## Naturopathic Management of HIV and AIDS

The naturopathic medical management of HIV and AIDS revolves around a number of treatment principles that should guide the phy- sician in helping patients to optimize their health, slow disease pro- gression, improve their quality of life, and improve immune function. Specific goals include the following: • Enhance overall integration with primary care physicians and build a caregiving team. • Complement and enhance the positive effects of conventional medical treatment and minimize the negative effects. • Establish a foundation of health and wellness on the basis of natu- ropathic principles. • Establish a core nutrient protocol: • Replace nutrient deficiencies known to exist with HIV. • Provide other nutrients to support optimal immune function. • Provide therapies to address constitutional symptoms, medication side effects, and symptoms of immunosuppression. • Provide specific antiviral therapy and immunomodulation using other, nondrug treatments.

## Enhance Overall Integration With Primary Care Physicians

## and Build a Caregiving Team

In the area of HIV, naturopathic physicians should lead the effort to optimize integrated care. A holistic provider who identifies advantages of all available treatments and encourages positive relationships with all available providers creates a unique and trusting relationship with patients who have often experienced lifetimes of fear, discrimination, victimization, and abuse. Naturopathic medicine offers an important opportunity to empower HIV+ patients. One of the first priorities is to ensure that each HIV+ patient has a complete care-providing team beginning with a conventional Western medicine HIV specialist. HIV specialists ensure the accessibility of HAART and have the greatest familiarity with the multitude of signs, symptoms, adverse reactions, and other issues unique to the HIV+ population. A growing body of literature reports that HIV+ patients have better objective indices of health (low viral load and high CD4 counts), better compliance with medications, and better long-term survival when they work with HIV specialists.27,28 The specialist’s obligations constitute a full-time job, preclud- ing many other aspects of care that have demonstrated efficacy for the overall health of HIV+ patients. Additional providers can support HIV+ patients with general health and lifestyle promotion, specific nutrient and other nondrug recommendations, social ser- vices, psychoneuroimmunological support, counseling, personal empowerment, and end-of-life care. In fact, although naturopathic physicians might be legally able to prescribe prophylactic antimi- crobial therapy and HAART in a growing number of states, the greater need is to provide nondrug holistic care in the areas just mentioned.

## Negative Effects

One of the paradigms of natural/preventative/holistic medicine is to minimize the need for higher-force (drug, surgery, radiation) inter- ventions. This goal remains valid in the care of patients with HIV, but there are no therapies known to be as effective as HAART in suppress- ing viral load or increasing CD4 T-lymphocyte cell numbers. CAM providers may be the best practitioners to teach HIV+ patients that there are no realistic s“alternatives” to HAART. Some HIV+ patients may never need HAART, and others may be resistant to HAART, but the option of HAART should always be considered, and its use is the current standard of care; therefore it should not be discouraged. With or without HAART, there is sig- nificant evidence that HIV+ patients receive many benefits from nondrug therapies.29 Naturopathic physicians must actively under- stand, integrate, and use the entire therapeutic order (most subtle, lower-force through most high-force, often-invasive therapies) to ensure that each patient has the best options to maximize his or her quality of life as well as length of life. Finally, physicians working with HIV must stay current with the global effort to find solutions for this pandemic to provide the best possible treatment options to match patients’ short-term needs while also including strategic health goals and future possibilities. Factors to be considered in the holistic care of HIV+ patients include complications (from immune suppression) of health chal- lenges that existed before HIV infection. In addition, the social, psy- chological, and spiritual challenges that exist with the diagnosis of HIV create a need for health care that extends far beyond the best drug or nutrient necessary for optimal health. Holistic physicians have a vital role in the care of each patient with HIV. The majority of HIV+ patients in North America are using HAART. Many of those same patients are also using CAM therapies. Therefore one of the first priorities of the naturopathic provider should be to ensure that the patient is safe from adverse drug–nutrient interactions. To

ensure safety, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of HAART as well as those of common nutrients being used by HIV+ patients.

## Conventional Treatment: Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy

The use of HAART has been the standard of care in HIV treatment since 1996 when multiple classes of medications came into existence and it was found that using multiple drugs of multiple classes was more effective at suppressing HIV virus as well as preventing resistance issues than single drug/class regimes. In terms of when to start HAART, the risks of OIs and other seri- ous complications increase exponentially when CD4 cell counts drop below 200/ μ L. Until 2015, the standard of care was to initiate HAART when the CD4 count dropped below 350/ μ L in asymptomatic patients, those with an AIDS-defining illness (regardless of CD4 count), preg- nant women, patients with HIV-associated nephropathy, or hepatitis B coinfection (when treatment of the hepatitis is indicated). HAART initiation could be considered when CD4 cell counts are greater than 350/ μ L in discordant relationships (one partner is HIV+ and the other HIV−), rapid CD4 decline, advanced age, or high viral load (more than 100,000 copies per milliliter).30 In September 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) pub- lished new guidelines on the treatment and prevention of HIV infec- tion (http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/earlyrelease-arv/en/). The main outcome of these new recommendations is that HAART should be initiated in most patients upon diagnosis. This was based on two studies, the START Study (Strategic Timing of Anti-Retroviral Treatment Trial) and the HPTN 052 Trial (HIV Prevention Trials Network 052 study).20,31,32 These were large studies at multiple sites around the world. The START study concluded that immediate initia- tion of antiretroviral therapy significantly reduced both AIDS-related and non–AIDS-related adverse events in that population. The HPTN 052 study concluded that antiretroviral therapy is highly effective at preventing heterosexual transmission of HIV if viral suppression is achieved and maintained in the positive partner. From this, the WHO issued the new guidelines recommending HAART be initiated in everyone upon diagnosis (with some case-specific caveats). The U.S. guidelines (published July 14, 2016) made similar recommendations for HAART initiation.33 The choice of specific antiretrovirals for either initial regimens or the modification of existing therapy is complex, and there are many factors to consider. Additionally, the guidelines change frequently. The best resource for the most current recommendations is the “Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Adults and Adolescents Living with HIV,” available on the AIDS information website https://aidsinfo .nih.gov/guidelines/html/1/adult-and-adolescent-arv/0. The most recent guidelines were updated as of May 30, 2018. Six main classes of HAART are currently being used in the care of HIV+ patients in various combinations designed to disrupt the life cycle of the virus at multiple junctures.30 These include the following: • Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs, or “nukes”) • Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs, or “non- nukes”) • Protease inhibitors (PIs) • Entry inhibitors (including fusion inhibitors, CCR5 inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies) • Integrase strand transfer inhibitors • Pharmacokinetic enhancers Over the past several years, a number of single-tablet, fixed-dose, multiclass formulations have been developed. This has helped to sim- plify dosing and decrease pill burden for patients using HAART. These single-tablet regimens (STRs) are rapidly becoming the most com- monly used forms of HAART as of 2019. As a result of the rapidly evolving resistance of HIV to specific drugs, there has historically been great pressure to quickly develop and approve new medications. As a result, many HAART medications have been generally fast-tracked through the FDA approval process. Therefore new drugs have been typically prescribed as soon as they are approved and usually before the full extent of their adverse reac- tions are known. Because the adverse drug reactions and interactions with HAART are myriad and potentially quite harmful, the clinician is advised to consult up-to-date resources to determine specific issues with each individual medication.

## Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors. NRTIs

were the first class of antiretroviral drugs approved for use in the United States by the FDA. These drugs work during the transcription phase of the HIV life cycle by competitive inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), leading to DNA chain termination. Nucleoside (or nucleotide) analogues act as substrates and bind to the active site of the RT enzyme. Then they are added to the new chain of DNA. Once they have been inserted, the normal links between pieces of the chain will not form, and the viral chain will be terminated without being inserted into the cell’s DNA. The following is a list of NRTIs; all are nucleoside analogues except tenofovir, which is the only nucleotide analogue that is FDA-approved: • 3TC: lamivudine (Epivir) • ABC: abacavir (Ziagen; patient must be HLA-B*5701 negative if used) • AZT: azidothymidine, zidovudine (Retrovir; the first FDA- approved HIV medication in 1986) • DDC: zalcitabine (Hivid; no longer manufactured) • DDI: didanosine (Videx, Videx EC) • D4T: stavudine (Zerit) • FTC: emtricitabine (Emtriva) • TDF: tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread, a nucleotide) • TAF: tenofovir alafenamide (a “prodrug” form of TDF) As of 2019, it is extremely rare to see AZT, DDC, DDI, or D4T used because there are many safer and easier-to-use alternatives. There are several combination formulations of NRTIs in existence: • Trizivir: 3TC, AZT, and ABC (no longer in use) • Combivir: 3TC and AZT (no longer in use) • Epzicom: 3TC and ABC • Truvada: FTC and TDF • Descovy: FTC and TAF • Cimduo: 3TC and TDF Truvada and, as of October 2019, Descovy have both been approved for use as PrEP for individuals in high-risk categories of exposure to HIV. Either one is given as a single tablet once daily. Daily use is important for maintaining efficacy. In April of 2016 the FDA approved tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) for use. It is a “prodrug” form of TDF that is used in much lower doses and becomes activated once it’s inside individual cells. It has a reduced pro- file of adverse effects versus its predecessor, TDF, which can affect kidney function as well as create problems with bone mineral density. The TAF form alleviates these issues. TAF is not available as a stand-alone but is found along with FTC as Descovy (as well as some specific single-tablet formulations). It is approved for the same uses as Truvada in HIV infec- tion but is not approved for PrEP or post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). NRTIs have effectively become the “backbone” of all HAART regimes. Unless there are resistance issues, every regime will contain Truvada, Descovy, or Epzicom, either directly or as part of an STR. The NRTIs are fairly well tolerated after introduction (initial mild to severe nausea usually resolves), with minimal long-term adverse

## 1380SECTION 6 Diseases

effects. Exceptions include AZT and the remaining “D” drugs (DDI and D4T). A common side effect of AZT is bone marrow suppres- sion, leading to macrocytic anemia.34 The D drugs are less commonly used today except in the case of multidrug resistance. They have been associated with mild to severe peripheral neuropathy and, of greater concern, pancreatitis.35 These side effects manifest secondary to neural inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase and reduced mitochondrial DNA content.36 Therefore patients who have been on D drug therapy should be provided with ample mitochondrial sup- port. Acetyl-l-carnitine, coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10 ), essential fatty acids (EFAs), α -lipoic acid, and B vitamins have been shown to decrease signs or progression of these side effects when taken in large doses.37–41 Additionally, the thymidine analogues (d4T, ddI, AZT) have been associated with lipoatrophy, also as a result of mitochondrial toxic- ity. Because the NRTIs have been on the market longer than the other drugs, it is no surprise that they are backed with the greatest amount of research regarding nutrient interactions. Although there are no studies indicating that vitamins or other nutrients deplete AZT, there is evi- dence that AZT may deplete cellular levels of carnitine, copper, zinc, and vitamin B 12 .42,43 With the exception of carnitine, these nutrients can be found in a good hypoallergenic multivitamin/multimineral supplement. In addition to deficiency caused by NRTI drugs, carnitine deficiency has been found in HIV+ patients not on HAART. Further, there are many other indications for carnitine in patients with HIV, making this nutrient a high priority for supplementation. Some nutrients have been found to enhance the efficacy of NRTIs when taken in combination with these drugs, including vitamin E, zinc, and folate.44–46 These nutrients are easily supplemented through a nutritious diet full of whole grains, colorful vegetables, and fruits and a good multivitamin/multimineral supplement. Overall, NRTIs are fairly well tolerated, and some have the additional benefit of being active against hepatitis B virus (3TC, FTC, TDF).47–49

## Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The second

class of HAART comprises the NNRTIs. NNRTIs also affect the transcription process and work by allosterically binding to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and inhibiting both RNA- and DNA-directed DNA polymerase functions of the RT enzyme. The following is a list of the NNRTIs: • EFV: efavirenz (Sustiva) • ETV: etravirine (Intelence) • DLV: delavirdine (Rescriptor; rarely used) • NVP: nevirapine (Viramune XR) • DOR: doravirine (Pifeltro) • RPV: rilpivirine (Edurant) NNRTI drugs are also fairly well tolerated after introduction, with low long-term toxicity. Other than an initial transient mild to severe skin rash, typical side effects (depending on the specific drug) include insomnia, abnormal dreams, elevated liver enzymes, and gynecomas- tia (all manageable with naturopathic support).50–52 Resistance to this class of HAART can occur easily if the viral load is unsuppressed, so this type of medication may not be an optimal choice for someone who is inconsistent with taking medications. No nutrients are known to be depleted by NNRTIs or to enhance their efficacy. Large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown that when used in combination with NRTIs, NNRTIs pro- duce sustained reductions in plasma viral loads and improvements in immunological responses.53–56 The advantages of this type of proto- col include the fewest number of side effects, excellent long-term viral suppression, and ease of dosing (fewer pills).

<!-- chunk -->

## Protease inhibitors. The third class of HAART is the PIs. PIs

intervene during the cleavage part of the viral life cycle by binding competitively to the substrate site of the viral protease (the enzyme responsible for the posttranslational processing), resulting in inhibition of the enzyme and the production of immature virus particles. The following is a list of the PIs: • ATV: atazanavir (Reyataz) • DRV: darunavir (Prezista) • FPV: fosamprenavir (Lexiva) • IDV: indinavir (Crixivan) • LPV-r: lopinavir + ritonavir (Kaletra; fixed-dose combination) • NFV: nelfinavir (Viracept) • SQV: saquinavir (Invirase) • TPV: tipranavir (Aptivus) Although PIs are effective at viral suppression, they are associated with the greatest number and most significant adverse drug reactions, and as of 2018, with the availability of equally effective classes with much fewer adverse reactions, they are being used less frequently. Adverse reactions include chronic and persistent gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities; lipodystrophy and lipoatrophy; elevations of choles- terol and triglycerides; insulin resistance leading to diabetes; and liver, kidney, and musculoskeletal complaints. Note that PIs are typically used in a “boosted” form. That is, they are given along with another class of HAART called a pharmacokinetic enhancer that inhibits the enzyme responsible for their metabolism and thereby raises their blood levels and their effectiveness. They have traditionally been given as two separate medications; however, there are three single-tablet combinations available. Kaletra (lopinavir + ritonavir) is the oldest example of this. Newer options include Evotaz (atazanavir + cobicistat) and Prezcobix (darunavir + cobicistat). In understanding these “boosted” forms of HAART, it is essential to realize that NNRTIs and PIs work by inhibiting cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme metabolism. Inhibition of this enzyme slows down the meta- bolic breakdown of the drug and effectively prolongs higher blood lev- els, which results in better viral suppression. Many foods, nutrients, and botanicals have been known to upregulate this enzyme function, and two have gained noteworthy attention. Some small studies (of fewer than subjects) in healthy HIV-negative (HIV−) individuals as well as in vitro studies have demonstrated that garlic and St. John’s wort decrease NNRTI and PI drug levels. In the human trials, subjects initiated NNRTI or PI therapy to establish the drug levels theoretically necessary to suppress viral load. Garlic or St. John’s wort was then introduced at levels typically used for therapeutic effect. Blood levels were then measured and found to be lower than the levels believed to be necessary to maintain optimal viral suppression. Garlic or St. John’s wort was then discontinued and NNRTI or PI blood levels subsequently measured and found to be back in the therapeutic range.57–60 Although these studies certainly do not conclusively demonstrate that garlic and St. John’s wort interfere with HAART viral suppression (small number of participants, single antiret- roviral vs. typical multidrug HAART protocol, HIV− vs. HIV+, drug- naive vs. long-term HAART), these therapies should be avoided in patients with HIV on HAART. The lesson learned from these studies is to be intimately aware of the mechanisms of action when adding new non- drug therapies intended for patients on multidrug treatments. The poten- tial for drug–nutrient interactions also should encourage and reinforce the use of the multitude of low-force interventions (e.g., diet, lifestyle, homeopathy, physical medicine, counseling) for conditions commonly treated by garlic or St. John’s wort to avoid potentially decreasing NNRTI or PI blood levels and risking increases in drug resistance. Milk thistle may be considered for the treatment of significant gas- trointestinal (GI) and liver complications with PIs. To date, there have been several studies investigating the drug interactions of this herb. In one with 10 HIV−, drug-naive patients taking milk thistle at 175 mg three times daily, investigators concluded that milk thistle did not sig- nificantly alter blood levels of indinavir despite a decrease of as much

## 1381CHAPTER 178 HIV/AIDS: Naturopathic Medical Principles and Practice

as 25% in trough levels.61 Another study showed no effect on indinavir levels in healthy subjects.62 Yet another tested cellular uptake of ritona- vir in the presence of various herbal substances including milk thistle (silybinin) and found no change in the efflux of ritonavir or any effect on CYP 3A4.63 An in vivo study with coadministration of nifedipine and silymarin in 16 healthy male volunteers concluded that silymarin is not a potent CYP 3A4 inhibitor in vivo.64 Silymarin was also found to be safe with other PI combinations.65 The best study to date involved 15 HIV+ individuals taking daruna- vir and ritonavir as it is actually used in practice (600/100 mg twice daily) and giving them silymarin (150 mg three times daily) for days. High-performance gas-liquid chromatography was used to measure serum concentrations of the darunavir before and at regu- lar intervals after its ingestion through to 12 hours after taking it. Values were compared between day 0 and day 14. This study’s findings showed no effect on the serum concentrations of darunavir from the silymarin. Therefore it was concluded that coadministration of sily- marin with darunavir/ritonavir was safe and no dose modifications were necessary.65 Currently, there is no evidence suggesting that milk thistle should be avoided by HIV+ patients on HAART. No nutrients are known to be depleted by PIs or to enhance their efficacy. However, if GI side effects are present, it could lead to micro- and macronutrient deficiencies.

## Entry inhibitors. There are now three classes of entry inhibitors:

fusion inhibitors, chemokine coreceptor antagonists (CCR5 inhibitors), and monoclonal antibodies. They are designed to prevent the HIV virion from initially entering the CD4+ cell through its membrane. The following is a list of the entry inhibitors: • ENF: T-20 or enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) • MVC: maraviroc (Selzentry) • IBA: ibalizumab (Trogarzo) ENF, T-20, or enfuvirtide (Fuzeon), is a fusion inhibitor that was approved by the FDA in 2003. It blocks the fusion of the virus with the target-cell membrane by binding with cell receptor gp41 proteins and thereby preventing the virus from entering the cell. This drug is unique because it is the only HAART medication administered via injection (two subcutaneous injections per day into the upper arm, thigh, or abdomen). Because of its cost and difficulty of use, Fuzeon was used only as “last resort” or salvage therapy during the mid-2000s in heav- ily treatment-experienced individuals in the presence of extensive viral resistance and is not designed to be used alone. With the approval of numerous new medications, Fuzeon is no longer used. It was fairly well tolerated, with the exception of injection-site irritation, allergic reactions, and an increased risk of bacterial pneumonia. There are no known drug–nutrient interactions of any clinical significance. MVC, or maraviroc (Selzentry), is a chemokine coreceptor antago- nist (CCR5 inhibitor) approved by the FDA in 2007. After HIV binds to CD4 receptors on the T-cell membrane, it then binds to one of two coreceptors, CCR5 or CXCR4. MVC is an antagonist that specifically blocks CCR5 coreceptors and prevents HIV from binding to them so that it cannot enter the cell. The limitation with this drug is that different viruses may express various coreceptors: CCR5, CXCR4, or both. A relatively expensive test called a tropism assay must be run in any individual in whom the use of MVC is being considered. This test determines whether the specific virus present binds to CCR5, CXCR4, or both types of receptors. MVC will be effective only in a patient with a CCR5-tropic virus. Significant possible side effects include an allergic reaction (rash) and liver toxicity. Other side effects can include cough, fever, cold, muscle/joint pain, stomach pain, and dizziness. If MVC is used, doses of other medications may have to be adjusted (including but not limited to NNRTIs, PIs, oral contraceptives, certain other anti- microbials). Another potential issue is that other cells of the immune system exhibit CCR5 receptors, and MVC may affect them and poten- tially increase the risk of other infections and cancers. As of the date of writing, this has not been seen in clinical trials. IBA or ibalizumab (Trogarzo) is a monoclonal antibody approved for use in HIV by the FDA in March 2018. It is the first of this type of biologic medication approved for use as a treatment for HIV. It was specifically approved for use in individuals with multiple resistances to other HIV medications. It is not approved for use other than in this multidrug-resistance scenario. It works by binding to CD4 receptors on the T-lymphocytes and interferes with HIV from properly binding to those same receptors, thus blocking HIV’s entry into the cell. Notably, it does not interfere with the CD4 lymphocyte’s normal functioning. It is administered by intravenous infusion, with a single initial loading dose of 2000 mg, followed by 800 mg infusions every 2 weeks. It must be combined with other oral antiretrovirals, and resistance testing is imperative to identify those medications with at least some anti-HIV activity to ensure success. The main common side effects include diar- rhea, dizziness, nausea, and rash. It can also trigger immune reconsti- tution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The most common laboratory abnormalities include creatinine and bilirubin elevations. There are no known drug interactions between Trogarzo and other medications (including the HIV antiretrovirals).

## Integrase strand transfer inhibitors. ISTIs are one of the newer

classes of antiretroviral medications, first approved for use by the FDA in 2007. These drugs disrupt the integrase enzyme, which facilitates the incorporation of HIV DNA into human DNA in the T cell and thereby prevents viral replication at that site. Four ISTIs currently exist: • RAL: raltegravir (Isentress) • DTG: dolutegravir (Tivicay) • EVG: elvitegravir (Vitekta; no longer available as a stand-alone; found only in the STRs Genvoya and Stribild) • BIC: bictegravir (approved by the FDA in February 2018 as part of a new STR medication; it will likely not be approved as a stand- alone) Both RAL and DTG are used quite extensively in many multidrug regimes. ISTIs are relatively well tolerated, are easy to take, and have demon- strated a remarkable ability to increase CD4 counts and drop viral load to undetectable levels in highly treatment-experienced patients with significant resistance issues. They are now part of many first-line initial regimes based on this effectiveness and tolerability. The most com- mon side effects include diarrhea, nausea, headache, and fever. Some other possible issues may include hypersensitivity reaction, anemia, and liver toxicity. They are metabolized by glucuronidation, and there is no interaction with the CYP450 system. Care should be taken with any drug that affects glucuronidation. Divalent cations (calcium, mag- nesium, zinc, iron) can bind ISTIs and can potentially interfere with absorption and activity. This includes vitamins, minerals, and antacids containing any of these minerals, and it is recommended that ISTIs not be taken with 2 hours of any of these formulations.

## Pharmacokinetic enhancers. The PKs are medications that have

no inherent anti-HIV activity but are used in low doses in combination with other classes of medications to boost their blood levels and make them more effective. This mechanism was previously mentioned with regard to “boosted” PIs. The PKs work by inhibiting CYP-3A4, which is a key enzyme in the detoxification pathway of certain antiretroviral medications. Because they affect CYP-3A4, there are significant interactions between any medication, herb, or nutritional supplement that involve this enzyme. Caution is therefore advised. • RTV: ritonavir (Norvir) has been in use for the longest and has tra- ditionally been used with protease inhibitors. It has previously been

<!-- chunk -->

## 1382SECTION 6 Diseases

categorized as a protease inhibitor but is included here because this most closely describes its function. It is not particularly well toler- ated, with significant GI side effects, and is rarely used anymore. • COBI: cobicistat (Tyboost) is the newest of this class and is typically better tolerated. It can raise serum creatinine and decrease creati- nine clearance, an effect that is reversible when stopped. It is used in some STRs (Stribild and Genvoya) and two boosted PIs (Evotaz and Prezcobix).

<!-- chunk -->

## Single-tablet regimens. Over the past several years, there has been

a trend in the medical treatment of HIV toward the use of multiclass combination STRs. The STRs are single tablets that are taken once daily and consist of a full complement of fixed doses of the medications needed to effectively suppress HIV replication. These formulations have allowed for the simplification of HIV treatment, resulted in a decrease in issues with adverse effects, and significantly reduced the daily pill burden for those individuals taking them. The STRs are now commonly used as initial treatment as well as an alternative for patients who have been on other, more complicated regimes. Side effects and interactions are all related to the individual drugs that make up each single tablet, and it is recommended that each be researched. As previously mentioned, all STRs (with the sole exception of Juluca) have as their backbone NRTIs, to which some other class of medication is added. In some instances, a PK is included; others do not include a PK. NRTI- and NNRTI-based STRs include the following: • Atripla: FTC, TDF, EFV • Complera: FTC, TDF, RPV • Delstrigo: 3TC, TDF, DOR (approved by the FDA August 2019; note that it contains TDF rather than the safer TAF) • Odefsey: FTC, TAF, RPV • Symfi and Symfi Lo: 3TC, TDF, EFV (both approved by the FDA in 2018) NRTI- and ISTI-based STRs include the following: • Biktarvy: FTC, TAF, BIC (approved by the FDA in November as maintenance therapy in already virally suppressed individuals; now used as an initial regime) • Dovato: DTG, 3TC (approved by the FDA in April 2019 as an initial regime in individuals where ABC, TAD, TAF cannot be used) • Genvoya: FTC, TAF, EVG, COBI • Stribild: FTC, TDF, EVG, COBI NNRTI: and ISTI based: • Juluca: DTG, RPV (approved by the FDA in November 2017 for maintenance therapy in an already virally suppressed individual) NRTI- and PI-based STRs include the following: • Symtuza: FTC, TAF, DRV, COBI (the first of the PI-based fixed- dose single-tablet treatments; FDA approved on July 17, 2018)

## New Approaches. One promising new approach to antiretroviral

therapy involves the use of long-acting injectable medications as an alternative to daily oral regimens. These are given at predetermined intervals and alleviate the need for patients to take daily medications. The Latte 2 trial is a Phase IIb trial that used an investigational ISTI (cabotegravir) with an existing NNRTI (rilpivirine). Once the study subjects were virally suppressed on an oral medication regime, they were switched to the injectable medication combination at either 4- or 8-week intervals, with another group maintaining the oral regime as controls. After 32 weeks, 94% of the 4-week group, 95% of the 8-week group, and 91% of the oral group maintained viral suppression. At the 96-week mark, 87% of the 4-week group, 94% of the 8-week group, and 84% of the oral group maintained viral suppression. The main side effects were site reactions and pain, both of which were more pronounced in the 4-week versus 8-week group. The patients involved in the study reacted quite favorably to it.66,67 The results at 96 weeks for the 8-week study group are quite impressive, and the use of injectable antiretrovirals may prove to be a viable strategy for treating individuals who are in situations where they cannot effectively maintain a daily oral regimen.

## of Naturopathic Principles

The naturopathic standard of incorporating healthy diet and lifestyle practices cannot be overemphasized for HIV+ individuals. These patients are likely to be taking a large number of medications, nutri- tional supplements, or both, resulting in additional biochemical stress on the body. Therefore each patient should be clearly encouraged and continually reminded to maintain dietary habits designed to ensure optimal GI health and nutritional intake. The most important recommendation is to encourage a high intake of filtered or safe water and fiber so as to decrease oxidative stress and reduce the toxic load of the HIV and medications.68 These patients should also be encouraged to maintain an optimal intake of protein.69,70 Protein requirements can be as high as 100 to 150 g per day, particularly when patients are experiencing malabsorption and/or diarrhea; it may be necessary to provide supplemental protein to pre- vent weight loss. Studies using large doses of whey protein and amino acids (l-glutamine, l-arginine) have proved effective in reversing or preventing HIV-induced wasting.71–73 Essential fatty acids (EFAs) have also been found to be deficient in HIV+ patients. Studies have demon- strated that HIV+ patients consuming generous amounts of EFAs have an increased body cell mass and a decreased risk of progression to AIDS74–76 as well as improved symptoms of depression.77 HIV+ patients and healthy subjects ingesting fruit juices or a fruit-vegetable concentrate on a long-term basis were found to have higher micronutrient and antioxidant levels.78,79 From this, it can be concluded that HIV+ patients should be continually encouraged to include colorful vegetables and fruits in their diets to help maintain levels of essential micronutrients and fiber.80,81 HIV+ patients commonly require appetite stimulation, digestive enzyme support, or both to combat the adverse effects of HIV, HAART, and prophylactic antibiotics on the GI system.82,83 Further, with high oxidation already present in the digestive system, all patients should be strongly encouraged to avoid additional GI stressors such as high-so- dium foods, high-fructose corn syrup in processed foods, alcohol, caf- feine, fried foods, and cigarette smoke. Raw eggs, unpasteurized milk, undercooked meat or fish, and potentially contaminated foods must also be avoided to decrease the risk of gastrointestinal OIs and parasites. Naturopathic physicians should exercise extreme caution in con- sidering allergy-elimination diets in HIV+ patients owing to the likelihood of nutrient deficiencies, maldigestion, and malabsorption caused by HIV itself and HAART medications. A safer alternative is to recommend replacement of common food allergens one food at a time to make sure that patients can maintain replacement diets with- out decreasing caloric and nutrient intake over time. Removing food vices and irritating foods may be one of the most challenging aspects of moving HIV+ patients toward optimal wellness because there are so many other higher-priority challenges and a vital need to maintain body mass. Lifestyle factors should be part of the naturopathic foundation with each HIV+ patient. Aerobic exercise has been demonstrated to provide benefit to individuals with immunodeficiency diseases, par- ticularly through stress alleviation and mood enhancement. HIV+ individuals had increases in CD4, CD8, and NK cells immediately after aerobic exercise, and long-term exercise has demonstrated increases in immune parameters.84,85 HIV+ individuals practicing Tai qi demonstrated a greater overall perception of health and significant improvements in several measures of physical function compared with

controls.86 Other patients practicing yoga demonstrated an increased quality of life (QOL)87,88 and reported increased self-confidence, reduced blood pressure,89 and a quicker return to athletic activities after medical interventions.90 All patients should be encouraged to create an optimal sleeping environment and to sleep 8 to 10 hours each night. Sleep is essential for the repair and rebuilding of tissues and has been demonstrated to increase circulating NK cells and lymphocytes.91,92 Screen for obstructive sleep apnea. Uncontrolled sleep apnea can result in a host of adverse health issues that can be alleviated if the issue is identified and treated. Simple in-office screening can be done using the STOP-BANG questionnaire (http://www.stopbang .ca/osa/screening.php). Based on a patient’s answers and situation, a score is obtained that gives a low, intermediate, or high likelihood of the presence of obstructive sleep apnea. If there is intermediate or high risk, clinicians should consider referring the patient for further evalua- tion with a qualified sleep medicine specialist. HIV+ patients involved with group activities have better progno- ses as well as decreased stress and anxiety. Anecdotal evidence links long-term AIDS survival with one or more of the following: having a positive attitude toward the illness, participating in health-promoting behaviors, engaging in spiritual activities, and taking part in activities that support the HIV+ community. Structured, brief group interven- tion for bereavement due to the loss of loved ones has been shown to decrease plasma cortisol and improve several immune markers in patients with HIV.93,94 Other forms of stress relief and manage- ment have proved effective for HIV+ patient health care. Cognitive- behavioral stress management is a guided form of relaxation training. It has been shown to improve the quality of life in HIV+ women, decrease herpes simplex 2 antibody titers in HIV+ men, improve HIV laboratory values, and have lasting effects on quality of life and psycho- logical well-being of patients.95–100 Mindfulness-based stress reduction was able to demonstrate increased mean CD4 counts in patient HIV+ ART-naïve patients.101 Engaging in prayer, including distance healing, has demonstrated fewer new AIDS-defining illnesses, decreased illness severity, sig- nificantly fewer doctor visits, fewer hospitalizations, and significant improvements in mood.102,103 For individuals not on HAART, partic- ipation in spiritual activities (prayer, meditation, affirmations, psychic healing, visualizations) resulted in a reduced risk of death over a 1-year period.104 Finally, laughter has been associated with improvement in WBC values and decreased stress.105

## Establish a Core Nutrient Protocol

## Replace known nutrient deficiencies caused by HIV. Vitamin

and mineral replenishment has been demonstrated to be efficacious in HIV+ patients.106–109 A double-blind placebo-controlled study involving 1078 pregnant Tanzanian women infected by HIV reported that taking vitamin A (preformed vitamin A and beta-carotene) and a low-cost multivitamin (vitamins B, C, and E) resulted in delayed progression to AIDS as well as a delay in the requirement to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Adding the low-cost multivitamins was statistically significant versus placebo or vitamin A alone.110 Numerous vitamin and mineral deficiencies have been identified with HIV disease progression.111 These deficiencies are likely due to loss, poor absorption, or rapid use and consumption. Box 178.4 summarizes the nutrients that have been found to be deficient in patients with HIV. Typical daily doses required to replete deficiencies taken in divided doses throughout the day are noted in parentheses followed by the rationale or benefits. Nutrient deficiencies (beta-carotene, vitamin D, acetyl-l-carnitine, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], testosterone, reduced glutathione, and catalase) not commonly included in a multivitamin/multimin- eral supplement must be replaced through specific dietary regimens or through additional supplementation. Natural forms of beta-caro- tene should be used because evidence suggests that synthetic forms can increase the risk of lung cancer in individuals who smoke.112 Consider acetyl-l-carnitine as a high-priority nutrient, despite its high cost, on the basis of the number of benefits.

## function. Box 178.5 summarizes nutrients that have been found to

replace or reduce other nutrient deficiencies or have beneficial action in patients with HIV, their daily doses divided throughout the day, and effects of supplementation. All these nutrients have benefits, but they significantly increase the overall cost and pill burden. Further, despite the positive evidence and outcomes demonstrated integrating CAM with HIV, there have been a few recent studies, including a systemic review, that have reported CAM therapies potentially interfering with HAART.113–116 In these negative studies, the antiretroviral therapies referenced are no lon- ger commonly being prescribed outside of less developed regions of world, the forms (chelates) of CAM that were used were often inferior forms, the populations being studied were often nutritionally unique (African), and many of the findings were debatable. These negative studies clearly emphasize the need to understand the mechanisms and interactions for the best integration of CAM and HAART. With pill burden and efficacy in mind, it is suggested that priority be given to the most essential (EFAs and DHEA) and lower-cost (vita- min C) nutrients or to address specific symptoms, as described in the next section.

## Immunosuppression

The following are some approaches for specific health conditions and OIs. The naturopathic physician should endeavor to iden- tify and remove the cause, tonify systems, and treat each patient individually.

<!-- chunk -->

## Candida albicans/Oral Thrush. Overgrowth of this fungal

organism may occur as a result of HIV itself (a low CD4+ count, reducing the body’s immune capacity) or secondary to prophylactic antibiotic treatment. Orally, it can cause pain and make eating difficult, which can lead to reduced caloric intake and subsequent problems. In the intestines, it can cause inflammation and compromise nutrient absorption. In the esophagus, it can cause pain and should be dealt with swiftly via antifungal pharmaceuticals. For treatment, patients should avoid foods that promote yeast growth, such as simple carbohydrates, sugar, baked goods, and starchy vegetables. These options should be considered: • Probiotics: Provide and support healthy flora via the consumption of fermented foods as well as using supplements with at least 8 bil- lion colony-forming units (CFUs), best taken with food. Beneficial species include Lactobacillus acidophilus/bifidus; Lactobacillus GG, a well-researched strain from Germany; and Saccharomyces boulardii, which is best for antibiotic-induced colitis and can help displace pathogenic flora.117–121 • Garlic (4 g/day, approx. = 1 clove, best taken before meals): Garlic is a potent antifungal found to spare nonpathogenic flora; note that patients on HAART should not take supplemental garlic.122 Con- sider incorporating it into the diet. • Oregano oil (300 mg best taken away from food): This is also a potent antifungal.123 • Nystatin, clotrimazole, and fluconazole: These are pharmaceutical antifungals.

## Cardiovascular disease. The issue of cardiovascular disease

is becoming increasingly problematic and prevalent, particularly in the aging HIV+ population. The adverse effects on serum lipids and glucose that accompany the use of HAART medications (specifically PIs and D-type NRTIs) significantly promote cardiovascular disease, particularly in patients already at high risk (where there are predisposing factors such as a positive family history). All patients on HAART should be encouraged to institute a preventive diet, adopt a healthy lifestyle, and implement exercise recommendations to promote cardiovascular health. Exercise in particular has been demonstrated to increase functional aerobic capacity, eliminate functional aerobic impairment, and improve measures of exercise performance (improved peak oxygen con- sumption, oxygen pulse, tidal volume, ventilation, and leg power).124,125 Garlic should be avoided owing to its adverse inter- action with HAART medications. The following specific nutrients should be considered: • Acetyl-l-carnitine (2–6 g best taken away from other proteins to optimize absorption) repletion has also been linked with a reduc- tion in serum triglycerides. • CoQ10 (100–300 mg) may enhance cardiovascular function.126 • Arginine (7.4 g taken away from food) decreases atherosclerosis.127 AIDS, Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; ART, antiretroviral therapy; AZT, azidothymidine/zidovudine; CoQ 10 , coenzyme Q 10 ; DHEA, dehydroepi- androsterone; GI, gastrointestinal; GSH, growth-stimulating hormone; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; NK, natural killer; NRTI, nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors; OI, opportunistic infection; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha.

• EFAs (up to 6 g daily taken with food) have been clearly demon- strated to lower triglycerides and markers of inflammation includ- ing, IL-6 and TNF- α ,128–130 as well as lower lipids.131

## Diarrhea. Diarrhea is a common complaint and an issue that can

greatly affect quality of life. An HIV+ person might develop diarrhea for numerous reasons; the specific etiology guides the choice of treatment. Causes might include HIV-associated enteropathy, HAART side effects (see specific medications—this is particularly an issue with PIs), antibiotic side effects, GI infections, and food allergies or intolerances. An osmotic-type diarrhea can also result from the consumption of too many indigestible gel caps (from medications and supplements) building up in the intestinal lumen. The first treatment priority is to remove the cause if at all possi- ble. There is an increased incidence of gluten intolerance in HIV+ individuals.132 Lactose intolerance and irritable bowel syndrome are also possibilities. Food allergies/sensitivities should be cautiously ruled out, with consideration given to the patient’s general nutri- tional status to ensure the safety of trial food eliminations. Stool cultures and testing for ova and parasites should be considered to screen for suspected infectious causes, and patients should be treated as indicated for each microbial etiology. All nutrient supplementa- tion may be stopped on a temporary basis to screen for an osmotic cause and then reintroduced one at a time to determine potential causes. Steps for prevention include avoiding unfiltered tap water, unpas- teurized milk or dairy products, ice made from unfiltered tap water, raw fruits and vegetables unless they can be peeled personally or washed with appropriate antimicrobial agents, raw or rare meat and fish, meat or shellfish that is not hot when served, and food from street vendors. Dehydration can be prevented by replacing electrolytes; broths, soups, fruit and vegetable juices, and high-nutrient drinks should be included. Prevent malnutrition; if diarrhea is present, malabsorption of nutrients is a likely consequence. Ensure adequate micro- and mac- ronutrient intake with a multivitamin/multimineral supplement and maintain adequate protein intake (requirements may increase to 100–150 g/day). Initial dietary intervention may include simplifying the diet (BRAT diet: bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) or using 1 tbsp tomato juice combined with 1 tbsp sauerkraut juice (a protocol taught by Dr. John Bastyr to two generations of naturopathic students and used with considerable clinical success by the senior editor to facilitate electrolyte replacement and promote enterocyte healing). Carob pow- der is an astringent that can help symptomatically. Begin with 1 tsp in applesauce and increase up to 6 tsp/day as needed. Consider these additional supplements: • Provide and support healthy flora as described earlier in the care of candidal infection.117–121 • l-Glutamine (9–40 g best taken away from other proteins) is an amino acid that provides fuel for small intestinal enterocytes. Using a powder is most efficient and cost-effective. Start with 3 g three times daily. This can be increased up to 40 g daily if necessary. This high dose can lead to psychoses, so the patient should be monitored closely.133 • Diphenoxylate and atropine (Lomotil), loperamide (Imodium), and psyllium husk (Metamucil) are common pharmaceutical inter- ventions.

## Herpes simplex virus/herpes zoster/shingles. All conditions

with a herpes-type virus etiology are considered together because the treatment approach is similar for each. The sequelae of herpesviruses tend to manifest on the skin in a dermatomal pattern of distribution. These symptoms can occur secondary to various types of stress, hormonal fluctuations, or a poor immune system response. First and foremost, try to identify and remove causes of stress (including dietary, emotional, and sunlight exposure) and support immune function. Secondarily, address the symptoms (most often, pain is at the forefront). Naturopathic physicians should consider the following: • Dietary suggestions include eliminating foods high in l-arginine (promotes herpes replication), such as chocolate, nuts, and peanuts, and increasing foods high in l-lysine (antagonizes l-arginine), such as whole grains, dairy, fish, lima beans, and soy. • l-lysine: 1000 mg three times daily away from food during an out- break; 500 mg three times daily away from food prophylactically.134 • Monolaurin: this antiviral, taken at 300 to 600 mg three times daily, is effective against encapsulated DNA viruses.135 • Melissa officinalis: an antiviral botanical used topically.136 • Glycyrrhiza glabra: an antiviral oral and topical botanical.137 • Acyclovir/valacyclovir: pharmaceutical antiviral therapy.

## Kaposi sarcoma. Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an HIV-associated

neoplasm of vascular origin that tends to occur when CD4+ counts fall below 500/mm3. KS is rarely found outside of the HIV+ population and is an issue that is becoming far less common in this era of early treatment through HAART. The etiology of AIDS-associated KS is poorly understood, but several factors are thought to contribute, including the presence of human herpesvirus (HHV) type 8, a compromised immune response, and hormones (it rarely occurs in women, and androgen therapy causes increased proliferation of the tumors). It is most commonly found in iron-rich geographical areas. ART, Antiretroviral therapy; CoQ 10 , coenzyme Q 10 ; EFAs, essential fatty acids; GSH, growth-stimulating hormone; HAART, highly active antiviral therapy; IgG, immunoglobulin G; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; NK, natural killer; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha.

## 1386SECTION 6 Diseases

Interestingly, 90% of AIDS-related cases in the United States occur in homosexual men, making it rare in heterosexual men, women, and intravenous drug users. KS begins as macules or elevated papules and can progress to large plaques or nodules. The color ranges from pink to purple or brownish-black. The lesions may be round or oval and do not blanch when pressure is applied to them. The lesions often appear first on the skin of the upper body or mucosal surfaces. In their aggressive form they can become widely disseminated and can manifest anywhere on the skin, mucous membranes, lymph nodes, or viscera (including the GI tract from the mouth to anus, lungs, liver, spleen, or pancreas). KS tumors secrete increased amounts of angiogenic growth factors, TNF- α , IL-6, basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and oncostatin-M.138–143 The level of immunosuppression of an affected person determines the clinical course of KS in AIDS. Currently, there are no known cures; the various local and systemic approaches are aimed at palliation. Treatment may involve the use of chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin as well as standard HAART. Surgical excision can suc- cessfully remove a lesion, but there is a high rate of recurrence at the affected site. Other researched options that have produced varying results include radiation therapy, cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen, and electrical stimulation with direct current. The following treatments should also be considered: • Topical and systemic retinoids144 • Topical vitamin D (1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3)145 • Iron has been shown to stimulate the growth of KS cells in vitro, whereas iron chelators reduced their growth.146,147 Given this information, it may be sensible to limit iron intake and ensure that serum iron and ferritin levels are at the low end of normal. • The use of various cytokine inhibitors and antiangiogenesis com- pounds might have a benefit for reducing the proliferation of these vascular tumors. • Because there are no known curative therapies and the palliative treatment of KS is difficult at best, naturopathic physicians have an opportunity to be creative and contribute in this area. Given the association between KS and HHV type 8, it may be beneficial to use antiherpetic therapies if a patient is known to be herpes simplex virus–positive.148 Topical application of a medicinal peat preparation has resulted in remission of topical KS lesions in sev- eral patients. Glutathione (NAC as a precursor) could be helpful in the treatment of KS lesions as well.149–151

## Lipodystrophy. Lipodystrophy is a redistribution of adipose tissue

from the extremities to the trunk. It often manifests with a Cushingoid “buffalo hump” over the upper thoracic region of the back or with truncal obesity. Self-image issues are often most significant for patients experiencing this condition. Lipodystrophy can occur as a result of alterations in lipid metabolism secondary to HAART or simply chronic HIV infection (greater than 15 years).152 Given the appearance of the buffalo hump, it is possible that adrenal abnormalities contribute to the problem. Increases in serum cortisol lead to increases in insulin release from the pancreas, which drives blood glucose into storage in adipose cells. This leads to increased truncal obesity,153–156 a physiological mechanism that bears consideration in the therapeutic approach as well as in future research. Lipodystrophy has also been found to increase with lack of exercise.157 In addition to correcting dietary nutrient insufficiencies, supplementing nutrients as per the general protocol, increasing exercise, and ensuring that blood glucose is appropriately regulated, the use of the following can be considered: • l-Glutamine (10 g in divided doses away from food)158,159 • Acetyl-l-carnitine (2–6 g away from food) to optimize mitochon- drial function160–162 • Uridine (36 g three times daily for 10 consecutive days per month) to normalize subcutaneous fat163 • Testosterone (10 g of testosterone gel daily) in HIV+ men with abdominal obesity and low testosterone; decreased whole-body, total, and abdominal fat mass; and increased lean body mass164 • Nandrolone decanoate (150 mg intramuscularly [IM] every weeks) may increase lean body mass more effectively than testos- terone.165 • Tesamorelin (Egrifta), a growth hormone–releasing factor analogue (2 mg per subcutaneous injection given daily), decreases visceral adipose tissue and triglycerides without aggravating glucose.166 • Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/bromelain (5% bromelain com- pounded by the Key pharmacy in DMSO gel applied two to three times daily). Topical applications have resulted in the reduction of Cushingoid adipose deposits. • Conventional treatment may include surgical removal of the trun- cal adipose deposits. Although this may not be the most desirable approach owing to its invasiveness, patients who undergo this pro- cedure tend to be happy afterward because of their more positive self-image. • Buccal injections of polylactic acid (PLA/Nufill) have been found to be safe and can reduce the cosmetic signs and depressive symptoms of lipodystrophy and wasting.167

## Macrocytic anemia. Macrocytic anemia can be a secondary effect

from the malabsorption of nutrients or a side effect of HAART (AZT causes bone marrow toxicity; PIs may cause malabsorption).168,169 The following treatments can be considered: • Vitamin B 12 (hydroxocobalamin/methylcobalamin/cyanocobala- min 1000 mcg/mL given IM three times a week) is an important nutrient for proper cell division and differentiation.170 If an IM injection is unavailable, sublingual tablets at 1000 mcg/day can be used to bypass intestinal absorption issues. • Folic acid (activated form recommended) and vitamin B complex (both found in a good multivitamin supplement) are indicated for proper cell division, differentiation, and improved vascular reactiv- ity.171–173

<!-- chunk -->

## Neuropathy. This is usually manifested in the periphery, part-

icularly in the feet. It can work its way proximally as it increases in severity. It is most often seen either as a result of long-term HIV infection or as a side effect of the D-type NRTIs and their toxic effect on the mitochondria in neurons.174,175 Diabetes mellitus type 2 can also be a factor, as can overdoses of vitamin B 6 (greater than 200 mg/day).176 The following treatments can be considered: • Acetyl-l-carnitine (2–6 g best taken away from other proteins to optimize absorption) decreases the risk for alterations in fatty-acid oxidation and energy supply, improves critical metabolic functions, and decreases pain.177 • EFAs (5 g/day with food) are anti-inflammatory agents and compo- nents of healthy cell membranes.178 • Vitamin B 12 (1000 mcg/mL IM three times weekly) is an important nutrient for proper cell division and differentiation. • Vitamin B complex (1 mL IM three times weekly) is indicated for proper cell division and differentiation.179,180 • CoQ 10 (100–300 mg) is indicated to optimize mitochondrial func- tion.181,182 • Alpha-lipoic acid (600 mg/day) may decrease pain.183

## Psychological conditions. Issues such as depression, anxiety,

posttraumatic stress disorder, sexual dysfunction, and substance abuse are extremely common in the HIV+ population. These problems potentially have physiological as well as psychological components but may not be adequately addressed by other providers. Suicidal ideations and suicide attempts can also be an issue for this population. As quality of life deteriorates, the burden of ongoing

## 1387CHAPTER 178 HIV/AIDS: Naturopathic Medical Principles and Practice

medical treatment increases, and close friends die, the desire to live can wane. It is critical that practitioners always be vigilant for signs of sui- cidal thinking or loss of hope in patients. These signs should be taken seriously, and there should be no hesitation in bringing in experienced professional help to assist these patients. In contemplating the treatment of any psychological issue in this patient population, extreme caution must be exercised owing to issues of polypharmacy and drug–nutrient interactions. Many of these patients are taking a substantial number of pharmaceutical medications. Interactions among many nutrients and these medications and even among the med- ications themselves are likely. Before instituting any treatment, all poten- tial interactions must be researched, identified, and considered. An example of this problem is the potential use of St. John’s wort, a commonly used herbal antidepressant. As previously discussed, St. John’s wort is an inducer of the cytochrome P-450 detoxification enzyme 3A4 in the liver and has been found to reduce serum levels of various HAART medications. Therefore it can theoretically reduce the effectiveness of those medications and potentially lead to increased issues with resistance. The use of St. John’s wort should be avoided in any patient who is undergoing HAART. Modalities such as counseling, lifestyle modification, and home- opathy can be quite useful in treating these psychological conditions. Meditation and mindfulness have been found to be effective for psy- chological health. For example, a mindfulness-based stress reduction meditation program showed stabilization of CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts independent of antiretroviral medication use.184 In another study, mantra repetition—a word or phrase with spiritual associ- ations repeated silently throughout the day—was found to reduce anger as well as to increase spiritual faith and spiritual connectedness; it was inversely associated with non-HIV-related intrusive thoughts and positively associated with quality of life, total existential spiritual well-being, and meaning/peace.185,186 Additional therapies to consider are as follows: • Multivitamin supplementation (B complex, C, and E) resulted in a reduction in the risk of elevated depressive symptoms and improve- ment in quality of life.187 • Androgens (DHEA 50 mg or testosterone—in supraphysiological doses of 300 mg IM weekly) can improve mood, quality of life, and overall survivability and also decrease fatigue.188,189 • Amino acids (if levels are found to be low by specialty laboratory analysis) should be prescribed in combinations tailored to replen- ish deficiencies.190,191 • Zinc (25 mg/day) can serve to normalize levels and improve the efficacy of antidepressants.192 • EFAs (5 g/day with food) have been found to be useful as adjunctive treatment in depressive disorders.193,194 • SAMe (1600 mg/day) has been shown to be as effective as imip- ramine (150 mg) in treating major depression and is better toler- ated.195

## Wasting. In 1987, the CDC defined HIV-associated wasting syn-

drome as an involuntary weight loss of greater than 10% of baseline body weight accompanied by chronic fever, weakness, or diarrhea. A more complete definition is available in The AIDS Reader196 (Box 178.6). Body cell mass (BCM) can be measured via bioimpedance assay. Research shows that BCM is a better predictor of survival than CD4 counts. Key issues to be addressed with patients include perceived weight loss, changes in appetite, diarrhea, energy level, and difficulties in performing activities of daily living. The etiology of wasting is most likely multifactorial in nature; some possible etiologies include the following197: • Decreased food intake—anorexia (decreased desire to eat or loss of appetite with corresponding decrease in food intake) or nausea sec- ondary to medications, systemic illness, or GI pathology; finances; dependence on others; poor food choices. • Malabsorption/chronic diarrhea—results in decreased nutrient intake; influenced by many pathologies and dysfunctions (affect- ing any part of the GI tract: oral, esophageal, stomach, pancreatic, biliary, hepatic, and small and large intestine); problems might include infections, medication side effects, enzyme deficiencies, and malignancies; all might result in the inability to absorb macro- and micronutrients. • Alterations of metabolism—studies show that resting energy expen- diture (REE) is higher in HIV/AIDS patients than in HIV– controls; studies also show the REE does not downregulate if anorexia or malabsorption is present (therefore the combination of decreased caloric intake with a metabolic rate that does not adjust to that state would result in a negative energy balance and weight loss).198 • Cytokine abnormalities—not well understood; TNF and IL-1 may induce anorexia and affect lipid, protein, and carbohydrate utiliza- tion; an example is cachexia in cancer. • Endocrine abnormalities—thyroid abnormalities, adrenal insuf- ficiency (cortisol, DHEA), hypogonadism (testosterone), growth hormone deficiency. • Alcohol abuse—studies show that progression to AIDS is much quicker in HIV+ patients who consume large amounts of ethyl alcohol (ETOH) versus normal expectations; ETOH can stimu- late HIV production, suppress immune defenses (lower CD4 cell counts), and deplete tissue micronutrients (specifically, antioxi- dants). As per general recommendations, the naturopathic physician should endeavor to remove the cause if it is identifiable and removal is feasible. Then he or she should identify and remove possible food aller- gies/intolerances (gluten and dairy in particular) and ensure adequate and appropriate nutritional intake via dietary counseling; patients should also be helped to access social service assistance if necessary. Patients are likely to need superdoses of nutrients. Protein intake should be increased to 100 to 150 g/day. Patients should be active and engage in daily exercise. The following therapies can be considered: • EFAs (5 g/day with food), which are essential in a healthy diet199 • Acetyl-l-carnitine (2–6 g/day) to optimize fatty acidic metabo- lism200 • l-Glutamine (10–40 g), an essential amino acid for enterocytes201,202 • DHEA (50 mg) to promote lean body mass203 • Melatonin (20 mg at bedtime) to decrease cachexia and TNF204 • Cannabis (four times daily) or oral dronabinol (5–10 mg four times daily) to increase daily caloric intake and body weight205 • Megastrol acetate (a synthetic hormone similar to progesterone; 400 mg) to decrease cachexia206 BCM, body cell mass; BMI, body mass index; TBW, total body weight.

## Using Other Nondrug Treatments

This section summarizes the botanical, homeopathic, and physical medicine studies that have been found to have potential for patients with HIV. They are not substitutes for HAART. This list is intended to assist health providers in finding additional nondrug solutions that resonate with the unique needs of individual HIV+ patients. Further, the majority of the following studies are based on initial or empirical findings encouraging additional areas for research and exploration.


Box 178.7 includes botanicals that have demonstrated efficacy in treating HIV. Care must be taken to understand the constituents and metabolism of these substances to ensure that there are no interactions with the patient’s medications or other treatments.


Homeopathy may offer a most interesting possibility in the care of HIV+ patients. The British Journal of Homeopathy published a report on the use of constitutional homeopathic remedies (30C- 1M doses) given to 129 asymptomatic HIV+ patients in India. As a result, 12 patients became ELISA negative after 3 to 16 months.211 In another study, 100 HIV+ patients between 17 and 50 years of age (71% men) were randomized to receive either a single homeo- pathic remedy or a placebo. The experimental group receiving rem- edies showed statistically significant increases in CD4+ T cells after 6 months.212 Other studies in homeopathy have demonstrated success with symp- tom care in HIV.213 For example, Bissuel and colleagues214 reported on the use of homeopathic sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Bactrim) in preventing the hypersensitivity reaction commonly associated with this drug. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 24 HIV+ adults with baseline CD4+ counts between 125 and 500/mL, as reported by Brewitt and colleagues,215 oral doses of homeopathic growth hormone resulted in statistically significant improvements in CD4 cells, CD8 cells, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), weight gain, and viral load; reduced occurrences of OI; and increased platelet counts. The use of constitutional homeopathy should be considered an essential aspect of the care of all HIV+ patients considering the amaz- ing potential, minimal side effects, and overall affordability.

another low-cost therapy that HIV+ patients can seek through a naturopathic provider. A growing body of evidence suggests that these therapies also play a pivotal role in the care of HIV+ patients: • Whole-body hyperthermia (twice weekly at 108°F for 20 minutes) may elevate CD4 count, but extreme caution must be used in heat-intolerant individuals.216 • Ozone (rectal and aural insufflation) may inactivate HIV-1.217–219 • Acupuncture and moxibustion (three treatments weekly) have been demonstrated to decrease diarrhea, decrease nausea, and decrease cravings for illicit drugs (cocaine and heroin).220–223 Acupuncture has also been found to be clearly effective in reducing attrition and decreasing pain in peripheral neuropathy.224 • Electroacupuncture (by continually stimulating acupuncture/con- ductance skin points associated with nervous and immune systems) has been demonstrated to ameliorate the complications of HIV- related peripheral neuropathy, raise CD4+ counts, and raise other lymphocyte counts.225,226 • Massage therapy has been demonstrated to increase NK cells, CD3 and CD4 cell counts, and CD4:CD8 ratios; improve quality of life; decrease health care costs; and decrease anxiety and symptoms of depression.227–230 • Reiki therapy with music has been found to reduce stress, anxi- ety, and depression.231 Other studies have demonstrated increased AIDS, Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; AZT, azidothymidine/zid- ovudine; HBV, hepatitis B virus; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; IV, intravenous; NK, natural killer; NNRTI, nonnucleoside reverse transcrip- tase inhibitor; PI, protease inhibitor.

growth and development and overall behavior in HIV-exposed newborns as well as improved immune preservation in HIV+ chil- dren in the absence of antiretroviral therapy.232,233 • Therapeutic touch can reduce anxiety in children.234 • Cranioelectrical stimulation (microcurrent 0.1 mA at 100 Hz to alligator clips attached to the earlobes 20 minutes twice daily) can decrease anxiety, insomnia, and depression.235 • Movement therapies may also be useful: • Aerobic exercise has been demonstrated to provide benefit to individuals with immunodeficiency diseases, particularly through stress alleviation and mood enhancement. One exer- cise study demonstrated that HIV+ individuals had significant improvements in both CD8 and NK cells.236–239 • Tai chi has demonstrated a greater overall perception of health and significant improvements in all functional measures in HIV+ individuals compared with controls.240 • Yoga has shown improvements in self-confidence and a return to athletic activities after the intervention.241,242

## Alternatives to Conventional Treatment

As mentioned earlier, there are currently no known therapies as effec- tive as HAART in suppressing viral load or increasing CD4 lympho- cyte cell numbers, thereby supporting normal immune function. CAM providers must avoid the temptation to allow their patients to believe otherwise. Additionally, as HAART has proven to be so efficacious in reducing the incidence of AIDS and other HIV-associated adverse events, it is now the standard of care that it should be started upon diagnosis. If a patient is aware of the risk of a high HIV viral load, low CD4 count, or both, yet still does not desire to initiate HAART or antibi- otic prophylaxis, ensure that this patient has access to a conventional Western HIV specialist. This specialist can provide clear education on conventional Western medical approaches to HIV and help diagnose and treat OIs should they arise. Concurrently, initiate a foundation of care that includes a healthy diet and lifestyle, nutritional support, and additional therapies as described earlier. Furthermore, ensure that the patient is scheduled for frequent follow-ups with health care providers to regularly screen for and monitor potential or existing OIs. If a sole practitioner is treating a patient who refuses to undergo conventional Western medical and pharmaceutical intervention, spe- cific use of the following therapies should be considered to decrease viral load and increase CD4 cell count: • Curcuma longa/turmeric (1200 mg) to inhibit HIV integrase, prote- ases, and viral transcription • Olea sp./olive leaf extract (2–6 g) to increase NK-cell function and oppose HIV and herpesviruses • Phyllanthus amarus (1200 mg), which has been shown to inhibit HIV-1, reverse transcriptase, receptors, and proteases in vitro and ex vivo • Lentinus edodes/shiitake mushrooms (1–5 mg IV twice a week), which can increase CD4 and decrease p24 (a surface marker) • Ozone (rectal and aural insufflations), which may inactivate HIV-1 For patients seeking advice on the discontinuation or interrup- tion of HAART (a structured treatment interruption [STI] or “drug holiday”), naturopathic physicians should ensure that patients clearly communicate this desire to their primary care physicians and HIV specialists. Treatment interruptions may be indicated in the following situations30: • Severe or life-threatening toxicity, unexpected inability to take oral medications, or lack of availability of antiretroviral medication (a short-term interruption) • Where the patient has to be relieved of the inconvenience, toxicity, and cost of antiretroviral therapy • Where the response to salvage therapy (treatment regimens used in patients who have failed other HAART regimens) can be improved by allowing the re-emergence of wild-type virus (the predominant virus type in a given individual as unaffected by HAART therapy) Potential problems with treatment interruptions include viral rebound, immune decompensation, and clinical progression of HIV. Multiple studies have been done over time to examine strate- gies for discontinuing and reintroducing HAART as well as to eval- uate the safety of such discontinuations; however, there has been no clear resulting consensus.243–249 The most recent studies include the SMART, TRIVACAN, and DART trials, which have not had positive outcomes.250–252 The SMART study was the largest, with more than 5000 subjects, and interrupted HAART when the CD4 cell count was greater than 350/mm3 and reinitiated treatment when it fell below 250/ mm3. This trial was discontinued when there was a clearly increased risk of disease progression and death compared with the arm on con- tinuous HAART. The current recommendation of the Department of Health and Human Services is that HAART interruptions should not be recommended except in the case of clinical trials or an acute problem.13


HIV is a chronic disease with no known cure; naturopathic physicians are encouraged to apply the principles of naturopathic medicine in the search for treatments and refinements of care. In addition, natu- ropathic physicians must be familiar with all aspects of this disease because HIV+ patients are actively seeking treatment options unique to naturopathic medical training. Naturopathic medicine already offers important possibilities in the care of HIV, and all fields in health care must collaborate to find solutions for this worldwide health prob- lem. Each patient should have a complete and appropriate caregiving team, including an infectious disease expert, primary care physician, and specialist providing psychosocial support.


A natural, whole-foods diet and a high caloric intake are recommended. This diet should be low in simple carbohydrates (e.g., sugar, white flour, fruit juice, honey, processed foods), low in natural and synthetically saturated fats, and low in oxidized or trans fatty acids. It should also be high in protein, fiber, and filtered water. Patients should abstain from alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine. Digestive stimulation is recommended if appropriate. Broad-spectrum allergy-elimination diets should gener- ally be avoided (dependent on an individual’s nutritional status).


Aerobic or mind–body exercise (e.g., tai qui, yoga) and 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night are optimal. Rule out obstructive sleep apnea if suspected. Prayer, spiritual activities, and activities that support the HIV+ commu- nity, guided forms of stress relief, and relaxation training are beneficial.


Potential interactions with HAART must always be investigated in considering the use of any nutritional or botanical supplement.

modifies ion transport across the cell membrane, insulin insensitiv- ity can lead to decreased cytosolic magnesium levels and increased cytosolic calcium levels within the vascular smooth muscle, resulting in increased vascular reactivity. Patients with normal-renin essential hypertension typically do not respond to sodium restriction. Patients with high-renin essential hypertension make up approx- imately 15% of patients with essential hypertension. The elevation in renin (and associated high BP) is thought to be secondary to an increase in sympathetic nervous system activation. The categorization of BP by renin level does not remain constant in each patient. For example, a patient might be labeled as having l ow- renin essential hypertension due to insulin resistance secondary to obesity. If the patient lost weight, regained insulin sensitivity, and yet the BP did not normalize, he or she would then be categorized as hav- ing normal- or high-renin essential hypertension. The categories based on renin level are primarily useful in identifying possible therapeutic interventions, as shown in Box 179.2.

## White-Coat Hypertension

White-coat hypertension has been defined as the persistent eleva- tion of BP at the clinic or office only. Its prevalence may be as high as 20% to 45% of people diagnosed as hypertensive.1 It appears to be more frequent in women, older patients, and persons with stage 1 hypertension. White-coat hypertension should not be con- fused with the white-coat effect, which signifies the difference in BP between the office and daytime ambulatory BP and occurs in patients with white-coat hypertension as well as in those with other causes of hypertension. The current conventional wisdom among naturopathic physicians is to treat white-coat hypertension as if it were essential hypertension. The reason for this stance is that cur- rent data suggest that the pressor response elicited mirrors real-life reactions to stress; that is, studies have suggested that white-coat hypertension is not an innocent phenomenon.3,4 In regard to the latter, in a 21-year study comprising 536 men, those with a white- coat effect had a significantly higher rate of mortality than normo- tensive men and were nearly twice as likely to develop sustained hypertension.4 Ambulatory BP monitoring is a clinically useful tool for assess- ing suspected white-coat hypertension and cardiovascular risk.5 In patients with confirmed white-coat hypertension, drug treatment is usually not indicated; instead, treatment should consist of lifestyle and dietary modifications, weight reduction, regular exercise, smoking ces- sation, and correction of glucose and lipid abnormalities.1 In addition, semiannual or annual follow-up with ambulatory BP monitoring is advised.

## Etiology

Essential hypertension is most likely the result of any number of factors that disrupt the regulation of arterial pressure and fluid volume. Vascular, hormonal, renal, and neurological fac- tors function in a complex interrelationship to maintain normal BP; disruption of any single facet disrupts the entire system and creates a cascading effect on regulatory mechanisms. Although genetic factors play a role, dietary, lifestyle, psychological, and environmental factors are the underlying causes in most cases of essential hypertension. Dietary factors include obesity; high sodium-to-potassium ratio; a low-fiber, high-sugar diet; high sat- urated fat and low omega-3 fatty acid intake; and a diet low in cal- cium, magnesium, and vitamin C. Important lifestyle factors that may cause high BP include stress, lack of exercise, and smoking. The dietary factor that has received the greatest attention is salt intake. Between 40% and 60% of patients with hypertension are salt sensitive. This factor is discussed later in the chapter under “Therapeutic Considerations.” Exposure to toxic metals, such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic, may also be a significant factor in some patients. The kid- neys are end-organ targets of several toxins. Although studies of blood lead levels have not consistently shown an association, it is important to point out that blood lead levels reflect primarily acute exposure.6–8 Studies looking at bone lead, for example, have upheld that exposure to heavy metals is associated with an increased risk of hypertension.9 Specifically, the data suggest that lead has an acute effect on BP via either a recent exposure or cumulative dose. These associations were demonstrated in a cross-sectional analysis of 2001 to 2002 data from a community-based cohort in Baltimore, Maryland, of 964 men and women aged 50 to 70 years (40% African American, 55% white, 5% other race/ethnicity). Both blood lead and tibial lead were determined, along with systolic and diastolic BP. Blood lead was a strong and consistent predictor of both systolic and diastolic BP in models adjusted and not adjusted for race/eth- nicity and socioeconomic status. Tibial lead was also associated with hypertension status before and after adjustment for race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.10

## 1393CHAPTER 179 Hypertension


Because more than 90% of patients with higher-than-optimal blood pressure have either prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension, most can be brought under control through changes in diet and lifestyle.11 In fact, in head-to-head comparisons, many nondrug therapies, such as diet, exercise, and relaxation therapies, have proved to be superior to drugs in cases of prehypertension and stage 1 hypertension. For stage hypertension, pharmacological therapy may be necessary. Ideally, drug treatment should be used only until the dietary, lifestyle, and supple- ment strategies take hold. However, long-term drug therapy is some- times required.

## Pharmacotherapy of Hypertension

For many years, the first drug of choice for high BP was a thiazide diuretic alone or in combination with a beta blocker. Because of the questionable effectiveness of this combination in reducing the car- diovascular death rate and the side effects noted in numerous stud- ies, this approach has somewhat fallen out of favor but is still quite popular. The most common treatment is a diuretic used alone or in combination with newer medications designed to relax the arteries, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and calcium channel blockers. The use of a diuretic or any of the previously mentioned other drugs alone is referred to as a “step 1” therapy. Thiazide diuretics are still the most popular step 1 drugs but may soon be displaced by calcium channel blockers or ACE inhibitors. Beta blockers are not suitable step 1 drugs because of their known side effects.12 Step 2 therapy comprises two medications, step 3 uses three, and the step 4 approach involves four. Physicians are instructed to use single therapies before going on to the combinations, unless compelling indications are present, such as diabetes or heart failure.13 Other types of BP-lowering medications that can be used in step or 4 approaches include those that act on the central nervous system, such as clonidine, methyldopa, and reserpine, as well as some that are potent dilators of the blood vessels, like nitroprusside sodium, hydrala- zine, prazosin, minoxidil, and hydralazine. However, these drugs have fallen out of favor with the development of the newer calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors. Nonetheless, they may be appropriate in certain situations.

## Overview of Dietary and Lifestyle Factors

Hypertension is closely related to lifestyle and dietary factors. Some of the important lifestyle factors linked to hypertension include smoking, stress, and lack of exercise. The most important dietary factors include obesity; high sodium-to-potassium ratio; low-fiber, high-sugar diet; high saturated fat and low essential fatty acids (EFAs) intake; a diet low in calcium, magnesium, or vitamin C; and excessive alcohol or caffeine intake (Fig. 179.1). Several of these dietary and lifestyle factors are also discussed in Chapter 148 because the health of the arteries is critical to maintaining normal BP.

## Stress

Stress can be the causative factor of hypertension in many instances, although, as in other health conditions, it has more to do with the response to and processing of stress than with stress itself. Relaxation techniques such as deep-breathing exercises, biofeedback, autogenics, transcendental meditation, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, and hypnosis have all been shown to have some value in lowering BP.14 Although the effect is only modest, a stress reduction technique is a necessary component of a natural BP-lowering program. One of the most powerful methods of producing less stress and more energy in the body is diaphragmatic breathing. Regular short exercise sessions of slow, regular diaphragmatic breathing have also been shown to lower BP in hypertensive individuals in several stud- ies.15,16 One study in particular has shed light on the effect of breath- ing in hypertension.17 Volunteers with normal BP were taught shallow breathing. Measurement of the amount of sodium and potassium then excreted in their urine indicated that shallow breathing led to the retention of sodium in the body. It was suggested that this breathing pattern may play a causative role in some cases of hypertension as a result of the retention of sodium. However, slow breathing (six breaths per minute) has also been shown to improve oxygen saturation, exer- cise tolerance, and baroreflex sensitivity.18 RESPeRATE is a medical device that interactively guides the user toward slow, regular breathing by synchronizing voluntary respiration to musical tones. When used for 15 minutes daily, this device can lead to a significant reduction in BP. In one 8-week study, systolic BP was reduced by 10.0 mm Hg and diastolic BP by 3.6 mm Hg, but not in the controls, and greater BP reduction was observed in those who demon- strated increased compliance with the device.19


Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated an inverse association between physical activity (or fitness) and hypertension. In addition to this evidence, clinical trials in hypertensive patients have clearly established that regular exercise is an effective treatment for high BP.20,21 Although it is generally thought that the greater the inten- sity of aerobic exercise, the greater the hypotensive effect, it has been shown that even mild to moderate aerobic exercise in as few as three exercise sessions per week with durations as short as 20 minutes pro- duces a hypotensive effect.21 The degree of BP reduction from a regular exercise program is typically in the range of 5 to 10 mm Hg for both the systolic and diastolic readings.

## Dietary Recommendations

Obesity is the major dietary cause of hypertension, and achieving their ideal body weight is the most important therapeutic goal for most patients with any form of hypertension. From prehypertension to chronic renal failure, weight loss can lead to complete elimination of the health issue, significant improvement, or at least a reduction in the number of prescriptions needed.22,23 Vegetarians generally have lower BP levels and a lower incidence of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases than nonvegetar- ians.25Although dietary levels of sodium do not differ significantly between these two groups, a vegetarian diet typically contains more potassium, complex carbohydrates, EFAs, fiber, calcium, magnesium, and vitamin C and less saturated fat and refined carbohydrates, all of which have a favorable influence on BP. An increased intake of fruits and vegetables has been shown to lower BP.24 This effect may be due to increased antioxidant concentrations. Hypertensive patients have been shown to have increased oxidative stress, and antioxidants have been shown to block angiotensin II–induced increases in BP as well as to promote proper nitric oxide synthesis.25,26 The most useful foods for people with hypertension include the following: • Celery • Garlic and onions • Nuts and seeds or their oils for their EFA content • Cold-water fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel) • Green leafy vegetables for their calcium and magnesium • Whole grains and legumes for their fiber • Foods rich in vitamin C, like broccoli and citrus fruits • Foods rich in active flavonoids, including berries, cherries, grapes, and small red kidney beans Celery contains 3-n-butyl phthalide, a compound that has been found to lower BP. In animals, a small amount of this compound low- ered BP by 12% to 14% and cholesterol by about 7%.27 The equivalent dose in humans can be supplied in about four to six ribs of celery. The research was prompted by the father of one of the researchers, who, after eating a quarter pound of celery daily for 1 week, observed that his BP had dropped from 158/96 to 118/82. Garlic and onions are also important foods for lowering BP. Although most research has focused on the cholesterol-lowering prop- erties of these vegetables, both have also been shown to lower BP in hypertension.28 In addition, commercial garlic supplements may be of benefit. The usual response to the use of garlic is fairly modest, a reduc- tion of roughly 8 to 11 mm Hg for the systolic and 5 to 8 mm Hg for the diastolic BP (see Chapters 62 and 63 for a full discussion and dosages).

## Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)

Clinical studies of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) were funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to evaluate the efficacy of a system of dietary recommendations in the treatment of hypertension. The DASH diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods and low in saturated and total fat. It is also low in cholesterol; high in dietary fiber, potassium, calcium, and magne- sium; and moderately high in protein. The first study showed that a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products can reduce BP in the general population and people with hypertension.29 The original DASH diet did not require either sodium restriction or weight loss—the two traditional dietary tools to control BP—to be effective.30 The second study from the DASH research group found that coupling the original DASH diet with sodium restriction is more effective than dietary manipulation alone.31 In the first trial, the DASH diet produced a net BP reduction of 11.4 and 5.5 mm Hg systolic and diastolic, respectively, in patients with hypertension. In the second trial, sodium intake was also quantified at a “higher” intake of 3300 mg/ day, an “intermediate” intake of 2400 mg/day, and a “lower” intake of 1500 mg/day. Compared with the control diet, the DASH diet was asso- ciated with a significantly lower systolic BP at each sodium level. The DASH diet with the lower sodium level led to a mean systolic BP that was 7.1 mm Hg lower in participants without hypertension and 11.5 mm Hg lower in participants with hypertension. These results are clinically sig- nificant and indicate that sodium intake below the recommended level of 2400 mg daily can significantly and quickly lower BP. Table 179.1 lists a brief description of the components of the DASH eating plan on the basis of a 2000-calorie daily diet.

## Potassium and Sodium

Considerable evidence indicates that a diet low in potassium and high in sodium is associated with hypertension and plays a major role in the development of cancer and cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart disease, hypertension, stroke).32,33 In regard to hypertension, there is over- whelming evidence that dietary sodium chloride (salt) is a major cause of raised BP and that a modest reduction in salt intake can lower BP, which is predicted to reduce cardiovascular disease because there is a direct relation between salt intake and cardiovascular risk.34 In advis- ing a patient to decrease salt consumption, one must ensure that he or she is getting enough iodine from alternative sources. Conversely, a diet high in potassium and low in sodium is protective against car- diovascular diseases. In the case of hypertension, as evident from the second DASH study and others, this type of diet can be therapeutic. It is a well-established fact that excessive consumption of dietary sodium chloride coupled with diminished dietary potassium is a common cause of high BP, especially in “salt-sensitive” individuals. However, numerous studies have shown that in many cases, sodium restriction alone does not significantly improve BP control—it must be accompanied by high potassium intake. In a typical Western diet, only 5% of sodium intake comes from the natural constituents in food. Prepared foods contribute 45% of the sodium intake, 45% is added during cooking, and another 5% is added as a condiment. Most Americans have a potassium-to-sodium (K:Na) ratio of less than 1:2. Epidemiological and experimental research suggests that a dietary K:Na ratio of greater than 5:1 (as was apparently typical of human evolutionary diets) is necessary to maintain health. However, even this level may not be optimal. A natural diet rich in fruits and vegetables can produce a K:Na ratio greater than 100:1 because most fruits and vegetables have a K:Na ratio of at least 50:1.

## Potassium

Many studies have shown that increased dietary potassium intake can lower BP.35 In addition, several studies have shown that potassium supplementation alone can produce significant reductions in BP in hypertensive subjects. Results from 33 randomized controlled trials (2609 participants) in which potassium supplementation was the only difference between the intervention and control conditions were used in one meta-analysis. Using a random-effects model, potassium sup- plementation was associated with a significant reduction in mean sys- tolic and diastolic BP of 4.44 and 2.45 mm Hg, respectively. The effects of potassium supplementation appeared to be enhanced in subjects who had a high intake of sodium, indicating that this is an important recommendation for the prevention and treatment of hypertension in those who are unable to reduce their intake of sodium. The dosage of potassium typically used in the studies ranged from 2.5 to 5 g/day.

## 1395CHAPTER 179 Hypertension

In one study, 37 adults with hypertension received either 2.5 g/day of potassium, 2.5 g/day of potassium plus 480 mg/day of magnesium, or a placebo for 8 weeks; then they were crossed over to receive one of the other treatments for another 8 weeks; and then they were crossed over again in another 8 weeks.36 The potassium supplementation low- ered systolic BP an average of 12 mm Hg and diastolic BP an average of 16 mm Hg. Interestingly, the additional magnesium offered no further reduction in BP; nonetheless, magnesium supplementation has been shown to be helpful in other studies (discussed later). Potassium supplementation may be especially useful in the treat- ment of hypertension in persons above age 65, who often do not fully respond to antihypertensive drugs. In one double-blind study, 18 untreated elderly patients (average age 75 years) with a systolic BP of greater than 160 mm Hg, a diastolic BP of greater than 95 mm Hg, or both were given either potassium chloride (2.5 g of potas- sium) or a placebo each day for 4 weeks.37 After this relatively short treatment period, the group receiving the potassium experienced a drop of 12 mm Hg in their systolic BP and 7 mm Hg in their dia- stolic BP. These results compare quite favorably with the reduction of BP produced by drug therapy—and without the negative effects and side effects.38 Potassium supplements are available by prescription and over the counter (OTC). However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restricts the amount of potassium available in OTC potassium supplements to 99 mg per dose because of problems associated with high-dosage prescription potassium salts. Salt substitutes such as the popular brands NoSalt and Nu-Salt are, in fact, potassium chloride and provide 530 mg of potassium per 1⁄6 tsp. The prescription and OTC supplements are either potassium salts (chloride and bicar- bonate), potassium bound to various mineral chelates (e.g., aspar- tate, citrate), or food-based potassium sources. Potassium chloride preparations are the most popular by prescription and are available in a vast array of formulations (e.g., timed-release tablets, liquids, powders, and effervescent tablets) and flavors. Potassium salts are commonly prescribed in the dosage range of 1.5 to 3 g/day. However, potassium salts can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and ulcers when given in pill form at high dosages. These effects are not seen when potassium levels are increased through the diet only. This difference highlights the advantages of using foods or food-based potassium supplements rather than pills to meet the human body’s high potas- sium requirements. Potassium supplementation is relatively safe except for patients with kidney disease. Their inability to maintain appropriate potassium homeostasis may result in heart arrhythmias and other consequences of potassium toxicity. Potassium supplementation is also contraindi- cated if used in combination with a number of prescription medica- tions, including digitalis, potassium-sparing diuretics, and the ACE inhibitor class of antihypertensive drugs.


Potassium interacts with magnesium in many body systems, and low intracellular potassium levels may be the result of low magnesium intake. It is therefore appropriate to supplement magnesium (400– 1200 mg/day in divided doses) along with potassium. This may also lower BP. A meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials that tested the effects of mag- nesium supplementation on hypertension demonstrated clear dose- dependent BP reductions—a drop of 4.3 mm Hg systolic and 2.3 mm Hg diastolic for each 10 mmol/day increase in magnesium dose.39 In one double-blind clinical study, 21 male patients with hyper- tension were given 600 mg/day of magnesium (as magnesium oxide) or placebo.40 Mean BP (the average between the systolic and diastolic) decreased from 111 to 102 mm Hg. The patients who responded best were those with reduced red blood cell (RBC) potassium. After ther- apy with magnesium, the levels of intracellular sodium, potassium, and magnesium normalized, suggesting that one of the ways in which magnesium lowers BP is through activation of the cellular membrane pump moving sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell.

## 1396SECTION 6 Diseases

Considerable evidence indicates that a high intake of magnesium is associated with lower BP in population studies. The principal source of magnesium in early studies was water. Water that is high in minerals like magnesium is often referred to as “hard water.” Numerous studies have demonstrated an inverse correlation between water hardness and high BP.41 In the Honolulu Heart Study, systolic BP was 6.4 mm Hg lower and diastolic BP 3.1 mm Hg lower in the group with the highest magnesium intake compared with that having the lowest magnesium intake.42 Studies of magnesium supplementation in the treatment of hyper- tension have yielded mixed results. Although the overall results in a meta-analysis of the data are quite favorable, it appears that the hyper- tensive patients who respond are those taking a diuretic who have a high level of renin, with low RBC magnesium, or with elevated intra- cellular sodium or a decreased intracellular potassium. The recommended daily intake for magnesium in hypertensive patients appears to be approximately 6 to 10 mg/kg body weight. Magnesium is available in several forms. Although most are equally well absorbed, magnesium bound to aspartate or the Krebs cycle intermediates (malate, succinate, fumarate, and citrate) is usu- ally preferable to magnesium oxide, gluconate, sulfate, or chloride. Absorption studies indicate that magnesium is easily absorbed orally, especially when it is bound to citrate (and presumably aspartate and other members of the Krebs cycle).43,44 In addition, magnesium bound to aspartate or Krebs cycle intermediates may also help with fatigue. Aspartate feeds into the Krebs cycle, the final common path- way for the conversion of glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids to chemical energy (adenosine triphosphate, or ATP), whereas citrate, fumarate, malate, and succinate are actual components of the Krebs cycle. Minerals chelated to the Krebs cycle intermediates are better absorbed, used, and tolerated compared with inorganic or relatively insoluble mineral salts, including magnesium chloride, oxide, or car- bonate. In addition, although inorganic magnesium salts often cause diarrhea at higher dosages, organic forms of magnesium generally do not. In general, magnesium is well tolerated. Magnesium supplemen- tation can sometimes cause a looser stool, particularly magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts), hydroxide, or chloride. Magnesium supplemen- tation must be used with great care in patients with kidney disease or severe heart disease (such as high-grade atrioventricular block).


Population-based studies have suggested a link between hypertension and a low intake of calcium.36 However, the association is not as strong as the one for magnesium and potassium. In addition to the epidemi- ological data, several clinical studies have demonstrated that calcium supplementation can lower BP in hypertension, but the results have been inconsistent.45 To clarify the effectiveness of calcium supplementation in patients with hypertension, a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was performed on 46 patients with either salt-sensitive or salt-resistant hypertension.46 During the calcium supplementation phase, patients received 1.5 g/day of calcium (as calcium carbonate) for 8 weeks. The calcium supplementation was found to effectively reduce BP in black patients and in salt-sensitive patients but not in those having salt- resistant hypertension. Better results have been found for calcium citrate versus calcium carbonate.47 Another group that appears to respond to calcium supplementa- tion is elderly patients with hypertension. One study used 24-hour monitoring of BP to evaluate the effect of calcium supplementation on essential hypertension in elderly hospitalized patients. The mean sys- tolic and diastolic BPs over a 24-hour period declined by 13.6 mm Hg and 5 mm Hg, respectively, in patients whose diets were supplemented with 1 g of elemental calcium.48


Population-based and clinical studies have shown that the higher the intake of vitamin C, the lower the BP. The results from two double-blind trials have confirmed a modest BP-lowering effect with vitamin C supplementation in people with mild elevations of BP.49,50 One of the key findings of these studies was that a daily dose of mg produced the same benefit as higher doses (i.e., 1000 and 2000 mg daily). Vitamin C supplementation can produce decreases of up to 4.5 mm Hg in the systolic and 2.5 mm Hg in the diastolic BP. One of the mechanisms by which vitamin C exerts this antihyper- tensive effect is by promoting the excretion of lead. Chronic exposure to lead from environmental sources, including drinking water, is asso- ciated with hypertension and increased cardiovascular mortality. Areas with a soft water supply have an increased lead concentration in drink- ing water due to the increased acidity of the water, and people living in these areas may be predisposed to hypertension. It should be noted that soft water is also low in calcium and magnesium, two minerals that have also been shown to protect against hypertension. Vitamin C is likely to be more effective when it is used with other antioxidant nutrients. The combination of 500 mg of vitamin C, mg of α -tocopherol, 200 mg of zinc sulfate, and 30 mg of beta-carotene daily produced mild reductions in the systolic BP compared with the placebo phase both in subjects receiving antihypertensive therapy and those who were normotensive.51

## Folic Acid and Vitamin B

## 6

Folic acid and vitamin B 6 reduce plasma homocysteine levels—a known contributor to atherosclerosis. A 2-year trial of folic acid and vitamin B 6 therapy to lower homocysteine was associated with a reduction of 3.7 mm Hg in systolic BP and a reduction of 1.9 mm Hg in diastolic BP.52 Vitamin B 6 supplementation alone has also been shown to lower BP. In one study, vitamin B 6 supplementation at a single daily oral dose of 5 mg/kg for 4 weeks in 20 people with hypertension demonstrated significant reductions in systolic and diastolic BPs as well as serum norepinephrine levels.53 The effects on BP were significant; systolic pressure dropped from 167 to 153 mm Hg, and the diastolic pressure dropped from 108 to 98 mm Hg.

## Omega-3 Oils

More than 60 double-blind studies have demonstrated that fish oil sup- plements are effective in lowering BP.54,55 Typically, fish oils produced a reduction of 2.1 mm Hg in the systolic BP and 1.6 mm Hg in the dia- stolic BP at a dose of 3000 mg of omega-3 (EPA/DHA) daily. In one double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, healthy men and women consumed a control oil or fish oil providing 0.7g or 1.8g EPA + DHA per day (intakes achievable through diet), in random order, each for 8 weeks to examine the effect of fish oil on systolic and diastolic BP.56 Findings indicated that in adults with isolated systolic hypertension, daily doses of EPA + DHA as low as 0.7 g showed clinically meaningful BP reductions. Flaxseed oil may also lower BP. In one study, along with reduc- ing the intake of saturated fat, 1 tbsp/day of flaxseed oil reduced both the systolic and diastolic readings by up to 9 mm Hg.57 Another study found that for every absolute 1% increase in body alpha-linolenic acid content, there was a decrease of 5 mm Hg in the systolic, diastolic, and mean BPs.58

## Arginine

Arginine, an amino acid, is important in the formation of nitric oxide. This compound plays a central role in determining the tone of blood vessels and renal function. Specifically, it exerts a relaxing effect on

## 1397CHAPTER 179 Hypertension

blood vessels, thereby improving blood flow as well as renal plasma flow and the glomerular filtration rate. Normally the body makes enough arginine even when the diet is lacking. However, in some instances, the body may not be able to keep up with increased require- ments, in which case supplementation may prove useful. In high BP, even in mild cases, there appears to be a derangement of endothelial nitric oxide production, especially in the kidneys. Low levels of NO are associated with impaired endothelial function. Asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA), an analog of l-arginine, is a naturally occurring product of metabolism found in human circu- lation. Elevated levels of ADMA inhibit NO synthesis and therefore impair endothelial function and thus promote atherosclerosis and hypertension. Experimental data from cell culture and animal exper- iments and cross-sectional studies in humans suggest an association between elevated ADMA concentrations and cardiovascular diseases. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigat- ing endothelial function as measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), serum ADMA and serum l-arginine levels in 49 hyper- cholesterolemic individuals were compared with those of individuals with normal cholesterol levels.59 People with hypercholesterolemia had impaired endothelial function, increased ADMA levels, and decreased l-arginine/ADMA ratios. ADMA levels were inversely correlated to the endothelial-dependent vasodilatation, and intravenous infusion of l- arginine normalized the l-arginine/ADMA ratio as well as the endothelial function. A 2005 study investigated the relationship between ADMA plasma levels and endothelium-dependent vasodilation in 36 patients with never-treated essential hypertension and 8 normotensive healthy sub- jects.60 Subjects with hypertension had impaired brachial artery FMD, increased ADMA levels, and increased l-arginine plasma concentra- tions compared with normotensive controls. These measures were inversely correlated with ADMA levels, independently accounting for 34% of the interindividual variability in peak flow-mediated dilatation. Infusion of l-arginine improved the endothelial function. Arginine supplementation has been shown to be beneficial in several cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension. By increasing nitric oxide levels, arginine supplementation improves blood flow, reduces the formation of blood clots, and improves blood fluidity. In hyperten- sion, the degree of improvement offered by arginine supplementation can be quite significant in some cases.61,62 In general, however, a dos- age of 4 g three times daily will produce only modest decreases (e.g., mm Hg) in systolic BP with little meaningful change in diastolic BP.63 Arginine supplementation may prove to be most beneficial in younger subjects with essential hypertension because older adult patients with hypertension appear to have a derangement in NO-dependent renal mechanisms. In a study comparing the renal response with an intra- venous infusion of arginine in young and aged patients with essential hypertension, arginine induced a significant increase in renal plasma flow, arginine glomerular filtration rate, and natriuresis and kaliuresis in the younger subjects, without changes in filtration fraction.64 These effects were not observed in older subjects. One trial investigated the influence of a combination of l-arginine with the vitamins B 6 , folic acid, and B 12 (TELCOR Arginin plus) on endothelial dysfunction in subjects aged 40 to 65 years with mild to moderate BP elevation not treated with antihypertensive drugs.65 Individuals were randomly assigned to either the dietetic product (n = 40) or a matching placebo (n = 41) for 3 months with open follow-up for a further 3 months. The primary efficacy analysis demonstrated a statistically significant superiority of the combination of l-arginine with B vitamins over placebo in improving and restoring impaired endothelial function and lowering BP in patients with mild to moder- ate blood pressure elevation.

## Anti-ACE Peptides

Various naturally occurring peptides have been shown to inhibit ACEs, including peptides from milk, chicken, and fish. The best-studied are composed of a purified mixture of nine small peptides (proteins) derived from muscle of the fish bonito (a member of the tuna fam- ily).66–68 Anti-ACE bonito peptides do not appear to produce the side effects typical of ACE inhibitors (according to human safety studies) and do not lower BP in people with normal BP, even when admin- istered at levels 20 times greater than the dose level that lowers BP in people with high BP. A possible reason is that its mechanism of action in inhibiting ACEs is different from that of the drugs. Research bears out this theory. The drugs indiscriminately block ACEs by interfering with their action, whereas the bonito anti-ACE peptides interact much differently. ACEs convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II by cleav- ing off a small peptide. Drugs work by directly blocking this action. Naturally occurring anti-ACE peptides work differently; ACEs actually react with the peptides instead of angiotensin. In addition to compet- ing with angiotensin via this effect, anti-ACE peptides are transformed into even more potent inhibitors of ACEs. Technically speaking, the bonito anti-ACE peptides are considered a “prodrug” because the transformed peptides exert an 800% greater activity level. Four clinical studies have shown that fish-derived anti-ACE pep- tides (three with the bonito peptides and one with a dipeptide from sardine) exert significant BP-lowering effects in people with high BP.67–69 The degree of BP reduction in these studies was quite signif- icant, typically reducing the systolic BP by at least 10 mm Hg and the diastolic BP by 7 mm Hg in people with hypertension. Greater reduc- tions are seen in people with higher initial BP readings.

## Coenzyme Q

<!-- chunk -->

## 10

Coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10 ), also known as ubiquinone, is an essential com- ponent of the mitochondria. Although CoQ 10 can be synthesized within the body, deficiency states have been reported. In hypertension, CoQ 10 deficiency has been shown to be present in 39% of patients. This find- ing alone suggests a need for CoQ 10 supplementation. However, CoQ 10 appears to provide benefits beyond the correction of a deficiency. The majority of studies exploring CoQ10 in the treatment of high BP have been uncontrolled or have used CoQ10 in combination with conventional antihypertensive medical treatments, making these stud- ies difficult to interpret. A Cochrane review on CoQ 10 in the treatment of hypertension (12 clinical trials, 362 patients) concluded that in hypertensive patients, CoQ 10 has the potential to lower systolic and diastolic BP without significant side effects.70 Among all included studies, decreases in systolic BP ranged from 11 to 17 mm Hg and in diastolic BP from 8 to 10 mm Hg. In 3 of the 12 studies, CoQ 10 was given in addition to existing antihypertensive medication, and in one of these, more than 50% of the patients were able to cease taking at least one antihypertensive medication during the trial. These results are consistent with some of the uncontrolled studies. For example, in one uncontrolled study, the dose of CoQ 10 was adjusted in 109 patients with essential hypertension according to clinical response and blood CoQ 10 levels (the aim was to attain blood levels >2 mg/mL). The aver- age CoQ 10 dose was 225 mg/day in addition to these patients’ usual antihypertensive regimen. The need for antihypertensive medication declined gradually; after a mean treatment period of 4.4 months, about half of the patients were able to discontinue between one and three of their drugs.71 It is important to remember that the antihypertensive effect of CoQ 10 is usually not seen until after 4 to 12 weeks of therapy. Thus CoQ 10 is not a typical BP-lowering drug; rather, it seems to correct some metabolic abnormality, which in turn has a favorable influence on BP. For more information, see Chapter 79.

## L-Citrulline

Supplementation with citrulline, an NO-boosting agent, has shown promise as a BP-lowering intervention in adults with hypertension, with animal evidence for atherogenic-endothelial protection. The car- diovascular health benefits of L-citrulline are largely predicated on the capacity for citrulline to increase l-arginine availability for NO bio- synthesis. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, L-citrulline treatment prevents hypertension by increasing the l-arginine/ADMA ratio.72 In obese men with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension, those treated with watermelon extract containing 6 g/day of L-citrulline/l- arginine, compared with placebo, for 6 weeks exhibited reduced ankle and brachial systolic blood pressure (–12 ± 4 and –15 ± 3 mm Hg, respectively), ankle and brachial diastolic blood pressure (–8 ± 2 and –8 ± 2 mm Hg, respectively), and carotid wave reflection, which may suggest improved arterial function.73 A pilot study of middle-aged, prehypertensive men and women evaluated the effects of watermelon supplementation (L-citrulline/l-arginine, 2.7g/ 1.3g per day) on aor- tic BP and arterial function in individuals with prehypertension.74 Compared with placebo, 6 weeks of watermelon extract supplemen- tation improved peripheral vascular tone (decreased augmentation index and pulse wave velocity) and led to a significant reduction in aortic systolic blood pressure (–9 ± 3 vs. –2 ± 3 mm Hg) and nonsig- nificant reductions in brachial artery systolic blood pressure (–9 ± 7 vs. –3 ± 7 mm Hg). Forty volunteers consumed 6 g of watermelon extract daily (n = 20; age 48.7 ± 1.9 years, 10 men) or a placebo (n = 20; age 47.4 ± 1.2 years, 11 men) in a 6-week randomized, double-blind, experimental, and placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of supplementation with watermelon extract on the BP and sym- pathovagal balance of individuals with prehypertension or hyper- tension.75 BP and cardiac autonomic modulation were measured. Although there was no significant change in sympathovagal balance from the beginning (1.7 ± 0.1) to the end of the study (1.7 ± 0.4), watermelon extract promoted a significant reduction in sys- tolic (137.8 ± 3.9–126.0 ± 4.0 mm Hg, p < 0.0001) and diastolic (79.2 ± 2.2–72.3 ± 2.0 mm Hg, p < 0.001) BP. Accumulating human clinical trials provide evidence that L-citrulline and watermelon extract reduce peripheral and central (aortic) BP and improve resting BP and arterial stiffness in adults with prehypertension and those with hypertension.76 In addition, L-citrulline appears to promote adaptations to physiological and envi- ronmental stressors to reduce vessel wall stiffness and attenuates any sympathetic-mediated hypertensive response.77

## Caffeine

Caffeine consumption from coffee or tea can produce an imme- diate, short-lived increase in BP, and regular coffee drinking has been associated with slight increases in BP. However, it is gener- ally thought that a tolerance to the hypertensive effects of caffeine develops in habitual coffee or tea drinkers.78–79 Yet some studies have shown that with repeated administration of caffeine, a per- sistent pressor effect is produced. For example, in 11 short-term trials looking at the pressor effect of caffeine consumption (rang- ing from 14 to 79 days), the average dose of five cups of coffee per day was associated with an increase of 2.4 mm Hg in systolic BP and an increase of 1.2 mm Hg in diastolic BP.80 Although the overall benefit of long-term avoidance of caffeine (from coffee, tea, chocolate, cola drinks, and some medications) on BP is unclear, it appears that some patients seem to respond quite favorably to caf- feine avoidance. It should therefore be attempted in patients with hypertension.

## Crataegus Species

Extracts of hawthorn berries as well as of the flowering tops are widely used by physicians in Europe because of their cardiovascular effects. Several studies, including double-blind trials, have demonstrated that hawthorn extracts are effective in lowering BP and improving heart function.81,82 However, the BP-lowering effect of hawthorn is mild. It typically takes 2 to 4 weeks before this agent begins to exert any effect. For more information, see Chapter 82.

## Olive (Olea europaea)

The leaves of the olive tree (Olea europaea L.) have been used since ancient times to combat high BP, and this agent has significant support in animal and human studies both as an antihypertensive and in low- ering cholesterol. The active substances are oleuropein (a polyphenolic iridoid glycoside),83 oleacein, and oleanolic acid, which act as natural calcium channel blockers. Hydroxytyrosol is a metabolite of oleuro- pein that exerts antioxidant effects. Olive extracts are often standard- ized for hydroxytyrosol, but this compound is devoid of any significant antihypertensive effect. Oleuropein is also found in the olive’s fruit and oil but in significantly smaller quantities than the leaf. In an initial small double-blind study of patients with essential hypertension, 12 consulting for the first time and 18 currently on anti- hypertensive drugs, olive leaf extract at a dose of 400 mg four times daily for 3 months produced a modest yet statistically significant decrease in BP, with no side effects.84 Additional studies have used Benolea (EFLA943), standardized to oleuropein (16%–24%), and polyphenols. In a preliminary clin- ical study, 20 monozygotic adult twin pairs with mild hypertension received either a dose of 500 or 1000 mg daily for 8 weeks or a placebo. After 8 weeks, BP remained unchanged from baseline in the placebo group and the 500-mg/day group but was significantly decreased for the group receiving 1000 mg/day (137 vs. 126).83 In another study with Benolea, 232 patients with hypertension were given either the olive leaf extract (500 mg twice a day) or captopril (12.5 mg twice daily). The mean BP at baseline was 149.3/93.9 mm Hg in the group receiving olive leaf extract and 148.4/93.8 mm Hg in the group on captopril. Mean reductions in systolic BP from baseline to the end of the study were 11.5 and 13.7 mm Hg in the olive leaf extract and captopril groups, respectively, with parallel reductions in diastolic BP of 4.8 and 6.4 mm Hg, respectively.85

## Allium Sativum and Allium Cepa

A meta-analysis of published and unpublished randomized controlled trials of garlic preparations was conducted to determine the effect of garlic on BP relative to placebo.28 Eight trials (seven double blind, one single blind) were identified as meeting analytic criteria. In total, 415 subjects were included in the analysis. All trials used a dried garlic powder standardized to contain 1.3% allicin at a dose of 600 to mg daily (corresponding to 7.8 and 11.7 mg, respectively, of allicin or the equivalent of approximately 1.8–2.7 g of fresh garlic daily). The meta-analysis concluded that garlic preparations designed to yield alli- cin can lower systolic and diastolic BP over a 1- to 3-month period. The typical drop from pooled data was 11 mm Hg in the systolic BP and 5 mm Hg in the diastolic BP.

indicated a significant effect of H. sabdariffa supplementation in lowering both systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference –7.58 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference –3.53 mm Hg).86 One double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 65 prehypertensive and mildly hypertensive adults 30 to 70 years of age who were not taking antihypertensive medications. They were given either three 240-mL servings per day of brewed hibiscus tea or a placebo beverage for 6 weeks. At 6 weeks, hibiscus tea was found to have lowered systolic BP compared with placebo (by 7.2 vs. 1.3 mm Hg). Diastolic BP was also lower, although this change did not differ from placebo. Participants with higher systolic BP at baseline showed a greater response to the hibiscus treatment.87 In another double-blind study, the effect of hibiscus tea was com- pared with that of black tea in 60 patients with diabetes and hyper- tension who were not taking antihypertensive or lipid-lowering drugs. The mean systolic BP in the hibiscus group decreased from 134.4 mm Hg at the beginning of the study to 112.7 mm Hg after 1 month, whereas it increased from 118.6 to 127.3 mm Hg in the group drinking black tea. The intervention had no statistically significant effect on the mean diastolic BP in either group.88 Another study with hibiscus tea did show an effect on diastolic BP (reducing it by 10.7%), as well as systolic BP (reducing it by 11.2%), after 12 days of treatment.89 Two clinical studies featured the use of a standardized extract of hibiscus in patients with high BP. In one double-blind study, patients with hypertension were given either hibiscus extract (250 mg of total anthocyanins daily) or 10 mg of lisinopril (control group). The results showed that the hibiscus extract decreased BP from 146.48/97.77 to 129.89/85.96 mm Hg, reaching an absolute reduction of 17.14/11.97 mm Hg. The hibiscus treatment showed a therapeutic effectiveness of 65.12% as well as tolerability and safety of 100%. BP reductions and therapeutic effectiveness were lower than those obtained with lisinopril. Hibiscus treatment lowered plasma ACE activity from 44 to 30 U/L.90 Similar effects on BP were shown in another double-blind study with a standardized hibiscus extract (a daily dose of 9.6 mg of total anthocyanins) compared with captopril (50 mg/day). Hibiscus extract decreased the systolic BP from 139.05 to 123.73 mm Hg and the dia- stolic BP from 90.81 to 79.5 mm Hg.91

## Viscum Album

Viscum album, or mistletoe, exhibits hypotensive action in animal studies. The crude extract of V. album possesses smooth-muscle–relax- ant effects mediated through the voltage-dependent Ca(++) channel blockade, which may explain its spasmolytic and vasorelaxant activ- ity.92 V. album has been shown to inhibit the excitability of the vaso- motor center in the medulla oblongata and to possess cholinomimetic activity.87 Its hypotensive activity may depend on the form in which the mis- tletoe is administered and the host tree from which it was collected. Studies indicate that aqueous extracts are more effective; the highest hypotensive activity was demonstrated by a macerate of leaves of mis- tletoe parasitizing on willow and gathered in January (see Chapter for further discussion).

repair-apoptosis pathways might have an important role in disease susceptibility, and because some of these genes are regulated by thy- roid hormones, they may affect the patient outcomes. One prospective case-controlled study aimed to assess the influence of the GST, CYP, and TP53 gene polymorphisms in the risk of Graves’ disease.6 The authors concluded that GSTP1, CYP1A1, and TP53 germline polymor- phisms may be associated with smoking-related Graves’ disease sus- ceptibility and configure a risk profile for the disease. However, these polymorphisms did not influence the patients’ response to treatment.

## Iodine Supplementation

An interesting study evaluated the effects of mandatory consumption of iodized salt in a whole population of 267,330 inhabitants of Galicia.7 The incidence of thyrotoxicosis, diagnosed as elevated T4 and sup- pressed TSH levels, increased throughout the whole study period, with 4.89 new cases per 100,000 population. The rate of increase among females (8.03) was much greater than that among males (1.34). The increased incidence of thyrotoxicosis comprised both nodular and diffuse goiters. The authors concluded that dietary iodine supplemen- tation in iodine-sufficient areas can increase the incidence of thyrotox- icosis in susceptible individuals. Globally, similar scenarios have occurred. When a population’s intake of iodine suddenly increases, even to appropriate levels, many individuals lapse into hyperthyroid states. This is more common among the elderly, those with positive thyroid antibodies, and those with marginal selenium status. Iodine from other sources in doses above 600 mcg can trigger Graves’ disease and toxic multinodular goi- ter. Common sources include potassium iodide, an iodine/potassium iodide (Iodoral) supplement, medications such as amiodarone, and imaging contrast agents.7

## Infection

The TSH receptor antibodies in Graves’ disease share a similar struc- ture with antibodies against several known pathogens. It has been shown that cases of Graves’ have started during or shortly after acute infection with Yersinia enterocolitica and Borrelia burgdorferi.8

<!-- chunk -->

## Drugs

In older patients with hyperthyroidism, a toxic reaction to prescrip- tion drugs must be considered. Exposure to iodine-containing contrast agents during medical procedures is a common scenario. Some sources recommend TSH screening before administration of iodine-contain- ing contrast agents.9 Another drug-induced cause of hyperthyroidism in the elderly is the use of amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic drug.10

## Toxins

Workers exposed to 2,3,7,8-TCDD, a dioxin contaminant of chloro- phenoxy herbicides, have significantly higher free T4 levels.11 Children with high perinatal exposure to PCDD/Fs show no change in thyroid hormone levels at age 1 or 2 but have significantly elevated T3 levels at age 5.12 A similar elevation of FT4 was noted at birth in babies exposed to dioxins in utero and through breast milk.13 The elevation of FT4 in the exposed infants reached statistical significance at week 1 and week 11. By week 11, TSH concentrations were also statistically higher in the children receiving dioxin with their breast milk. Perchlorate is known to competitively inhibit iodide uptake at the sodium iodide symporter and has been used in the past in the diagnosis and treatment of thyrotoxicosis.14 Workers in an ammonium perchlo- rate production plant were found to have a 38% reduction in 14-hour thyroid radioactive iodine uptake.15

## Other

Other factors that may initiate Graves’ disease include corticosteroid use and local trauma to the thyroid. In addition, symptoms of hyper- thyroidism vary somewhat in older adults, with apathy, tachycardia, and weight loss being more common. This response is more probable in those with subclinical hyperthyroidism (lack of symptoms, normal T4, but low TSH).

## Clinical Presentation

The typical clinical presentation of Graves’ disease is a young adult female complaining of the following: • Nervousness • Irritability • Sweating • Palpitations • Insomnia • Tremor • Frequent stools • Unexplained weight loss • Metrorrhagia Physical examination often reveals a smooth, diffuse, nontender goiter; tachycardia, especially after exercise; loud heart sounds (often a systolic murmur); mild proptosis, lid retraction, lid lag, and tremor; and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes. Other signs and symptoms may include muscle weakness and fatigue, anxiety, heat intolerance, and pretibial myxedema. However, in atypical cases, especially in elderly patients, any or all of the previously mentioned symptoms may be absent. This pre- sentation is known as apathetic thyrotoxicosis and has been known to present in the elderly, with the only symptom being depression. Special care must be taken to avoid missing the diagnosis with this presentation. A screening laboratory test for suppressed TSH is helpful in these patients. Also, it is useful to keep in mind that an increase in thyroid hormone can present as a worsening of already present cardiac symptoms such as angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.

## 1402SECTION 6 Diseases

The skin can show characteristic changes, becoming moist, warm, and finely textured. Perspiration increases as a response to the increased body temperature. Pigment changes such as vitiligo can be associated with Graves’ disease, as well as increased pigmentation of areas such as skin creases and the knuckles. Hair may thin or fall out in patches or altogether (alopecia). Nails may separate prematurely from the nail bed (onycholysis). Localized, nonpitting edema typically occurs along the shins (myxedema) but may occur elsewhere, generally on the extensor surfaces, and is often pruritic and red. Additional symptoms associated with Graves’ disease, include glu- cose intolerance, dyspnea, polyuria and polydipsia, myopathy, paraly- sis, parkinsonian, and others.16,17 Although in severely hyperthyroid states symptoms are predict- able, some symptoms can be paroxysmal, manifesting in both mild hyperthyroid and hypothyroid states. These include anxiety, palpita- tions, weight gain, fatigue, and insomnia. This is relevant in managing patients for either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism because it is not safe to assume that patients have increased or decreased levels of thyroid hormone based solely on symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

## Differential Diagnosis

Graves’ disease is the most common diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, but several other conditions present with a similar symptom picture. The sec- ond most common cause is toxic nodular goiter, which includes toxic ade- noma and multinodular goiter. Other causes of hyperthyroidism include early Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (also known as hashitoxicosis), painless thy- roiditis, and radiation thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism can also result from exogenous causes, including iatrogenic hyperthyroidism, factitious hyper- thyroidism (often seen in dieters who are taking thyroxine for weight loss), and iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (Jod–Basedow disease). Rare causes of hyperthyroidism include thyroid carcinoma, ecto- pic hyperthyroidism, trophoblastic tumors (e.g., hydatidiform mole, choriocarcinoma, embryonic carcinoma of the testis), excessive TSH (e.g., pituitary adenoma, nonneoplastic pituitary secretion of TSH), and struma ovarii. Table 180.1 indicates the relative frequency of the various causes of hyperthyroidism.

<!-- chunk -->

## Laboratory Diagnosis

The laboratory is where the definitive diagnosis is made, and several tests are available to assess thyroid function and functional anatomy (Table 180.2). In most cases, serum TSH will be suppressed below 0.2, and free T3 and free T4 may be elevated. Hyperthyroid morbidity and mortality risks are present even with TSH suppression alone. The autoimmune activity associ- ated with Graves’ disease involves both B and T lymphocytes and is directed at four specific thyroid antigens: the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), thy- roglobulin (Tg), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), and the thyrotropin receptor (TSH-R). TSH receptor antibodies (TSH-R Ab) or thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSIs) are present in 80% of cases of Graves’ disease. If a nodule or diffuse swelling is present on palpation or ultrasound, a thyroid uptake scan should be performed to guide treatment and rule out malignancy. The determination of serum antibodies can also be useful in ruling out cancer in patients with firm lobular goiters. High antibody levels suggest chronic thyroiditis in these cases. The presence of a nodule in the absence of abnormal thyroid function tests always warrants ultrasound and possible biopsy. Iodine scans show diffuse heightened iodine uptake in Graves’ disease and localized heightened iodine uptake, also known as “hot” nodules, in toxic nodular goiter. “Cold” nodules on scans are regions of poor iodine uptake and are assumed to be cancerous until proven otherwise.


The objective of the natural treatment of Graves’ disease and hyper- thyroidism is to reduce symptoms while trying to reestablish normal thyroid status. Few treatments besides antithyroid drugs (ATDs), radi- ation, or surgery will have a significant effect on the immediate severity of hyperthyroid symptoms. Nonetheless, adjunctive treatments and Naturopathic lifestyle recommendations can lower the dose or dura- tion of ATDs or increase the likelihood of disease remission when combined with conventional treatment. Practical steps include reduction of risk factors (e.g., stress, smok- ing, excess iodine intake) and increased rest. Stress control is the single most important action the patient can take to assist normalization of the thyroid. The patient should avoid anything that will excite him or her and increase agitation. Counseling may be incorporated to prevent a return to a stress-generating lifestyle. Rest should also be increased.

## Comorbidities

Patients with autoimmune thyroid disease are more likely than the general population to suffer from the following18: • Celiac disease • Osteoporosis • Mitral valve prolapse • Type 1 diabetes

# CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT OF

# HYPERTHYROIDISM

Conventional first-line treatment of hyperthyroidism in the United States focuses on radioactive iodine ablation. Advantages include a high rate of response and lack of ongoing suppression. Disadvantages include progression to hypothyroidism and an elevated risk of nonlo- calized cancers and parathyroid disease.

## 1403CHAPTER 180 Hyperthyroidism

Surgery to remove all or part of the gland is less commonly used for hyperthyroidism. It is a consideration when the patient is very young or pregnant and iodine or ATDs are less preferred. It can also be considered when the gland is enlarged enough to create ana- tomical impingement on adjacent structures or cosmetic concerns. Disadvantages include laryngeal nerve damage, parathyroid abnor- malities through localized trauma or inadvertent removal, and general surgical complications. Globally, ATDs are more commonly relied on as mainstays of treat- ment for hyperthyroidism. Most cases can be given a trial of an ATD for 18 to 24 months; these individuals may not need ongoing treatment afterward. The disadvantage is that they can have hepatic and hemato- logic toxicities and monitoring is required. ATDs work by entering the thyroid via active transport mecha- nisms, accumulating inside the thyroid, and inhibiting binding of iodine to tyrosine, thus disrupting hormone synthesis. In Europe and Japan, ATD treatment is considered a first-line approach for Graves’ and Plummer’s diseases. Most cases are known to resolve within months, and most remain euthyroid or hypothyroid for life. In the United States, radioactive iodine (RAI) is considered first-line ther- apy, with ATDs only being used for initial management.19 However, according to a recent study examining the frequency of antithyroid drug prescription in the United States, methimazole has become the most frequently prescribed antithyroid drug, indicating a shift toward pharmacological treatment as the primary treatment option in Graves’ disease.20 Fluoride in the form of sodium fluoride is a natural compound with antithyroid properties significant enough to allow for its use instead of conventional ATD or in conjunction with ATDs allowing for lower doses of medications. Historically, sodium fluoride and flu- orotyrosine were used as oral antithyroid agents before propylthioura- cil (PTU) and methimazole. Common doses of PTU used to manage adult hyperthyroidism range from 200 to 450 mg/day in divided doses and 5 to 20 mg/d in divided doses for methimazole. Fluoride is listed as a pregnancy category C agent and is known to cause gastrointestinal side effects at doses starting at 3 mg/kg and toxicity at doses starting at 5 mg/kg. In the early management of hyperthyroidism, 4 to 6 weeks of ATD are needed to see clinical benefit because of the high amount of pro- tein-bound iodine already stored within the thyroid gland. Excess levels of both T4 and T3 are known to be reabsorbed through entero- hepatic recirculation. It has been shown that cholestyramine can speed the elimination of thyroid hormone by blocking enterohepatic recir- culation.18 It is plausible that dietary fibers such as rice bran or ground flax may have similar properties.

## Balanced, Whole-Foods Diet

Small, frequent, high-calorie meals should be consumed to compensate for the increase in metabolism. Protein should be supplemented if the patient is nutritionally depleted. Caffeine-containing foods and other stimulants should be avoided. In mild cases, consumption of large amounts of raw Brassica family foods and raw soy products may be adequately combined with restricted iodine consumption to control symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dietary Goitrogens

Some foods contain goitrogenic substances that prevent the utilization of iodine. These compounds are primarily isothiocyanates that are similar in action and structure to propylthiouracil. They are found in such foods as turnips, cabbage, rutabagas, mustard, cassava root, soy- beans, peanuts, pine nuts, and millet. However, these foods are unre- liable in the treatment of hyperthyroidism for the following reasons: • The goitrogen content is quite low and has minimal beneficial effect on hyperthyroidism. • Cooking inactivates goitrogens. • No substantial documentation exists that these naturally occurring goitrogens interfere with thyroid function to any significant degree when dietary iodine levels are adequate. Because iodine is found in kelp and other seaweeds, vegetables grown near the ocean, seafood, iodized salt, and some nutritional sup- plements should be avoided.21 Great care must be exercised when using this approach because results are inconsistent, and a delay in effective treatment can harm the patient. If the patient does not respond within a few weeks of treatment, conventional intervention is required.

## Iodine

Worldwide, iodine deficiency continues to be a problem, but in devel- oped countries, iodine excess is more common. Sources of iodine include additives to food products (e.g., salt and iodine used to sterilize pipes in dairies) and in medical products (e.g., povidone/iodine washes, iodine-containing drugs such as amiodarone, radiographic dyes). The effects of iodine in patients with hyperthyroidism include the following: • Large doses of iodine temporarily reduce symptoms by stopping hormone synthesis (Wolff–Chaikoff effect). • The thyroid can remain suppressed or can eventually resume hor- mone synthesis at a reduced, former, or even increased rate (escape from Wolff–Chaikoff).22 • Excess iodine can trigger hyperthyroidism (Jod–Basedow disease) in a euthyroid person or can trigger an overactive thyroid to return to normal. From the brief descriptions of these three possibilities, aside from the initial suppression of thyroid function, the action of iodine is unpredictable. • Iodine intake should be kept on the low end of the normal thera- peutic range; 150 to 250 mcg/day for adults.

## -Carnitine

l-Carnitine is a ubiquitous nutrient in tissues, where it plays an important role in energy metabolism and may be beneficial in cases of hyperthyroidism.23 Carnitine is already known for its important implications for cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and several other conditions (see Chapter 63).


Calcium metabolism is altered in hyperthyroidism, and patients with Graves’ disease are more susceptible to osteoporosis.


Emerging research is showing that selenium deficiency influences the generation of free radicals, the conversion of T4 to T3, and the autoim- mune thyroid process. Selenium administration may be effective and safe in patients with Graves’ disease and with mild forms of Graves’ orbitopathy. A prospective, case-control study of 198 patients from Australia aimed to determine whether serum selenium levels are reduced in patients with Graves’ disease with orbitopathy compared with those without orbitopathy.24 Results showed that mean serum selenium levels were significantly lower in individuals with Graves’ orbitopathy than in those without orbitopathy. In addition, mean selenium levels appeared to decrease in parallel with increasing severity of orbitopathy.

One randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial compared the effect of selenium (an antioxidant agent) or pentoxifylline (an anti-inflammatory agent) in 159 patients with mild Graves’ orbitop- athy.25 The patients were given selenium (100 μ g twice daily—a very modest dosage), pentoxifylline (600 mg twice daily), or placebo (twice daily) orally for 6 months. Selenium, but not pentoxifylline, was shown to improve quality of life, reduce ocular involvement, and significantly slow the progression of the disease. Moreover, a 6-month follow-up confirmed the benefits of the 6-month selenium treatment.

## Antioxidants

Oxygen free radicals and cytokines play a pathogenic role in Graves’ dis- ease as well as in the development of Graves’ orbitopathy. Patients with Graves’ disease who received supplementation with a mixture of antiox- idants (selenium, beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E) in addition to therapy with methimazole achieved euthyroidism faster than patients taking methimazole alone.26 A prospective, nonrandomized, compara- tive study of patients with mild or moderately severe, active, newly diag- nosed Graves’ ophthalmopathy found that 82% of patients treated with oral antioxidants showed improvement in symptoms compared with only 27% of the control group.27 Although the sample size was small, the encouraging results warrant further prospective studies.


Low serum vitamin D status is associated with the development of auto- immune diseases, including hyperthyroidism and new-onset Graves’ disease. A quantitative meta-analysis of t20 case-control studies found that patients with autoimmune thyroid disease had lower levels of 25(OH)D and were more likely to be deficient in 25(OH)D compared with controls.28 Subgroup analyses results showed that patients with Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis also had lower 25(OH)D levels and were more likely to have a 25(OH)D deficiency. In addition, considering the increase in metabolic rate and systemic functioning, vitamin D supplementation is recommended to maintain bone min- eral density and to maintain circulating vitamin D concentrations.


Vitamin A is vital for proper thyroid function, and deficiency is com- mon in thyroid disorders. In a study of 190 patients with goiter, serum levels were significantly decreased in those with hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.29


Table 180.3 lists medicinal plants that have traditionally been used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Unfortunately, these plants have not been adequately evaluated in clinical studies.

## officinalis

Aqueous freeze-dried extracts of Lycopus species, Lithospermum offici- nale, and Melissa officinalis have been studied both in vivo and in vitro, with preliminary results supporting their use in the treatment of Graves’ disease. However, additional research is necessary before these plants can be relied on clinically. Effects noted for these three plants include an ability to inhibit the effects of exogenous TSH on the thyroid glands of rats, block the effects of TSH on the TSH receptor sites located on thyroid membranes, inhibit the peripheral deiodination of T4 to T3, and block the effects of antithyroid immunoglobulins on TSH receptors.30–32 Eight isolated compounds, mainly oxidation products of deriva- tives of 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid, were found to be responsible for most of these effects.33 The blocking effects of the isolated compounds of the TSH receptors were reversible, and none of the compounds combined irreversibly, damaged, or altered the TSH receptors in situ. An alcohol extract of Lycopus europaeus administered orally to rats caused a long-lasting decrease in T3 levels, presumably due to reduced peripheral T4 deiodination. A pronounced reduction in TSH was also observed 24 hours later, as were declines in luteinizing hormone and testosterone.34 Water extracts did not have as strong an effect, explain- ing the lack of results in some earlier studies. This finding is consistent with the observation that the active constituents are the unoxidized phenolic compounds, which are not present in the aqueous extract. Although these findings support the traditional use of these plants for patients with hyperactive thyroids, there is no research on the clin- ical use of these plants or documented guidelines for dosage recom- mendations. Anecdotally, most who have attempted to use botanical medication to treat Graves’ disease have found it to be ineffective.


Acute Graves’ disease is not easily treated by naturopathic methods. In most cases, there is no guarantee that natural treatments will alleviate the symptoms. Thyroid storm is a potentially fatal complication and should be treated aggressively with antithyroid drugs, radio ablation, or thyroidectomy. In mild cases, natural therapeutics can manage the symptoms well but must be monitored carefully to avoid sudden exac- erbation of the illness. Patients will often do well for a time and then relapse. Mild cases should be treated symptomatically and allowed to return to a euthyroid status if possible. Rarely are natural antithyroid treatments adequate as monotherapies. If iodine is used, then ablative treatment should also be scheduled, as the risk of escape, with a poten- tial for a return to even more intense symptoms, increases with time. The allopathic treatment of Graves’ disease is unusual in that there are three relatively equal treatments from which to choose. As phy- sicians, it is best to educate patients about the advantages and disad- vantages of each treatment option and work together to decide which treatment best fits their needs. Importantly, decision making is dif- ficult while patients are in a thyrotoxic state. For these individuals, symptomatic relief must be rendered before a decision is made. Antithyroid medications can manage symptoms indefinitely while waiting for a possible return to euthyroid status. The main consid- eration is they can have immunosuppresant and hepatotoxic effects.

Monitoring is required and changing therapies may be needed. If these drugs are not well tolerated, then ablative therapies must be consid- ered. Surgery has a higher rate of euthyroid results than radioactive iodine but carries a greater risk of serious complications. Regardless of the treatment selected, supportive treatment should be rendered.


A whole-foods diet with increased levels of calories, micronutrients, and protein is recommended to meet the increased metabolic needs of the patient with hyperthyroidism. In mild cases, consumption of large amounts of raw Brassica family foods and raw soy products may be adequately combined with restricted iodine consumption to control symptoms.

## 1407CHAPTER 181 Hypoglycemia

The heart is also dependent on glucose. In a study in Japan, oral glucose tolerance (OGTT) was assessed in 116 nondiabetic patients with coronary artery disease.7 Reactive hypoglycemia was observed in 24% (28 individuals) of the patients. These patients exhibited sig- nificantly elevated insulin levels at 1 hour. Furthermore, a significant increase in the white blood cell count during OGTT was observed in the reactive hypoglycemia group compared with the nonreactive hypo- glycemia group.


Clinical hypoglycemia is identified by the modified Whipple’s criteria, consisting of (1) central nervous system symptoms, including confu- sion, aberrant behavior, or coma; (2) a simultaneous blood glucose level equal to or less than 40 mg/dL; and (3) relief of these symptoms by the administration of glucose.1 The normal fasting blood glucose level is between 65 and 100 mg/dL. A fasting plasma blood glucose measurement greater than 126 mg/dL on two separate occasions is diagnostic of diabetes.8 Although the most specific criterion for the presence of hypoglycemia is a blood glucose level of 40 mg/dL or less, a blood glucose level below 50 mg/dL should arouse clinical suspicion.1

## 1408SECTION 6 Diseases

A more functional test of blood sugar control is the OGTT. It is used in the diagnosis of both reactive hypoglycemia and diabetes, although it is rarely required for the latter. After fasting for at least hours, a baseline blood glucose measurement is collected. The subject then consumes a glucose-containing drink. The amount consumed is based on body weight: 1.75 g/kg. Blood sugar levels are measured at minutes, 1 hour, and then hourly for up to 6 hours. Blood sugar levels greater than 200 mg/dL indicate diabetes. Levels below 50 mg/dL indi- cate reactive hypoglycemia. Table 181.1 further explains in detail how to interpret the results of a GTT.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Glucose–Insulin Tolerance Test

Relying on blood sugar levels alone is often not enough to diagnose hypoglycemia. It is now widely recognized that the signs and symp- toms of hypoglycemia can occur in individuals having blood glucose levels well above 50 mg/dL, and there is a wide overlap between symp- tomatic patients and asymptomatic controls.3 Many of the symptoms linked to hypoglycemia appear to be the result of increases in insulin or epinephrine. It has been recommended that insulin or epinephrine (adrenaline) be measured during a GTT because symptoms often cor- relate better with elevations in these hormones than with glucose lev- els.9,10 Several studies have shown that the glucose–insulin tolerance test (G-ITT) leads to a greater sensitivity in the diagnosis of both hypo- glycemia and diabetes than the standard GTT.10,11 The G-ITT uses a standard 6-hour GTT coupled with measure- ments of insulin levels. The G-ITT appears to be one of the best diag- nostic indicators for faulty sugar metabolism.11 As many as two thirds of subjects with suspected diabetes or hypoglycemia who have normal GTTs will demonstrate abnormal insulin tolerance tests. Table 181.2 lists the various patterns seen with the G-ITT.

## 24-Hour Continuous Glucose Monitoring

Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are electronic diagnostic sys- tems that require the insertion of a sensing catheter under the skin of the patient’s abdomen. The catheter contains a miniaturized electronic device that measures blood sugar and then sends this information every few seconds to a pager-sized computer module worn on the patient’s belt for up to a week. The portable computer module trans- lates and records blood sugar data, which can then be downloaded to a larger computer. A graph showing the average blood sugar reading every 5 minutes (288 blood sugar readings per day) can then be gen- erated and studied in relation to food intake, appetite, food cravings, hypoglycemic symptoms, medication, and exercise. CGMs have been shown to be very useful tools in the diagnosis and monitoring of blood sugar control.12,13 Using a CGM, Michael R. Lyon, MD, has discovered that most people with weight problems and insulin resistance go through their days with remarkably fluctuating blood sugar, or increased glycemic volatility. Rather than the absolute glucose level being the prime determinant of hypoglycemic symptoms, Lyon has found that feel- ings of hypoglycemia occur when the blood sugar drops rapidly, even when it is above the normal range (i.e., between 70 and mg/dL) (Fig. 181.2). In such cases, symptoms of hypoglycemia can range from mild to severe and include such things as food cravings, headache, depression, anxiety, irritability, blurred vision, excessive sweating, and mental confusion. Rather than referring to these patients as suffering from hypoglyce- mia, Lyon and Michael T. Murray, ND, propose that they suffer from a new clinical entity referred to as “elevated glycemic volatility.”14 These authors believe that such volatility is at the heart of most weight prob- lems. Their data indicate that rapidly fluctuating blood sugar levels are generally related to some degree of insulin resistance and made worse by more-than-moderate consumption of foods with a high glycemic effect.

## The Hypoglycemic Index

In borderline cases of hypoglycemia, the hypoglycemic index may aid in the diagnosis. This value is determined by calculating the fall in blood glucose levels during the 90-minute period before reaching the lowest point divided by the value of the lowest point. A hypoglycemic index greater than 0.8 usually indicates reactive hypoglycemia.

## The Hypoglycemia Questionnaire

In many cases, when all is considered, the most useful measure in the diagnosis of hypoglycemia remains an assessment of symptoms. In general, when symptoms appear 3 to 4 hours after eating and disappear

with the ingestion of food, hypoglycemia should be considered. The questionnaire shown in Table 181.3 is an excellent screening method for hypoglycemia.

# GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

In the 1970s, hypoglycemia was a popular “self-diagnosis” for a long list of symptoms; every symptom on the questionnaire in Table 181.3 was linked to hypoglycemia. Although all these symptoms may be due to hypoglycemia, many cases have other etiologies. The tremendous public interest in hypoglycemia and sugar intake was fueled by popular books like Sugar Blues, by William Duffy; Hope for Hypoglycemia, by Broda Barnes; and Sweet and Dangerous, by John Yudkin. The pop- ularity of these books and the diagnosis of hypoglycemia were met with much skepticism from the medical community. Editorials in the Journal of the American Medical Association and the New England Journal of Medicine during the 1970s denounced this public interest in hypoglycemia and tried to invalidate the concept.15,16 Research has provided an ever-increasing amount of information concerning the roles that refined carbohydrates and the faulty con- trol of blood sugar play in many disease processes. Metabolic syn- drome or syndrome X describes a cluster of abnormalities that owe their existence largely to a high intake of refined carbohydrates, lead- ing to the development of hypoglycemia, excessive insulin secretion, and glucose intolerance followed by diminished insulin sensitivity and leading to high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol levels, obe- sity, and ultimately, type 2 diabetes. Metabolic syndrome is discussed in greater detail later. Hypoglycemia, or idiopathic postprandial syndrome, is without question a valid clinical entity. A substantial amount of information indicates that hypoglycemia is caused by an excessive intake of refined carbohydrates.17,18 Although most medical and health organizations, as well as the U.S. government, have recommended that no more than 10% of the total caloric intake be derived from refined sugars added to foods, added sugar accounts for roughly 30% of the total calories con- sumed by most Americans.19 The average American consumes more than 100 lb of sucrose and 40 lb of high-fructose corn syrup each year. This sugar addiction plays a major role in the high prevalence of ill health and chronic disease in the United States.

## Health Effects of Hypoglycemia

<!-- chunk -->

## Hypoglycemia and the Brain

The brain depends on glucose as an energy source. During hypoglyce- mic events, brain dysfunction develops, resulting in dizziness, head- ache, clouding of vision, blunted mental acuity, emotional instability, confusion, and abnormal behavior. The association between hypoglycemia and impaired mental function is well known. However, the role of hypoglycemia in vari- ous psychological disorders is often overlooked. For example, despite numerous studies of depressed individuals showing a high percentage of abnormal glucose or insulin tolerance tests, rarely is hypoglycemia considered, and rarely are depressed individuals offered dietary ther- apy.20,21 There is no explanation for this oversight among so many

physicians, especially because dietary therapy (usually simply elimi- nating refined carbohydrates from the diet) is occasionally all that is necessary for effective therapy in patients who suffer from depression due to reactive hypoglycemia.

<!-- chunk -->

## Aggressive and Criminal Behavior

A strong yet controversial link exists between hypoglycemia and aggressive or criminal behavior. Several controlled studies among psy- chiatric patients and habitually violent and impulsive criminals have shown that reactive hypoglycemia (as determined by an OGTT) is a common finding.22,23 Furthermore, during the GTT, abnormal and sometimes emotionally explosive behavior is often observed. In one study, reactive hypoglycemia was shown to induce fire-setting behav- ior in arsonists.24 Several large studies involving more than 6000 inmates in 10 cor- rectional institutions in three states have evaluated the effect of dietary intervention (i.e., the elimination of refined sugar) on antisocial or aggressive behavior.25,26 In the first study, 174 incarcerated juvenile delinquents were placed on a sugar-restricted diet, and another 102 offenders were placed on a control diet.25 During the 2-year study, the incidence of antisocial behavior was reduced by 45% in the treatment group. The most sig- nificant changes were in the reduction of assaults (83%), theft (77%), “horseplay” (65%), and refusal to obey orders (55%). Antisocial behavior changed most in those charged with assault, robbery, rape, aggravated assault, auto theft, vandalism, child molestation, arson, and possession of a deadly weapon. In the largest study, 3999 incarcerated juveniles were studied over a period of 2 years.26 This study limited the dietary revisions to replacing sugary soft drinks with fruit juices and high-sugar snacks with nonre- fined carbohydrate snacks (e.g., replacing a candy bar with popcorn). When the 1121 young men on the sugar-restricted diet were compared with the 884 on the control diet, there were significant differences: sui- cide attempts were reduced by 100%, the need for restraints to prevent self-injury was reduced by 75%, disruptive behavior was reduced by 42%, and assaults and fights were reduced by 25%. Interestingly, the dietary changes did not seem to affect the behavior of female subjects. This lack of effect seems to indicate that men and women may react to hypoglycemia differently. From an anthropological and evolutionary view, this makes sense. Low blood sugar levels were undoubtedly an internal signal for men to hunt for food. The link between hypoglycemia and aggressive behavior also extends to men without a history of criminal activity. In one study, a GTT was given to a group of men who did not have a history of aggressive behavior or hypoglycemia.18 In these subjects, a significant correlation was found between the tendency to become mildly hypo- glycemic and scores on questionnaires used to measure aggression. The results indicate that aggressiveness often coincides with hypoglycemia.

## Premenstrual Syndrome

The premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a recurrent condition of women characterized by troublesome yet often ill-defined symptoms that usu- ally appear 7 to 14 days before menstruation. The syndrome affects about one third of women between 30 and 40 years of age, about 10% of whom may have a significantly debilitating form. An authority on PMS, Guy Abraham, MD, attempted to clarify the different forms by subdividing PMS into four distinct subgroups (A, C, D, and H).27 Each subgroup is linked to specific symptoms, hormonal patterns, and metabolic abnormalities (see Chapter 212 for further information). PMS-C is associated with increased appetite, craving for sweets, headache, fatigue, fainting spells, and heart palpitations. GTTs on patients with PMS-C during the 5 to 10 days before their menses typ- ically displayed a flattening of the early part of the curve and reactive hypoglycemia, whereas during other parts of the menstrual cycle, the GTT was normal. A flat early portion of the GTT curve usually implies excessive secretion of insulin in response to sugar consumption. This appears to be hormonally regulated, but other factors may also be involved.28 Sodium chloride ingestion enhances the insulin response to sugar ingestion, and decreased magnesium levels in the pancreas can result in the increased secretion of insulin in response to glucose. Regardless of the cause, women with PMS-C appear to be extremely sensitive to hypoglycemia.

## Migraine Headaches

Migraine headaches are probably caused by excessive dilation (expan- sion) of a blood vessel in the head (see Chapter 198). Migraines are a surprisingly common disorder, affecting 15% to 20% of men and 25% to 30% of women at some time in their lives. More than one half of the patients have a family history of the illness. Since 1933, hypoglyce- mia has been shown to be a common precipitating factor in migraine headaches.29 Several studies have found that by eliminating refined sugar from the diets of migraine sufferers with confirmed hypoglycemia, significant improvement may be seen. In one study of 48 migraine sufferers with reactive hypoglycemia, 27 (56%) showed an improvement in symptoms of greater than 75%, 17 (35%) showed an improvement of greater than 50%, and 4 (8%) showed an improvement of greater than 25%.30

## Atherosclerosis, Intermittent Claudication, and Angina

Substantial evidence indicates that reactive hypoglycemia or impaired glucose tolerance is a significant factor in the development of ath- erosclerosis. Although a high sugar intake leads to elevations in tri- glyceride and cholesterol levels, the real culprit may be the elevations of insulin.31 Abnormal GTTs and elevations in insulin secretion are common findings in patients with heart disease.32,33 High sugar con- sumption and reactive hypoglycemia can also be a cause of angina and intermittent claudication.34,35

## Metabolic Syndrome

The term metabolic syndrome is used to describe a set of cardiovas- cular risk factors that includes glucose or insulin disturbances, high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, elevated blood pressure, and android obesity. Other terms to describe this syndrome include syn- drome X, Reaven’s syndrome, insulin resistance syndrome, and athero- thrombogenic syndrome.36,37 The underlying common denominator in the metabolic syndrome is an elevated insulin level, along with insulin resistance. There is lit- tle doubt that an elevated intake of refined carbohydrates contributes to these elevations. An increased intake of simple sugar may first lead to hypoglycemia and potentially to diabetes. There exists considerable scientific evidence that the development of type 2 diabetes is preceded by elevations of serum insulin values and insulin insensitivity due to the prolonged consumption of refined sugars.38 In most cases these defects presented themselves decades before the development of dia- betes. Hypoglycemia, increased insulin secretion, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes can be viewed as a progression of the same illness— maladaptation to the Western diet.


Dietary carbohydrates play a central role in the cause, prevention, and treatment of hypoglycemia. Simple carbohydrates, or sugars, are

## 1411CHAPTER 181 Hypoglycemia

quickly absorbed by the body, resulting in a rapid elevation in blood sugar and stimulating a corresponding excessive elevation in serum insulin levels. It is thought by some that the assortment of natural, sim- ple sugars in fruits and vegetables have an advantage over sucrose and other refined sugars in that they are balanced by a wide range of nutri- ents that aid in the utilization of the sugars. This is true. Perhaps more importantly, sugars found in whole, unprocessed foods are absorbed slower because they are contained within cells and are associated with fiber and other food elements. Problems with carbohydrates begin during the refining process, which increases their rate of absorption and removes essential nutri- ents. Virtually all the vitamin and trace mineral content is removed from white sugar, white breads, pastries, and many breakfast cereals. When high-sugar foods are eaten alone, blood sugar levels rise quickly, producing a strain on blood sugar control. Eating foods high in simple sugars from any source (e.g., sucrose, honey, maple syrup) is harmful to blood sugar control. Large amounts of fruit juice, and even vegetable juice, may be problematic for individuals with hypoglycemia because the cell disruption characteristic of juicing increases the percentage of the sugars in the juices. More than one half of the carbohydrates consumed in the United States are in the form of sugars added to processed foods as sweetening agents.19 Patients should be instructed to read food labels carefully for clues to sugar content, noting that various words are used to describe refined simple carbohydrates. Any of the fol- lowing might appear on the label as sugar: sucrose, glucose, maltose, lactose, fructose, corn syrup, evaporated cane juice, and white grape juice concentrate.

## A Closer Look at Simple Carbohydrates

Glucose is not particularly sweet-tasting compared with fructose and sucrose. It is found in abundant amounts in fruits, honey, sweet corn, and most root vegetables. Glucose is also the primary repeating sugar unit of most complex carbohydrates. Fructose, or fruit sugar, is the primary carbohydrate in many fruits, maple syrup, and honey. Fructose is very sweet, roughly 1.5 times sweeter than sucrose. Although fructose has the same chemical for- mula as glucose, its structure is quite different. To be used by the body, fructose must be converted to glucose within the liver. Many physicians have recommended that individuals with diabetes or hypoglycemia avoid fruits and fructose. However, research chal- lenges this. Fructose does not cause a rapid rise in blood sugar levels. Because fructose must be changed to glucose in the liver to be used by the body, blood glucose levels do not rise as rapidly with fructose consumption as they do with that of other simple sugars. For example, the ingestion of sucrose results in an immediate elevation in the blood sugar level. Although most individuals with diabetes or hypoglycemia cannot tolerate sucrose, most can tolerate moderate amounts of fruits and fructose without loss of blood sugar control. In fact, fructose and fruits are not only better tolerated than white bread and other refined carbohydrates, but they also produce more gradual elevations in blood sugar levels, compared with most sources of complex carbohydrates (starch).39 In addition, fructose at concentrations found in most sin- gle servings of fruit ( ∼ 10 g) has been shown to enhance sensitivity to insulin.40 Regular fruit consumption may help control sugar cravings and promote weight loss in overweight individuals. Although studies have shown aspartame (NutraSweet), glucose, and sucrose to increase the appetite, fructose has been shown in several double-blind studies to decrease the calories and fat consumed. Typically, subjects are given food or drink containing an equivalent caloric amount of fructose or other sweetener 30 minutes to 2.5 hours before consuming as much food as they want at a dinner buffet. Consistently, subjects receiving the fructose-sweetened food or drink consume substantially fewer cal- ories and fat compared with the groups receiving aspartame, sucrose, or glucose.41–43

## The Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load

The glycemic index (GI) and the glycemic load (GL) are two helpful methods of categorizing foods based on the ability of the food to alter blood sugar. The GI was developed in 1981 to express the rise of blood glucose after a particular food is eaten.44 The standard value of 100 is based on the rise seen with the ingestion of glucose. The GI ranges from about 20 for fructose and whole barley to about 98 for a baked potato. The insulin response to carbohydrate-containing foods is similar to the rise in blood sugar. The GI is used as a guideline for dietary recommendations for people with either diabetes or hypoglycemia (see Table 181.4). People with blood sugar problems are advised to avoid foods with high values and choose carbohydrate-containing foods with lower

## 1412SECTION 6 Diseases

values. However, the GI should not be the only dietary guideline. For example, high-fat foods like ice cream and sausage may have a low GI, but because a diet high in fat has been shown to impair glucose tolerance, these foods are not good choices for people with hypogly- cemia or diabetes. The GL uses the information the GI provides in a more comprehen- sive way to assess the effect of carbohydrate consumption.45 Although the GI reveals how quickly a food’s carbohydrate content can raise blood glucose levels, it still does not explain how much of the blood sugar–increasing carbohydrate is in a certain food. The dietary GL is defined as the value of a food’s GI divided by and then multiplied by its available carbohydrate content. A GL of or more is considered high, 11 to 19 is considered intermediate, and or less is considered low. The GI of watermelon, for example, is 72, and a typical serving of 120 g has 6 g of available carbohydrate. Therefore the GL for watermelon is (72/100)×6 =4.32 Even though the GI for watermelon is fairly high, the GL is low, indicating that within reasonable serving amounts, it does not adversely stress blood sugar control. Appendix 6 provides a complete listing of foods and their GI, fiber content, and GL. The GL reinforces the idea that foods containing natural soluble and insoluble fibers, as well as whole foods that are minimally pro- cessed, remain better choices in terms of glycemic influence and insu- lin response.46 Further research indicates that diets with a high GL are directly linked to conditions such as diabetes38; coronary heart disease47; and colon,48 ovarian,45 and pancreatic49 cancers.

## The Importance of Fiber

Population studies and clinical and experimental data show blood sugar disorders to be clearly related to inadequate dietary fiber intake.19,50 These results indicate that although the intake of refined sugars should be curtailed, the intake of complex carbohydrate sources that are rich in fiber should be increased. The term dietary fiber refers to the components of the plant cell wall as well as the indigestible residues from plant foods. Different types of fibers possess different actions. The water-soluble forms exert the most beneficial effects on blood sugar control and include hemicelluloses, mucilages, gums, and pectins. These types of fiber are capable of the following actions: • Slowing down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, thereby preventing rapid rises in blood sugar • Increasing cell sensitivity to insulin, thereby preventing the exces- sive secretion of insulin • Improving uptake of glucose by the liver and other tissues, thereby preventing a sustained elevation of blood sugar (Fig. 181.3) For a full discussion of the importance of fiber, see Chapter 132. The majority of fiber in most plant cell walls is water soluble. Particularly good sources of water-soluble fiber are legumes, oat bran, nuts, seeds, psyllium seed husks, pears, apples, and most vegetables. Patients should be advised to consume a large amount of plant food to obtain adequate levels of dietary fiber. A daily intake of 50 g is a healthful goal.

## PolyGlycoPlex

Based on their work with CGM, Drs. Lyon and Murray have uncov- ered many important findings on how to effectively reduce blood sugar volatility. For example, they confirmed earlier work that although a low-glycemic diet is very important in reducing blood sugar levels, it has little effect in eliminating blood sugar volatility.51 The most effec- tive way to reduce glycemic volatility is a low-glycemic diet along with the use of a novel matrix of soluble fibers known as PolyGlycoPlex (PGX). Several double-blind studies have shown a reduction of post- prandial hypoglycemia by PGX in a dose-dependent manner, inde- pendent of food form.52–54 The PGX matrix produces a higher level of viscosity, gel-forming properties, and expansion with water compared with any other known fiber. This translates to a significant reduction in the glycemic effect of any food or meal. The typical dosage is 1.5 to 5 g before meals.

## Chromium

Chromium is vital to proper blood sugar control because it func- tions in the body as a key constituent of the “glucose tolerance factor.” Without chromium, the action of insulin is blocked, and glucose levels are elevated. A chromium deficiency may be an underlying factor to the tremendous number of Americans who have hypoglycemia, have diabetes, or are obese.55 Evidence exists that marginal chromium deficiency is quite common in the United States and may be responsible for many cases of reactive hypoglycemia.56 In one double-blind crossover study of eight female patients, mcg of chromium (as chromium chloride) given twice daily for months alleviated hypoglycemic symptoms and the glucose nadir at to 4 hours after a glucose load.56 In addition, insulin binding improved, and the number of insulin receptors increased.57,58

## Lifestyle Factors

<!-- chunk -->

## Alcohol

Alcohol consumption severely stresses blood sugar control and is often a contributing factor to hypoglycemia. Alcohol induces reac- tive hypoglycemia by interfering with normal glucose utilization as well as increasing the secretion of insulin. The resultant drop in blood sugar produces a craving for food, particularly foods that quickly elevate blood sugar, as well as a craving for more alcohol. In the presence of more alcohol, the increased sugar consumption aggravates the reactive hypoglycemia, again due to alcohol-induced impairment of normal glucose utilization and increased secretion of insulin. Hypoglycemia is an important complication of acute and chronic alcohol abuse. Hypoglycemia aggravates the mental and emotional problems of the alcoholic and the withdrawing alcoholic with symp- toms such as the following59: • Sweating • Tremor • Rapid heartbeat • Anxiety • Hunger • Dizziness • Headache • Visual disturbance • Decreased mental function • Confusion • Depression Although acute alcohol ingestion induces hypoglycemia, chronic alcohol use leads to hyperglycemia and diabetes. Eventually the body becomes insensitive to the augmented insulin release caused by the alcohol. In addition, alcohol itself can cause insulin resistance even in healthy individuals.60 There is also evidence from large population studies that alcohol intake is strongly correlated with diabetes.19,61 The greater the alcohol intake, the more likely it is that an individual will have or develop diabetes.

## 1413CHAPTER 181 Hypoglycemia


Regular exercise has been well documented to prevent type 2 diabe- tes, and it improves many aspects of glucose metabolism, including enhancing insulin sensitivity and improving glucose tolerance in those who are already diabetic. Some effects of exercise on blood sugar con- trol may stem from the fact that exercise increases tissue chromium concentrations.62

<!-- chunk -->

## Toxin Exposure

A significant amount of research demonstrates the effects of toxins and toxicants on glycemic control. Although most results demonstrate hyperglycemic effects, others have the opposite effect. For example, vanadium potentiates the action of insulin and lowers blood glucose levels by inhibiting some tyrosine-protein phosphatases increasing phosphorylation levels of various insulin pathway intermediaries.63 There have been reports of severe hypoglycemia that may threaten life in vanadium acute intoxication.64 Hypoglycin-A (methylene cyclopropyl-alanine, MCPA), a compound found in ackee fruit, causes hypoglycemic encephalopathy in a dose-dependent manner and has been implicated in ackee-fruit poisoning in Africa and West Indies.65


The primary treatment of hypoglycemia is the use of dietary therapy to stabilize blood sugar levels. Reactive hypoglycemia is not a disease; it is a complex set of symptoms caused by faulty carbohydrate metabolism induced by an inappropriate diet.


All simple, processed, and concentrated carbohydrates, as well as food choices with a high GL, must be avoided. Foods rich in soluble fiber, such as legumes and low-glycemic vegetables, should be consumed reg- ularly. Frequent small meals may be more effective than larger meals further apart in stabilizing blood sugar levels. Alcohol must be avoided because it can cause hypoglycemia. Further dietary recommendations mirror those in Chapter 165.


Many essential nutrients are critical for proper carbohydrate metabo- lism. Taking a multivitamin–multimineral formula providing at least the recommended dietary intake levels appears warranted. Chromium: 200 to 400 mcg/day PGX: 1500 to 5000 mg before meals


Because the beneficial effects of exercise in improving insulin sensitiv- ity decrease within 3 days after exercise and are no longer evident after 1 week, a sustained program is required.66 A graded long-term exercise program should be developed that is appropriate to the individual’s fitness level and interest; it should elevate the heart rate to at least 60% of its maximum for half an hour three times a week.

the increased rate of heart disease due to atherosclerosis in individuals with hypothyroidism.8 In addition, hypothyroidism can cause increases in capillary per- meability and slow lymphatic drainage, resulting in the swelling of tis- sue (edema) as well as fluid retention, commonly noticed in the lower extremities.

<!-- chunk -->

## Endocrine

Various hormonal symptoms can exist in hypothyroidism. The most common are decreased libido in both genders and menstrual abnor- malities in women. Women with mild hypothyroidism may have prolonged, heavy menstrual bleeding with a shorter menstrual cycle. Female infertility may also result. If a woman with untreated hypothy- roidism becomes pregnant, there is an increased risk for miscarriage, premature delivery, and stillbirth. Hypotheses for the occurrence of these conditions include hyperprolactinemia from increased produc- tion of TRH leading to ovulatory dysfunction,9 and hypothyroidism interferes with normal physiological pulsatile gonadotrophin-releasing hormone secretion, which is a prerequisite for normal follicular devel- opment and ovulation.10 Adrenal dysfunction is a common comorbidity with primary and secondary hypothyroidism. Patients with thyroid antibodies are more likely to possess adrenal cortex antibodies associated with Addison’s disease. Furthermore, cortisol secretion may increase to compensate for low T3 levels because cortisol raises the cell membrane’s permea- bility to T3.

## Skin, Hair, and Nails

Most individuals with hypothyroidism have dry, rough skin covered with fine superficial scales along with coarse, dry, and brittle hair. Hair loss can be quite severe and is generally diffuse and uniform as opposed to patchy. The nails become thin and brittle and typically show trans- verse grooves.

## Muscular and Skeletal

Muscle weakness and joint stiffness are predominant features of hypo- thyroidism. Some individuals with hypothyroidism may also experi- ence muscle and joint pain as well as general tissue tenderness. Slow reflexes are common, and a slow Achilles reflex time can be diagnostic.

## Cardiovascular

Overt and subclinical hypothyroidism predispose individuals to ath- erosclerosis as a result of increases in cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as elevated levels of homocysteine and C-reactive protein (CRP).11 Hypothyroidism can also lead to hypertension, reduced cardiac func- tion, and bradycardia.

## Other Manifestations

Shortness of breath, constipation, and impaired kidney function are other common features of hypothyroidism.

## Causes of Hypothyroidism

<!-- chunk -->

## Iodine Deficiency

About 95% of all cases of clinical hypothyroidism are primary. The thyroid gland adds iodine to the amino acid tyrosine to create thyroid hormones. Iodine deficiency leads to hypothyroidism, the develop- ment of an enlarged thyroid gland (i.e., goiter), or both. Goiters are estimated to affect more than 200 million people worldwide, and in more than 95% of cases, the cause is an iodine deficiency. Iodine deficiency is now quite rare in the United States and other industrialized countries due to the addition of iodine to table salt. Few people in the United States are considered iodine-deficient, yet some still develop goiters. Prolonged thyrotropin (TSH) elevation can lead to thyrocyte hypertrophy, which can manifest as a goiter. Goiters generally regress as thyrotropin is suppressed but in rare cases may require surgical resection. Nodules can also form within the gland during or independent of output dysfunction. Approximately 20% of adult patients have nod- ules on palpation, and random screening by ultrasound reveals nod- ules in up to 50% of the population. About 5% of nodules may be cancerous. Goiters or nodules in patients with adequate but marginal iodine intake may result from excessive ingestion of dietary or envi- ronmental goitrogens. See Nutritional Considerations for details on dietary goitrogens. Environmental goitrogens include perchlorate, iodine more than 290 mcg/day, fluoride, and mercury. Medications that induce goiters and suppress thyroid function include amiodarone, carbamazepine, lithium, potassium iodide, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, and rifampin.

## Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder and is the most frequent cause of clinical hypothyroidism in the United States. The antibodies that bind to the thyroid (specifically against the thyroid peroxidase enzyme, thyroglobulin, and TSH receptors) are formed and prevent the manufacturing of sufficient levels of thyroid hormone. In addition to binding to thyroid tissue, these antibodies may also bind to the adrenal glands, pancreas, and acid-producing cells of the stomach (parietal cells). Autoimmune thyroid disease can exist in the absence of serum hypothyroidism, although those with autoim- mune thyroid disease progress to hypothyroidism in almost all cases. The presence of Hashimoto’s disease raises the risk of developing other autoimmune diseases. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is formally a histologi- cal diagnosis. However, the presence of serum antibodies against thy- roid proteins such as thyroglobulin (TG) or thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is often sufficient for diagnosis; 10% to 15% of individuals may be antibody-negative. If a histological assessment is done via biopsy, fine-needle aspira- tion, or postthyroidectomy, the typical finding is cellular infiltration of immune cells, especially lymphocytes. Variables that predict Hashimoto’s thyroiditis include a family history of thyroid disease of any type and exposure to environmental triggers. Environmental toxins generate free radicals, which activate immune responses and may sensitize immune cells to surrounding thyroid proteins. Chemicals documented to correlate with Hashimoto’s disease include the following: • Iodine (in excess or when intake increases significantly) • Perchlorate • Fluoride • Lithium • Mercury • Bisphenol A • Teflon

## Toxins

Many groups of chemicals have thyroid-disrupting potential. These chemicals have various mechanisms of action and, when combined, may have synergistic effects.12 Many aspects of the many compo- nents of thyroid production and effects can be adversely affected, such as decreased TSH production, decreased T4 production, poor or inconsistent conversion of T4 to T3, reduced cellular response to T3, decreased absorption of iodine, and impaired mitochondrial response to T3 limiting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. In addition,

## PCBs, Dioxins, and Furans

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and thyroxine both consist of two connected benzene rings with halogens attached. PCBs have chlorine attached, and thyroxine has iodine. PCBs inhibit the production, acti- vation, and utilization of thyroid hormones. There is a dose-dependent decrease in total T4 among U.S. adults with exposure to dioxin-like toxic equivalents (TEQs) at levels similar to those found in the general U.S. population.14 Several animal studies confirm that exposure to PCBs or dioxin results in reduction of serum thyroid hormone levels, especially T4.15,16 Dioxins and furans adversely affect the thyroid hormone–metab- olizing enzymes uridine-diphosphate-glucuronyl transferase, iodothy- ronine deiodinase, and sulfotransferases found in the liver and brain. Hydroxylated PCBs also inhibit iodothyronine sulfotransferase activity, adversely affecting peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormones. German children showed a significant positive correlation between PCB serum levels and elevation of TSH, as well as a significant inverse correlation between serum PCB levels and FT4.17 U.S. Air Force personnel partici- pating in operation Ranch Hand (the spraying of broadleaf defoliants) during the Vietnam War were found to have high serum tetrachlorod- ibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) levels that were significantly associated with elevated levels of TSH.18 Thus PCBs reduce peripheral thyroid hormone levels, inducing a compensatory increase in TSH. PCBs, dioxins, and furans have demonstrated in vitro activ- ity in binding transthyretin, blocking the transport of thyroxine.19 Hydroxylated PCBs bind to TTR with a stronger binding affinity than their parent compounds. Elevated antithyroid antibodies, both antiperoxidase and antithy- roglobulin, were found in workers in a PCB manufacturing plant.20 However, no difference was found in the levels of T4 and TSH in these TCDD workers than in the control group. Swedish women who consumed at least two meals of fish from the Baltic Sea each month showed a significant inverse correlation between serum PCB levels and TT3 and an insignificant inverse correlation with TT4.21 DDT was found to be higher in a group of hypothyroid Indian women than in euthyroid female controls, whereas Dieldrin was sig- nificantly associated with low T4 levels.22 Canadian newborns had significantly lower T4 concentrations in their cord blood when penta- chlorophenols (PCPs) were also present.23

## Organophosphate Pesticides

Individuals with acute organophosphate pesticide (OP) poisoning have revealed a host of hormonal alterations, including elevations of ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin. Interestingly 31.8% of these individuals also experienced sick euthyroid syndrome with low FT3, FT4, or TSH. OP pesticide formulators had significantly low TT3 and nonsignifi- cantly elevated TSH levels,24 and persons using backpack sprayers with dithiocarbamates (also acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) had increased TSH levels.25

## Mercury

Mercury accumulates in the thyroid and reduces the uptake of iodine by binding to the sodium/iodide transporting molecule. Mercury also inhibits deiodinase function in the peripheral tissues, prevent- ing the production of triiodothyronine (T3) from thyroxine (T4).

## 1417CHAPTER 182 Hypothyroidism

Methylmercury, particularly when combined with a selenium defi- ciency, inhibits D1, the predominant deiodinase in the liver, kidney, and intestines. Both adolescents and adults in the 2007 to 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) had a negative associa- tion between blood mercury levels and total T3 and T4.26 Adolescents also showed a higher risk for both antithyroglobulin and anti-TPO antibodies. Women in the same NHANES cohort with blood mercury of greater than 1.8 ug/L (approximately the 80th percentile) were more likely to have antithyroglobulin antibodies, than those with blood mer- cury of less than 0.4 ug/L.27

## Perchlorate

Newborn TSH levels in cities with 100% perchlorate-contaminated drinking water were significantly higher than those in newborns in cities with noncontaminated water.28 Perchlorate is known to compet- itively inhibit iodide uptake at the sodium iodide symporter and has been used in the past in the diagnosis and treatment of thyrotoxicosis.

## Cadmium

Increasing serum cadmium levels is associated with elevating TSH and lowering FT4 levels. Cadmium has been shown to reduce TSH levels,29 although this effect is completely blunted in animals given zinc and selenium.30 Cadmium accumulates primarily in the kidneys and at lower levels in the lungs, and liver and thyroid hyperplasia and hyper- trophy are often seen with chronic cadmium toxicity.

## Polybrominated Flame Retardants

Brominated flame retardants, such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), pentabromophenol (PBP), and tetrabromobisphe- nol A (TBBPA), have a structural resemblance to thyroxine (T4) and are potent competitors for T4 binding to TTR. PBDEs suppress TH-regulated gene expression in humans and interfere with TH sig- naling.31 Several animal studies indicate that PBDEs decrease the levels of circulating thyroid hormones,32–34 and perinatal maternal exposure reduces thyroid hormones pre- and postnatally.35,36

## Phthalates

Phthalates have various mechanisms of action on thyroid homeostasis, including interfering with the activity of the NIS,37 inhibiting T3 uptake in cells,38 and competitively binding to TTR.39 Significant mild negative correlations were found between TT4 and FT4 and urinary phthalate mon- oesters in pregnant women exposed to di-n-butyl-phthalate (DBP).40 In adult men, an inverse association exists between urinary concentration of mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) and serum levels of FT4 and TT3.41

## Other Causes

Other causes of clinical hypothyroidism include thyroid surgery, abla- tion, and postpartum hypothyroidism, which is a transient form of hypothyroidism, affecting 5% to 10% of women in the United States. Annual follow-up should be offered to any woman who develops post- partum hypothyroidism because 25% of these women will develop overt hypothyroidism within the next 5 years.42

# SUBCLINICAL HYPOTHYROIDISM AND

# HYPOTHYROIDISM SYNDROME

Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as elevated TSH levels with nor- mal serum thyroid levels. Using this criterion, subclinical hypothy- roidism is a relatively common finding in primary care, affecting 2% to 7% of adults. Subclinical hypothyroidism has been shown to be linked to an increased risk for cardiovascular disease.43 Thyroid disease in the absence of overt laboratory findings is more accurately known as hypothyroid syndrome and can be defined by the following clinical findings: • The presence of hypothyroid symptoms • The absence of other explanatory diseases • Possible functional thyroid abnormalities, as found on basal body temperature (BBT) and Achilles reflex testing In addition, one or more of the following objective findings will help confirm the presence of thyroid disease: • Suboptimal blood levels • Abnormal antibody studies • Abnormal findings on ultrasound • Abnormal findings on fine-needle aspiration of the thyroid


Before the use of blood measurements, it was common to diagnose hypothyroidism using basal body temperature (BBT; i.e., the tempera- ture of the body at rest) and Achilles reflex time (reflexes are slowed in hypothyroidism). With the advent of sophisticated laboratory mea- surement of thyroid hormones in the blood, these “functional” tests were no longer used Normal BBT is 97.6°F to 98.2°F. Many consider BBT to be an indicator of thyroid status, yet it is affected by many other variables, including adrenal function, body composition, activity level, menstrual status, and immune function. Therefore it has little speci- ficity for thyroid function. Furthermore, reliance on BBT as a factor superseding blood levels in determining optimal thyroid dosing can expose patients to dangerous supraphysiologic doses of thyroid hor- mones. BBT can, however, be used as a general indicator within the context of a complete clinical evaluation. Instructions for taking BBT are outlined in Appendix 10.

## Clinical Assessment

A clinical score based on the Colorado Thyroid Disease Prevalence Study has been created to simplify the process of symptom evaluation in patients with suspected hypothyroidism. In this study of more than 25,000 people, it was shown that many patients with significant symp- toms did not have clinical hypothyroidism. The symptoms listed in Table 182.1 serve as the best predictors of hypothyroidism.

<!-- chunk -->

## Laboratory Evaluation

When clinically indicated, thyroid screening ideally includes a marker of thyroid regulation (e.g., TSH), markers of thyroid output (e.g., free T4, free T3), and markers of thyroid inflammation (e.g., thyroid microsomal antibody, thyroid peroxidase antibody, antithyroglobu- lin antibody). The American Thyroid Association recommends TSH screening every 5 years beginning at age 35. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism by laboratory methods is primar- ily based on the results of total T4, free T4, free T3, and TSH levels (Table 182.2). TSH is a more sensitive test for both hyper- and hypo- thyroidism than free T4. The diagnosis is straightforward in overt cases (Table 182.3). In subclinical cases, the diagnosis is clear, but the benefit of treatment in the absence of symptoms is debated. An elevation in TSH with a normal T4 level is considered subclinical. The accepted normal TSH range is extremely broad, 0.35 to 5.50 mIU/mL. Some physicians do not recommend treatment unless the TSH is greater than 10 mIU/mL. Given the importance of adequate thyroid hormone to human health, the recommendation presented here is more aggressive. Patients with a combination of subclinical hypothyroidism and objective signs of autoimmune thyroiditis can benefit from TSH reduction. This can be achieved through diet and lifestyle changes and possible thyroid replacement therapy.

## 1418SECTION 6 Diseases


Fig. 182.2 provides an algorithm for managing patients with hypothy- roidism; it combines clinical evaluation, BBT, and laboratory evalua- tion. Although the conventional diagnostic model may be restrictive, relying solely on symptoms or BBT to determine the need for thyroid treatment often leads to several attempts at proper dosing, side effects, and limited to no benefits. Furthermore, if such measures are used as the sole factors for determining dosing strategies, many will end up on dangerous supraphysiologic doses. Adult patients who have reached full physiological doses of thyroid and have TSH scores lower than 1.0 should be considered to have maximal improvement from thyroid treatment. Because supraphysiologic doses speed the rate of T4 degra- dation, further increases in dosage will not yield lasting benefit. Higher doses should also be discouraged because a chronically suppressed TSH raises the risk of dementia, atrial fibrillation, and osteoporosis. Patients with “hypothyroid syndrome” may have a positive clin- ical response to thyroid treatment when they possess the following characteristics: • Objective signs of early Hashimoto’s disease. This would include positive serum antibodies or abnormalities on thyroid anatomy evidenced by examination or ultrasound. • Pertinent hypothyroid symptoms. These include the highly sensi- tive symptoms gleaned from the Colorado study delineated earlier. • Suboptimal thyroid blood levels. TSH scores greater than 2.5 increase the likelihood of Hashimoto’s disease and hypothyroid symptoms. Patients with less sensitive hypothyroid symptoms, such as over- weight, depression, or poor libido, yet lacking the previously listed three criteria, may respond poorly to thyroid treatment even if they possess low BBTs or delayed Achilles tendon reflexes.

## Diet/Iodine Status

Although the key role of iodine deficiency in hypothyroidism has been known for over a century, there are clearly problems with even modestly excessive levels. There is a correlation between iodine intake and autoimmune thyroid disease. In one Furans study, a group of 45 adults with hypothyroidism secondary to Hashimoto’s thyroiditis were divided into two groups. One group was placed on a low-iodine diet of under 100 micrograms per day of iodine, whereas the other group did not modify their diets. Of those on the low-iodine diet, 78.3% returned to euthyroid status with no other treatment, as opposed to 45% in the control group.44 The average TSH score changed from 14.28 IU/mL to 3.28 IU/mL in those who recovered.

## Physiological/Hormonal Considerations

Thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) is a protein generated by the liver that transports thyroid hormones, including 75% of circulating T4. Certain factors may lead to increased TBG levels, including pregnancy, oral estrogen supplementation from birth control pills, and hormone replacement therapy. Tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer and liver diseases also increase TBG levels. High TBG levels can hinder the avail- ability of free thyroid hormone for use in the peripheral tissues, thus contributing to hypothyroid symptoms. Depending on the clinical picture, it may be useful to moderate hormonal excesses by decreas- ing the intake of oral estrogens, changing to nonoral regimens that do not involve first-pass metabolism through the liver, or helping the liver efficiently metabolize estrogens.

## 1419CHAPTER 182 Hypothyroidism

The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for iodine in adults is 150 mcg. The average intake of iodine in the United States is esti- mated to be more than 600 mcg/day. However, intake has decreased substantially in the past several decades due to decreased use of iodized table salt (more people now eat prepared foods, which typically use salt that has no added iodine), dairies using antibiotics instead of iodine for cleaning udders, and bakers switching from iodine-based to bro- mine-based leavening agents. Too much iodine can inhibit thyroid gland synthesis. Because the only role of iodine in the body is to pro- vide for thyroid hormone synthesis, it is recommended that dietary levels or supplementary iodine not exceed 600 mcg/day for any length of time. Individuals with an iodine intake under 300 mcg daily have the lowest rates of development of thyroid disease or thyroid disease progression.45

## Vitamins and Minerals

Zinc, vitamin E, and vitamin A function together in the manufacturing of thyroid hormone. A deficiency of any of these nutrients results in lower levels of active thyroid hormone production. Low zinc levels, as well as hypothyroidism, are common in the elderly, indicating a pos- sible correlation.46 Riboflavin (B 2 ), niacin (B 3 ), pyridoxine (B 6 ), and vitamin C are also necessary for thyroid hormone manufacture. The trace minerals zinc, copper, and selenium are required cofac- tors for iodothyronine deiodinase, the enzyme that converts T4 to the more active T3. This enzyme has several different forms, each requiring a different trace mineral. Supplementation with zinc has been shown to reestablish normal thyroid function in patients with hypothyroidism who were zinc-deficient even though they had nor- mal serum T4 levels.

## 1420SECTION 6 Diseases

Individuals living in areas where selenium is deficient have a greater incidence of thyroid disease. Although a selenium deficiency does not decrease the conversion of T4 to T3 in the thyroid or the pituitary, it does result in a decrease in this conversion in other cells of the body.47 People with a selenium deficiency have elevated levels of T4 and TSH, and supplementation with selenium results in a decrease in T4 and TSH and a normalization of thyroid activity.48 Moreover, selenium is known to decrease thyroid antibody levels in autoimmune thyroid conditions.49 Antioxidant supplementation has been shown to increase thyroid func- tion in rats with methimazole-induced hypothyroidism. Statistically sig- nificant results were reported in rats given vitamin C, vitamin E, and Curcuma longa (turmeric) extract with decreased abnormal thyroid weight changes, less suppression of T4 and T3, and attenuated increases in cholesterol levels.50 Furthermore, in one animal study, thyroid hor- mone abnormalities also correlated with decreased glutathione antiox- idant status in testicular tissues.51 Although there are no human studies to corroborate these findings, given the safety and beneficial profile of these supplements, it seems a reasonable approach to consider them in an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant treatment regimen.


Exercise stimulates thyroid gland secretion and increases tissue sensi- tivity to thyroid hormone. Many of the health benefits of exercise may be a result of improved thyroid function. A consistent effect of dieting is a decrease in the metabolic rate as the body strives to conserve fuel. Exercise has been shown to prevent the decline in metabolic rate in response to dieting.

## Thyroid Hormone Replacement

If nutritional and lifestyle interventions are inadequate to reestablish normal thyroid activity, the prescription of thyroid hormones is nec- essary. Several thyroid hormone preparations are available, each with advantages and disadvantages. Conventional treatment involves the administration of oral tetraiodothyronine/levothyroxine sodium (T4). Levothyroxine preparations are bioidentical to human tetraiodothy- ronine and readily absorbed orally. The half-life of tetraiodothyronine is roughly 7 to 10 days. Therefore once-daily dosing is adequate for steady blood levels. For maximum and consistent absorption, it is best to take thyroid hormones at least 1 hour before food and beverages other than water. Morning administration is preferred to mimic the circadian thyroid cycle. Dosages are titrated to reduce TSH and to elevate T4 to normal ranges. The most common starting dose is 50 mcg (0.05 mg), and the most common ending doses range from 88 to 137 mcg for women and 100 to 150 mcg for men. Some patients who remain clinically hypothyroid may poorly deiodinate levothyroxine (T4) into triiodothyronine (T3). In these cases, oral T3 is given. Like T4, T3 (Cytomel or liothyronine) is well absorbed orally and is easily bound by many nutrients. The half-life of T3 is approximately 2½ days, so once-daily dosing is recommended. Common doses are 5 to 10 mcg daily. Many naturopathic physicians prefer the use of natural desiccated thyroid (NDT). NDT contains all thyroid hormones, not just thyroxine. Studies in rats whose thyroids were removed demonstrated that normal tissue levels of T4 and T3 were achieved only with an infusion of T4 and T3, and not by T4 alone.52 The advantage of NDT is that it provides T4, T3, T2, and relevant amino acids and micronutrients (including 0.2% iodine per table). The main drawback often cited by those who prefer thyroxine is that NDT lacks consistency. However, according to the U.S. Pharmacopoeia (USP), these preparations must contain not less than 85% and not more than 115% of the labeled amount of T4 and not less than 90% and not more than 110% of T3. The labeled amount is 38 mcg of T4 and 9 mg T3 per grain (65 mcg). The equivalencies of the thyroid agents based on clinical response are as follows: • 100 mcg of T4 (e.g., Synthroid) • 20 to 25 mcg of T3 (e.g., Cytomel) • 1 grain of desiccated thyroid • 12.5 mcg of T3 + 50 mcg of T4 (e.g., Thyrolar)


Natural treatment strategies for normalizing thyroid function vary depending on the diagnosis of an autoimmune hypothyroid condition, Wilson’s syndrome, or subclinical or clinical hypothyroidism.

## Thyroid Replacement

The use of thyroid replacement achieves two objectives in the patient with autoimmune hypothyroidism: the normalization of decreased thyroid hormone levels and the suppression of thyroid activity, thus decreasing autoimmune processes. Either desiccated or synthetic thyroid replace- ment may be used in sufficient doses to decrease TSH to 0.1 or 1.5, the lev- els found in healthy euthyroid populations. It should be noted that some reports say that TSH values equal to or less than 0.1 mIU/mL may carry a risk of numerous hyperthyroid side effects as well as atrial fibrillation. Desiccated thyroid may be beneficial in stimulating blocking antibodies to antithyroid antibodies and by acting as decoys for thyroid antibodies. Some patients recover from Hashimoto’s thyroiditis after an extended treatment time with thyroid hormone and no longer need maintenance replacement. Some patients may not benefit from desiccated thyroid, lead- ing to an adverse reaction to antigenic thyroid substances. These patients should promptly be placed on a combination of synthetic T4 and T3 thy- roid instead. In either case, frequent TSH and antibody tests are essential to verify the suppression of thyroid activity and monitor autoimmune activity. Often in early Hashimoto’s disease, a hyperthyroid picture is more prevalent. In this case thyroid replacement may be contraindicated.

<!-- chunk -->

## Diet/Lifestyle

Food elimination, detoxification, and gut-healing options may be use- ful treatments aimed at ameliorating a possible root factor of antigenic autoimmune activity (see Chapter 14).

<!-- chunk -->

## Other Recommendations

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a beneficial supplement in the treatment of several autoimmune conditions.53 Although many clin- ical studies have employed high dosages (100–200 mg/day), much lower physiological doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg/day in women and 10 to 20 mg/day in men may be beneficial and safe. Laboratory work should be done to confirm physiological ranges with DHEA supple- mentation. DHEA should be used with caution, particularly in patients at risk for developing hormone-dependent cancers.54 Two hundred mg/day of selenium is recommended for Hashimoto’s autoimmune thyroiditis, especially in patients who have high titers of antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies.

## Hypothyroid Disorder


The diet should be sufficient in vitamins and trace minerals needed for thyroid hormone production and activation, including selenium, zinc, B vitamins, and vitamin D. Sources of zinc include seafood (especially oysters), beef, oatmeal, chicken, liver, spinach, nuts, and seeds. Copper

is found in liver and other organ meats, eggs, yeast, beans, nuts, and seeds. Sources of B vitamins include yeast, whole grains, and liver. A great source of selenium is unshelled Brazil nuts. Organically grown foods are recommended because of their higher levels of trace minerals and reduced levels of toxins.


• Zinc: 20 to 30 mg/day • Copper: 1 to 2.5 mg/day • Selenium: 200 to 400 mcg/day • Vitamin C: 1 to 3 g/day in divided doses • Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols): 200 to 400 IU/day

<!-- chunk -->

## Thyroid Hormones

Thyroid hormone replacement options include the following: • Desiccated natural thyroid: ¼ grain initially; can be adjusted incre- mentally up or down as needed • T4 (Levothyroxine): 25 to 200 mcg • T4 and T3 Use 10:1 T4/T3 Ratio for isolated T4 and T3 medications such as Synthroid and Cytomel. Compounded thyroid medication is not recommended due to vari- abilities in production. Brand consistency is recommended for thyroid medication. Do not prescribe generic medications. Both of these practices can lead to fluc- tuating thyroid levels due to variables in inactive ingredients from one product to the next. Reevaluation of TSH T4, T3, free T3, and free T4 levels 4 to 6 weeks after initiating therapy is recommended. The goal of treatment is to normalize serum hormone levels and improve patient symptoms. After stabilization of dosage, periodic evaluations are based on the individ- ual patient’s needs. Follow-up is recommended at least once a year. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy is to be taken on an empty stomach to increase absorption. The patient should avoid taking thyroid hormones at the same time as other medications and supplements (espe- cially those containing iron), which may affect absorption. Once-a-day dosage generally produces stable increases in thyroid hormone levels. Thyroid hormone dosage during pregnancy will likely have to be adjusted because estrogens increase serum thyroid hormone–binding globulin, thereby reducing the level of free thyroxine. Careful moni- toring is required during pregnancy. Dose requirements may increase by 30% to 50% during pregnancy and return to prepregnancy levels shortly after delivery.

to 5.6% of samples in most studies. In severe cases, however, bacte- rial etiology is more common: in a study of 173 community-dwelling healthy adults with severe diarrhea, a bacterial etiology was discovered in 87% of cases.8

<!-- chunk -->

## Viral Agents

Viruses are important causes of diarrhea. In healthy adults, the clin- ical manifestation of viral diarrhea is generally an acute, self-limited gastroenteritis. Although at least 25 different bacteria and protozoa can cause an identical clinical syndrome, greater than 75% of diar- rhea-associated cases of gastroenteritis are caused by viruses. Viruses are suspected when vomiting is prominent, the incubation period is longer than 14 hours, and the entire illness is over in less than 4 days. Viral pathogens are likely when there are no warning signs of bacte- rial infection (e.g., high fever, bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, more than 6 stools in 24 hours) and there are no epidemiological clues from the history (i.e., travel, sexual contact, antibiotic use) suggesting an alternative diagnosis.9

## Rotavirus

Rotavirus is one of the most ubiquitous agents of diarrhea. It can con- tribute to an acute, dehydrating diarrhea in children and is estimated to cause more than 800,000 annual deaths of young children in devel- oping countries.10 Rotavirus-associated diarrheal disease is seasonal; in the United States it begins in the autumn in the Southwest and ends in the spring in the Northeast. Rotaviruses are spread via a fecal–oral route that includes person-to-person transmission. Although the pre- cise mechanisms of disease have yet to be fully elucidated, rotaviruses are known to infect the villous enterocytes of the small intestine and cause a watery diarrhea. In addition to diarrhea, patients often have fever and vomiting.11

## Parvovirus (Norwalk Virus)

Often categorized within the family of the Norwalk virus are the calici- viruses, also referred to as Norwalk-like viruses or small, round-struc- tured viruses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 66% of 13.8 million cases of food-related illnesses are caused by these viruses each year in the United States. This family of viruses is often suspected when acute gastroenteritis sweeps through a semiclosed community (e.g., family, school, residential home, hospi- tal, ship, dormitory).9 These viruses are transmitted through contam- inated food and water or from person to person. Sources of outbreaks have included well water, raspberries, lunch meat, and, in several instances, oysters.11 Individuals infected by caliciviruses experience nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and headache; low- grade fever, malaise, and myalgias also occur.11

## Cytomegalovirus

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is present in a latent state in most people, having been acquired either at birth or through sexual or parenteral exposure. CMV comes out of latency when there is strong allergenic or antigenic stimulation of the immune system. Often those with severe immunodeficiency also have activation and replication of CMV. When CMV becomes active in the bowel wall, gastrointestinal disease may occur. The disease is seen primarily in patients with severe immune deficiency such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), transplantation, and cancer chemotherapy9 and is a major cause of diarrhea in these conditions.

## Epstein–Barr Virus

By the age of 20 years, almost all adults are infected with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). This virus infects B cells and then persists for life because these cells proliferate indefinitely. Proliferation is usually controlled by virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. EBV causes diarrhea mainly in immunocompromised patients.

## Bacterial Agents

<!-- chunk -->

## Escherichia coli

At least four distinct varieties of diarrheogenic Escherichia coli exist: enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enterohemorrhagic (EHEC), enteroinva- sive (EIEC), and enteroadherent. In North America, the most prom- inent diarrheogenic E. coli is the EHEC serotype, E. coli O157:H7.11 Contaminated ground beef is the most common vehicle of transmis- sion because contaminating bacteria are distributed throughout the meat during grinding and are not killed if hamburgers are under- cooked. After an incubation period from 1 to 8 days, typical symptoms include abdominal cramping and diarrhea that can present as mild, moderate, or severe. Early in the disease course, bowel movements may be loose and watery; in time, however, they may contain gross blood. A subset of patients, often children, may develop the severe, life-threat- ening hemolytic-uremic syndrome, characterized by the clinical triad of hemolytic anemia, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia.11

<!-- chunk -->

## Campylobacter jejuni

Campylobacter is part of the intestinal flora in many mammals. Contaminated and improperly cooked meat contributes significantly to the spread of disease. Unpasteurized dairy products, contaminated water, and other foods also may encourage transmission. Symptoms begin 1 to 7 days after ingestion of the bacteria and consist of fever, headache, and malaise. These may herald the onset of diarrhea and abdominal cramps by 1 to 2 days. The nature of the diarrhea varies from watery to bloody. Campylobacter enterocolitis is usually acute and self-limited over 7 to 10 days. Rarely, relapses, complications, severe disease, and death may occur.11

## Clostridium difficile

C. difficile infection has become the most common cause of infec- tious diarrhea in hospitalized patients12 and is most likely to affect the elderly. Clostridium can be catalyzed by the use of antibiotics.

<!-- chunk -->

## Salmonella

The spread of resistant Salmonella strains continues to increase world- wide,13 and there are more than 2200 currently known serotypes. Spread chiefly through contaminated food, Salmonella enteritidis accounts for 85% of all salmonella infections in the United States. Other prominent salmonella infections include Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi, which are responsible for typhoid fever. Nontyphoidal salmonellosis may present as fever, gastroenteritis-re- lated diarrhea, and localized infections of the gastrointestinal tract, endothelial surfaces, pericardium, meninges, lungs, joints, bones, uri- nary tract, or soft tissues. Typhoidal symptoms include a gradual onset of fever, headache, arthralgias, pharyngitis, constipation, anorexia, and abdominal discomfort.

<!-- chunk -->

## Shigella

Among the bacterial enteric pathogens, Shigella is unique in that ingestion of fewer than 200 organisms and possibly as few as 10 organ- isms may cause clinically apparent disease. Shigella, like other enteric pathogens, may be transmitted through contaminated food and water. However, person-to-person spread and transmission by flies may also occur because so few organisms are necessary to cause disease.11 The incubation period is usually 1 to 4 days. Adults present with nonbloody diarrhea with or without fever and possible gripping abdominal pain, urgency, and relief with defecation. As the infection progresses,

episodes may increase, with the presence of mucus and blood in the stool. Infections often resolve spontaneously in 4 to 8 days for mild cases or 3 to 6 weeks in severe cases.

<!-- chunk -->

## Yersinia enterocolitica

Yersinia enterocolitica, like Salmonella and Shigella, is a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family. Yersinia species are significantly less frequent causes of bacterial enterocolitis in North America than else- where. Pathogenic strains of Y. enterocolitica are usually transmitted through fecally contaminated food or water but infrequently are trans- mitted by contaminated blood products. A 4- to 7-day incubation period occurs, followed by watery to bloody diarrhea. This organism is invasive and demonstrates a propensity for lymphoid tissues, caus- ing mesenteric lymphadenitis that may be clinically mistaken for acute appendicitis.11 Disease usually resolves within 1 to 4 weeks, but occa- sionally complicating septicemia may develop, usually in patients with underlying disease.

## Laribacter hong-kongensis14

Described and characterized in 2001, Laribacter hong-kongensis is a novel genus and species originally isolated from the blood and empy- ema pus cultures of a cirrhotic patient with bacteremic empyema tho- racis. Since then, it has been described in six patients with diarrhea in Hong Kong and Switzerland. Although more extensive epidemiologi- cal studies are necessary, there is reason to consider its role in future studies of diarrheal outbreaks worldwide.

## Parasitic Agents

Diarrheal diseases caused by parasites still constitute the greatest single worldwide cause of illness and death. The problem is more severe in underdeveloped countries with poor sanitation, but even in the United States, diarrheal diseases are a major cause of sickness and death. Furthermore, the ease and frequency of worldwide travel and increased migration to the United States are resulting in growing numbers of parasitic infections. In addition to normal inhabitants of the gastroin- testinal system acting as parasites, there are also significant diarrheal diseases associated with protozoa and helminths. Giardia lamblia is the most frequent cause of parasitic enteritis in the United States and should be suspected in cases where history suggests recent hiking and drinking out of streams. Waterborne infec- tion is also important in the developed world, particularly as a result of contamination of domestic water supplies with the cysts of Giardia intestinalis and Cryptosporidium parvum.6 Other diarrhea-associated parasites include Entamoeba histolytica, Microsporidium, Isospora belli, and Strongyloides species. Although the most commonly reported symptoms of parasitic infec- tion are abdominal pain and cramping with concomitant explosive diarrhea, these symptoms do not occur in all cases. In fact, a growing number of individuals are experiencing milder-than-usual gastrointes- tinal symptoms due to parasitic infections or symptoms not tradition- ally considered to be linked to parasitic infections. For example, in some cases of irritable bowel syndrome, indigestion, and poor digestion, par- asites may be causing the symptoms. In addition, parasitic infections are often an unsuspected cause of chronic illness and fatigue.


Patients presenting with bloody diarrhea, persistent fever, severe and unremitting abdominal pain, and/or symptoms of severe dehydration warrant in-office evaluation. Immune-compromised/immune-sup- pressed patients, those with the potential for cardiovascular com- promise, or those with a history of inflammatory bowel disease may warrant hospitalization. The initial assessment should include careful history (including travel history and other sources of recent expo- sure from food or occupational hazard) and physical examination to assess for volume depletion. Diarrhea of small bowel origin is more typically of large volume, watery, and associated with abdominal bloat- ing, cramping, and gas.15 Fever and bloody stool are rare. In contrast, diarrhea of large bowel origin is typically lower volume and more fre- quent but is more likely to present with painful bowel movements, fever, and blood/mucus. Visibly bloody stool is most often caused by E. coli O157:H7, Shigella, Salmonella, or Campylobacter.16 The timing of recent food intake may provide some nonspecific clues to etiology; early symptoms (<6 hours postingestion) suggest the presence of pre- formed toxin (likely from Staphylococcus aureus or Bacillus cereus). An onset of greater than 16 hours suggests viral or bacterial infection. An onset between 8 and 16 hours may indicate Clostridium perfrin- gens infection. Recent antibiotic use or hospitalization greater than hours should be considered (particularly if within the prior 3 months), especially to rule out a high likelihood of C. difficile. The physical examination to assess for signs of dehydration or more serious illness should include an assessment of skin turgor, dry- ness of mucous membranes, hypotension, and altered mental state. An abdominal examination may show signs of generalized tenderness and pain with percussion, as well as general distension.

## Laboratory Diagnosis

Numerous laboratory procedures exist for the assessment of patients with diarrhea. Stool diagnostic studies may be used if available in cases of dysentery, moderate to severe disease, and symptoms lasting more than 7 days. Other potentially concerning components of the his- tory that may warrant stool testing include more than 6 loose stools within 24 hours, severe abdominal pain, or signs of frank blood in the stool. When visible blood was present in the stool, more than one third of cases were caused by Shiga toxin–producing E. coli (STEC) O157:H7 (making this the most common STEC in the United States).4 Consideration in bloody diarrhea should also be made for the presence of amebiasis, especially in recent travelers. Bacterial cultures using selective media, detection of pathogen-spe- cific genes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), electron micro- scopic examination and antigen detection for viruses, and direct examination with or without the use of special stains for protozoa are some of the plethora of diagnostic tests available. Despite this wide array, a microbiological cause is identified in only 50% of patients at best.14 One hospital survey of more than 30,000 stool specimens sent for testing revealed a specific pathogen in only 5.6% of cases. In descending order, the most commonly identified pathogens were Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella, Shigella, and E. coli O157:H7.4 Confounding this issue, it has been shown that substantial varia- tion exists in the use of stool testing, which typically does not correlate with the clinical characteristics of affected patients.4,17 One study has identified several important independent variables that may be predic- tive of positive stool culture in adult patients with a clinical picture of infectious diarrhea. These variables are month of presentation, fever, duration of abdominal pain at presentation, and requirement of intra- venous fluid therapy. Surprisingly, this study demonstrated that nei- ther a history of bloody diarrhea nor persistent diarrhea was associated with positive stool culture.17 Testing for ova and parasites is of low yield in most cases and should be run only when diarrheal illness persists for more than 7 days.4 In the case of persistent diarrhea, parasites most likely to be discovered include Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and E. histolytica, and assessment should include ova and parasite inspection of three specimens sepa- rated by at least 24 hours.

## Conventional Medicines

Although appropriate in certain cases, the antibiotics and opiates used to treat diarrhea are also well known to have their limitations because many of these drugs adversely affect gastrointestinal motility; fur- thermore, increasing numbers of pathogens are proving resistant to antimicrobial agents. Increasing numbers of isolates resistant to anti- microbial agents and the risk of worsened illness (e.g., hemolytic ure- mic syndrome with STEC O157:H7) further complicate antimicrobial and antimotility drug use.4 Additionally, available antiperistaltic or antisecretory drugs to reduce the severity of diarrhea can cause serious side effects in children.10 Generally, selective antibiotic treatment is recommended for trav- eler’s diarrhea, Shigella, and Campylobacteria infection. Bismuth salts (e.g., Pepto-Bismol) can be used for travel abroad to coat the intestinal lining and help prevent infection. The role of antibiotic therapy in sal- monellosis and E. coli O157:H7 infection remains unclear, although in general, enterohemorrhagic E. coli should not be treated with empiric antibiotics. Avoidance of antimotility agents in bloody diarrhea is emphasized, especially when illness is caused by E. coli O157:H7, which could increase the risk of subsequent hemolytic-uremic syndrome. In select at-risk populations, wider use of vaccines, including the oral typhoid vaccine and the oral cholera vaccine (available only outside the United States), is recommended.4 Some newer therapeutic approaches include 5-HT 2 and 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists, calcium-calmodulin antagonists, and alpha-re- ceptor agonists. These may be useful to avoid adverse effects on gastric motilility.6

## Underlying and Predisposing Factors

Although a pathogenic agent is often responsible for infectious diar- rhea, a number of host factors can predispose individuals to experi- ence illness. Poor digestive function, which is often characterized by low stomach acid output or achlorhydria and inadequate pancreatic enzyme output, should be explored in patients who are susceptible to infectious diarrhea. In these cases, hydrochloric acid and pancreatic enzyme supplementation may be advisable. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies help discourage epithelial adherence of pathogenic organ- isms. Depressed levels of secretory IgA can leave the immune system of the gastrointestinal tract feeble and unable to deal with patho- genic infection. Decreased intestinal motility, which can be caused by chronic stress and high sugar intake, can also allow microbes to flour- ish in an intestinal environment. Recurrent infectious diarrhea may be encouraged by food allergy and sensitivities as well. The clinician should also be aware that many drugs may actually increase susceptibility to infectious diarrheal illness. These include pro- ton-pump inhibitors, antifolate drugs, and antibiotics. Hospitalized patients who receive proton-pump inhibitors are at increased risk of C. difficile–induced diarrhea.18–20 As in the case of achlorhydria, it is likely that inhibition of upper gastrointestinal digestive acids by pro- ton-pump inhibitors may allow pathogens and undigested food to reach the intestines without being properly broken down. Also, antibi- otic-associated diarrhea is known to occur with broad-spectrum anti- biotics.21 Antibiotics can disrupt local bowel flora, allowing pathogenic organisms to flourish, and are well-known to leave patients susceptible to diarrhea (see “Probiotics” later in the chapter).

<!-- chunk -->

## Hydration/Electrolyte Balance

It is of paramount importance to keep the patient with diarrhea well hydrated and to ensure electrolyte balance. This is most crucial in chil- dren. Of course, rehydration does not treat the diarrhea itself, which will persist until the infection resolves. Signs of dehydration may include decreased or absent urination, decreased skin turgor, and dry tongue. Rehydration using solutions of glucose, sodium, and potas- sium is appropriate. In cases of severe dehydration with weight loss of more than 10% or unconsciousness, intravenous rehydration is indi- cated.22 Otherwise, oral rehydration solutions can be quite effective, given that glucose absorption via sodium–glucose cotransport remains intact during episodes of diarrhea.


Prevention of infectious diarrhea may be accomplished by avoiding undercooked meat or seafood, unpasteurized milk, or soft cheese.4 Once the patient has symptoms, the use of the traditional “BRAT diet” can usually help decrease gastric motility. The components of this diet are foods that can slow peristalsis and tend to be more binding. These are bananas, white rice, apples, plain white toast or bread, and tea. High-fat meals and dairy-based foods (due to secondary lactose malabsorption, which may last for several weeks to months after an infectious diarrheal event) should be avoided. Evidence indicates that larger, less frequent meals are more taxing to the digestive and absorptive capacities of the gastrointestinal sys- tem. In one porcine study, 3-week-old piglets were assigned to one of four dietary regimens and were subsequently all infected with rotavi- rus, followed 24 hours later with enteropathogenic E. coli. The dietary regimen designed to tax the digestive and absorptive capacities of the piglets (a high nutrient intake with a three-times-a-day feeding) sig- nificantly produced the most prolonged diarrhea as well as the most advanced colonization of the gut by hemolytic enteropathogenic E. coli and persistent shedding of rotavirus. The same nutrient intake divided into 24 equal increments and administered hourly produced a less severe response. The least severe diarrhea was seen in piglets fed one- third the nutrient intake either hourly or three times a day.23 Traditional dietary preparations for diarrhea such as carrot soup and products based on rice can be useful because of their high absor- bance capacity. They have been known to reduce stool output and the duration of diarrhea, although they may not necessarily diminish the intestinal loss of water and electrolytes.22,24 One study evaluated the effects of green banana and pectin on intes- tinal permeability in 57 boys with persistent diarrhea. Green banana and pectin contain nondigestible dietary sources of colonic short-chain fatty acids. The patients were given a week’s treatment with a rice-based diet containing either cooked green banana, pectin, or a rice diet alone. Intestinal permeability was assessed before and after treatment by giv- ing a lactulose-mannitol (LM) drink and measuring urinary recovery after 5 hours. Treatment with banana significantly reduced lactulose recovery, increased mannitol recovery, and decreased the LM ratio, indicating an improvement of permeability. Pectin produced similar results. Permeability changes were associated with a 50% reduction in stool weights, which correlated strongly with the LM ratio.25 In a study of 154 male infants aged between 1 and 30 months, commonly allergenic soy- and casein-based diets were not helpful in alleviating persistent diarrhea, whereas yogurt and broken-down amino acid formulas were helpful in encouraging a significant reduction in stool output and in the duration of diarrhea.26 Other studies also suggest, as an adjunctive measure for patients who experience vomiting, the administration of a small amount of glucose.22


The administration of vitamin A to children can reduce the incidence of severe diarrhea. One double-blind controlled trial examined children from ages 1 to 5 with acute diarrhea. These young subjects

## 1426SECTION 6 Diseases

were assigned to receive either 60 mg of vitamin A or a placebo. They were followed up at home on alternate days until they recov- ered from the diarrheal episode. In all study children, those treated with vitamin A had a significantly lower risk of persistent diarrhea. However, there was no change in the duration or average stool fre- quency. Interestingly, the group who was not breastfed had a shorter average duration of diarrhea. In these children, the mean number of stools passed after the intervention, the proportion of episodes last- ing greater than 14 days, and the percentage of children who passed watery stools on any study day were also significantly lower in those treated with vitamin A.27

## Folic Acid and Vitamin B


Studies are beginning to emerge correlating low levels of folic acid and vitamin B 12 with increased susceptibility to diarrhea. Folic acid defi- ciency is known to promote malabsorption due to the altered struc- ture of the intestinal mucosal cells.28 Thirteen patients diagnosed with megaloblastic anemia suffering from chronic diarrhea showed signifi- cant histological changes of the ileal mucosa, including inflammation, atrophy, erosion and flattening of the villi, lymphatic ectasia, and focal fibrosis. When given folate and cyanocobalamin supplementation, these patients quickly demonstrated decreased diarrheal episodes as well as intestinal restoration.29 Antifolate chemotherapeutic drugs such as methotrexate can con- tribute to folic acid and vitamin B 12 deficiencies and can cause or contribute to diarrheal symptomatology. Cancer patients treated with this class of drugs who had lowered folic acid and vitamin B 12 were found to be more susceptible to subsequent development of serious drug-related toxicities such as myelosuppression, diarrhea, mucosal toxicity, and infection. This suggests that toxicity is related to relative folate deficiency in some cancer patients.30 In this study, nutritional supplementation led to a marked reduction in toxicity and the abo- lition of treatment-related deaths without affecting the efficacy of the antineoplastic drugs. Tangential to the conversation of infectious diarrhea and folic acid, there is a concern for neural tube defects (NTDs) with folic acid and vitamin B 12 deficiency. It has been suggested that gastrointestinal dis- turbances such as those caused by diarrhea might negatively affect the availability of these vitamins to the pregnant mother and fetus, thereby increasing the risk of birth defects. In one study evaluating the risk of neural tube defects with periconceptional diarrhea, it was observed that one or more episodes of periconceptional diarrhea were associated with an increased risk of NTD-affected pregnancies compared with no episodes of diarrhea. This association was independent of fever, obe- sity, maternal age, maternal birthplace, income, prior unproductive pregnancy, and dietary plus multivitamin folate intake.31 Whether the cause of diarrhea is infectious or of any other origin, it is prudent to ensure proper folic acid and vitamin B 12 nutrition in women who are trying to conceive as well as in newly pregnant women. Folic acid supplementation appears to be without side effects, even at high doses (e.g., 15 mg/day). Patients with certain genetic polymor- phisms, including COMT and/or MAO, may experience aggravations from high doses of methyl-donors secondary to impaired ability to metabolize increased neurotransmitter availability (a concept known as methyl-trapping). It has been reported that 8 of 14 healthy human subjects who consumed 15 mg/day of folic acid for 1 month developed abdominal distention, flatulence, nausea, anorexia, sleep disturbances with vivid dreams, malaise, and irritability.32 This, however, has not been confirmed in a double-blind clinical study33 and other investiga- tions.34,35 Vitamin B 12 is not carcinogenic, teratogenic, or mutagenic. It is considered safe even at 1000 times the recommended daily allow- ance. However, during such treatment, care should be given to not take large amounts of folic acid because this may mask the nerve damage associated with vitamin B 12 deficiency.


In recent years, the nutritional importance of zinc has been estab- lished, and zinc deficiency and its symptoms have been well recog- nized. Diarrhea has been found to be one of the clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency. Zinc has demonstrated an antimicrobial effect on enteric pathogens such as S. typhi, Salmonella, E. coli, Enterobacter, Shigella, Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Vibrio chol- erae36,37 and may contribute to the treatment of diarrhea. Zinc absorp- tion occurs throughout the small intestine, not only in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Many illnesses distinguished by chronic diarrhea entail insufficient absorption of zinc. In fact, in some cases of chronic enteropathies in infants, like celiac disease and cystic fibrosis, a defi- ciency of zinc has been isolated.38 Good dietary sources of zinc are meat, fish, and to a lesser extent, human milk. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare but severe disease in which skin lesions, chronic diarrhea, and recurring infections are the main symptoms. The disease is related to the malfunctioning of intestinal absorption of zinc and can be treated by administering phar- macological doses of zinc orally. The amount of zinc absorbed in the small intestine is influenced by other nutrients: some compounds such as dietary fiber and phytates (which are found in foods including soy, wheat bran, peas, carob, and brown rice) may inhibit this process, whereas picolinic and citric acid facilitate it. Citric acid is thought to be the ligand that accounts for the high level of bioavailability of zinc in human milk.38 As a cautionary note, it is theoretically possible that some of the dietary treatments used by practitioners of natural medicine for per- sistent postenteritis diarrhea—such as elimination of cow’s milk and increased fiber and carob powder as well as use of soy formula in infants—can contribute to a scarce supply of zinc and therefore pro- mote the persistence of diarrhea itself.38 Although these therapeutic approaches are being used, zinc supplementation may be warranted, especially if the patient tends to have diarrheal symptoms.

## Glutamine

Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the blood. As one of the principal fuels used by the intestinal lining cells, it accounts for 35% of their energy production. Although glutamine is readily available in the diet and synthesized in the body, supplementation improves the energy metabolism of the gastrointestinal mucosa, thus stimulating regeneration.39 Glutamine prevents intestinal mucosal damage and has been shown to decrease bacterial leakage across the intestines after they are damaged, presumably by stimulating repair.40 Clearly, glutamine holds promise for enhancing the repair of mucosal injury by a wide range of infections or toxic agents and thus has great potential as a new oral rehydration and nutritional therapeutic for patients with enteric infection, malnutrition, or chemotherapy-induced or radiation-in- duced enteritis.40 Animal models have definitely shown the usefulness of this amino acid in diarrhea. Glutamine has been shown to enhance sodium and water absorption in a rabbit model of cholera and Cryptosporidium- infected piglet intestine and has proven effective in a bovine model of Cryptosporidium as well. One rat model of cholera toxin–induced diarrhea also showed that alanyl-glutamine (a more stable derivative of glutamine) enhanced water and electrolyte intestinal absorption even better than the traditional glucose solutions.41 In one double-blind clinical study of 128 healthy children ages 6 to 24 months old with acute diarrhea, 63 received 0.3 g/kg/day of glutamine, and 65 controls received a placebo for 7 days. The

average duration of diarrhea in the glutamine-treated group was sig- nificantly shorter than that in the placebo group (3.4 days vs. 4.57 days, respectively).42 Glutamine, even at high doses, is without side effects and is well tolerated.41 A typical dosage of glutamine is 100 mg three times a day (see Chapter 84 for a more comprehensive discussion of glutamine).

## Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces

Probiotics, translated as “for life,” are bacteria residing in the intestine that are considered beneficial to health. The most important health- ful bacteria are Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Other bacteria (including such beneficial strains as Lactobacillus casea, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus salivores, and Lactobacillus bre- vis) also become established in the gut (see Chapter 105 for an exten- sive discussion of these useful clinical agents). A substantially growing body of scientific evidence has now demon- strated that lactobacilli, Saccharomyces, and fermented foods play a significant role in human health. Probiotics are thought to have a pro- tective effect against acute diarrheal disease and have been shown to be successful in the treatment or prevention of various types of infectious diarrhea, including that due to rotavirus, C. difficile, and traveler’s diar- rhea.5,43,44 A review of the literature suggests that Lactobacillus rhamno- sus GG (LGG) and Saccharomyces boulardii had the most compelling evidence of efficacy; they reduced the duration of disease by 24 hours in acute gastroenteritis and were both likely to improve outcomes in antibiotic-associated diarrhea.95 Corroborating earlier reviews,45,46 a Cochrane meta-analysis supports the use of probiotics to shorten the duration (reduced risk of diarrhea lasting 4 or more days by 59%) and reduce stool frequency in acute infectious diarrhea.47 Studies show that probiotic supplementation may also prevent future nosocomial rotaviral gastroenteritis, thus demonstrating an immune-modulating effect of probiotics,5,48 possibly by significantly increasing the number of cells secreting IgA. Lactobacillus sp. have also shown remarkable ability to inhibit E. coli O157:H7, but not Salmonella, in refrigerated storage.49 Lactobacillus may be considered as a future addition to stored foods used for low immune status and high susceptibility to E. coli O157:H7. Children are especially susceptible to infectious diarrhea and its sequelae. In a recent Cochrane review of children with antibiotic-associ- ated diarrhea, L. rhamnosus or S. boulardii at 5 to 40 billion colony-form- ing units/day was shown to be effective at improving symptoms, with a reasonable number needed to treat (NNT).50 In one double-blind, place- bo-controlled study, a standard infant formula was supplemented with the probiotics Bifidobacteria bifidum and Streptococcus thermophilus. Subjects in the probiotic group developed diarrhea at a statistically lower rate than those in the control group (7% vs. 31%). Additionally, rota- virus shedding was decreased statistically in the probiotic group (10% vs. 39%).44 A second randomized placebo-controlled trial evaluated probiotics in a different but also high-risk population. In this case, undernourished Peruvian children received LGG or placebo. Although a difference in rates of diarrhea was observed, where the treated group had statistically fewer episodes of diarrhea, the reduction was minor (from 6 episodes per child per year to 5.2 episodes per child per year). Interestingly, children who were breastfed did not seem to benefit at all, raising the possibility that probiotics provide a similar action as breast milk in the prevention of infection.51 In a third double-blind study, 81 children aged 1 to 36 months were enrolled in a trial and randomly assigned at admission to receive 6 × 109 CFUs of LGG or placebo twice daily orally for the duration of their hospital stay. The Lactobacillus- treated children enjoyed a dramatically reduced risk of nosocomial diar- rhea of 6.7%, versus 33.3% in those who were not given the probiotic. Once again, the use of LGG significantly reduced the risk of rotavirus gastroenteritis (2.2% vs. 16.7%).52 S. boulardii, also known as Saccromyces cerevisiae, is a nonpatho- genic probiotic yeast that may be most helpful in diarrhea caused by C. difficile, a pathogen most likely to affect the elderly. Although in the conventional medical world vancomycin is the preferred treatment of severe cases, S. boulardii alone or in combination with vancomycin has been reported to be an effective therapeutic alternative for recur- rent infection.12 Although it is generally safe, a few case reports have demonstrated that fungemia and sepsis are rare complications of the administration of S. boulardii in immunocompromised patients,53 in whom it may be contraindicated. The daily adult dose is usually 1 g/ day in divided doses (500 mg twice a day) for at least 4 weeks. L. acidophilus has been shown to correct the increase of gram-neg- ative bacteria observed after the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, as occurs with any acute or chronic diarrhea.54–59 Similarly, a mixture of B. bifidum and L. acidophilus inhibited the lowering of fecal flora induced by ampicillin and maintained the equilibrium of the intestinal ecosystem.57 Although it is commonly believed that acidophilus supplements are not effective if taken during antibiotic therapy, the research actually supports the use of L. acidophilus during antibiotic administration.57,58 Reductions of friendly bacteria or superinfection with antibiotic-resis- tant flora, or both, may be prevented by administering L. acidophilus products during antibiotic therapy. A dose of at least 15 to 20 billion organisms is required. Probiotic supplements should, however, be taken as temporally far away from the antibiotic as possible. Evidence indicates that the conventional medical world is begin- ning to take notice of the benefits of giving Lactobacillus with antibiotic therapy. In one double-blind, controlled study, the antibiotic con- taining ampicillin (250 mg) and cloxacillin (250 mg) with or without protected lactobacilli was evaluated in 740 patients undergoing cata- ract surgery. The incidence of diarrhea in patients receiving antibiotic alone was 13.3%, compared with 0% in patients receiving antibiotic with protected lactobacilli.21 Although antibiotics should be used judi- ciously and only in cases where the benefits outweigh the risks, adjunc- tive therapy may decrease the untoward effects of antibiotic therapy on the gastrointestinal system. Although many excellent companies provide high-quality probi- otic products, it is difficult to sort through all of the manufacturers’ claims of superiority, and some products have been shown to contain no active L. acidophilus.60 Only high-quality, laboratory-tested probi- otics should be used.

## Berberine-Containing Plants

Berberine-containing plants include goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), barberry (Berberis vulgaris), Oregon grape (Berberis aquifolium), and goldthread (Coptis chinensis). Berberine, an alkaloid, has been exten- sively studied in both experimental and clinical settings for its antibi- otic activity. Berberine exhibits a broad spectrum of antibiotic activity, having shown antimicrobial activity against bacteria, protozoa, and fungi, including Candida albicans.61–67 Berberine’s antibiotic action against some of these pathogens is actually stronger than that of the antibiotics commonly used for the disease these pathogens cause. Berberine-containing plants should be considered in infectious processes involving the previously mentioned organisms. Berberine’s action in inhibiting Candida, as well as patho- genic bacteria, prevents the overgrowth of yeast, which is a common side effect of antibiotic use. Diarrhea is a common symptom in patients with chronic candi- diasis. Berberine has shown remarkable antidiarrheal activity in even

## 1428SECTION 6 Diseases

the most severe cases. Positive clinical results have been shown with berberine in relieving diarrhea in cases of cholera, amebiasis, giardiasis, and other causes of acute gastrointestinal infection (e.g., due to E. coli, Shigella, Salmonella, and Klebsiella) and may also relieve the diarrhea seen in patients with chronic candidiasis.68–74 The dosage of any berberine-containing plant should be based on berberine content. Because there is a wide range of quality in gold- enseal preparations, standardized extracts are preferred. Three-times- a-day dosages are as follows: • Dried root or as infusion (tea), 2 to 4 g • Tincture (1:5), 6 to 12 mL (1.5–3 tsp) • Fluid extract (1:1), 2 to 4 mL (0.5–1 tsp) • Solid (powdered dry) extract (4:1 or 8%–12% alkaloid content), 250 to 500 mg Note that the dosage recommendations for berberine would be to 50 mg three times a day or a daily dosage of up to 150 mg. This dos- age is consistent with the dosage range in the positive clinical studies in patients with gastrointestinal infections. For children, a dosage based on body weight is appropriate. The daily dosage would be the equiva- lent of 5 to 10 mg of berberine/kg (2.2 lb) body weight. Berberine and berberine-containing plants are generally nontoxic at the recommended dosages; however, berberine-containing plants are not recommended for use during pregnancy, and higher dosages may interfere with B vitamin metabolism.

## Potentilla tormentilla (Tormentil Root)

Tormentil root contains more than 15% tannic acid, giving this plant high astringent capacity75; it may be useful in treating infectious diar- rhea, shortening the duration of rotavirus diarrhea, and decreasing the requirement for rehydration solutions.10 A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted at a children’s hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia. In this study, 40 children ranging in age from months to 7 years with rotavirus diarrhea were divided into two groups: a treatment group consisting of 20 children given 3 drops of tormentil root extract per year of life three times a day until discontin- uation of diarrhea or a maximum of 5 days and a control group of children who received a placebo. The duration of diarrhea in the group treated with tormentil root extract was 60% less than that in the placebo group (3 days, com- pared with 5 days in the control group). In the treatment group, 8 of 20 (40%) children were diarrhea-free 48 hours after admission to the hospital, compared with 1 of 20 (5%) in the control group. Children in the treatment group also received smaller volumes of parenteral fluids than subjects in the control group.10 For adults, a reasonable dose is drops of tincture twice daily. Some clinicians find the powdered herb to be more effective in adults at a dosage of 1/4 tsp twice daily.75

## Allium sativum (Garlic)

Garlic appears to affect DNA and RNA synthesis and is being investi- gated as an effective antibiotic. In vitro antimicrobial sensitivity tests on E. coli, Shigella sp., Salmonella sp., and Proteus mirabilis found significant effects of garlic along with ciprofloxacin and ampicillin. The gram-neg- ative diarrheagenic pathogens from the stool samples were highly sensi- tive to garlic, whereas ciprofloxacin was most effective against E. coli. The differences were inferred to result from genetic differences among the organisms and differences in the modes of action of the antibiotics. Most interestingly, no pathogens were resistant to garlic, which led the authors to conclude it was a promising antimicrobial agent.76

## Other Antidiarrheal Botanicals

A recent review of the available evidence indicates the use of herbal compounds in children or adolescents suffering from acute diarrhea. An herbal preparation containing Matricaria chamomilla (German chamomile) was shown to significantly reduce the duration of diarrhea and frequency of bowel movements compared with placebo. Carob bean juice was shown to be superior to placebo in reducing the required intake of a standard rehydration solution, total stool out- put, and the overall duration of diarrhea. The more commonly avail- able carob powder, at a dosage of 15 g daily (in divided doses), has been

## Other Antiparasitic Botanicals

A wide variety of botanicals have been used alone or in combination with anti-inflammatory and demulcent herbs to specifically stop para- sitic infections and heal the digestive tract. Curcumin has been shown to protect against castor oil– and carrageenan-induced diarrhea in rat models.78 The Brazilian Ocimum selloi essential oil produced a significant reduction in the severity and frequency of diarrhea pro- duced by castor oil while also reducing transit time in mice.79 A Thai herbal formula called Pikutbenjakul—which contains Piper longum, Piper sarmentosum, Piper interruptum, Plumbago indica, and Zingiber officinale—has shown promise in in vitro work against some Vibrio species, Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli, and S. aureus.80 Unfortunately, human clinical trials are lacking to corroborate the safety and efficacy of their use. Future studies should evaluate the potential benefits and toxicities of the following antiparasitic herbs: Artemisia absinthium (wormwood), Chenopodium abrosioides (wormseed), Curcuma longa (turmeric), Phytolacca decandra (pokeweed, pokeroot), Juglans species (black and white walnut), and Tanacetum vulgare (tansy).


A meta-analysis of three double-blind clinical trials of diarrhea found that individualized homeopathic treatment decreases the duration of acute childhood diarrhea. In this review, 242 children ages 6 months to 5 years were analyzed as one group. Children were randomized to receive either an individualized homeopathic medicine or placebo to be taken as a single dose after each unformed stool for 5 days. Parents recorded daily stools on diary cards, and health workers made home visits daily to monitor the children. The duration of diarrhea was defined as the time until there were fewer than three unformed stools per day for 2 consecutive days. A meta-analysis of the effect–size dif- ference of the three studies was also conducted. Combined analysis showed a statistically significant duration of diarrhea of 3.3 days in the homeopathy group versus 4.1 in the placebo group. Homeopathics commonly included as possible remedies for diar- rhea include podophyllum (which is well known for its almost uni- versal application for traveler’s diarrhea81), aloe, china, mercurius, phosphorus, nux vomica, sulfur, aconite, veratrum album, and arse- nicum. Although these results must still be evaluated further with larger-scale studies, given the safety and historical effectiveness of homeopathy, it should be thoroughly considered as part of the natural medicine practitioner’s therapeutic choices.


From a traditional Chinese medicine perspective, diarrhea is generally due to an imbalance of large intestinal regulation as well as deficiency of the spleen and stomach. Although there are variations depending on a particular patient’s presentation, the four basic diagnoses are diarrhea due to Cold-Damp, Damp-Heat, Spleen-Yang Depletion, and Kidney Yang deficiency. Typically, diarrhea caused by infectious pathogens falls into the category of Damp-Heat and may present with pain, mucus, and blood in the stool. A few studies have shown the effect that acupuncture82–84 and Chinese herbal preparations have on intestinal movement.2,85 One

## 1429CHAPTER 183 Infectious Diarrhea

study demonstrated that intestinal peristalsis was accelerated signifi- cantly by acupuncture at the abdomen but suppressed by moxibus- tion, which is the warming of certain acupuncture points with nearby burning of Artemisia argyi.83 Depending on the desired result, the acu- puncture practitioner may want to focus on moxa therapy for some cases where slower peristalsis is desired. Two studies measured the influence of electrical stimulation of acupuncture points including ST-36 (Zusanli) and SP-6 (Sanyinjiao) on the myoelectrical activity of the small intestine; as a result, a clear ability of acupuncture to alter intestinal motility was recorded. One of these trials employed 3 Hz of electroacupuncture on the ST-36 (Zusanli) point and demonstrated increased regularity of the gastric myoelectrical system.84 However, another evaluation did not find acupuncture plus electrostimulation to be effective enough to normalize gastric dysrhythmia after pretreat- ment with atropine.86 Animal research has supported the historical use of acupuncture for infectious diarrhea. The effect of acupuncture was evaluated in the treatment of 32 young pigs with induced enteropathogenic E. coli diar- rhea. The animals were all inoculated with E. coli and then divided into three groups. One group, the controls, remained untreated; a second group was treated with the antibiotic enrofloxacin; and the third group was treated with traditional acupuncture using GV-1 (Jiaochao). Using histopathological evaluation by hematoxylin-and-eosin stain, severe infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria was observed in the ascending and descending colon and in the fundic stomach of the untreated control group. Destruction of the fundic gland’s architec- ture and necrotic lesions were also observed. However, in these same anatomic locations, the animals treated with acupuncture or antibiot- ics maintained mucosa of the colon and stomach that were relatively similar to those of the normal group.87 Another corroborating similar study of 34 animals employed Du-20 (Bai-hui), BL-20 (Pishu), CV-12 (ZongWan), and ST-25 (TianShu). This study found no extra benefit from using electrical stimulation.88 Many Chinese practitioners find benefit in using acupuncture and Chinese herbs together to decrease the side effects associated with Western medicine.89 One study of Keishi-ka-shakuyaku-to (Gui- Zhi-Jia-Shao-Yao-Tang) on diarrhea induced by pilocarpine, barium chloride, or castor oil found a significant reduction when the herbal combination was dosed at 1000 mg/kg. This herb may mechanisti- cally act to inhibit excessively accelerated small intestinal movement. Another trial comprised 162 children suffering from chronic pro- tracted diarrhea; it involved randomly dividing them into two groups and observing them clinically. In the Chinese herbal medicine group, Xiang Cheng San was externally applied to the umbilicus of each patient; in a second group, Western drugs were routinely given. The results showed that the therapeutic effects were markedly better in the herbal medicine group.90 Although no control was used in this experi- ment, the results are encouraging. A wider variety of patent, granular, and loose herb combinations are used to treat various Chinese diagno- ses for infectious diarrhea. Future clinical research will help elucidate their use. Finally, complex chronic immune deficiency conditions leave patients quite susceptible to pathogenic infection and are difficult to treat. Diarrhea affects more than 60% of persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS. AIDS patients already on a polypharmaceutical regimen have shown good responses to acupunc- ture and moxibustion used to alleviate symptoms of diarrhea.91,92 In one pilot study, 15 HIV-positive men with chronic diarrhea received the same acupuncture/moxibustion treatment for six sessions over a 3-week period. In all subjects, stool frequency was reduced by approx- imately one episode per day. Stool consistency also improved from baseline to week 3 and week 4 by more than 1 point on Hansen’s stool consistency scale. Once again, more studies are necessary, but pre- liminary results are promising for antidiarrheal therapy that does not require additional pharmaceuticals. Overall, Chinese medicine modalities have proved to be quite safe. In one 6-year Japanese study, the results of 84 therapists and 65,482 treatments were evaluated. Participants were required to report all adverse events. In total, only 94 (0.14%) adverse events were recorded, and none was serious (serious events included conditions like pneu- mothorax, infection, and spinal cord injury). The authors concluded that serious or severe adverse events are rare in standard practice. Although more research is clearly necessary to elucidate the benefits of acupuncture, given the little risk and long history of positive anec- dotal evidence, it is certainly worth using.93 More research on Chinese herbs is also necessary to elucidate the toxicity in those preparations that appear therapeutically beneficial.


Overall, natural treatments can adequately manage most cases of non–life-threatening diarrhea. Importantly, diarrhea itself is an elim- inative function used by the body to clear toxins and should not be completely suppressed. Of course, chronic diarrhea and diarrhea that causes extreme or rapid electrolyte and water loss may require conven- tional interventions. It is imperative to maintain hydration and elec- trolyte balance. Nowhere is this need more immediate than in children younger than 5 years of age.

## Underlying Factors

Addressing underlying factors such as low stomach and pancreatic output and depressed levels of IgA helps decrease the chances of patho- genic infection. When possible, eliminating iatrogenic causes such as proton-pump inhibitors and antibiotics also helps prevent recur- rences. Diets low in refined sugar and cow’s milk dairy are encouraged. Food allergies and intolerances should be assessed in those with recur- rent infections. Methods to relieve stress also help encourage proper digestive function. Proper treatment with either an antibiotic or a natural alterna- tive requires close monitoring by standard laboratory methods (e.g., repeating multiple stool samples 2 weeks after initiation of therapy).


The BRAT diet may be useful to discourage large volume loss in infec- tious diarrhea. Green banana and pectin fiber may be a useful part of the BRAT diet. Small, frequent meals (hourly, if possible) may be best, with glucose administration in the case of vomiting. Avoidance of soy, casein, and other known allergenic foods may be beneficial.


Dosages are for adults unless otherwise indicated. • Vitamin A: 60 mg/day in children and up to 50,000 IU/day for 1 to 2 days for adults with infections. Caution against high doses (above 10,000 IU/day in pregnant women). • Folate: 1 mg/day • Vitamin B 12 (methylcobalamin): 600 to 1000 mcg/day • Zinc picolinate: 30 mg/day • Glutamine: 100 mg twice a day • Lactobacillus sp. and Bifidobacteria sp. 6 to 10 billion CFU of LGG or other high-quality probiotic twice a day orally. For prevention of antibiotic-induced diarrhea, a dosage of at least 15 to 20 billion organisms is required. Probiotic supplements should be taken as far away from the antibiotic as possible (2–4 hours is ideal). In chil- dren younger than age 6 experiencing antibiotic-induced diarrhea,

<!-- chunk -->

## 1430SECTION 6 Diseases

the probiotic should be taken every day of the antibiotic dose and continued for 1 week after discontinuing the antibiotic. • S. boulardii: Specifically to treat C. difficile, a daily adult dose of 1 g/ day in divided doses (500 mg twice a day) for at least 4 weeks. Can be used adjunctively with vancomycin.


• Berberine: Dosage recommendations for berberine would be 25 to 50 mg three times a day or a daily dosage of up to 150 mg. For chil- dren, a dosage based on body weight is appropriate. The daily dos- age would be the equivalent of 5 to 10 mg of berberine/kg (2.2 lb) body weight. See earlier discussion for more details. • Tormentil: 60 drops of tincture twice a day or powdered herb at 1/4 tsp twice a day. In children, 3 drops of tormentil root extract per year of life three times a day until discontinuation of diarrhea or a maximum of 5 days. • Carob powder: 15g daily (in divided dose), mixed into applesauce or similar mixture


• Typical remedies for diarrhea include podophyllum, aloe, china, mercurius, phosphorus, nux vomica, sulfur, aconite, veratrum album, and arsenicum. The specific choice of remedy should be based on the individual patient and his or her presentation.


• Acupuncture points may include ST-36 (Zusanli) and SP-6 (Sany- injiao), DU-20 (Bai-hui), BL-20 (Pishu), CV-12 (ZongWan), and ST-25 (TianShu). • Acupuncture is appropriate for stress relief as well as in the direct treatment of intestinal issues and is excellent for treating HIV/ AIDS-related diarrhea.

## 1432SECTION 6 Diseases

The probability of a couple’s fecundity is calculated to determine the monthly chance a couple has of conceiving a child. It factors in a number of variables and considerations for both the male and female partners. In diagnosing the cause of infertility, it is important to con- sider all variables as pieces of a couple’s reproductive and fertility health. The clinical presentation may suggest either blatant fertility impediments (e.g., genetic abnormality) or each partner may have minor health concerns that, when combined, constitute major imped- iments to a successful fertility outcome (Table 184.1).

## Medicine

The statistics suggest that 4.6% of U.S. infants born in 2005 (95% uncertainty range: 2.8%–7.1%) resulted from ovulation treatments not involving assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs). National ART Surveillance System data indicate that ART treatments currently account for 1.2% of total U.S. live births, 16% of U.S. twins, and 38% of U.S. triplets or higher-order (quadruplets or more) live-born infants.7 Therefore the prudent clinician must be aware of potential interactions and consider each treatment protocol accordingly. It is advisable for clinicians to recommend the following approach to their patients for safe, integrated treatment: • Before an in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle, a 3- to 4-month precon- ception program for both partners should be encouraged to ensure appropriate nutritional status and detoxification to optimize suc- cessful outcome. • Any causative or contributing factors that may hinder the success of an IVF cycle should be investigated and eliminated thoroughly. • Any preexisting health conditions during the preconception win- dow of 3 to 4 months must be addressed and treated. • During an IVF cycle, it is crucial to enable optimal communication between the naturopath and fertility specialist to prevent any inter- actions. Dietary and lifestyle recommendations should be encour- aged; however, nutritional and/or herbal medicine prescriptions must consider potential negative interactions with IVF medica- tions. As such, all prescriptions must be individualized. • Once IVF has concluded and a successful outcome has been attained, treatment can be modified to support the pregnancy, focusing on miscarriage prevention in the first trimester and then adjusting as the pregnancy continues.

## Optimizing Natural Fertility

Natural conception is clearly the ideal scenario for any couple. It is therefore necessary to assess a few key variables, including ovulation detection and the timing and frequency of intercourse. Before infer- tility is diagnosed, the current recommendations are to encourage couples to attempt conception for a minimum of 12 months of unpro- tected, appropriately timed intercourse. The time period is reduced in couples where the female is older than 35 years. In these couples, a diagnosis of infertility is achieved after 6 months. A couple’s fertility is generally highest in the first few months of unpro- tected sex and declines gradually thereafter. If no conception occurs within the first 3 months, monthly fecundity decreases substantially among those who continue their efforts to conceive.8 Therefore couples who are likely to conceive naturally are likely to do so in a few short cycles. In cases where conception takes longer, other impediments may be present. These may be physical or genetic factors, which may require assistance from ART. However, the cause may simply be a compounding health variable such as a blatant nutritional deficiency. Appropriate investigations, as discussed later on in this chapter, will elucidate the approach required. Couples should be encouraged to attempt conception during the fertile window. A recently ovulated egg will survive for only a few hours (maximum of 24 hours); however, sperm can survive for up to 5 to days in the presence of fertile-quality cervical fluid. The fertile window is best defined as the 6-day interval ending on the day of ovulation.9 As estrogen increases in the female in the lead-up to ovulation, she pro- duces fertile-quality cervical fluid, which protects the sperm from the acidic pH of the vagina, provides a medium in which it can travel, and provides nutritional sustenance for it to survive on its journey. A widely held misconception is that frequent ejaculations decrease male fertility. A retrospective study analyzed 9489 men with normal semen quality, sperm concentrations, and motility and found that profiles remained normal even with daily ejaculation.10 Of more importance is the finding that males with abnormalities such as oligo- zoospermia, lowered sperm count, and poor motility concerns may be improved with more frequent (daily) ejaculation.10 In supporting patients with natural conception, ovulation detec- tion is a key component. Box 184.1 includes the main methods avail- able and highlights their most appropriate application.

## Female Reproductive Assessment

A thorough assessment of the female patient is crucial to accurately determine her general and fertility health. Some of these assessments may require referral to a fertility specialist, gynecologist, or endocri- nologist; however, thorough questioning should be conducted by the naturopath to elucidate a full history and assess causative or contribut- ing factors (Table 184.2). All fertility patients should be screened with the queries in Table 184.3, and stage 1 investigations should be con- ducted with all fertility patients (Table 184.4).

## Miscarriage

The comprehensive coverage of the topic of miscarriage is beyond the scope of this chapter. Because the incidence is as high as one in four pregnancies,11 the prudent clinician should be informed about the background, useful assessments, and treatment approaches to miscar- riage as part of the holistic approach to female fertility.

## 1438SECTION 6 Diseases

Implantation of the developing embryo into the receptive endome- trium is a critical and key event in the establishment of early pregnancy. The unique process of cell adhesion of the trophoblast to the endo- metrium at the time of implantation and its subsequent invasion into the maternal tissue is dynamically balanced through the expression of specific cell adhesion molecules and endocrine, paracrine, and auto- crine signals. The process can be viewed as a series of distinct events, many of which are similar to those of an inflammatory reaction and are greatly influenced by the factors present in the uterine microen- vironment, including hormones, growth factors, and inflammatory and proinflammatory cytokines.12 The secretion of a number of factors achieves modulation of the immunological response of the tropho- blast. Cytokines produced at the fetal-maternal interface play a key role in regulating maternal tolerance to the fetus and successful pregnancy. Although approximately 25% of all recognized pregnancies result in miscarriage, less than 5% of women will experience two consecutive miscarriages, and only 1% experience three or more.11 Recurrent preg- nancy loss is a disease distinct from infertility, defined by two or more failed pregnancies.13 When the cause is unknown, each pregnancy loss merits careful review to determine whether specific evaluation may be appropriate. Although the general consensus is to evaluate after three or more losses, it is more in keeping with the naturopathic paradigm to review all patients even after the first and more comprehensively after the second or subsequent miscarriage. The risk of miscarriage is highest immediately after implantation. It is thought that around 50% of all fertilized eggs do not survive, coming away with a normal (or slightly late) period. This is often referred to as an “unnoticed miscarriage” because it is usually not formally acknowledged by the woman, who is never aware of her pregnancy. In summarizing the possible clinical scenarios, it is useful to group them into three distinct categories: 1. For a healthy, viable pregnancy to initiate and continue success- fully, a number of biochemical, anatomical, and molecular events must occur in a systematic and timely manner. Any deviation can disrupt the process and abort the pregnancy. 2. The overlapping clinical continuum of presentation can conflict with or complicate the fertility presentation. Each clinical presentation

has the potential to present as infertility (occult implantation fail- ure), subclinical or clinical miscarriage in the first trimester, a fetal loss in the midtrimester before viability, a premature birth, or as a birth defect presenting at or after term. Each presentation is unique and must be considered holistically and individually. 3. The number of similarities between previous miscarriages (if any) can enable the clinician to ascertain the most definitive scenario and develop and adjust treatment accordingly. 4. As seen in Table 184.5, various conditions can be associated caus- ally or coincidentally with miscarriage.

<!-- chunk -->

## Classic Causes of Miscarriage

• Genetic/chromosomal: 60% or more of early miscarriages are due to chromosomal abnormalities. • Age: after age 40, one third of pregnancies end in miscarriage. • Hormonal abnormalities: luteal-phase deficiencies (low progester- one) are the most common cause. This can relate to hyperprolac- tinemia. • Metabolic abnormalities: poorly controlled blood sugar levels or diabetes mellitus and polycystic ovary syndrome increase miscar- riage risk. • Uterine abnormalities: distortion of the uterine cavity can account for 15% to 20% of miscarriages. • Antiphospholipid syndrome: this can account for 3% to 15% of pregnancy losses. • Thrombophilias: this creates an increased risk of thrombosis and consequent increased risk of pregnancy loss, especially in the sec- ond half of pregnancy. • Male factors: abnormal sperm DNA can result in pregnancy loss (see Chapter 185 for a full discussion). • Unexplained: no explanation is found in 50% to 75% of couples.

<!-- chunk -->

## Unexplained Causes of Miscarriage

When the causes of miscarriage are unexplained, the naturopath can provide the most beneficial support and care. A miscarriage, especially a first-trimester loss, can occur for any number of natural biological reasons. A marked deficiency in any nutrient (macro or micro) can theoretically cause a miscarriage. A full discussion of macro- and micronutrients and their relation to pregnancy loss is offered later in this chapter. Additionally, the naturopath’s consideration of the patient’s general health and comprehensive review of all other factors is invaluable.

## Supporting Female Fertility

On being asked to consider a patient with infertility, it is crucial for the practitioner to assess several factors initially to determine the best approach to treatment. As in the case of male fertility, naturopathic treatment cannot address all variables, such as genetic factors or overt physical impediments; however, it can attenuate various presentations. In the clinician’s initial assessment, the prime objective is to assess the patient fairly and holistically. Therefore consideration should be given to the patient’s previous pregnancy, duration of infertility, age of part- ner, severity of present pathology, and other factors. For example, in the case of a 41-year-old female who has had no prior pregnancies, has been infertile for 2 years, and suffers from endometriosis, it is cru- cial to initiate integrative care with a reproductive endocrinology and infertility (REI)/fertility specialist because ART is likely to be required. If this patient had sought consultation 4 years earlier, time constraints would not be as severe, and the naturopathic paradigm would possibly be of help. Unfortunately, age is one of the variables that cannot be modified. Similarly, if the couple incorporates donor gametes, the cli- nician must acknowledge the potential limitations to treatment. A useful summary to delineate the possible approaches is as follows: • Treatable conditions: Some patients present with blatant deficien- cies or disease processes that require interventions to improve their natural fertility. Most people respond positively to a preconception program focusing on detoxification, which enables conception more readily at the conclusion. • Untreatable subfertility: After naturopathic intervention, some infertility factors may not be possible to address, or alternatively, referral for ART/IVF may be required. • Untreatable female sterility: This can occur in instances of mature patients, genetic disorders, or previous conditions that compro- mise fertility. Adoption or donor oocytes are the only possibilities for couples in this group who wish to have a family. Donor oocytes may not be an option for all patients.

## Naturopathic Preconception Treatment

As in the case of male infertility, during naturopathic preconception treatment, the most optimal approach for females is to encourage a program that correlates with the final stages of gamete development (oocytes). Although women are born with all of their oocytes at birth, there are limited treatment options to remedy the primordial stage of development (unless we can modify potential epigenetic factors). Because the primary follicle development from the primordial follicle takes up to 120 days, preconception care is best prescribed within this time period. Following this treatment approach, we can successfully influence additional stages of oocyte development (secondary → antral → Graafian). By influencing the oocyte’s environment during devel- opment and the correlating general health of the patient, practitioners are able to positively influence the development of oocytes and address and attenuate related health concerns. The principles of the preconception approach are to attenuate pre- existing conditions; optimize nutritional repletion; detoxify the body from dietary, lifestyle, and environmental perspectives; and encour- age a healthy approach to parenting on all levels. It is imperative to acknowledge that nutritional repletion is required throughout the pre- conception period and that prescriptions may require higher quanti- ties than typical to optimize the patient’s status. Fertility occurs when a person’s individual health is optimal. The notion of a healthy body being a fertile one cannot be ignored. As discussed in Chapter 185, the body is primed to pass genetic material only when the environment and conditions are at their best. If survival from an evolutionary per- spective is compromised, fertility will be hindered. Everything a person eats, drinks, experiences, or is exposed to can and will influence his or her fertility. True naturopathic fertility supports, acknowledges, and considers absolutely all variables for holistic health. Couples should be encouraged to participate in treatment for 3 to 4 months to properly address all genetic and epigenetic variables. The concept of preconception care was pioneered by Foresight, the Association for the Promotion of Preconceptual Care. It was estab- lished in the United Kingdom in 1978 and is a preconception pro- gram that incorporates dietary and lifestyle advice to enhance fertility, thereby increasing the chances of a healthy conception. Readers may wish to review this research in more detail for additional information. However, published studies lack sufficient evidence owing to poor study design and delivery (one was provided as a letter to an editor and is referred to as a study); nevertheless, the evidence of successful outcomes cannot be refuted. It is hoped that further investigation into this highly effective approach will be conducted in the future. If the practitioner is incorporating ART, it is beneficial to inform patients that cotreatment is likely to produce the best outcome. In

one study, 65% of couples who had previously undergone multiple IVF cycles were able to conceive within 2 years of a preconception program.14 It is important to acknowledge that most fertility patients are incor- porating several treatment options concurrently.15 It is therefore pru- dent to point out the scope of all treatments and to discuss individual treatment protocols openly so as to foster a collaborative approach and reduce the risk of negative interactions.

## Fertility-Damaging Factors

<!-- chunk -->

## Age. The biggest preventable cause of infertility is undoubtedly

a woman’s age. Approximately 20% of women wait until after age to begin their families. Several factors have contributed to this trend, including contraception choices, career pathways, marrying at older ages, high divorce rates, financial security, or—most concerning—the fact that many women simply do not realize that their fertility begins to decline in their late 20s, with a rapid decrease from age 35 onward. After 35 years of age, a women’s fertility declines rapidly in conjunction with the deteriorating quality of her oocytes (Fig. 184.1). She may enter oopause in her 30s, depending on her genetic makeup, thus further reducing the chances of a successful fertility outcome. Regardless of a woman’s health, age-related changes cannot be prevented or modified. The age of a woman’s oocytes is fixed, and as she ages further, fertility potential undergoes a statistical decline. Although over 95% of healthy couples will conceive within 3 years of trying when the woman is 35 years of age, that figure drops to 77% when she reaches age 38. By the age of 41, less than half of the healthy couples will conceive after 3 years of trying. A number of considerations regarding the effects of age on fertility should be considered. These include the following4: • Ovarian function: As women age, fertility declines owing to normal age-related changes in the ovaries. Women are born with all the oocytes they will ever have, with approximately 300,000 follicles remaining at menarche. They will then lose between 20 to 30 follicles each cycle. Of the oocytes remaining at puberty, it is believed that approximately to 400 of these follicles will mature over 30 years and be released by the body, with the remainder being lost in each cycle. The rest will undergo atresia, a degenerative process that occurs regardless of whether a woman is pregnant, has normal menstrual cycles, uses birth control, or is undergoing infertility treatment. Smoking appears to accelerate atresia and is linked to earlier menopause. • Ovarian reserve: Ovarian reserve declines with each cycle. Dimin- ished ovarian reserve is usually age related and occurs because of the natural loss of eggs and decrease in the average quality of the eggs that remain. The remaining eggs become “poor responders” to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thus shortening the menstrual cycles. Young women may also have reduced ovarian reserve because of smoking, a family his- tory of premature menopause, prior ovarian surgery, or even if they have no known risk factors. • Genetic abnormalities: Aging affects oocyte quality and increases the risk of neonatal genetic abnormalities. As a female ages, her risk for having a child with Down syndrome and total chromosomal abnormalities increases dramatically. At 20 years of age, her risk for producing a child with Down syndrome is 1 in 1667 (1 in total risk for any chromosomal abnormalities); at 35 years of age, that risk increases to 1 in 378 (1 in 192). At 45 years of age, the risk increases again to 1 in 30 (1 in 21).16 • Miscarriage risk: Older oocytes increase the risk of miscarriage. The risk of miscarriage remains at 10% between 15 and 29 years of age; it then increases to 12% at 30 to 34 years of age and to 18% at 35 to 39 years of age. Thereafter, it escalates significantly to 34% at 40 to 44 years of age and to 53% after the age of 45.16

## Weight balance. For optimal conception, women must ensure

that their body fat percentage is between 20% and 25% to support fertility and the subsequent health of their child. A body fat percentage below 17% can result in anovulation, with some research suggesting that it can take as long as 2 years before regular conception occurs even after body fat percentage has been corrected.17 Women with a body mass index (BMI) below 19 who have irregular or absent menses should be advised to gain weight to improve their chance of conception. Malnutrition can be a relatively simple solution for conception difficulties (provided mental health issues are addressed). Although anorexia or underweight is a concern, obesity poses a similar and significant risk for infertility. The effect of obesity is much more comprehensive than that of underweight, and the necessary treatment is easier to prescribe. Obesity affects female reproduction by disturbing the general body metabolism, hormone metabolism, and the follicular environment. Obesity is associated with the following: • Suboptimal oocyte quality and development, oocyte fertilization, and embryo development and implantation18,19 • Adverse effect on ovarian reserve20,21 • LH surge and corpus luteum dysfunction22–24 The risk of infertility in obese women is three times that of nor- mal-weight women.25 A systematic review of the literature concluded that weight-loss interventions were likely to result in ovulation improve- ments and pregnancies. Miscarriage rates were not affected by weight- loss interventions.26 In a retrospective cohort study, meaningful weight 30% 25% 20% 15% 10% 5% 0% 22

loss (10% of their maximum weight) was found to increase conception rates (88% vs. 54%) and live birth rates (71% vs. 37%) in patients with infertility compared with women who did not lose weight.27 The effect of obesity on reproductive function is as follows28: • Ovulation potential: Ovulation returns with a relatively modest degree of weight loss from diet and exercise. Approximately 90% of obese women will resume ovulation if they lose more than 5% of their pretreatment weight, and 30% will conceive. In very obese women, these statistics are higher for pregnancy rates than can be expected from a single IVF cycle. This recommendation is crucial and encouraging for obese women wishing to have children. • IVF outcome: The success rate of ART is significantly reduced in obese women. IVF success rates may be reduced by as much as 25% in obese patients and 50% in very obese patients. A retrospective cohort study of 4609 women with obesity found a 68% reduction in live births from an ART cycle compared with women of nor- mal weight.29 It has been proposed that altered endometrial gene expression in obese patients may contribute to the lower implan- tation rates and increased miscarriage rates seen in obese infertile patients.30 Obesity also promotes inflammatory markers that are negatively correlated with pregnancy rates in women undergoing IVF treatment.31 In women undergoing ART, obesity has a greater effect on fertility in women under 35 years of age. After age 35, age becomes a more important factor in regard to the chance of con- ception than obesity.18,32 IVF centers are very reluctant to perform fertility treatment on women with a BMI greater than 35 and gen- erally recommend a target BMI of 30 before starting treatment.33 • Miscarriage: The risk of miscarriage in the first trimester increases from 12% to 15% in normal-weight women under 37 years of age; for women with a BMI above age 35, it increases to 31%. The rate of recurrent miscarriage increases fourfold in obese women. • Birth defects: Maternal obesity has a detrimental effect on fetal devel- opment (e.g., three times the risk of neural tube defects and structural heart defects). Folic acid supplementation is less effective in prevent- ing neural tube defects, so high-dose supplementation is required for obese women (it is always beneficial to calculate nutrient require- ments based on the patient’s presenting weight, using Clark’s rule). • Pregnancy complications: Pregnancy complications are more com- mon in obese women (gestational diabetes is six times more com- mon), and pregnancy-induced hypertensive diseases are more common (specifically, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia). Complications increase the risk of premature delivery and/or the need for cesarean section. Babies born to obese women have heavier birth weights (fetal macrosomia), which increases the risk of traumatic vaginal delivery. Additionally, there is a higher complication rate for cesarean and vaginal deliveries in obese women (e.g., excessive blood loss, thromboembolic disease, and postoperative infection). • Pregnancy outcomes: Increasing BMI increases the risk of stillbirth (twice the risk vs. normal-weight women). • The newborn: Maternal obesity carries long-term risks for the new- born infant (e.g., increased risk of being overweight as an adult and the likelihood that these children will have weight-related diseases in adulthood). A recent prospective cohort study of 501 couples found that the body composition both partners needs to be taken into account. In couples where both partners are obese, a longer time to pregnancy was observed than in leaner couples.34 A recent Cochrane review was unable to suggest any evidence-based recommendations on the best interventions for improving pregnancy outcomes for women who are overweight or obese35; however, an individualized weight-loss program involving dietary, lifestyle, and exercise changes should be implemented.

## Immunological considerations. Although this topic is beyond

the scope of this chapter, the immunological considerations associated with successful conception and a healthy birth are worthy of review. Because optimal production of gametes requires a healthy immune response, any deviation from “normal” can significantly affect the outcome. In females, any immunological aspect that can affect general health, conception, implantation, and the maintenance of pregnancy can cause problems. A number of miscarriage factors (including implantation factors) relate to autoimmune diseases. Therefore stabilizing and modulating the immune response is a key objective of treatment. The immune system must “switch itself off” at conception, implantation, and a number of key stages in the first trimester. Therefore consideration of these variables is crucial.

## Environmental factors. Increased industrialization and the use

of agricultural chemicals has contributed to an increased exposure to thousands of chemicals now associated with a negative effect on male and female fertility. Exposure to environmental toxins such as radiation (including mobile phone use),36 heavy metals, and chemicals can cause oxidative stress and damage to DNA, leading to a negative effect on female fertility.37 A comprehensive discussion of the environmental effects on fer- tility is provided in Chapter 185. The reader is specifically directed to the discussion regarding estrogen exposure and general environmental pollutants. Specific considerations for women should acknowledge the effect of substances more commonly associated with females, includ- ing makeup, fragrances, hair dyes, nail polishes, and other beauty products. All of these can have a negative effect on reproductive func- tion and hormone cascades. It is therefore prudent to reduce such exposures as much as possible, specifically within the preconception window and during the first trimester, when embryogenesis and pla- centogenesis are paramount. Of greater concern is the fact that gestational exposure to carcino- gens, endocrine disruptors, and other toxins has been shown to affect more than one generation in some cases. Most studies unfortunately have not investigated effects beyond the third (F2) generation. Further studies are required in this intriguing area of genetics, especially because the F2 generation may have experienced the exposure directly. Chemicals known to induce phenotypic effects in unexposed genera- tions include alloxan,38 cyclophosphamide,39 orthoaminoasotoluol,40 benzpyrene,41 diethylstilbestrol,42 and vinclozolin.43 The underly- ing mechanisms are not known, and in most cases, inherited genetic lesions cannot be ruled out, especially in cases of mutagens (e.g., cyclo- phosphamide). As time progresses, it is likely that these chemicals will induce greater damage to subsequent generations due to their cumula- tive effects and earlier generational effect. A full discussion on potential environmental effects is provided in Chapter 35.

## Sleep irregularities. Shift work is associated with negative effects

on the regularity of the menstrual cycle and reproductive function and also increases the risk of an adverse pregnancy outcome. In one study, the effect of shift work on nurses (all less than 40 years of age) was reviewed; the investigators evaluated sleep, menstrual function, pregnancy outcome, and reproductive function. It was found that 53% of the women studied noted menstrual changes owing to shift work, changes that clearly could affect fertility.44 It is therefore essential that women wishing to achieve pregnancy normalize their cycles and find a way to optimize and regulate their sleep patterns.

## Smoking. Both active and passive cigarette smoking are known

to have a significant effect on both pregnancy rates and long-term ovarian function. Additionally, smokers are more likely to have a premature menopause, thus making smoking one of the most readily

## 1442SECTION 6 Diseases

avoidable causes of infertility. Smoking appears to reduce fertility by having a direct effect on the uterus, oocytes, and embryos by increasing the thickness of the zona pellucida.45 It becomes difficult for the sperm to penetrate the increased thickness of the zona pellucida. Overall, research indicates that smoking can age oocytes prematurely by as much as 10 years. Considering that the average age for conception is 30 years and the average age at which fertility begins to decline steeply is 38 years, it appears prudent to recommend immediate smoking cessation coupled with systematic antioxidant therapy. On review of the research, smoking has been shown to decrease ovarian vascularization and reduce oocyte maturation.46 It is linked with premature ovarian aging (premature menopause) and an increased risk of miscarriage.47 It is important to note that smoking, either current or historical, is strongly correlated with negative effects on the health of the oocytes. A trial comprising 14,779 women between the ages of 18 and 23 years showed that current smokers and ex-smok- ers had an increased risk of menstrual symptoms and miscarriage com- pared with women who had never smoked.48 Of more importance, it was found that women who smoked 20 or more cigarettes a day and for the longest periods were most at risk. Additionally, those who started smoking at a younger age had the worst outcome. A 2010 Cochrane review found that active and passive smoking reduced fertility and decreased the chance of a healthy live birth in both fertile and infertile populations.49 Additionally, a number of meta-analyses have proved that smokers perform poorly in IVF/ ART procedures compared with their nonsmoking counterparts.50,51 Smoking has been associated with delayed conception and a signifi- cant decrease in the odds for pregnancy and live delivery per IVF/ART cycle. There is also a marked increase in the odds for spontaneous miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy.52 Cigarette smoke is composed of many toxic chemicals and pro-oxidants that increase reactive oxygen species (ROS). Each stage of reproductive function—folliculogenesis, steroidogenesis, embryo transport, endometrial receptivity, endome- trial angiogenesis, uterine blood flow, and uterine myometrium—is a target for cigarette smoke components.52,53

## Caffeine. Patients should be encouraged to avoid caffeine during

the preconception period and during pregnancy. Caffeine has been shown to increase time to conception54–56 and has also been linked with endometriosis and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion.57 Caffeine has been shown to increase dopamine production, which in turn stimulates progesterone secretion, thus inhibiting the production of prolactin (owing to the antagonistic and regulatory interrelationship between progesterone and prolactin). Any prolactin abnormality, either excess or deficiency, can affect a woman’s fertility negatively. According to several studies, as little as one caffeinated beverage a day can lead to a temporary reduction in conception.58,59 Owing to its prolactin-modulating effects, caffeine appears to increase early follicular estrogen levels.60 Caffeine is also likely to interfere with adrenal function and associated cortisol secretion. In addition, caffeine’s diuretic effects increase the loss of nutrients that are beneficial to fertility. It is important to note that the quantity of coffee has a direct correlation with pregnancy rates. Women who drink less than one cup of coffee a day are twice as likely to conceive compared with moderate coffee drinkers.55 Caffeine has been shown to reach the follicular fluid. Increased serum caffeine levels are associated with a decrease in the number of harvested eggs in IVF treatment.61 Some studies have found that coffee intake is unrelated to fertility. In women undergoing ART, cof- fee intake was unrelated to treatment outcomes, but consumption of caffeinated herbal tea had lower odds of achieving pregnancy during treatment.62 In a prospective cohort study of fertile women, it was found that caffeine in general does not have negative effect on time to pregnancy.63 Similarly, a recent prospective cohort study of women found that there was no significant association between coffee intake and fecundity. Once again, caffeinated tea was associated with slight reductions in female fecundability.64

## Alcohol. A review of the literature regarding alcohol intake and

female fertility indicates that there are many factors that can affect each woman uniquely. There are strong associations with alcohol intake and miscarriage65; excessive alcohol consumption is associated with hyperprolactinemia,66 adverse effects on oocyte retrieval, and a lower chance of subsequent pregnancy in IVF67; and a minimum of 50% reduction in conception can be seen with intake as low as one drink per week during a menstrual cycle.68 Additionally, research suggests that alcohol produces negative effects on blastocyst development and implantation and increases estrogen levels, causing a subsequent reduction in FSH secretion and suppressing folliculogenesis, thus leading to anovulation and infertility.69 Acute alcohol consumption can cause increases in estradiol, testosterone, and LH levels.70 Regular alcohol use leads to overproduction of ROS, which is associated with delayed conception. A Danish study demonstrated that alcohol might exacerbate age-related infertility. Women over the age of 30 who consumed more than seven alcohol servings per week had an increased risk of infertility.71 Clinical studies to date have been inconclusive in their findings; however, a recent systematic review and meta- analysis of the literature concluded that female alcohol consumption is associated with reduced fertility and that the association is dose dependent.72 It is advisable to recommend the cessation of alcohol intake during the preconception period. Conclusive evidence exists regarding fetal abnormalities and associated alcohol intake during pregnancy. This evidence can often be sufficient to motivate patients. Because detoxification is encouraged during the preconception period, the avoidance of alcohol is recommended.

## Marijuana. As discussed in Chapter 61, marijuana contains

cannabinoids, which have been shown to impair signaling pathways, alter hormonal regulation, and interfere with the timing of implantation.73 Additionally, it is believed to cause ovulatory abnormalities and to disrupt ovarian function,74 and regular marijuana use results in an elevated risk of primary infertility compared with nonusers.52 Furthermore, marijuana has been shown to have harmful effects on the developing fetus.75 Therefore avoidance is strongly recommended.

# NUTRITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

## The Fertility Diet

There are countless papers documenting dietary modifications to sup- port and improve a woman’s fertility. Specifically, research suggests that dietary modulation improves ovulation, conception, and the birth of a healthy child. The strongest evidence in favor of dietary modification to sup- port fertility can be seen in the prospective study developed from the information ascertained from the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS-II).76 Of importance, the information acquired was from 2 years before the report of infertility in this study, thus enabling a preconception interpretation. Information included dietary and lifestyle characteris- tics (body weight, physical activity) and medical health factors. In this intriguing study, the participants were followed for 8 years. The “high-fertility diet” thus characterized includes the following: • Lower intakes of trans fatty acids and greater intake of monounsat- urated fats77 • Lower intake of animal protein and greater intake of vegetable pro- tein78 • Higher intake of high-fiber, low-glycemic carbohydrates

## 1443CHAPTER 184 Infertility, Female

• Higher dietary sources of dairy foods (Note: This is controversial because there are conflicting studies on this.79,80) • Higher dietary sources of nonheme iron • Higher frequency of multivitamin use • More likely to consume coffee, tea, and alcohol • More likely to be physically active (vigorous activity for 30 minutes or more daily) • Less likely to smoke • Less likely to have long menstrual cycles • More likely to be a recent user of the oral contraceptive pill • Weight balance: BMI between 20 and Researchers concluded that these components of a fertility diet are conducive to the most successful outcome. When these approaches are combined with the control of body weight and increased physical activity, the majority of infertility problems involving ovulation may be prevented. In another trial, researchers noted that the Mediterranean diet increased the chance of a successful pregnancy in those undergoing IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). It was found that the high content of B vitamins (especially vitamin B 6 ) combined with the high intake of vegetable oils may be the mechanism responsible for this positive outcome.81 These findings are supported by a case-control study of 485 Spanish women that showed improved fertility in women who adhered to a Mediterranean diet compared with those who fol- lowed a Western dietary pattern.82 Adequate folate intake is associated with female fertility, and a study found that a higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet was significantly related to a greater folate intake.83 In another cohort study, adherence to the Dutch dietary recom- mendations (characterized by high intake of whole grains, mono- unsaturated or polyunsaturated oils, vegetables, fruit, meat or meat replacers, and fish) before IVF treatment was associated with an increased probability of pregnancy.84 Another aspect of diet that needs to be considered is fat intake. High-fat diets have been associated with changes in reproductive function, including altered menstrual cycle length, as well as changes in reproductive hormone levels and embryo quality in ART settings. These effects on reproductive function are present in normal-weight women, and the effect is worsened in obesity.85 Trans fatty acid intake is associated with reduced fecundability.86 A recent prospective cohort study of 60 women undergoing IVF treatment found a negative cor- relation between the trans fatty acid index and IVF outcomes.87 Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) have been shown to have a negative effect on ART outcomes and appear to be related to dimin- ishing ovarian reserve or abnormally functioning folliculogenesis.88 Dietary AGEs are formed during the cooking process (grilled, burned, or barbequed foods), especially in animal-derived foods that are high in fat and protein.89 The evidence is mounting that a healthy diet can reduce the risk of infertility. With regard to pregnancy loss, results from the NHS-II cohort found no relationship between preconception adherence to any one specific dietary pattern and risk of pregnancy loss.90

## -Arginine

Arginine is a precursor of nitric oxide synthesis and is required for angiogenesis, embryogenesis, fertility generally, and hormone secre- tion.91 Additionally, it is required for the replication of cells, making it essential for oocyte development and embryo formation. One study92 produced notable results. The specific population was “poor responders”—women who had failed to achieve an adequate number of mature follicles and/or adequate serum estradiol levels after gonadotrophin stimulation. This trial indicated that arginine supple- mentation (oral at 16 g/day) improved ovarian response, endometrial receptivity, and pregnancy rates. The women were divided into two groups: (1) flareup gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) plus elevated pure follicle-stimulating hormone (pFSH) (n = 17) or (2) flareup GnRHa plus elevated pFSH plus oral l-arginine (n = 17). Results indicated that group 2 (the arginine group) demonstrated a lower cancellation rate, increased number of oocytes on collection, and increased embryo quality and transfer compared with the control group. Additionally, 3 of 17 women in the arginine group conceived, whereas none in the control group did so. The literature regarding arginine and fertility outcome is impres- sive; however, although the trial showed very promising results, it assessed only a small sample of women, too small to allow definitive conclusions. Further research into the potential of this promising adjunct during ART procedures is recommended.

## -Carnitine

Similar to its role in male reproductive function, l-carnitine plays a vital role in fatty acid metabolism. It is derived from the amino acids lysine and/or methionine and works synergistically with coenzyme Q 10 . It is essential in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria; a deficiency results in a decrease in fatty acid concentrations in the mito- chondria and reduced energy production. Prescriptions must use the l form and not the dL form to ensure effectiveness and safety. The mito- chondria are crucial components of oocyte development, acceptance of the spermatozoa, and subsequent embryogenesis. It is the mRNA within the oocyte that requires the power of the mitochondria to allow conception to occur. Therefore the prescription of carnitine is specif- ically indicated in women who are experiencing implantation issues and/or presenting with aging oocytes. In addition to mitochondrial energy production, l-carnitine improves female fertility by reducing cellular stress and maintaining hormonal balance.93 In mouse studies, carnitine has been found to exert a protective effect on mouse oocytes, reducing damage to the oocyte’s cytoskele- ton and also mitigating embryo apoptosis induced by incubation in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis.94 Although perito- neal fluid has a strong effect on endometriosis, it helps regulate endo- metrial lining production and implantation factors. A small in vitro study of follicular fluid from 22 infertile women with mild endometri- osis undergoing IVF treatment found that l-carnitine with N-acetyl- cysteine prevented oocyte damage.95 As such, although human studies are lacking, the prescription of carnitine for patients experiencing endometriosis and/or implantation failure due to endometrial factors is recommended. A trial in 170 women with clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) found that administering l-carnitine (3 g/day) in conjunction with clomiphene citrate (250 mg/day) from day 3 until day 7 of the cycle significantly improved both the ovulation and pregnancy rates. The lipid profile and BMI of the women were also improved.96 A small prospective study (n = 24) of acetyl-l-carnitine supplemen- tation (1 g/day) over 16 weeks in women with stress-induced hypotha- lamic amenorrhea found a significant increase in LH levels in hypo-LH women, via modulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonad (HPG) axis. LH response to naloxone was restored in the treatment group.97 These results were supported in a follow-up study of 27 women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea who were administered l-carni- tine (500 mg/day) with acetyl-l-carnitine (250 mg/day) over 12 weeks. LH plasma levels increased (in hypo-LH women), whereas cortisol and amylase levels decreased significantly.98

## Antioxidants

Compared with male fertility, there is little evidence supporting the use of specific antioxidants. However, the consensus remains that the

<!-- chunk -->

## 1444SECTION 6 Diseases

use of antioxidants combined with a good diet improves fertility in women.15 One Cochrane review assessed the use of vitamin supple- mentation in the prevention of miscarriage. It concluded that patients given multivitamins plus iron and folic acid, compared with controls, had reduced risk for stillbirth, but there was no effect on miscarriage risk.99 The same review concluded that there is a lack of evidence to support antioxidant supplementation for reducing the risk of mis- carriage. Therefore it is highly likely that any vitamin prescription, provided that it is prescribed holistically and effectively, will have a positive effect on female fertility. Transgenerational epigenetic effects include both the physiological and behavioral (intellectual) transfer of information across genera- tions. Although in most cases the underlying molecular mechanisms are not understood, modification of the chromosomes that pass to the next generation through gametes is sometimes involved; this is called transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. The oocyte, a highly sensitive structure, is highly vulnerable to its external environment and external influences. Every female is born with all of her oocytes. As such, they are thus exposed to everything she experiences throughout her entire life. Additionally, from an epigen- etic perspective, a woman’s oocytes are also exposed to everything to which her mother and even her maternal grandmother were exposed. Oxidative stress has a detrimental effect on female fertility by increasing time to conception, decreasing fertilization rates, decreas- ing oocyte penetration function and viability, decreasing implantation, and increasing loss of implantation.100 The oocyte requires a regular antioxidant supply to continue to reduce oxidative damage both from current circumstances and his- torical (or transgenerational) exposure. Glutathione is the major nonenzymatic antioxidant found in oocytes and embryos.52 During conception, the mRNA is responsible for using antioxidant reserves to address any DNA fragmentation or oxidation from both the sperm and the oocyte. The very act of conception and the subsequent travel of the embryo through the fallopian tubes before implantation generate free-radical damage. Because oxidative stress has been shown to hinder optimal fertility,101,102 it is imperative to provide sufficient support for the oocyte so that conception and implantation can occur. It is important to note that physiological levels of ROS are required for healthy oocyte development and better IVF outcomes. It is a pre- requisite for the first meiotic phase (meiosis I) and is also required for folliculogenesis; however, if levels are abnormally high, they are negatively associated with oocyte and embryonic development and pregnancy outcomes. Antioxidant intake is important to suppress ROS buildup and maintain physiological levels of free radicals for homeostasis and proper cell functioning.103 Excessive ROS production (through lifestyle factors such as advanced age, obesity, smoking, alco- hol intake, recreational drug use, and exposure to environmental pol- lutants) can overpower the body’s natural antioxidant defense system, creating an environment unsuitable for normal female physiological reactions, leading to unexplained infertility.52,103–105 Women with idiopathic infertility have lower total antioxidant sta- tus in the peritoneal fluid, and it has been suggested that peritoneal fluids with increased ROS and decreased antioxidant status diffuse into the fallopian tubes and can damage the sperm, which is highly sensi- tive to oxidative stress.105 Oocyte quality is also affected by oxidative stress, limiting successful ovulation and fertilization. Follicular fluid contains high levels of antioxidants that protect oocytes from ROS damage, and a small pilot study has shown that higher levels of mel- atonin (a powerful antioxidant) in the follicular fluid are associated with both the quantity and quality of oocytes and can predict IVF out- comes.106 Selenium and glutathione peroxidase levels have been found to be lowest in follicular fluid in patients with unexplained infertility, and antioxidant capacity levels were found to be higher in follicles of patients whose oocytes fertilized successfully.107 Oxidative stress causes alterations in certain protein pathways, the abnormal expression of which could possibly lead to the pathophysi- ology of infertility.103 In women undergoing IVF treatment, it was found that increased intakes of β -carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E were associated with time to pregnancy, but the effect of individual antioxidants varies by age and BMI.104 Although is it clear that antioxidant status plays a role in reproduction and infertility, the success of antioxidant supplemen- tation in female subfertility is not so clear. A 2013 Cochrane review found that the quality of the evidence in the studies was low and that antioxidant supplementation was not associated with an increased live birth rate or clinical pregnancy rate.108 This conclusion was supported by a later trial of women with unexplained subfertility undergoing IVF treatment, which showed that daily oral antioxidant supplementation (multivitamins and minerals) did not improve oocyte quality and pregnancy rates.109

## R-Alpha Lipoic Acid

In both its lipid- and water-soluble forms, alpha-lipoic acid is a pow- erful antioxidant found in virtually all cells of the human body, scav- enging the free radicals implicated in oxidative stress. It assists in the chelation of heavy metals, thus minimizing the risk of cellular dam- age and regenerating other antioxidants, including vitamins C and E, coenzyme Q 10 , and glutathione.110


Vitamin A is a powerful antioxidant that assists in cellular growth and differentiation, both crucial for embryogenesis and placentogenesis.111 It is required for gene expression and cellular differentiation in organ- ogenesis and embryonic development112 as well as for immunity, regu- latory functions, the integrity of epithelial tissue, and the health of the cilia in the fallopian tubes. It has a direct relationship with zinc, and the deficiency of zinc has been linked with infertility, miscarriage, and the development of cleft palate. It is a cofactor of 3- β -dehydrogenase in steroidogenesis (specifically for estrogen production), and deficiencies may result in impaired enzyme activity.113 Additionally, low concen- trations of vitamin A are associated with anovulation,114 and plasma levels have been observed to be decreased in women suffering from habitual miscarriage.115 A Cochrane review has found no evidence, however, to support the use of vitamin A supplementation to reduce the risk of miscarriage.99 Supplementation during pregnancy is inadvisable due to the poten- tial for malformation and congenital abnormalities. However, supple- mentation in the preconception period is strongly advised. Owing to its lipid solubility and the liver’s high storage capacity, it is advisable to keep prescriptions below 10,000 IU/day. It is also important to note that cross-placental transfer occurs primarily with lipid-soluble nutri- ents. Therefore cessation of vitamin A supplementation is advisable as a cautionary measure immediately before conception attempts. An alternative is to prescribe carotenoids ( β -carotene), owing to their lower toxic potential. An additional benefit is that they have a role in ovarian oocyte and follicular maturation and function.116 However, 15% to 25% of whites are unable to convert β -carotene to vitamin A, so it is not a substitute for vitamin A (see also Chapters 57 and 125).

## 10

Coenzyme Q 10 , also known as ubiquinone (ubidecarenone) or ubiqui- nol, is an endogenous enzyme involved in intracellular adenosine tri- phosphate (ATP) production; it serves as a cofactor in oxidative stress respiration for the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain.117 It

## 1445CHAPTER 184 Infertility, Female

is a fat-soluble antioxidant and free-radical scavenger found in every cell in the body and plays a vital role in all energy-dependent processes. It is required in the maintenance of cell membrane integrity and cell func- tioning and is therefore specifically important for all new cells in the body and the development of cells in their maturation process. The presence of coenzyme Q 10 in human follicular fluid indicates its potential role in reproductive outcomes. Higher coenzyme Q 10 levels were seen in the follicular fluid of mature oocytes and good-grade embryos compared with immature eggs and poor-grade embryos, respectively.118,119 It is endogenously produced from tyrosine in a 17-step process that requires riboflavin (B 2 ), niacinamide (B 3 ), pantothenic acid (B 5 ), pyridoxine (B 6 ), cobalamin (B 12 ), folic acid (B 9 ), vitamin C, tetrahydrobiopterin, and trace elements as cofactors. Therefore an ample supply of these key nutrients is essential for the production of this enzyme. Additionally, it can be expected that patients with thyroid irregularities (both hyper- and hypothyroid) would require additional coenzyme Q 10 owing to its reliance on tyrosine as an initial building block. In women with clomiphene-resistant PCOS, it was found that sup- plementing with coenzyme Q 10 (180 mg/day) in conjunction with clo- miphene citrate resulted in significantly improved ovarian response, luteinization (midluteal progesterone), endometrial thickness, ovula- tion, and most importantly, pregnancy rate compared with treatment with clomiphene citrate alone.120 The use of coenzyme Q 10 supplemen- tation (600 mg/day) in women undergoing IVF procedures resulted in reduced aneuploidy and increased pregnancy rates compared with placebo.121 Clinical trials are very limited; however, there are countless papers supporting its inclusion in culture media used in an IVF setting, and it is considered a crucial component to mimic various reproductive fluids incorporated in natural conception. In the clinical setting, its role can be extrapolated fairly conclusively; therefore, its use should cer- tainly be considered because its clinical and therapeutic effectiveness are irrefutable. Because dietary sources are poor choices for optimal effect, supplementation is essential. In choosing supplements, it is essential to select the ubiquinol form because it is the active antioxidant. Specifically in the context of female fertility, coenzyme Q 10 can be seen to support mitochondrial function and to have positive appli- cations for maturing oocytes, which are at greater risk of oxidative damage. Oxidative damage is typically seen in the zona pellucida of the oocyte, thus preventing the acrosome reaction with sperm (fertil- ization). Receptivity of the zona pellucida is strongly correlated with the antioxidant status of the oocyte, and coenzyme Q 10 is believed to be the most specific antioxidant for this application. Understandably, requirements for coenzyme Q 10 will be greater for more mature oocytes (women above 35 years of age) or women undergoing ART procedures owing to the increased oxidative effect on the oocyte of such procedures.


Vitamin C is the body’s primary water-soluble antioxidant. It is pro- tective against free radicals, protects folic acid and vitamin E from oxi- dation, and has been shown to improve fertility outcomes in women with luteal-phase defects.122 The ovary is considered the primary site of ascorbic acid accumulation because the midcycle change of retention and excretion of ascorbic acid is one of the main markers of ovulation. In the literature, vitamin C is seen to be crucial for collagen biosyn- thesis and its positive effect on the growth and repair of the ovarian follicle and the development of the corpus luteum123; it may also facil- itate luteal steroidogenesis. It is necessary for the maturation of the preovulatory follicle and reduces the risk of preeclampsia when pre- scribed concurrently with vitamin E. Deficiency increases the risk of miscarriage, spontaneous rupture of membranes, and brain tumors in the offspring. Vitamin C is best coprescribed with bioflavonoids, which provide the additional benefits of strengthening capillaries, preventing miscar- riage, and preventing breakthrough bleeding during the pregnancy. Evidence levels are still low, and according to a Cochrane review, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of vitamin C supplementa- tion alone, or in combination with other supplements, to help prevent stillbirth, poor fetal growth, preterm birth, or preeclampsia.124


Vitamin E is a powerful lipid-soluble antioxidant that is essential for fertility and reproduction. It is a plant-derived fat-soluble vitamin that exists in eight different isomers. Alpha-tocopherol is the most biolog- ically active form for conception and is the focus in nutrition research. It has been shown to maintain the health of the ovaries125; help premen- strual syndrome (PMS) sufferers, including relief of affective and physical symptoms126; relieve benign breast disease127; and ameliorate menstrual migraine,128 indicating effects in the regulation of hormonal activity. The literature suggests that it may be of benefit in infertile women by reducing scar formation (especially keloid scarring when applied topically).129 This may make it particularly useful to those suffering from endometriosis and/ or complicated reproductive conditions such as Asherman’s syndrome. Additionally, one study found that women suffering from infertility and endometriosis had lower levels of vitamin E and increased lipid peroxi- dation.130 This was confirmed by another study indicating that levels of vitamin E were low in infertile patients compared with controls. This research suggests that the antioxidant capacity was compromised in infer- tile women and may cause subsequent risk of oxidative damage.131 A recent study found that higher levels (10–15ml/dL) of serum vita- min E were associated with higher-quality embryos in women under- going IVF treatment.132 As far as intervention trials go, one trial assessing outcomes in women with unexplained infertility undergoing ART showed that vitamin E (400 IU/day) combined with clomiphene citrate resulted in increased endometrial thickness. However, no statistical difference was found in implantation or ongoing pregnancy rates compared with clomiphene citrate treatment without vitamin E.133 A double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 105 infertile women with PCOS undergoing IVF treatment showed that clinical pregnancy and implan- tation rates were significantly higher in the treatment group compared with placebo. Treatment consisted of supplementation with vitamin E (400 mg/day) and vitamin D 3 (50,000 IU/once every 2 weeks) over an 8-week period. Oxidative stress was not reduced, and antioxidant sta- tus was not increased, in the treatment group in this study, and it was concluded that the positive results were due to the increase in vitamin D 3 levels of the participants.134 Further high-quality trials are needed in this area. A 2015 Cochrane review found no evidence to support vita- min E supplementation in pregnancy to prevent stillbirth, baby death, preterm birth, preeclampsia, or low-birthweight babies.135


Selenium is a powerful antioxidant with marked immune-modulat- ing properties. Deficiency has been linked to female infertility, mis- carriage, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, fetal growth restriction, preterm labor, and obstetrical cholestasis.136 Supplementation appears to reduce the risk of miscarriage, especially in association with thyroid autoantibodies.137 Supplementation has been suggested as a powerful supportive nutrient to regulate and control thyroid autoimmunity, specifically thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies.137 Selenium is essential in thy- roid hormone synthesis because several of the enzymes involved are selenoproteins.138 Selenium also plays a role in the immune system and the coagulation system.139,140

## 1446SECTION 6 Diseases

In a double-blind, randomized clinical trial, selenium substitution decreased TPO antibody levels in euthyroid subjects and increased quality of life.140 In another trial, it also decreased TPO antibody lev- els in hypothyroid patients treated with T4 substitution.141 Specifically in this specialized population, lowered selenium levels have been observed in the hair of women with recurrent miscarriage compared with controls who have had successful pregnancies139; decreased serum selenium has also been observed in women who suffered from miscar- riage in the first trimester as well as recurrent miscarriage.142 Serum and follicular fluid levels of selenium appear to be reduced in women undergoing IVF, and this has been associated with nonfertil- ization of the harvested oocytes.143 Multivitamin/mineral supplemen- tation has been shown to normalize selenium in serum and follicular fluid in women undergoing IVF.144 It has been shown that selenium levels in hair correlate positively with follicle number and oocyte yield after ovarian stimulation, suggesting that selenium has a positive effect on ovarian response to gonadotrophin therapy for IVF.145 In pregnancy, selenium supplementation (100 mcg/day) reduces prelabor membrane rupture and preeclampsia.146,147 In a preliminary study of healthy women, dietary selenium was significantly associated with lower odds of luteal phase deficiency. A 10-mcg increase in aver- age daily selenium consumption decreased the odds of luteal-phase deficiency by 20%. Luteal-phase deficiency refers to inadequate pro- gesterone secretion by the corpus luteum, which may render the endo- metrium less receptive to implantation and result in infertility or early pregnancy loss.148


More than 200 enzymes require zinc for their activity; these include the enzymes required for the production of the nucleic acids in DNA and RNA.149 Zinc has specific antioxidant properties required for the reproductive system and protects the oocytes from free radicals and reactive oxygen species.150 It enables reproduction, ovulation, fertiliza- tion, and the development of the oocyte.151,152 Deficiency may result in altered synthesis/secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone or luteiniz- ing hormone153 because it has been reported to have a role in the syn- thesis, transport, and peripheral action of hormones. Low zinc status is associated with low circulating concentrations of several hormones.154 Deficiency may produce symptoms such as abnormal ovarian development, increased risk of miscarriage, or increased risk of terato- genicity.155 It is considered to be the single most important nutrient for preconception and pregnancy and is frequently disrupted with the use of an oral contraceptive pill or a copper intrauterine device. In animal trials, low zinc levels were associated with impaired ovulation and a larger number of deteriorated oocytes151; in such circumstances, sup- plementation may be beneficial. Caution is advised because an exces- sive intake of zinc can be detrimental156; doses should be calculated on the basis of assessments and clinical findings. In the preconception period, zinc supplementation used to enhance fertility will further support a healthy pregnancy and subsequent healthy birth. Poor maternal zinc status is associated with a number of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birth weight, prema- ture delivery, complications of labor and delivery, and congenital anomalies in the offspring.157 Intrafollicular zinc levels in women with endometriosis have been observed to be higher in those women who successfully achieved pregnancy after IVF than in those who did not become pregnant.158 Additionally, requirements increase during preg- nancy because marginal zinc deficiency has been shown to be prevalent during this time.159 Monitoring is crucial because suboptimal levels are associated with growth retardation in the fetus.159 In one study, sup- plementation of 25 mg from at least 19 weeks’ gestation resulted in significantly greater birth weight.160 Additionally, a meta-analysis of supplementation trials indicates that zinc supplementation produced a 14% reduction in premature deliveries.161 However, a Cochrane review found that although zinc supplementation in pregnancy leads to a slight reduction in preterm births, it does not prevent other prob- lems such as low birth weight or preeclampsia.162

## B-Complex Vitamins

It is imperative to take the B-group vitamins in a stable, combined for- mulation owing to their interrelation and interdependence in a num- ber of key reactions in the body. Their synergy of effect can be seen in countless scenarios; however, some patients may require additional key B vitamins such as folate for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), polymorphisms, or vitamin B 6 in instances of luteal-phase defects or progesterone insufficiency. Deficiencies of this group of vitamins have been associated with a number of fertility problems, including fetal abnormalities such as neural tube defects,163 neonatal or perinatal death, low birth weight, and miscarriage.164,165 It is important to consider that alcohol, carbo- hydrate-rich diets, and the oral contraceptive pill increase the body’s requirements for B vitamins. Therefore any couple wanting to optimize their fertility may require additional B vitamins to prepare themselves for conception. Acknowledging that stress also increases requirements for B vitamins and that stress has been identified as playing a major role in couples who are having difficulty conceiving, the importance of adequate B-vitamin intake is further emphasized.

## (Thiamine)

In animal models, vitamin B 1 has been shown to stabilize the mem- branes of newly generated neuronal cells during embryogenesis con- current with slowing cell death. Additionally, it has been shown to be involved in the plasma membrane transformation of uterine epithelial cells during pregnancy.166 It plays a key role in reproductive function, with deficiency associated with altered cellular differentiation and pro- liferation and interference with hormonal processes, thus increasing the risk of miscarriage.167 Additionally, when taken preconceptually in combination with vitamins B 3 and B 6 , it has been shown to contribute to the prevention of oral-facial clefts.168

## (Riboflavin)

Vitamin B 2 is crucial for energy production, antioxidant defense, and numerous enzyme systems that rely on the presence of B vitamins. Insufficient levels can lead to altered estrogen and progesterone lev- els, often causing irregular menstruation. Supplementation often addresses irregularities such as general menstrual difficulties, irregular menses, PMS, and infertility.169 Vitamin B 2 is essential for the development of the fetus; according to animal studies, deficiency appears to affect embryonic growth and cardiac development. Therefore supplementation has been encour- aged to prevent these complications.170 Low dietary intake has also been associated with low birth weight171 and has been shown in one study to increase the risk of congenital heart defects in the offspring of mothers who did not take vitamin supplements in the periconceptual period or consume sufficient dietary saturated fatty acids.172

## (Pyridoxine)

Vitamin B 6 is required for the metabolism of amino acids, lipids, path- ways of gluconeogenesis, and synthesis of neurotransmitters during the periconception period.111 It is required for the synthesis of pros- taglandins; it also plays a key role in conjunction with vitamins B 9 and B 12 in their regulation of homocysteine, which, when elevated, has been linked to infertility and recurrent spontaneous miscarriage.173,174 Additionally, elevated homocysteine concentrations in follicular fluid

are also associated with poor oocyte and embryo qualities in patients with PCOS who are undergoing assisted reproduction,175 thus further supporting the B-vitamin combination. In addition, vitamin B 6 helps reduce elevated prolactin levels; sup- port luteal-phase defects by increasing progesterone secretion; increase the influx of magnesium into the myometrium; improve the absorption of zinc; and prevent preeclampsia, toxemia, and infarction of the pla- centa. Serum levels are often low in hyperemesis gravidarum, and a defi- ciency may be associated with a higher incidence of gestational diabetes. A study examining a Mediterranean diet in couples undergoing IVF demonstrated an increase in plasma vitamin B 6 levels and, in those with high adherence to the diet, a 40% increase in the probability of pregnancy.81

## (Folate, Folinic Acid or L-5MTHF)

Folic acid is required for healthy DNA and RNA synthesis, optimal protein synthesis, and the regulation of gene expression.176 Impaired folate metabolism disturbs endometrial maturation and results in poor oocyte quality. The most important variation in folate metabolism in terms of effect is the MTHFR polymorphism, which could be one rea- son for unexplained infertility.177 Deficiency can be corrected with supplementation, which is rec- ommended for at least 3 months for any woman planning preg- nancy.178 The primary justification for its preconceptual prescription is to prevent neural tube defects and spina bifida, as confirmed by a 2015 Cochrane review179; however, it must be supplemented for the first 28 days of gestation to achieve this goal.180 Therefore a preconcep- tual prescription for 3 months before conception is the safest option because most women are unaware of their pregnancy status until it is confirmed after a minimum of 14 days. Supplementation of folic acid is associated with a decreased inci- dence of ovulatory infertility76,181 and has been identified as being important for oocyte quality and maturation.152 A 2016 Cochrane review found no evidence to support the use of folic acid supplemen- tation for reducing the risk of early or late miscarriage or stillbirth.99 Folate and vitamin B 12 levels have been found to be largely inade- quate among women undergoing IVF treatment.182 Inadequate folate results in elevated homocysteine and alters DNA methylation nega- tively, influencing oocyte and early embryo quality.183 Inadequate B-vitamin status and raised concentrations of homocysteine are also associated with the early loss of pregnancy, as evidenced by a systematic review, which found that folate-deficiency–induced hyperhomocyste- inemia posed a risk for placenta-mediated diseases such as preeclamp- sia, spontaneous abortion, and placental abruption.184 In a prospective cohort study of women undergoing IVF (n = 232), live birth rates were 20% higher among women with the highest amount of supplemental folate intake (>800 mcg/day) compared with women taking the lowest amount (<400 mcg/day). This study also suggested that folate supplementation was superior to dietary folate.185 Similarly, in a study of 100 women, higher serum concentrations of folate and vitamin B 12 before ART treatment were associated with higher live birth rates.186 Contrary to these positive findings, a study found that neither folic acid supplementation nor folate status increased the chance of achieving a pregnancy after ART in women with unexplained infertility.187 Folate intake has been related to a lower frequency of sporadic anovulation in young healthy women,188 and folic acid supplement use was also associated with a shorter time to pregnancy among a large cohort of 3895 women.189 In women undergoing IVF treatment, higher urinary bisphenol A (BPA) concentrations were associated with a 66% lower probability of implantation. This effect was ameliorated by higher levels of dietary folate intake (more than 400 mcg/day).190 Preconception folic acid intake may increase fertility and increase a woman’s chance of becoming pregnant. Doses higher than recom- mended for the prevention of neural tube defects may offer the greatest benefit, as might the additional intake of vitamin B 12 .

## (Hydroxo-, Adenosyl- or Methyl-Cobalamin)

It is common for women to take folate in isolation and not acknowl- edge its copartner in all metabolic reactions, vitamin B 12 . Vitamins B 9 and B 12 work together to ensure that the replication of DNA and RNA in all cells is uniform and regulated. In one longitudinal study, it was noted that although folate levels decreased slightly during pregnancy and remained decreased for up to 6 weeks postdelivery, vitamin B 12 progressively declined during pregnancy and reached marginal or deficient levels in some individuals.191 Clinicians are reminded that supplementation of either vitamin B 9 or B 12 in isolation can cause a rebound anemia of the other nutrient and that pernicious anemia can be masked with supplementation of one vitamin in isolation, as evi- dent on the basis of red blood cell indices. Furthermore, low mater- nal levels of vitamin B 12 have been associated with a threefold risk of neural tube defects,192 again confirming its combined role with folate. Vitamin B 12 deficiency has been linked to infertility and recurrent spontaneous miscarriage.193 Moreover, pregnancy has been shown to occur after correction of this deficiency.193 In addition, it is prudent to acknowledge the collaborative role of vitamin B 12 in cases of elevated homocysteine levels.


The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) reported a prevalence of vitamin D deficiency of between 25% and 57% among adults.194 It is important to note that the accepted levels of this vitamin in this analysis are below what naturopaths would consider a safe, therapeutic level for optimal health. Therefore it can be hypothesized that the deficiency percent- age is actually much higher. Each week a new paper emerges high- lighting an additional application for this crucial vitamin. Its main functions include calcium homeostasis; modeling and remodeling of bone (supporting the skeletal health of both mother and child); immune activation; cell differentiation, proliferation, and growth; and many others. In the context of female fertility, the active form of vitamin D, 1-25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, has been shown to regulate the transcrip- tion and function of genes associated with placental invasion, normal implantation, and angiogenesis.195 Vitamin D is a powerful immune modulator and therefore an effective prescription for those who expe- rience autoimmune conditions that affect fertilization, implantation, and an increased risk of miscarriage. This is because of the vitamin D receptors found in cells involved in the immune response. Specifically, in fertilization, it is believed to have receptors on the zona pellucida of the oocyte as well as in the head of the sperm. Researchers have theo- rized that the acrosome reaction with the zona pellucida is enabled by an adequate vitamin D status. Vitamin D receptors are also found in the ovaries, uterus, placenta, and endometrium.196 Additionally, this vitamin appears to be involved in the acceptance of the sperm by the oocyte, whereby the vitamin D receptors act as gatekeepers to enable immune regulation and thus prevent rejection. Although the effect of vitamin D deficiency is unclear, no association with ovarian reserve or risk of spontaneous abortion has been observed197,198; however, a positive association of vitamin D levels with endometrial thickness has been observed.199 Maternal vitamin D deficiency has also been sug- gested to be an independent risk factor for preeclampsia, and a number of animal studies highlight the fact that vitamin D deficiency is associ- ated with infertility.200

## 1448SECTION 6 Diseases

There has been an increased level of interest in the effect of vitamin D on fertility, as evidenced by a search on the literature, and although some studies have yielded positive findings, similar numbers of studies have found no association. Studies of women undergoing IVF treatment found that higher serum and follicular fluid levels of 25(OH)D had increased pregnancy rates. Each ng/mL increase in follicular fluid 25(OH)D increased the chance of becoming pregnant by 6%.201–203 Similar results were found in women undergoing single blastocyst transfer—vitamin D deficiency was found to impair pregnancy.204 These findings were not supported in other studies.205–208 One study even found that that higher follicular fluid levels of 25(OH)D negatively affected embryo quality and led to poorer IVF outcome.209 Other studies have failed to find a significant association between serum and follicular fluid 25(OH)D levels and IVF outcome.210,211 In women undergoing euploid embryo transfer, vitamin D status was unrelated to pregnancy outcomes.212 A case-control study compared early pregnancy levels of vitamin D between women who took 12 to 24 months to get pregnant with age- matched women conceiving in less than 1 year and found no asso- ciation.213 A recent study of 70 infertile women found that 64% of the women were vitamin D deficient, but this did not correlate with anti-Müllerian hormone levels.214 A retrospective cohort study found that the relationship between vitamin D status and pregnancy rates differed by race. In non-Hispanic white women, pregnancy rates declined with lower levels of vitamin D, whereas in Asian women, the reverse association was seen.215 A study in donor–recipient IVF cycles showed that insufficient vitamin D levels of the recipients (rather than the donors) was associated with lower pregnancy rates, suggesting that the effects of vitamin D may be mediated through the endometrium rather than through the follicle or oocyte.216 Once again, however, these results were not supported by another study, which found no difference in pregnancy rates in recipients who had differing vitamin D levels (normal, insufficient, or deficient).217 Given the heterogeneity of findings, little can be conclusively stated from the results on vitamin D and fertility. Vitamin D deficiency might be detrimental to fertility, but it is not clear whether higher levels of vitamin D confer additional benefit once sufficiency has been achieved. A Cochrane review concluded that supplementing with vitamin D during pregnancy may reduce the risk of preeclampsia, low birth weight, and preterm birth. However, vitamin D and calcium supple- mentation combined increases the risk of preterm birth.218 At this stage, the clinician is advised to use serum levels to ascertain the best clinical approach and be mindful of not overprescribing.


Calcium is an important nutrient for conception, embryogenesis, and gestation. It is required for oocyte maturation, fertilization,219 and bone formation of both mother and child. It has also been shown to exhibit a protective effect against preeclampsia. A Cochrane review emphasized that calcium supplementation appeared to almost halve the risk of preeclampsia,220 which supports the prescription of calcium for all preconceptual women whose dietary intake is inadequate.221

## Iodine

Iodine deficiency has increased in the past two decades because of changes in the dairy industry. The primary supplementation for most people consisted of their dairy intake owing to the iodine solutions used to clean the dairy equipment.222 This practice has been modified, and today, chloride and bromide solutions are used instead. More than 30% of nonpregnant women of childbearing age have suboptimal uri- nary iodine concentrations.223,224 Adequate dietary intake of iodine preconceptually is imperative because it can minimize the risk of thyroid-related disorders and/or mental retardation in the infant, defects that are commonly seen in the offspring of deficient mothers. Additionally, low iodine has been shown to negatively affect the development of the central nervous sys- tem in the fetus and can hinder conception owing to its role as a nutri- ent donator for the T3 and T4 hormones that regulate thyroid function and thus ovulation. Maturing oocytes are highly dependent on healthy thyroid hormone levels for optimal reproductive function225; deficiency may result in a spectrum of disorders, including miscarriage, still- birth, mental retardation, and cretinism (deaf-mutism and spastic- ity).226,227 Additionally, thyroid autoimmunity is significantly higher among infertile women than among fertile women and increases the rate of miscarriage.228 Therefore iodine can help supply building blocks for thyroid hormones that are compromised by the autoim- mune process. Subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with ovulatory dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes; it is therefore cru- cial to assess thyroid (and iodine) status for both infertile males and females because correction of this condition can reverse or prevent infertility.229 In one study, 4980 women (462 of whom were pregnant) were tested for iodine status. Repeated miscarriage and stillbirth were associated with higher levels of deficiency, which increased the risk of reproductive failure.230 A recent population-based prospective cohort study of 501 women found that moderate to severe iodine deficiency is associated with a 46% decrease in fecundability.231 A 2017 Cochrane review found no conclusive evidence for the benefits or harms of iodine supplementation in women before, during, or after pregnancy. Iodine supplementation appears to decrease the likelihood of postpar- tum hyperthyroidism and increases the likelihood of digestive intoler- ance in pregnancy.232 As early as 1939, Kemp233 acknowledged a link between a deficiency of iodine and stillbirth of unknown origin. In the late 1970s, Potter et al.234 discussed the decline in stillbirth rates after iodine supple- mentation, highlighting the positive relationship that ensued between iodine (when taken at the correct dose) and a reduced incidence of stillbirth. Current research235 indicates that 2000 babies continue to be stillborn every year. In spite of advances in technology, the cause of one third of these deaths is unknown. It is recognized that a diagnosis of hypothyroidism based on thy- roid-stimulating hormone (TSH) values in isolation may not suf- fice to diagnose mild to moderate iodine deficiency in the pregnant woman.236 It is therefore prudent to assess the urinary iodine status of each patient either as a morning spot urine test, 24-hour urinary excre- tion test, or iodine:creatinine ratio, as recommended by the World Health Organization.237,238

## Iron

Iron is required for the formation of red blood cells, subsequent trans- port of oxygen to the tissues via hemoglobin, and nucleic acid metab- olism, as well as being involved in numerous enzyme systems within the body.111 Because there may be a risk of hemochromatosis, it is imperative that all patients be assessed thoroughly before prescription to ensure that their health is prioritized. If supplementation is needed, patients should address this deficiency in the preconceptual period to help prevent iron deficiency during the pregnancy.221 Results from the NHS-II suggest that women who consume iron supplements have a significantly lower risk of ovulatory infertility than women who do not.107,239

<!-- chunk -->

## 1449CHAPTER 184 Infertility, Female

In one article, iron supplements up to 40 mg or more were shown to reduce the risk of ovulatory infertility by up to 60% and to improve the chances of conception compared with women who did not take iron supplements.239 The link between iron deficiency and infertility has been confirmed by a number of other articles.240 Therefore practi- tioners should study the patient’s iron profile and ensure that all com- ponents are within the normal range, aiming to achieve serum ferritin stores of 80 ng/mL before conception and saturation of greater than 30%. It is imperative to assess a full iron study profile because ferritin can be elevated due to inflammatory processes in the body and give a false sense of iron repletion. This is especially important because some women are unable to take iron supplements during the first trimester owing to their tendency to aggravate nausea.


Magnesium is involved in numerous reactions in the body relevant to fertility, including cell signaling and energy production. Women experiencing spontaneous abortion have been observed to have lower plasma magnesium levels than healthy controls,241 and those expe- riencing associated stress regarding their fertility will benefit from both magnesium and B vitamin supplementation. Stress is associated with impaired fertility, including miscarriage and failed pregnancy outcomes.242


Women undergoing preconception care are encouraged to consume a diet rich in essential fatty acids (EFAs)221 because omega-3 fatty acids are required to maintain the lipid bilayer in all cell membranes and to serve as precursors for prostaglandin synthesis. Specifically, in the pre- vention of miscarriage, omega-3 fatty acids (4 g/day providing 795 mg of docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] and 1190 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]) have been found to improve the velocity of blood flow in the uterine arteries in women with recurrent miscarriage due to impaired uterine perfusion.243 Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids has been shown to improve endometrial function. In vitro studies of decidualized cells have identified a decrease in prostaglandin production by up to 80%, indicating that prescription is beneficial for all women but most importantly, those suffering from endometriosis or endometrial insufficiency.244 Additionally, supplementation is believed to assist in reducing spontaneous preterm births associated with intrauterine inflammation.245 In a North America cohort, women with the lowest intake of omega-3 fatty acids had lower fecundability than women with higher intakes.86 DHA has been associated with a reduced risk of anovulation in a cohort of healthy, regularly menstruating women.246 The role of EFAs in IVF treatment has received a little more atten- tion. A study of women undergoing IVF treatment found that omega-3 fatty acid intake has a beneficial effect on fertility. Women with a higher alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) intake had higher baseline estradiol levels, and ALA and DHA intake was associated with improved embryo mor- phology.247 A study investigating the associations between serum lev- els of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and embryo implantation in women undergoing IVF found that an increased ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 was more important than individual levels of PUFAs in increasing implantation and pregnancy rates.248 In overweight and obese women undergoing IVF in Australia, intake of PUFAs, specif- ically omega-6 PUFAs and linoleic acid and possibly omega-3, was associated with improved pregnancy rates; however, there was no association with live birth rates.249 A cohort study among 105 women undergoing IVF treatment in Iran found that serum levels of EPA were significantly higher in women who achieved pregnancy compared with those who did not.250


Alterations in the microflora of the vagina and subsequent genital and intrauterine infections251 have been linked to reproductive failure and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm labor, miscarriage, and spontaneous preterm birth.251–253 In one study, during the first half of pregnancy, women with altered vaginal flora of bacterial origin were four times more likely to have a spontaneous preterm birth compared with the overall preterm birth rate.254 Bacterial vaginosis is associated with ascending infections, which may lead to tubal factor infertility. Selected Lactobacillus strains are typically used for treating bacterial vaginosis because the human vagi- nal microbiota is a predominantly Lactobacillus community.255

## Actaea racemosa (Black Cohosh)

Actaea racemosa has historically been described by the eclectics as a uteroovarian tonic for “pains of a dull aching character; dragging pains in the womb, with sense of soreness; the dull tensive pains incident to reproductive disorders of the female, as well as the annoying pains accompanying pregnancy; false pains; after pains.”256 Its modern clin- ical application focuses heavily on mitigating menopausal complaints and regulating the estrogen cascade specifically in this life stage; how- ever, its potential benefits are far broader, and it shows promise in assisting fertility. In one trial, women with unexplained fertility who were not responding to clomiphene citrate were divided randomly into two groups, both of which received clomiphene. However, one group was also given 120 mg of A. racemosa on days 1 to 12 of the cycle. Results showed that pregnancy rates were higher in the A. racemosa plus clomiphene group compared with the group that received clomi- phene is isolation. The A. racemosa group had increased LH, progester- one, and estradiol, in addition to increased endometrial thickness.257 A subsequent trial of women with unexplained infertility who were undergoing clomiphene induction compared clomiphene citrate cycles with follicular-phase supplementation with A. racemosa (120 mg/day on days 1–12 of the cycle) or ethinyl estradiol. Results showed that A. racemosa supplementation improved endometrial thickness, follic- ular maturation, and estradiol levels. There was no statistically signif- icant difference in clinical pregnancy rates between the two treatment groups.258 Similar results were seen in a study of women with PCOS and infertility. Treatment with clomiphene citrate alone or clomiphene citrate combined with A. racemosa (120 mg/day) found that the A. rac- emose group had improved cycle outcomes and pregnancy rates.259

## Alchemilla vulgaris (Lady’s Mantle)

Unfortunately, there is little research on this valuable herb. Alchemilla vulgaris has a strong clinical and traditional use as a therapeutic astrin- gent, which makes it an effective prescription for patients experiencing menorrhagia or frequent early miscarriage. Its tannin content supports the antihemorrhagic property, and A. vulgaris has traditionally been prescribed to halt bleeding and heal wounds (internal or external).260 A. vulgaris is used to treat female reproductive problems, including men- strual disorders; to prevent miscarriage; and as an aid to conception.261

## Angelica sinensis (Dang Gui)

Angelica sinensis is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine with a gentle warming action. It is believed to nourish the blood, restore the body’s natural balance, and serve as a female tonic for a number of gynecolog- ical conditions, including amenorrhea. It appears to contain compo- nents that can increase uterine tone and relax the uterine musculature. The two active constituents most associated with this function include ligustilide262 (an essential oil component) and ferulic acid.263 Like many other herbal medicines, it is supported by a long history of use

and clinical efficacy. In the absence of human studies, animal exper- iments have demonstrated that compounds in A. sinensis also regu- late prostaglandin synthesis and can regulate experimentally induced inflammatory responses due to prostaglandin release.264 Additionally, thromboxane A2, which increases blood viscosity and promotes blood clotting, appears to be regulated by this herb.265 These mechanisms may explain its strong reputation as a blood tonic. A. sinensis is spe- cifically prescribed for women with compromised fertility who also have blood disorders, menorrhagia, and reproductive inflammatory responses such as those present in endometriosis. It is important to remember that the very process of fertilization and implantation is a marked inflammatory event, which may explain the efficacy of A. sinensis as an antimiscarriage herbal medicine serving to promote and sustain conception. A. sinensis is known to have spasmolytic effects on the uterus, specifically in the treatment of dysmenorrhea. It appears to normal- ize uterine activity and ease pelvic blood flow, which relieves pelvic congestion and pain. Traditionally it has been combined with Paeonia lactiflora266 and Ligusticum wallichii263 for menstrual pain that is aggra- vated by the cold. Modern herbalists extrapolate that usage to suggest that A. sinensis is a relaxing blood mover that can improve circulation to the uterus and thus assist in normalizing the endometrial lining and supporting implantation.

## Asparagus racemosus (Shatavari)

A. racemosus is an Ayurvedic botanical renowned for its effects on the female reproductive system; it has been used for this purpose since the 16th century. A. racemosus is believed to function as an aphro- disiac, promoting strength and enhancing sexual appetite while pre- venting miscarriage and supporting healthy fertility. The roots were traditionally boiled in milk and consumed with sugar owing to their ability to promote libido and to increase ojas (which can be likened to the naturopathic version of “vital force”). In Western herbal med- icine, Shatavari is primarily prescribed as a female reproductive herb; in animal studies, it has been observed to exert estrogenic effects.267 Unfortunately, few well-blinded human clinical studies are to be found in the literature; however, in Ayurveda, this herb has been used safely over long periods of time, even during pregnancy and lactation.268

## Chamaelirium luteum (False Unicorn Root)

An important herbal medicine for reproductive disorders, C. luteum is a restricted herb owing to its threatened status from excessive wild crafting. Therefore practitioners are encouraged to prescribe other herbal medicines containing similar steroidal saponins, such as Dioscorea villosa (wild yam) and to prescribe Chamaelirium luteum if the clinical objective is not achieved. Additionally, the combination of A. racemosus (Shatavari) and D. villosa (wild yam) may be an even bet- ter choice owing to the synergistic action of these herbs. C. luteum has a strong traditional application as an antimiscarriage herbal medicine. It is undoubtedly one of the most effective herbal medicines for this purpose. The rhizomes appear to function as a uter- ine tonic and, since the time of the eclectics, have been prescribed to remedy any imbalance or symptom in the female reproductive tract. King’s dispensatory documents the use of C. luteum for treating repeated and successive miscarriages, and Ellingwood269 highlights its use for uterine displacement, particularly where there is threatened abortion, saying that it should be combined with Viburnum pruni- folium to optimize this effect. It has a strong traditional application in the regulation of ovarian function and is particularly indicated to assist in the regulation of menstrual issues experienced in the first half of the cycle.270 Additionally, it is described as an ovarian amphoteric because of its ability to regulate and normalize ovarian function.270 Unfortunately, its precise mechanism of action is unknown; however, researchers have determined that it contains steroidal saponins, which are converted through digestion into the sapogenin diosgenin. This constituent has been shown to produce effects on ovarian function via its action on the hypothalamic–pituitary axis.

## Paeonia lactiflora (White Peony)

Paeonia lactiflora has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its effects on the female reproductive system. In Chinese medi- cine, P. lactiflora is used in a formulation known as Dang-Gui-Shao- Yao-San, a combination of medicinal herbs used for the treatment of ovulatory disorders and thus to promote a good fertility outcome. Another formulation, Unkei-to (a traditional Japanese herbal medi- cine consisting of Shakuyaku [Paeonia radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pallas] and Keihi [Cinnamomi cortex, Cinnamomum cassia Blume]) demon- strates stimulatory effects on the ovulatory process and human gran- ulosa cells in vitro.271 This formulation has been found to promote steroidogenesis, cytokine secretion, 17 beta-estradiol secretion, and progesterone secretion in highly luteinized granulosa cells obtained from IVF patients.

## Tribulus terrestris (Tribulus)

Tribulus terrestris is generally thought of as a male tonic; however, it is used extensively in Western herbal medicine for the treatment of female reproductive disorders, including infertility. A common clinical use of Tribulus involves its FSH-stimulating properties at the start of the menstrual cycle in initiating ovulation and improving conception rates. Most of the evidence for this claim, although clinically relevant, lacks research substantiation. In a clinical context, one can expect to see a marked increase in cervical fluid within a few days of taking the prescription. This increase precedes ovulation and supports conception outcome markedly. It is especially beneficial for patients who have delayed or absent ovulation because it regulates the ratio of follicle-stimulating hormone to lutein- izing hormone. Patients are generally more aware of their increased fertility, libido, and release of cervical fluid. This has a positive effect on their mood and confidence in their fertility. Most articles and documentation refer back to a poorly designed study by Tabakova et al.,272 who conducted a nonrandomized trial in 51 women with endocrine sterility to assess the effect of Tribestan (standardized Tribulus extract) on infertility. Although the results of this study were encouraging, larger studies of better design are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of Tribestan in treating female infertility. Subjects took Tribestan, 1 to 2 tablets (250 mg per tablet) by mouth three times daily, either on days 5 to 14 of the cycle (schedule I) or on days 1 to 12 of the cycle (schedule II) for the first 3 months. After a washout period, the patients were treated with Tribestan, 1 to 2 tab- lets by mouth three times daily days 1 to 12 of the cycle, plus either Stimovul, 1 to 2 tablets daily on days 5 to 14 of the cycle, or clomi- phene citrate 1 to 2 tablets daily on days 5 to 9 of the cycle. The authors found that 67% of the patients treated with Tribestan had normalized ovulation with or without pregnancy. Compared with other drugs, Tribestan was inferior to Stimovul alone. Of 36 patients, 20 went on to receive combination treatment.

## Vitex agnus castus (Chaste Tree)

Vitex agnus castus, one of the best-known adjuncts to fertility treat- ment, is beneficial for anovulatory cycles, hyperprolactinemia, hypo- thalamic dysfunction, hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian (HPO) axis modulation, and promoting a regular and normal menstrual cycle. It is well known for its beneficial effects in PMS, and numerous trials have been undertaken in multiple countries to evaluate its effectiveness. It

has been proved to alleviate symptoms associated with latent hyperpro- lactinemia, whereby it is characterized by lower-than-normal proges- terone secretion and normal to mildly elevated prolactin levels. These characteristics are believed to cause a number of menstrual disorders, including typical PMS symptoms, altered menstrual cycle lengths, and amenorrhea. Causative factors appear to relate to an alteration in the hypothalamic–pituitary axis. V. agnus castus has been shown to correct menstrual irregularities,273 including amenorrhea,274 specifically when caused by latent hyperprolactinemia, owing to its ability to inhibit pro- lactin secretion.275 This is achieved by competitively binding to dopa- mine D2 and opioid receptors, suggesting a dopaminergic effect.276 An uncontrolled study using a blend of V. agnus castus combined with green tea extract and nutrients (l-arginine; vitamins E, B 6 , and B 12 ; folate; as well as iron, magnesium, zinc, and selenium) admin- istered to 30 women who had been unsuccessful in their attempt to conceive despite trying for 6 to 36 months also observed beneficial results.277 After 5 months of treatment, 5 women out of 15 in the treat- ment group were pregnant (33% vs. 0%, P < 0.01). Four of the five women had healthy live births. A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of V. agnus castus compared with placebo was shown to improve hormone levels, facili- tate the recurrence of menstruation in women with amenorrhea, and ameliorate pregnancy outcome in women with fertility problems.278 Women were given a registered product called Mastodynon, and the results were impressive. In those with amenorrhea or luteal-phase insufficiency, pregnancy occurred in the active group more than twice as often as in the placebo group, with minimal side effects. Another study used a preparation containing V. agnus castus as well as other botanicals.279 Ninety-six women with secondary amenorrhea, luteal insufficiency, or idiopathic infertility received either the Vitex combination or placebo over three menstrual cycles. Of these women, 15 went on to conceive (7 with amenorrhea, 4 with idiopathic infertil- ity, and 4 with luteal insufficiency).

## General Measures

• Avoid exposure to free radicals. • Identify and eliminate exposure to environmental hazards, includ- ing pesticides, solvents, heavy metals, and other toxins • Use effective stress-reduction techniques and employ psychological counseling if needed.280,281 • Avoid cigarette smoking, alcohol, and recreational drugs • Avoid douches, vaginal sprays, scented tampons, or other femi- nine products that change the pH of the vagina and disturb vaginal microecology. • Ensure that weight is within a healthy body mass index (20%–25%). • Avoid medications that affect the quality of cervical fluid, including antihistamines, some cough mixtures, dicyclomine, progesterone (taken before or at ovulation), propantheline, tamoxifen, and oth- ers. • Avoid all personal lubricants (unless sperm-friendly types are cho- sen) because several studies show that some common lubricants kill sperm as effectively as contraceptive jellies do.282–294


• Encourage the principles of the fertility diet. • Avoid dietary sources of free radicals, saturated fats, hydrogenated oils, trans fatty acids, and cottonseed oil. • Increase consumption of good dietary sources of antioxidant vita- mins, carotenes, and flavonoids (dark vegetables and fruits) as well as essential fatty acids (nuts and seeds). • Follow the recommendation of daily consumption of 8 to 12 serv- ings of vegetables and 1 to 2 servings of fresh fruits. • Optimize protein intake from both vegetarian and organic animal sources. • Ensure that hydration requirements are met using a 30-mL/2.2-lb (1-kg) formula to calculate requirements individually and optimize hydration and renal function. • Eliminate caffeine, alcohol, sugar, and artificial substances (preser- vatives, colorings, additives). Artificial sweeteners have been found to be associated with unfavorable embryo development.295 Sugared beverages, independent of their caffeine content, are associated with lower oocyte and embryo quality in women undergoing IVF treatment.296 • Encourage sufficient essential fatty acid intake in the form of half a cup of raw nuts or seeds, cold-pressed oils, and sustainably farmed fish (from organic sources).


Supplementation is best achieved by incorporating the repletion model (as previously discussed). A comprehensive summary of all nutrients is listed in Table 184.6; however, an individualized prescription based on a thorough assessment is advisable to accurately determine the most essential supplements required.

aRetinol equivalents (REs) are now used: 1 mcg RE = 1 mcg retinol = 6 mcg beta-carotene = 12 mcg other carotenoids. Avoid during pregnancy. Ensure that prescription is based on need due to fat solubility and potential for placental transfer in second trimester. Monitor dose carefully. Alterna- tively, beta-carotene may be a more appropriate prescription. bPrescribe based on pathology results. cConsider prescription in instances of coagulation disorders. Monitor closely to ensure no drug interaction is present. dDose dependent on blood sugar level control and weight requirements. Calculate based on patient’s weight. eAvoid in instances of Wilson’s disease (assess before prescription) and ensure that prescription is recommended only when zinc:copper ratio is considered. fAssessment before prescription is essential to determine dose. Should only be conducted when thyroid function values can be reviewed. gPrescription must have pathology interpretation before recommendation to determine required dosage.

• A smooth, oval head that is 5 to μ m long and 2.5 to 3.5 μ m around (smaller than the point of a needle) • A well-defined cap (acrosome) that covers 40% to 70% of the sperm head • No visible defect of neck, midpiece, or tail • No fluid droplets in the sperm head that are bigger than half of the sperm head’s size7 If a sperm deviates from normal, it is defined by the terminology given in Table 185.1.

# SPERMATOGENESIS

In healthy young men, sperm are produced by repeated divisions of cells in small, coiled tubules within the testes at an average rate of approximately 100 million per day. Each spermatogenic cycle consists of six stages, and approximately five cycles are required to produce one mature sperm. From the beginning of the division of the stem cell to the appearance of mature sperm in the semen takes between 72 and days. Therefore anything that the male experiences during spermato- genesis can affect mature sperm regardless of his health at the time of examination. Factors to consider would include illness, toxicity, trauma, nutritional status, and others. The sperm spend 2 to 10 days passing through the epididymis, during which time they mature and become capable of swimming and penetrating oocytes. At the beginning of ejaculation, sperm are transported from the tail of the epididymis via the vas deferens to the urethra. The seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and Cowper’s glands secrete most of the volume of semen; these secretions help deliver the sperm during ejaculation. The volume of liquid com- ing from the two epididymides is less than 5% of the total semen volume. Approximately 60% of the semen volume comes from the seminal vesicles and 30% from the prostate gland. The average semen volume for healthy men ejaculating every 2 days is 3 mL; the average sperm concentration is 85 million/mL (more specifics are given later). During ejaculation, the sperm and prostatic fluid are usually ejected first, and the seminal vesicle fluid follows. The seminal vesicle fluid coagulates, giving the semen a lumpy, gel-like appearance. Liquefaction occurs after 20 minutes or so, when the gel disappears.

## Semen Analysis

In a fertility context, the semen analysis forms the primary basis of assessment. It provides the clinician with a snapshot of the male’s fer- tility and reflects his general health in the preceding 72 to 76 days. An individual’s semen quality can vary considerably between sam- ples, even in males with normal semen parameters. In interpreting the assessment, it is imperative that the clinician acknowledge the important fact that a diagnosis is not achieved until an abnormal- ity is confirmed by two separate investigations. As a result, at least two and occasionally three semen analyses are needed, each several weeks apart, to gain an accurate picture of an individual’s average semen quality. It is well recognized that sperm count can be adversely affected by illness, especially fevers, which may temporarily suppress sperm count in normal males for several months. In this case the semen analysis should, of course, be delayed. Additionally, general recommendations such as in-clinic collection (vs. at-home collec- tion), careful consideration of laboratory guidelines (abstinence tim- ing, lubricant usage), and the standard of the andrology laboratory facility must be considered in reviewing the results. Table 185.2 out- lines the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) guidelines for assess- ing a semen analysis. In 2010 the WHO released updated guidelines for semen analysis. The fourth edition (released in 1999, with a review in 2003) had pre- sented a more positive picture of male fertility. The 2010 guidelines suggest that, overall, male fertility is declining. (Note that all andrology laboratories have adopted the new guidelines. The greatest difference can be noted by reviewing morphology, owing to differing criteria and percentage scales.) A semen analysis can be conducted by a number of assessments, including the following: • General semen analysis (SA): To assess motility, morphology, con- centration, volume, appearance, and so forth • Sperm chromatin integrity test: To determine the level of DNA damage to sperm • Immunobead test: To assess for antibodies against sperm • Semen culture: To assess for infection • Retrograde ejaculatory testing: To assess for retrograde semen flow or obstruction if semen analysis yields an extremely low count • Trial wash: To assess sperm factors and determine whether IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is more appropriate, con- ducted before IVF and/or ICSI procedures • MESA/TESE/PESE (microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration/ testicular sperm extraction/percutaneous epididymal sperm aspira- tion): To extract sperm from the testicles by a specialized procedure when sperm count is low/absent or if ejaculation is not possible

## Male Reproductive Assessment

A thorough assessment of the male patient is crucial to accurately determine his general and fertility health. Some of these assessments may require referral to a fertility specialist, urologist, or endocrinolo- gist; however, thorough questioning should be conducted by the natu- ropath to elucidate a full history and assess causative or contributing factors. Tables 185.3 through 185.6 highlight the most relevant assess- ments required in a fertility workup.


When the clinician is presented with a male patient complaining of infertility, the first step is to determine whether he has been given a thorough, comprehensive assessment. Assessment results can help determine whether the issue can be effectively treated because genetic factors or overt physical impediments will require additional interventions. • Treatable conditions: One in eight infertile men has a treatable condition that can be overcome so that natural conception may become possible.

Data from World Health Organization. WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen, 5th ed. Geneva, Switzer- land: WHO; 2010, cited in Hechtman L. Clinical Naturopathic Medicine. Chatswood, Australia: Elsevier Australia, 2018. • Untreatable subfertility: Three quarters of infertile men have sperm present in the semen, but in lower numbers than normal. In these cases, the problem cannot be solved without intervention. These men are often defined as subfertile because pregnancies may occur but at lower rates than usual. On average, more months of trying are needed to achieve conception, or conception may simply not occur. After naturopathic intervention, it may be possible to address infer- tility factors or, alternatively, offer a referral for ARTs/IVF. • Untreatable male sterility: About one in nine infertile men has no sperm in his semen or testes and cannot be treated. Sperm-produc- ing cells in the testes either have not developed or have been irre- versibly destroyed. Adoption or donor insemination are the only possibilities for couples in this group who wish to have families. In treating males for infertility, the optimal approach is to adopt a preconception program for both prospective parents. Preconception treatment adheres to the philosophy that the final stages of gamete pro- duction can be modified and influenced. The final stages of spermato- genesis last between 72 and 76 days. By influencing the environment to which sperm are exposed and optimizing the general well-being of the host, practitioners may be able to influence sperm development positively and to address and deal with related health concerns. Of importance, acknowledging and addressing nutritional status throughout this developmental stage can significantly influence the prospective outcome. The concept of nutrient repletion is highly appli- cable within a fertility context. Optimal fertility is best achieved when prime health is realized. The repletion model indicates that prescrip- tions are required for a minimum of 3 months to properly address any deficiencies present and to ensure that all nutrients are used within each required pathway in the body. For example, zinc is involved in hundreds of pathways, including those that affect reproductive health and function. To rectify all possible deficiencies, sufficient zinc sup- plementation at a repletion dose (typically higher than in general pre- scriptions) for an extended time (at least 3 months) can enable optimal correction. At lower doses or doses of insufficient duration, zinc treat- ment may address only those health concerns that have the highest priority (i.e., immune function vs. sperm production). Within the naturopathic framework, it is crucial to naturally sup- port and attenuate all coexisting health conditions. Therefore treat- ment should be structured to acknowledge all health concerns; that is, to optimize the general health of the male patient as an underlying position. Finally, it is always important to acknowledge that the most favorable fertility occurs when the individual’s health is optimal. The body is primed to pass on genetic material only when the envi- ronment and other conditions are at their best. If survival from an evolutionary perspective is compromised, fertility will be hindered. Everything a person eats, drinks, experiences, or is exposed to can and will influence fertility. True naturopathic supports of fertility acknowledge and consider absolutely all variables of holistic health. Couples should be encouraged to participate in treatment for 3 to 4 months to properly address all genetic and epigenetic variables affecting the gamete.

## Improving Sperm-Controlling and Sperm-Damaging

## Factors

The first step in improving sperm counts, morphology, and function is controlling factors that can damage or impair sperm formation. These include the following: • Scrotal temperature • Estrogen and xenoestrogen exposure • Heavy metals • Radiation • Cigarettes, alcohol, and illicit drugs • Obesity • Infection • Diabetes

## Scrotal Temperature

The scrotal sac normally keeps the testes at a temperature of between 94°F and 96°F. At temperatures above 96°F, sperm production is greatly inhibited or stopped completely. Heat stress modifies gene expression in the testes, causing impaired spermatogenesis. Sperm cells, being extremely vulnerable, respond by apoptosis and DNA damage.8 Typically, the mean scrotal temperature of infertile men is significantly higher than that of fertile men. A reduction in the scrotal temperature in infertile men is often enough to make them fertile. This is best achieved by having them avoid tight-fitting underwear, tight jeans, and hot tubs. In addition, the following exercise or exercise equipment can raise scrotal temperature, especially if a man is wearing synthetic fabrics, exceptionally tight shorts, or tight bikini underwear: rowing machines, simulated cross-country ski machines, treadmills, and jogging. After exercising, a man should allow his testicles to hang free to allow them to recover from heat buildup.

## 1459CHAPTER 185 Infertility, Male

Infertile men should wear boxer-type underwear and periodically apply a cold shower or ice to the scrotum. They can also choose to use a device called a testicular hypothermia device or “testicle cooler” to reduce scrotal temperatures. The testicle cooler looks like a jock- strap from which long, thin tubes have been extended. The tubes are attached to a small fluid reservoir filled with cold water that attaches to a belt around the waist. The fluid reservoir is also a pump that causes the water to circulate. When the water reaches the surface of the scrotum, it evaporates and keeps the scrotum cool. Because of evaporation, the reservoir must be filled every 6 hours or so. It is recommended that the testicle cooler be worn daily during waking hours. Most users claim that it is fairly comfortable and easy to conceal.9 Increased scrotal temperature can be due to the presence of a vari- cocele. A large varicocele can lead to scrotal temperatures high enough to inhibit sperm production and motility. Surgical repair may be nec- essary, but scrotal cooling should be tried first.

## Estrogen and Xenoestrogen Exposure

According to experts on the effect of the environment and diet on fetal development, we now live in an environment that can be viewed as “a virtual sea of estrogens.”10,11 Increased exposure to environmental

## 1460SECTION 6 Diseases

estrogens and other environmental pollutants during fetal develop- ment as well as during the reproductive years is suggested to be a major cause of the tremendous rise in the incidence of disorders of develop- ment and function of the male sexual system12 (Box 185.1). One can best view the relationship between estrogens and male sexual development by examining the effects of the synthetic estro- gen diethylstilbestrol (DES). Between 1945 and 1971, several mil- lion women were treated with DES. By 1970, the side effects of DES became better known. DES is now recognized to have led to substantial increases in the number of men suffering from developmental prob- lems of the reproductive tract as well as decreased semen volume and sperm count.10 Apart from having been used in humans, DES and other synthetic estrogens were used for 20 to 30 years in the livestock industry to fatten the animals and make them grow faster. Although most synthetic estrogens like DES are now outlawed, many animals, both livestock and poultry, are still hormonally manip- ulated, especially dairy cows. Cow’s milk contains substantial amounts of estrogen because of modern farming techniques. The rise in dairy consumption since the 1940s inversely parallels the drop in sperm counts. Avoidance of hormone-fed animal products, including milk products, is important for male sexual vitality, especially in men with low sperm counts or low testosterone levels. There are reports that estrogens have been detected in drinking water.11,13 Presumably they are recycled from excreted synthetic estro- gens (birth control pills) at water treatment plants. These estrogens may be harmful to male sexual vitality because they are more potent— they do not bind to sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG). Purified or spring water may be a suitable option to prevent exposure. It is also important to ensure that bottled water is avoided owing to the bisphe- nol A content of plastic bottles. Other sources of estrogen in the environment (food, water, and air) can weaken male sexual vitality. For example, many of the chem- icals with which we have contaminated our environment in the past 50 years are weakly estrogenic. Most of these chemicals, like poly- chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxin, and dichlorodiphenyltrichlo- roethane (DDT), are resistant to biodegradation and are recycled in our environment until they find a safe haven in our bodies. For example, even though DDT has been banned for nearly 30 years, it is still often found in the soil and in root vegetables such as carrots and potatoes. These toxic chemicals are known to interfere with sper- matogenesis, but their effects during sexual development may be even more important. All of the estrogenic factors previously discussed are thought to have their greatest effect during fetal development. On the basis of animal studies, these estrogens inhibit the multiplication of the Sertoli cells. The number of Sertoli cells is directly proportional to the number of sperm that can be produced because each Sertoli cell can support only a fixed number of germ cells that will develop into sperm. Sertoli cell multiplication occurs primarily during fetal life and before puberty and is controlled by follicle-stimu- lating hormone (FSH). In animal studies, estrogens administered early in life have been found to inhibit FSH secretion, resulting in a reduced number of Sertoli cells and, in adult life, diminished sperm counts. One example of the impairment of male sexual development by environmental estrogens is the ability of vinclozolin, a fungicide used in the wine industry, to disrupt the fertility of male rats.14 Alarmingly, just one exposure of a pregnant female rat to this fungicide was found to disrupt spermatogenesis in more than 90% of the male offspring for at least four generations via an effect exclusively transmitted through the male germline. Environmental toxins are also linked to increasing testicular can- cer rates, testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS), cryptorchidism, and hypospadias.6,15 Whether the outcome is impaired spermatogenesis, TDS, testicular cancer, or any other disturbance may depend on the timing and nature of the xenobiotic attack and the genetic background on which these factors are acting. As such, a determination of the outcome will have to take into account the patient’s polymorphism profile for proteins involved in detoxification, such as the cytochrome P450s and glutathione-S-transferases. The bottom line is that the environmental effect on spermatogenesis cannot be underestimated. Industrial growth since the end of World War II has introduced many complex chemicals into the environment that are novel to biologi- cal detoxification systems. Some of these molecules are reproductive toxicants, capable of impairing fertility and inducing developmen- tal abnormalities in the embryo, including errors in normal sexual differentiation. The power of reproductive toxicants that target the germline lies in their capacity to generate damage that can be passed down the gener- ations via genetic or epigenetic means. A prime example is the effect of paternal smoking. Men who smoke heavily generate spermatozoa that may have high levels of DNA damage, largely as a result of oxi- dative stress. One of the consequences of this DNA damage is that the children of such men exhibit an increased incidence of childhood can- cer.16 Although we have traditionally focused on the ability of cigarette smoke to induce lung cancer, a far more sinister effect is its ability to induce DNA damage in the germline and thereby influence the health and well-being of future generations. It is therefore advisable to discourage exposure to cigarette smoke in all male fertility patients and, in those with suspected heavy expo- sure, to initiate further investigations and specialized treatments to chelate and support detoxification.

## Exposure Route

Environmental toxins may exert their genetic or epigenetic effects on the germline via several potential routes of exposure: 1. Women may be exposed to xenobiotics during pregnancy, thereby disrupting the normal differentiation of the germline in the fetus. 2. Women exposed to toxicants may transmit xenobiotics to their off- spring via breast milk. 3. Because of acquired toxicity, men may contribute adverse effects on the integrity of DNA in the male germline. Toxicological studies in animal models reporting infertility, abortion, and birth defects as a result of male exposure to xenobiotics demonstrate that such asso- ciations are possible.17 Epidemiological studies suggest that they are clinically significant.6,15 For a full discussion of potential environmental effects, see Chapter 35, Environmental Medicine.

## Assessment

It is advisable to thoroughly assess all presenting patients for exposure to environmental toxins and, depending on the results, to offer appro- priate treatment. Specific areas to consider include the following: 1. Full occupational exposure review 2. Nonoccupational exposure • The area in which the couple lives • Age of the couple’s home • Ages of carpet, floor coverings, floorboards • Renovations—when, what, and how • Type of heating/air conditioning • Use of indoor or outdoor pesticides • Attached garage • Blinds, curtains • Cleaning products • Pool/spa/sauna • Pets—type, medicines, foods • Food sources • Water source • Prescription drugs • Others It is best to recommend the avoidance of other exposures, such as those from renovation materials, cleaning products, personal toiletries, new furniture, new carpet or cabinets, plastics, gas, chemical gases, and many others. Organic, environmentally sound, sustainable practices are generally the safest. For men who work in occupations that may affect fertility, it is important to wear protective clothing and follow all occupational health and safety guidelines. Persistent organic pollutants, phthalates, and PCB serum levels in males have been associated with reductions of up to 30% in fecundity in couples trying to conceive.18 An unexpected source of exposure to phthal- ates is via prescription medications, where phthalates and polymers are used as excipients to enable the timed release of active ingredients. A recent Danish case-control study included more than 18,500 males with poor semen quality, and more than 31,000 controls, from the Danish IVF Register over a 10-year period. Exposure to medicinal products containing ortho-phthalates and/or polymers within 90 days of testing was associated with a 30% and 71% increased risk of poor semen quality, respectively. The highest association was found in exposure to polymers from bisacodyl and sulfasalazine, alimentary tract and metabolism drugs.19

## Heavy Metals

Sperm are also particularly susceptible to the damaging effects of heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, arsenic, and mercury.12,20,21 The results of a recent meta-analysis of 20 case-control studies indicate that men with low fertility have higher semen levels of lead and cadmium and lower semen zinc levels. Lead and cadmium have a direct toxic effect on the testis and also inhibit the formation of sperm and induce sperm morphology changes, leading to a decline in the quality and quantity of semen.22 A hair mineral analysis for heavy metals should be performed on all men with reduced sperm counts to rule out heavy metals as a cause.

## Radiation

Cell phones operate at 400- and 2000-MHz frequency bands and emit radiofrequency electromagnetic waves (EMWs).23 Cordless phones must be considered in this context as well; these use the 900-MHz, 1.9-GHz, 2.4-GHz, and 5.8-GHz bands. Reports of potential adverse effects of radiofrequency EMWs on the brain, heart, endocrine system, and DNA in humans and animals are commonly found in the litera- ture. Specifically, from a fertility context, they have also been impli- cated in DNA strand breaks.24 The relationship between cell phone use and male infertility remains unclear. Harmful EMWs emitted from cell phones may interfere with normal spermatogenesis and result in a significant decrease in sperm quality. Specific findings pertaining to sperm motility in humans have also been noted.25,26 In one observational study,27 the use of cell phones decreased semen quality by decreasing the sperm count as well as the sperms’ motility, via- bility, and normal morphology. This decrease in sperm parameters was dependent on the duration of daily exposure to cell phones and inde- pendent of initial semen quality. Of greatest importance was that sperm count, viability, and morphology declined as cell phone use increased. Specifically, the use of a cell phone for more than 4 hours a day caused a 25% drop in the number of sperm produced, and only 20% of these looked normal. These results were not supported in a longitudinal cohort study of 153 men attending a fertility clinic. Results were inconsistent between different patterns of cell-phone usage, and overall, no evidence was found for a relationship between cell phone use and semen quality.28 By comparison, a retrospective analysis of 468 men at a fertility clinic found that cell-phone storage in trouser pockets had an effect on sperm morphology and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels. Cell-phone storage in pockets was also significantly associated with increased varicocele, which in turn have an effect on sperm concentration and testosterone levels.29 A 2014 meta-analysis reported a statistically significant decrease in sperm motility with mobile phone use, but no relationship with sperm concentration.30 A second meta-analysis reported that mobile-phone use in epidemiological studies was not related to semen volume, motility, sperm concentration, or normal morphology. However, mobile-phone EMW was related to significant decreases in sperm motility in in vitro studies as well as decreases in motility and concentration in animal studies.31 The authors of both of these meta-analyses, despite inconsistent results from a small of num- ber studies, concluded that mobile-phone use may negatively affect semen quality. Studies have also shown a negative correlation between wireless Internet usage duration and the total sperm count. Wi-Fi was shown to have a more destructive effect than cell-phone use.32 A recent in vitro study found that the effects of EMWs emitted from 3G+ Wi-Fi modems cause a significant decrease in sperm motility and velocity.33 It is therefore prudent to encourage limiting Wi-Fi use and expo- sure and discourage cell-phone use. It is recommended that male patients refrain as much as possible from storing cell phones in their pockets, owing to increased genital exposure to the frequency bands.

## Cigarettes, Alcohol, Caffeine, and Illicit Drugs

Lifestyle exposures, including cigarette smoke, alcohol, and caffeine, have all been studied in relation to male reproductive health. Over the years, the focus has primarily been on semen quality and/or fertility.

## 1462SECTION 6 Diseases

More recently, the literature evaluating direct adverse effects of lifestyle exposures on sperm, chromosomes, and chromatin has grown because of concern that induced damage could be transmitted to offspring, causing transgenerational health effects.

## Cigarette smoking. A common source of oxidants is cigarette

smoking, which is associated with decreased sperm counts and sperm motility as well as a higher frequency of abnormal sperm.34 Cigarette smoking, as well as the increase in environmental pollution, is thought to be a major contributor to the diminution in sperm counts seen in many industrialized nations over the past few decades. Although passive and active smoking are known to lead to a num- ber of health concerns, male patients are often complacent about its effect. However, heavy smokers have been shown to produce more than 20% less sperm. Tobacco smoke contains high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause DNA damage. The cadmium, lead, and nicotine in cigarettes also cause DNA strand breaks.35 Cigarette smoking accelerates DNA damage of the sperm, and smoking cessa- tion is the quickest treatment strategy to reverse such damage and thus affect sperm morphology parameters positively. Stopping smoking for 3 months allows sperm quality to improve.36 When the sperm enters the oocyte during conception, the mRNA within the oocyte attempts to defragment the DNA and provide anti- oxidant support so as to improve sperm quality. It is important to note that the improvements to sperm occur before any oocyte maintenance. It is only once the sperm has been positively addressed that the mRNA and any antioxidant potential within the oocyte can address any oocyte deficiency, oxidative process, or DNA (or chromosomal) abnormality. When the male partner is a heavy smoker, it often means that there are simply insufficient reserves to repair the damage for both gametes; as a result, the oocyte fails, causing either fertilization deficits, a lack of implantation, or abnormalities in the embryo, thus initiating an early miscarriage or negative effects on the long-term health and fertility of the subsequent child.37 The female’s surveillance does not typically allow the compromised embryo to grow beyond early miscarriage because the chance of a healthy birth is then unlikely. Therefore this highly pertinent clinical discussion can motivate most male patients to take responsibil- ity for their oxidative processes and commit to smoking cessation. A systematic Cochrane review found that in both fertile and infertile populations, active and passive smoking are associated with reduced fertility and a decreased chance of producing a healthy, live infant. In males, cigarette smoking has been observed to impair sperm respira- tion, thus affecting the sperms’ mitochondrial function38 as well as caus- ing a reduction in sperm motility and semen quality.39 Reproductive hormone system disorders, dysfunction of spermatogenesis and the sperm maturation process, and impaired spermatozoa function have been observed in smokers. Tobacco smoking leads to reduced semen quality, including semen volume, sperm density, motility, viability, DNA fragmentation, seminal zinc levels, and normal morphology. The effects are directly correlated with cigarette quantity and duration of smoking.40,41 A systematic review and meta-analysis (n = 5865 men) on the effects of cigarette smoking suggested an overall negative effect on semen parameters. An association was seen with reduced sperm count and motility, and the effect is greater in moderate and heavy smokers.42 It is therefore strongly recommended that all males cease both pas- sive and active smoking for at least the preconception period and ide- ally beyond it.

## Alcohol intake. Excessive alcohol consumption in men is strongly

associated with diminished sperm function; however, there is a scarcity of comprehensive research in this area. The limited available data suggest that moderate or occasional alcohol intake does not affect semen quality as do regular high levels of consumption.43–45 A review of the literature in 2013 suggests that alcohol consumption alters sperm parameters (most commonly morphologically abnormal spermatozoa) and testicular pathology. It is noted that genetic factors, as well as nutritional deficiencies, may modulate the effect of alcohol on spermatogenesis.43 More recently, a cross-sectional study of 8344 healthy men in Europe and the United States found that moderate alcohol intake was not associated with a reduction in semen quality. However, this study only looked at alcohol consumed the week before the semen testing, which does not account for the long-term effects of alcohol consump- tion.44 Another study of 347 men investigating the effect of the last days’ worth of alcohol intake found that alcohol intake was associated with impairment of most semen characteristics. There was a tendency toward lower semen parameters with higher intake of alcohol, but no statistically significant dose-response association was found.45 Without further rigorous studies, the best available evidence suggests that alco- hol intake and fertility are linked only with high levels of consump- tion (more than 8 drinks per week, or more than 40 g alcohol per day, depending on the study).46 A recent review of 15 cross-sectional studies has shown a detrimen- tal effect of alcohol consumption on semen volume and morphology, mainly in daily, not occasional, consumers. This suggests that moder- ate consumption of alcohol should not adversely affect semen quality parameter.47 As with smoking, abstaining from alcohol reverses semen parameter damage. A case report of a 6-year follow-up of a male patient showed that stopping alcohol consumption led to a rapid, dra- matic improvement in semen characteristics. Normal semen parame- ters were observed after 3 months.48 From a naturopathic viewpoint, however, it is important to encour- age avoidance for a number of reasons, including effects on the liver and detoxification as well as on endocrinology (especially estrogen path- ways), calorie consumption, hyperglycemic effects, and others. It is pru- dent to recommend alcohol avoidance in the preconception period so as to ensure optimal functioning of the male body and subsequent positive effects on sperm parameters. It is of prime importance to recommend abstinence from binge drinking and regular heavy drinking.

## Caffeine. High dosages of caffeine have been shown in vitro

to increase protein oxidative damage in Sertoli cells, but moderate caffeine intake appears to be safe in male reproductive health. Although caffeine intake boosts semen volume, it also lowers the concentration.49,50 Caffeine intake of less than 800 mg/day does not appear to affect motility, morphology, or DNA fragmentation.51 A recent systematic review of the relationship between caffeine and parameters of male fertility found that caffeine intake may nega- tively affect male reproductive function; however, the data to date are inconsistent and inconclusive.52 An observational study on the effects of caffeine and alcohol on men at a fertility clinic found no associa- tion between caffeine or alcohol intake on semen parameters; however, pretreatment caffeine and alcohol intake did affect live birth outcome after infertility treatment with ART. Caffeine intake was associated with a lower probability of achieving live birth; however, alcohol intake was related to a higher probability of live birth. Alcohol intake was assessed on reported drinking habits over 1 year; therefore the effect of acute alcohol intake preceding ART was not assessed.53

## Marijuana and other recreational drugs. The effects of

marijuana and other recreational drugs are difficult to determine because their use is illegal; however, the illicit drugs that have been found to adversely affect male fertility are marijuana, opioid narcotics, methamphetamines, cocaine, and anabolic-androgenic steroids.54,55 The use of such drugs generally should be discouraged, particularly because they have well-documented harmful effects on the developing fetus.56

## 1463CHAPTER 185 Infertility, Male

A known fertility toxicant, marijuana contains constituents known as cannabinoids, which have been shown to impair signaling path- ways, alter hormonal regulation, and complicate timing issues during embryo implantation.57 In males, cannabinoids have been found to inhibit the mitochondrial respiration of sperm,58 reduce testosterone production,57 decrease sperm motility, compromise sperm morphol- ogy, and decrease sperm function, specifically capacitation and acro- some reactions.59 In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that cannabis may dis- rupt the hypothalamus–pituitary–gonadal axis, spermatogenesis, and sperm function (motility, capacitation, acrosome reaction).60 Consuming cannabis several times per week for 5 years results in a reduction in the volume and number of spermatozoa and changes sperm morphology and motility, reducing their fertilization capacity.61

## Obesity, Weight Loss, and Exercise

Obese men are known to have lower sperm counts (up to 50%), reduced sperm motility, reduced spermatogenesis, increased DNA fragmentation in sperm, and increased levels of erectile dysfunction.62 A meta-analysis of 21 studies demonstrated an increased risk of DNA fragmentation and azoospermia or oligozoospermia in overweight or obese males.63 Obesity can alter the physical and molecular structure of germ cells in the testes and ultimately affect the mature sperm.64,65 Obesity induces a state of inflammation, and proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α ) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are increased in the serum, testicular tissue, and seminal plasma of obese males. In the testes, proinflammatory cytokines can directly impair the seminiferous epithelium. A proinflammatory state can also damage epididymal epithelium function, impeding sperm maturation and fer- tilization ability.66 Obesity also causes oxidative stress due to the excess of ROS, which causes damage to DNA and plasma membrane integrity in sperm.67 Additionally, extra-abdominal weight can increase scrotal tempera- ture. Hormonal changes are primarily responsible for such changes in obese men. The levels of total and free testosterone are reduced in obese men in proportion to the level of obesity. Estrogen is increased owing to the peripheral aromatization of androgens in adipose tissue. The estrogens produced have a negative-feedback effect on gonadotro- pin production, thereby reducing FSH. This reduction in FSH further reduces testosterone production and spermatogenesis. Additionally, increased body fat and a sedentary lifestyle are associated with raised testicular temperature, which further adversely affects spermatogen- esis.62 Obesity has been shown to affect semen parameters, including decreased sperm concentration, decreased sperm motility and vital- ity, and increased abnormal morphology.67–70 Similarly, it was found that being underweight also had a negative effect on sperm quality. Maintaining an adequate or normal body weight is an important factor for male fertility,71 and weight loss in obese men can increase sperm count and normal sperm morphology.72 Regular physical activity has beneficial effects on sperm parameters, as demonstrated in a cross-sectional study of 32 men that found a sig- nificant enhancement in semen volume, viability, motility, and mor- phology in the physically active men compared with sedentary men.73 A study of 419 sedentary men attending a fertility clinic found that moderate aerobic exercise training for 24 weeks favorably improved sem- inal markers of inflammation and oxidative stress and enhanced anti- oxidant defense system. This correlated with improvements in semen parameters, sperm DNA integrity, and pregnancy rate. Improvements were seen after 12 weeks of the trial.74 These results are supported by additional studies showing that in healthy men, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise training can induce significant improvements in semen parameters and sperm DNA integrity, mainly through adaptations in the seminal antioxidant defense system and attenuating seminal mark- ers of inflammation.75–78 It should be noted that prolonged intensive exercise and training may lead to alterations in reproductive hormone levels; atrophy of the testicular germinal epithelium and adverse effects on spermatogenesis; and changes in semen parameters, including abnormal sperm morphology and reduced sperm motility.77

## Sedentary Lifestyle

A study of 189 young men found that sperm concentration and total sperm count were directly related to physical activity. Measurement of physical and leisure time activities was not related to sperm motility and morphology in this study; however, TV watching has been inversely associated with sperm concentration and sperm count.79 In another small study (n = 31) of healthy males, it was found that physically active men have a more anabolic hormonal environment and health- ier semen production compared with their sedentary counterparts.80 Physical activity also helps maintain a healthy weight: body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference are associated with a decrease in total sperm count and ejaculate volume.81

## Infections and Infertility

Infections in the male genitourinary tract—including infections of the epididymis, seminal vesicles, prostate, bladder, and urethra—are thought to play a major role in many cases of infertility.82 The exact extent of this role is largely unknown because of the lack of suitable diagnostic criteria coupled with the asymptomatic nature of many infections. The presence of antisperm antibodies or high levels of debris in the semen sample is considered to be a good indicator of chronic infection in the absence of other clinical findings. A wide number of bacteria, viruses, and other organisms can infect the male genitourinary system. Table 185.6 offers a list of the more common potential causative agents.

# DIETARY CONSIDERATIONS

A single sperm comprises the key nutritional ingredients (Fig. 185.1). The dietary guidelines in Chapter 44 provide sound guidance for improving fertility. In particular, it is important to eat the right types of fats. Surrounding the entire sperm is a “shield” of essential fatty acids protecting its structure, enabling continuity of movement, and safeguarding the integrity of the precious genetic material within. The male’s dietary intake must be assessed so as to ensure that all trans, rancid, and oxidized fats and excessive saturated fats are avoided. High intakes of saturated fats are negatively associated with sperm count and sperm concentration.83–85 It is recommended to prescribe sufficient essential fatty acids from both supplemental and dietary sources. The presence of essential fatty acids ensures that sperm are kept fluid and flexible, which regulates the acrosome reaction, sperm-oocyte fusion, and sperm-oocyte fertilization.86 Because of the effects of fats and oils on agglutination and cell-mem- brane dynamics, certain fats are best avoided in infertile men, and con- sumption of others should be increased. Hydrogenated oils, trans fatty acids, and cotton oils should be avoided. Trans fats are unable to be endogenously synthesized, and excessive consumption contributes to fat accumulation in the testicular environment,87 and trans-fat intake has been shown to be inversely related to sperm count and testicular volume.88,89 Cottonseed is especially problematic because it may con- tain toxic residues as a result of the heavy spraying of cotton and its high levels of gossypol, a substance known to inhibit sperm function. In fact, gossypol is being investigated for possible use in a “male birth control pill.” Its potential as an antifertility agent became known after

## 1464SECTION 6 Diseases

studies demonstrated that men who had used crude cottonseed oil for cooking had low sperm counts followed by total testicular failure.90 Excessive consumption of long-chain saturated fats from meat should also be avoided; these, combined with an inadequate intake of essential fatty acids, can change the fatty acid composition of the sperm mem- branes, thus reducing fluidity and interfering with sperm motility. The patient must be taught to read food labels carefully and avoid all sources of cottonseed oil and other damaging oils. To promote proper sperm membrane function, it is important to supplement with the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil because studies have shown that sperm motility and morphology strongly correlate with levels of omega-3 fatty acids, in particular, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the sperm membrane.83,91 One paper noted that excessive omega-6 compared with omega-3 fatty acids in seminal fluid decreased sperm concentration, sperm motility, and sperm morphology among patients with idiopathic oligoasthenotera- tozoospermia.92 It is therefore advisable to encourage omega-3 sources as a preference and to restrict the use of popular omega-6 cooking oils, such as soy, corn, and safflower. Supplemental goals should be to pre- scribe an optimal dose of 1000 to 2000 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)+DHA daily, with additional dietary recommendations such as raw nuts and seeds; cold-pressed monounsaturated oils like olive, canola, and macadamia nut oils; avocados; and wild and sustainably farmed fish containing high essential fatty acids (EFAs). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of men with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratospermia (n = 238), it was shown that 1.84 g/day of omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA) over 32 weeks resulted in a significant improvement of sperm cell total count and sperm cell concentration in the omega-3 groups compared with placebo.93 An RCT of 57 men found that supplementation with DHA-enriched oil (990 mg of DHA and 135 mg of EPA per day) over a 10-week period resulted in a significant decrease in sperm DNA frag- mentation compared with placebo. No significant effect was found on semen parameters.94 Walnuts contain EFAs and are also a good source of antioxidants in the diet, and a study has shown that 75 g of walnuts per day for 3 months improved sperm vitality, motility, and morphol- ogy in a group of healthy men consuming a Western-style diet.95 Adequate dietary protein is also an important consideration. The entire sperm is dependent on the protein status of the male. Insufficient protein in the diet undermines the quality of the sperm, reflected pri- marily in their morphology but undoubtedly also in their inability to move adequately and in the right direction (motility). Similar to the rest of the body, if protein needs are not met, deterioration of bodily pro- cesses and structures can eventuate. It is crucial to thoroughly assess the protein levels of all male patients both in laboratory assessments (total protein status) and through dietary calculation. The standard calcula- tion of 0.8 to 1.2 g protein per 2.2 lb (1 kg) body weight is a positive general rule; 0.8 g protein is best for more sedentary patients, and 1.2 g protein is more appropriate for more active types. For example, an active patient weighing 176 lb (80 kg) should be prescribed 96 g pure protein per day, ideally from a variety of sources. The quality of the pro- tein is also important. A high intake of processed meats is associated with fewer morphologically normal sperm compared with a low intake. It’s also associated with a higher risk of asthenozoospermia. Fish intake is related to higher sperm count and morphologically normal sperm.96,97 Hydration must also be optimized. Sperm are manufactured and spend time within semen. On reviewing the nutritional components of semen, it becomes clear that it is a by-product of the body, as is urine or feces. Therefore, if a male is dehydrated, it is understandable that the resultant coagulation of semen will increase, and exposure to toxin and by-products from eliminatory channels will occur. Thus optimal hydration can dilute semen, reduce sperm exposure, and improve motility considerably. Calculating a male’s hydration requirements is best achieved using a 30-mL/2.2-lb (1-kg) rule; that is, for a 176-lb (80- kg) patient, minimal hydration requirements would be 2.4 L per day, with additional intake required for dehydration, exercise, and alcohol or caffeine intake. A recent review of observational studies concluded that adherence to a healthy diet (e.g., the Mediterranean diet pattern and diets char- acterized by higher intakes of seafood, poultry, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables in non-Mediterranean countries) has been consistently associated with better semen parameters in a wide range of studies in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia.98–100 It has been shown that following a diet characterized by higher intakes of EFAs + E surround the sperm Protein required for entire structure Tail [Se]

legumes, vegetables, cereals, fruits, and olive oil and low intakes of dairy, mayonnaise, margarines, sauces, snacks, and sweets was associ- ated with semen quality—particularly sperm concentration and pro- gressive motility—among men from couples planning pregnancy.101 A study in men with asthenozoospermia showed an association between following a dietary nutrient intake pattern comprising mainly antioxi- dants, vitamin D, fiber, and polyunsaturated fatty acids with a signifi- cantly lower risk of asthenozoospermia.102

## Antioxidants

A 2014 Cochrane review103 assessed the effect of antioxidants on male subfertility by reviewing 48 trials and 4179 subfertile men. Of impor- tance, the authors concluded that there is sufficient evidence to prove that antioxidant supplementation in subfertile males improves the outcomes of live births and pregnancy rates for subfertile couples undergoing ART cycles. Other reviews found an improvement in sperm quality (predomi- nantly motility, but including concentration and morphology), along with increased pregnancy rates, after antioxidant supplementation. Significant reductions in measures of sperm oxidative stress and DNA damage were found in 95% of the studies after oral antioxidant treatment.104–106 A study found that combined antioxidant therapy consisting of vitamin C (80 mg/day), vitamin E (40 mg/day) and coenzyme Q 10 CoQ 10 (120 mg/day) administered over a period 6 months in men with oligoasthenozoospermia (n = 169) resulted in significant improvements in sperm concentration and motility.107 Similarly, combination therapy with L-carnitine (440 mg), CoQ 10 (ubiquinol mg), vitamin E (75IU), and vitamin C (12 mg), two or three times per day, for 3 to 6 months improved sperm concentration in infertile men.108 A study of 120 men with idiopathic infertility showed that supplementation with NAC (600 mg/day) for 3 months resulted in improvements in semen volume, motility, and viscosity. Serum anti- oxidant capacity was increased, and the total peroxide and oxidative stress index were lower.109 A clinical trial on the effects of curcumin in infertile men found that supplementation with curcumin (80 mg/ day) over 10 weeks resulted in statistically significant improvements in semen parameters and total antioxidant capacity, compared with placebo.110 In greater detail, important points in these reports include the following: • Antioxidant use was associated with a statistically significant increased pregnancy rate compared with control (pooled odds ratio [OR] 4.18, 95%; confidence interval [CI] 2.65–6.59; P < 0.00001). • No studies reported evidence of harmful side effects of the antioxi- dant therapy used. • One man in 20 will be affected by subfertility, and 3% to 80% of male-factor subfertility is believed to be due to oxidative stress.111 • Subfertile men are confirmed to have lower levels of antioxidants in their semen than fertile men.111,112 • Levels of ROS are significantly higher in infertile sperm samples compared with others from healthy controls; 25% to 80% of infer- tile men present with elevated ROS in the semen.113 • ROS cause fertility problems by a. Damaging the sperm membrane, which contains high levels of unsaturated fatty acids, which are susceptible to oxidation, thus affecting sperm motility and the ability of spermatozoa to break down the oocyte membrane (zona pellucida). Damage to the sperm membrane leads to loss of membrane integrity, increased permeability, and structural DNA damage.112,113 b. Altering sperm DNA: the integrity of sperm DNA is one of the major determinants of normal fertilization and embryo growth in natural and assisted conception. All antioxidants are concentrated in the head of the sperm to vary- ing degrees. The general recommendation is to encourage the prescrip- tion of combination products to ensure that the greatest antioxidant potential is achieved. Antioxidants are responsible for protecting the DNA within the head of the sperm and reducing the workload of the mRNA in the eventual oocyte. By optimizing oxidant status, the sur- vival and longevity of the sperm are also promoted, and the sperm is enabled to detect signals from the recently ovulated oocyte. A reduc- tion in antioxidants is likely to present specifically as high DNA dam- age or poor morphology. However, individual antioxidants such as zinc are responsible for regulating hormone status and thus sperm count; therefore all must be considered in a holistic infertility treat- ment protocol. Free-radical or oxidative damage to sperm is thought to be respon- sible for many cases of male infertility, high levels of free radicals having been found in the semen of approximately 40% of infertile men.114–116 The following three factors combine to render sperm particularly sus- ceptible to damage by free radicals: • A high membrane concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PFAs) • Active generation of free radicals • A lack of defensive enzymes All of these factors combine to make the health of the sperm critically dependent on antioxidants. Although most free radicals are produced during normal metabolic processes, the environment contributes greatly to the free-radical load. Men exposed to higher levels of free radicals are much more likely to have abnormal sperm and sperm counts.114–116 Antioxidants are required to protect sperm against oxidative damage (which may alter DNA) as well as to insti- gate cellular repair of damage caused by environmental factors or aging. In the healthy male, the seminal plasma is naturally rich in antioxidants because sperm are highly susceptible to the effects of ROS. Sperm are extremely sensitive to free radicals because they depend so much on the integrity and fluidity of their cell membranes for proper function. Without proper membrane fluidity, enzymes are acti- vated, possibly leading to impaired motility, abnormal structure, loss of viability, and ultimately death of the sperm. The major determinant of membrane fluidity is the concentration of PFAs, particularly omega-3 fatty acids like DHA, which are highly susceptible to free-radical damage. The sperm have a relative lack of superoxide dismutase and catalase, which can prevent or repair oxi- dative damage. Adding to this more susceptible state is the fact that sperm generate large quantities of free radicals to help break down bar- riers to fertilization.


Vitamin C improves all semen parameters. A marginal deficiency causes oxidative damage to sperm, resulting in reduced sperm motility and viability. Supplementation leads to improvement in both viabil- ity and motility, reduced numbers of abnormal sperm, and reduced sperm agglutination.117,118 The generation of ROS and associated links with infertility have been established and extensively studied. In particular, the effects of increased ROS in the serum, semen, and testicular tissues have been considered. Alterations in the testicular microenvironment and hemo- dynamics can increase the production of ROS and/or decrease local antioxidant capacity, resulting in the generation of excessive oxygen species.

## 1466SECTION 6 Diseases

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), a major antioxidant present in extra- cellular fluid, is present at a high concentration in seminal fluid com- pared with blood plasma (364 vs. 40 mM) and is present in detectable amounts in sperm,119 where it prevents sperm agglutination and oxi- dative damage. In infertile men, vitamin C has been found in reduced quantity in the seminal plasma.120,121 Males with inadequate seminal vitamin C have also been observed to suffer from sperm DNA dam- age,120 suggesting that a defect or inadequate intake of vitamin C may prompt ROS to cause breakage and oxidation of sperm DNA. When dietary vitamin C was reduced from 250 to 5 mg/day in healthy human subjects, the ascorbic acid content in seminal fluid decreased by 50%, and the number of sperm with damage to their DNA rose by 91%.122 These results indicate that dietary vitamin C plays a crit- ical role in protecting against sperm damage and that low dietary vita- min C levels were likely to lead to infertility. A study examining vitamin C as an adjunct therapy for men after undergoing varicocelectomy (n = 115) showed that 3 months of daily vitamin C supplementation (500 mg/day) resulted in a significant improvement in sperm motility and morphology in the treatment group compared with placebo.123 Another study has shown that supplementation with 1000 mg vitamin C per day for 6 months resulted in improvements in sperm concentration and motility in fertile but obese men. There was no change in semen volume or percentage of normal sperm morphology in the study.124 It is now well documented that cigarette smoking greatly reduces vitamin C levels throughout the body, and it is proved that smokers require at least twice as much vitamin C as nonsmokers. In one study, men who smoked one pack of cigarettes a day received either 0, 200, or 1000 mg of vitamin C. After 1 month, sperm quality improved in proportion to the level of vitamin C supplementation.125 Nonsmokers appear to benefit from vitamin C as much as do smokers. In one study, 30 infertile but otherwise healthy men received either 200 or 1000 mg of vitamin C or placebo daily.126 Sperm count, viability, motility, agglu- tination, abnormalities, and immaturity were measured weekly. After 1 week, the 1000-mg group demonstrated a 140% increase in sperm count, the 200-mg group a 112% increase, and the placebo group no change. After 3 weeks, both vitamin C groups continued to improve, with the 200-mg group catching up to the improvement of the 1000- mg group. One of the key improvements was observed in the number of agglutinated sperm. Sperm become agglutinated when antibodies produced by the immune system bind to them. Antibodies to sperm are often associated with chronic genitourinary tract or prostatic infec- tion. When more than 25% of the sperm are agglutinated, fertility is very unlikely. At the beginning of the study, all three groups had more than 25% agglutinated sperm. After 3 weeks, the proportion of agglu- tinated sperm in the vitamin C groups dropped to 11%. Although this result is significant, the most impressive result of the study was that at the end of 60 days, several men in both of the vitamin C groups had impregnated their wives, compared with none in the placebo group. Therefore vitamin C supplementation can be very effective in treating male infertility, particularly if it is due to antibodies against sperm.


Vitamin E supplementation appears to be especially warranted because this vitamin is the main antioxidant in various cell membranes, includ- ing those surrounding sperm. Free radicals, if left alone, lead to the per- oxidation of phospholipids in the mitochondria of the sperm, making the sperm immotile. Vitamin E has been shown to play an essential role in inhibiting free-radical damage to the unsaturated fatty acids of the sperm membrane127 and in enhancing the ability of sperm to fertilize an egg in an IVF setting. Additionally, it has been shown to protect DNA within the sperm from damage.128 Infertile men have significantly lower serum and seminal vitamin E concentrations than fertile men.129 In one study, supplementation with vitamin E was found to decrease malondialdehyde concentration in sperm pellet suspensions and to improve sperm motility. Even more important, however, of 52 (21%) treated infertile men impregnated their spouses, whereas none in the placebo group did so. After completion of the study, of the placebo patients were switched to vitamin E; soon thereafter, were able to successfully impregnate their spouses.130 In another study, vitamin E (400 IU) and selenium (225 mcg) significantly improved sperm quality.131 This was supported by a study in which a combined therapy of vitamin E (400 IU/day) and selenium (200 mcg/day) was administered for 6 months, resulting in a significant increase in sperm motility and a reduced percentage of defective spermatozoa.132 A pro- spective randomized study compared the effectiveness of vitamin E alone, clomiphene citrate alone, or a combination of both treatments on semen parameters of 90 patients with idiopathic oligoasthenozo- ospermia (OAT). After 6 months, there was a significant improvement in sperm concentration and sperm motility in the combined-treatment group.133 Supplementation with vitamin E may also be useful for couples undergoing IVF. Vitamin E (200 mg/day for at least 3 months) was found to improve the in vitro fertilization rate of fertile normospermic males with low fertilization rates after 1 month of treatment, possibly by reducing the lipid peroxidation potential.134 Beneficial results have also been observed in patients undergoing ICSI, where vitamin E helps prevent DNA fragmentation, thus improving ICSI outcomes.135

## Vitamin A, Beta-Carotene, and Lycopene

Vitamin A is an antioxidant required for cellular growth and differen- tiation, gene expression and cellular differentiation, immunity, regu- latory functions, and epithelial tissue integrity. It is necessary for the health of the testes and for sperm production. Low concentrations of vitamin A are associated with abnormal semen parameters in men,136 and deprivation of vitamin A in animals has been shown to lead to a loss of spermatogenesis due to degeneration of the germ cells, which is restored once vitamin A is reintroduced.137 Studies are lacking on the effects of vitamin A supplementation in men; however, studies of vitamin A in combination with other nutrients show improved effects on sperm motility and sperm count.138 Beta-carotene levels are sig- nificantly reduced in immune-infertile men. Intake is associated posi- tively with a higher sperm concentration as well as higher quantities of motile sperm.139 In one study of 189 young, healthy men, higher β -car- otene and lutein intake from food sources was associated with better sperm motility, whereas a moderate intake of β -carotene and vitamin C was associated with higher sperm concentration and sperm count.140 The same study found that higher lycopene intake was associated with better sperm morphology, and lycopene may be even more useful than β -carotene. Lycopene is found in high concentrations in the testes and seminal plasma, and reduced levels have been demonstrated in men with infertility.141 In one clinical trial, 30 men with idiopathic non- obstructive oligo-/astheno-/teratozoospermia were administered 2 mg of lycopene twice a day for 3 months. Twenty patients (66%) showed an improvement in sperm concentration, 16 (53%) had improved motility, and 14 (46%) showed improvement in sperm morphology. In patients showing an improvement, the median changes were million/mL in concentration, 25% in motility, and 10% in morphol- ogy.131 Lycopene levels in semen can be significantly increased with dietary intake of natural sources of lycopene.142 A randomized con- trolled study found that regular consumption of tomato juice signifi- cantly increased seminal plasma lycopene levels and increased sperm motility. In this study, 44 infertile men consumed one can of tomato juice per day (30 mg lycopene) for 12 weeks. Improved results were seen after 6 weeks of the trial.143

## 1467CHAPTER 185 Infertility, Male


Vitamin D is a lipid-soluble vitamin that is required structurally and functionally. It enhances male and female fertility and facilitates the absorption of calcium. The vitamin D receptor and enzymes that metabolize vitamin D are found in the sperm head and midpiece of human sperm and in the testes and male reproductive tract of rats. It has been suggested to play an important role in the production and transport of sperm,144 and the expression levels of vitamin D receptor in CYP24A1 in spermatozoa are positive markers for semen quality.145 Studies show that men who are vitamin D deficient have a lower per- centage of motile spermatozoa compared with those who have suffi- cient vitamin D146,147; however, both low and high vitamin D levels are associated with a decline in semen parameters.148 This trend is sup- ported by a further study investigating the association between vitamin D status and semen quality in 307 young, healthy men. High vitamin D levels were associated with lower total sperm count and percentage of normal morphology sperm.149 Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to increase testoster- one levels in a small study (n = 54). All men in the study were vitamin D deficient at the start of the study and had testosterone levels at the lower end of the reference range.150 This result was not confirmed in other studies. Other studies found that vitamin D supplementation did not affect testosterone levels.147,151 A cross-sectional study of 1362 men did find that plasma 25(OH)D levels were positively associated with total and free testosterone levels.152 Given the level of available evi- dence, supplementation with vitamin D might improve semen qual- ity in at least some of the idiopathic cases of male infertility in a safe and noninvasive manner. Data from small intervention studies and association studies indicate that vitamin D supplementation may only be beneficial for men with vitamin D deficiency,153 and this finding is supported by a recent prospective study of more than 1000 infertile men.154 Vitamin D supplementation (5000 IU/day for 2 months) was found to improve sperm motility in idiopathic infertility patients who had low vitamin D levels.155 Similarly, in a prospective pilot study of infertile men, the incidence of low vitamin D was 76.9% (mean serum vitamin D level 23.6 ng/mL). After treatment with vitamin D supple- ments, the rate of low sperm motility (<40%) improved.156


Selenium is a critical antioxidant that is essential for male fertility because of its role in testosterone synthesis, normal sperm matura- tion, and motility157; moreover, clinical trials reveal that selenium has the ability to increase sperm motility and assist in the production of healthy spermatozoa.158 Selenium is also required structurally because the sperm’s capsular selenoprotein is involved in the stability and motility of the mature sperm and also forms part of the glutathione peroxidase antioxidant system, which is vital for spermatogenesis and protects the sperm against the effects of ROS.159 Lack of selenium leads to atrophy of the seminiferous epithelium, testis volume reduction, and disorders of spermatogenesis and maturation of spermatozoa in the epididymis. Selenium in seminal plasma correlates with good sper- matozoa concentrations, motility, and morphology.160 In animal studies, depletion of mitochondrial glutathione per- oxidase has been found to cause impaired sperm quality and severe structural abnormalities in the midpiece of spermatozoa, leading to infertility.161 The tail of the sperm relies on adequate selenium status to maintain its “whip-like” action. Without sufficient selenium, sperm are unable to swim in the right direction or may display marked immo- tility, thus preventing oocyte location and fusion. A supply of selenium for the selenoproteins in the testis is critical to spermatogenesis, and deficiency or an excess of dietary selenium may impair spermatogene- sis, resulting in poor semen characteristics and quality and infertility.162 The effects of selenium on sperm motility are highlighted in a study involving a subgroup of individuals with poorly motile sperm and subsequent subfertility.163 Over a 3-month period, the administration of selenium (either on it its own or as a combination of antioxidants, including vitamins A, C, and E) to males led to increased sperm motil- ity compared with placebo. Five men (11%) achieved paternity in the treatment group, in contrast to none in the placebo group. This small study highlights the efficacy of selenium supplementation in subfertile men and suggests that improved selenium status can, in turn, improve sperm motility and the possibility of successful conception. Although this number may be seen as small, it was highly meaningful to those who were successful in conceiving—and all the more significant in terms of the cost and convenience of supplementation compared with IVF or ICSI. Selenium (200 mcg/day) in combination with the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (600 mg/day) was found to improve semen param- eters in idiopathic oligo-asthenoterato-spermiaplasma males in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study undertaken over 6.5 months.164 Improvements in sperm count, motility, and morphol- ogy were all observed; however, once supplementation stopped, the parameters reverted back to their readings at baseline in two spermato- genesis cycles. This study did not include pregnancy rate.


Zinc is perhaps the most important trace mineral for male sexual func- tion and is found in high concentrations within the prostate and testes; particularly high amounts are also found in the semen (approximately 2.5 mg of zinc is lost per ejaculate). It is involved in virtually every aspect of male reproduction, including hormone metabolism, sper- matogenesis, and sperm motility.165 Zinc plays an important role in all human living cells; it is involved in the transcription of RNA, the replication of DNA, and the synthe- sis of protein, all of which are crucial for reproduction and fertility. Additionally, it protects against free-radical damage and ROS, which can impair sperm.166 Deficiency of zinc in males can lead to gonadal dysfunction165 and has been observed to be associated with idiopathic male infertility166 and impotence. Zinc levels are typically much lower in infertile men with low sperm counts, indicating that a low zinc status may be the contributing fac- tor to infertility.167,168 It has also been shown that zinc status directly correlates with an increase in sperm count as well as improvements in morphology and motility.160,169 In considering sperm structure, zinc has been shown to influence motility and the head–neck con- nection of the sperm170; it is also important in the stabilization of cell membranes and sperm chromatin.171 Zinc has been shown in vitro to improve seminal antioxidant states in infertile men, but it does not prevent sperm lipid peroxidation.172 Finally, it has been shown to exert an antimicrobial effect on the seminal plasma, which is helpful if sperm antibodies or underlying genitourinary infection is present.173 Several studies have evaluated the effect of zinc supplementation on sperm counts and motility.174–177 The results of all of the studies sup- port the use of zinc supplementation in the treatment of oligospermia, especially in the presence of low testosterone levels. The effectiveness of zinc is best illustrated by a study in 37 men with infertility of greater than 5 years’ duration whose sperm counts were less than 25 million/ mL.27 Blood testosterone levels were also measured. The men received a supplement of zinc sulfate (60 mg elemental zinc daily) for 45 to days. In the 22 patients with initially low testosterone levels, the mean sperm count rose significantly from 8 to 20 million/mL. Testosterone levels also increased, and 9 of the 22 wives became pregnant during the study. This result is quite impressive, given the long-term nature of the infertility and the rapidity of the results. In contrast, in the 15 men

## 1468SECTION 6 Diseases

who had normal testosterone levels before the study, sperm counts increased slightly, but there was no change in testosterone levels, and no pregnancies occurred. In a 3-month study of 45 asthenozoospermic men, it was found that supplementing with zinc sulfate (200 mg twice daily) alone, in combination with vitamin E, or in combination with both vitamin E and vitamin C was associated with improved sperm parameters, less oxidative stress, sperm apoptosis, and sperm DNA fragmentation compared with placebo. No difference in effect between the three treatment groups was found.178 Two other studies have shown that supplementation with zinc sulfate (24 mg for 45–50 days, and 89 mg for 4 months) significantly increases testosterone, seminal zinc levels, and sperm count.179 An additional study of zinc sulfate supplementa- tion (220 mg/day for 3 months) in 110 men found that it resulted in increased semen volume, increased sperm motility, and normal sperm count. Antioxidant status was improved in spermatozoa and seminal plasma.180 Oral zinc supplementation (440 mg zinc sulfate per day) successfully restored seminal catalase-like activity and improved sperm concentration and progressive motility in a group of asthenozoosper- mic men.181 A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the liter- ature examined 22 studies including 2600 cases and 867 controls. The review concluded that seminal plasma zinc concentrations in infertile males were significantly lower than those of fertile males, and zinc sup- plementation could significantly increase the sperm quality of infertile males.182 Optimal zinc levels must be attained if optimal male sexual vitality is desired. Zinc deficiency is increasing throughout the world and is dependent on the country’s soil content and on environmental legis- lation that prevents harmful farming practices. Additionally, owing to the negative effects of excess copper, it is advisable to check serum zinc and copper status. Where a deficiency state is diagnosed, it is import- ant to ensure that a 1:1 ratio (or better) is achieved.

## B Vitamins (Especially Folate and Vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

## )

Folate and vitamin B 12 are concentrated within the head of the sperm and provide vital nutritional potential in sperm generation and sur- vival. Folate and B 12 are required for healthy DNA and RNA synthe- sis, normal protein synthesis, and the regulation of gene expression.176 These nutrients are required to ensure that the DNA within the head of the sperm is structured appropriately and that each sperm (and the DNA within it) replicates identically. Both folate and B 12 facilitate spermatogenesis,183 which is reliant on DNA synthesis176 for germ cell growth and the rapid division of cells. Multiple studies have found that low levels of folic acid in seminal plasma are associated with increased sperm DNA damage,184 whereas B 12 deficiency is strongly associated with reduced sperm motility and count.185 Because the human body has a high turnover of B 12 and requires a continuous supply on a daily basis, supplementation is advis- able for all men experiencing infertility regardless of proved deficiency state and especially for men who have sperm counts below 20 million/ mL or a motility rate of less than 50%. In one study, 27% of men with sperm counts less than 20 million/mL who were given 1000 mcg/day of B 12 were able to achieve a total sperm count in excess of 100 million/ mL.177 In another study, 57% of men with low sperm counts who took 6000 mcg/day demonstrated improvements.186 A recent small study showed that infertile men with varicocele administered a multivitamin including vitamin B 12 at 1 mcg/day, for 3 months, had lower sperm DNA fragmentation by about 22.1%.187 Similarly, a study found that vitamin B 12 (1 mcg/day for 3 months) as part of an oral antioxidant treatment improved sperm vitality, motility, and DNA integrity.188 Infertile men have lower concentrations of serum folic acid than fertile men; however, serum folate concentration was not found to correlate with any semen parameters.189 In another study, seminal plasma folate concentration was found to be lower in infertile men than fertile men and was significantly correlated with low sperm con- centration.190 Folic acid supplementation (5 mg/day) in conjunction with zinc sulfate (220 mg/day) did not improve sperm quality in subfertile men in a 16-week trial.191 However, another study found that coadministration of folic acid (5 mg/day) and zinc sulfate (66 mg/ day) over a 6-month period significantly improved sperm parameters after surgical repair of varicocele.192 It is important to remember that it is advisable to refrain from prescribing one nutrient without the other owing to the possibility of inducing a rebound anemia. Where this occurs, disorders of homo- cysteine metabolism such as methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms may present with count or morphological issues. In men with the MTHFR gene polymorphisms, vitamin B 9 and vitamin B 12 dietary intake was associated with a decrease in homocys- teine and improvement of sperm concentration, motility, and mor- phology. The greatest benefits were seen in men with the T allele of MTHFR C677T polymorphism.193 A recent study investigating high-dose folic acid supplementation (5 mg/day) over 6 months found that methylation of promoter regions in several genes involved in cancer and neurobehavioral disorders was altered. Care must be taken in folic acid supplementation to avoid overdosage problems, particularly in patients who are homozygous for the MTHFR C677T polymorphism.194

## Carnitine

Carnitine is derived from the amino acids lysine and/or methionine and plays a vital role in fatty acid metabolism. It works synergistically with CoQ 10 , highlighting the importance of coprescription for optimal benefit. It is essential in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochon- dria, and deficiency results in a decrease in fatty acid concentrations in the mitochondria and reduced energy production. It is believed to have protective antioxidant effects and provides energy to the testicles and spermatozoa specifically. Several studies comparing fertile with infertile men found that fertile men had a statistically significant larger amount of carnitine in their seminal sample than the infertile men and that low levels of l-carnitine in the seminal plasma may be a potent marker for infertility.195 Carnitine concentrations are extremely high in the epididymis and sperm, suggesting a role in male reproductive function. The epididy- mis derives the majority of its energy requirements from fatty acids, as do the sperm, during transport through the epididymis. After ejac- ulation, the motility of sperm correlates directly with carnitine con- tent; the higher the carnitine content, the more motile the sperm. Conversely, when carnitine levels are low, sperm development, func- tion, and motility are drastically reduced.114 Several clinical studies have shown that carnitine supplementa- tion can produce dramatic improvements in sperm counts and sperm motility. In the Italian Study Group on Carnitine and Male Infertility, 100 subjects were given 3000 mg of l-carnitine daily for 4 months.196 Carnitine was able to increase sperm counts and sperm motility in both a qualitative and a quantitative manner, as follows: • The number of ejaculated sperm per milliliter increased from billion to 163 billion. • The percentage of motile sperm increased from 26.9% to 37.7%. • The percentage of sperm with rapid linear progression increased from 10.8% to 18%. • The mean sperm velocity increased from 28.4% to 32.5%. These results are even more impressive if results for only the patients with the poorest sperm motility are examined. This subgroup saw even more significant gains on all parameters. For example, the

## 1469CHAPTER 185 Infertility, Male

percentage of motile sperm increased from 19.3% to 40.9%, and the percentage of sperm with rapid linear progression increased from 3.1% to 20.3%. These results have been confirmed in several dou- ble-blind studies.197–201 Carnitine, administered in conjunction with other nutrients, has been shown to improve sperm motility in infertile men with idiopathic asthenozoospermia or asthenoteratozoospermia. Carnitine (1500 mg/day) was given in combination with vitamin C, CoQ 10 , selenium, zinc, B 12 , folic acid and vitamin E.188,202 These results are supported by another randomized interventional study in which l-carnitine (2 g/day) was administered in conjunction with a multivi- tamin for 3 months. Improvements were seen in sperm concentration, sperm count, and sperm motility in men with idiopathic oligo- and/ or asthenozoospermia. The results were more significant in l-carni- tine combined with multivitamin than in either of those interventions alone, compared with control.203 Similarly, in a 3-month study of subfertile men, supplementation with a combination of l-carnitine (440 mg), l-arginine (250 mg), zinc (40 mg), vitamin E (120 mg), glu- tathione (80 mg), selenium (60 mcg), CoQ 10 (15 mg), and folic acid (800 mcg) once per day resulted in a significantly better improvement in sperm density and motility compared with supplementation with l-carnitine (500 mg) twice per day.204 In ART, where sperm is cryo- preserved, l-carnitine had an enhancing effect on sperm motility and viability after cryopreservation.205

## R-Alpha-Lipoic Acid

Alpha-lipoic acid is a powerful antioxidant indicated for its lipid and water solubility and because it assists in the chelation of heavy metals regardless of their storage site in the body. It is especially useful owing to its ability to regenerate other antioxidants, including vitamins C and E, CoQ 10 , and glutathione.206 Alpha lipoic acid exhibits marked antioxidant activity to sperm in animal studies.207–209 On review of the research, it appears to act as a shield for the sperm, forming a protective barrier around the mid- piece (aqueous layer) and within the structure itself (lipid layer). This protection is crucial because it has been identified as one of the first places at which free radicals attack.209 It is therefore useful to con- sider in patients with high DNA fragmentation levels. Additionally, animal studies reveal that alpha-lipoic acid improves sperm motility and viability, minimizes DNA damage,209 and protects against bacte- rial lipopolysaccharides, which can induce acute inflammation210; it and may also assist with energy supply to the sperm.209 In a random- ized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of infertile men (n = 44), alpha-lipoic acid supplementation (600 mg/day) for 12 weeks improved sperm count, concentration, and motility and seminal levels of total antioxidant capacity.211

## Coenzyme Q

<!-- chunk -->

## 10

CoQ 10 is concentrated in the head and midpiece (neck) of the sperm. It is considered to be the most crucial and powerful antioxidant in sperm structure because of its role in mitochondrial energy release. It is believed to promote motility, foster sperm survival, and provide optimal energy to assist the sperm’s travel on its journey to the oocyte. As a fat-soluble antioxidant and free-radical scavenger, CoQ 10 is required for the maintenance of cell membrane integrity and cell functioning. It is also specific for the health of all new cells, especially spermatozoa. CoQ 10 in the seminal fluid and sperm212 helps maintain optimal sperm motility.213,214 Decreased levels have been found in the seminal plasma and spermatozoa of males with idiopathic and varico- cele-associated asthenospermia.215 There have been a number of trials of CoQ 10 supplementation in infertile men with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratospermia (OAT). A 26-week RCT of 212 infertile men with idiopathic OAT showed that daily supplementation with CoQ 10 (300 mg) resulted in a statis- tically significant improvement in sperm count, sperm motility, and sperm morphology.216 These results were confirmed in a 3-month study of supplementation with CoQ 10 (200 mg/day), resulting in a significant improvement in sperm morphology in men with idio- pathic OAT. The supplementation also resulted in higher catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, indicating improved oxi- dative stress in seminal plasma.217 A longer, 12-month study of infertile men with idiopathic OAT found that treatment with CoQ 10 (300 mg/day) resulted in significant improvements in sperm motility and sperm morphology. There was also a beneficial effect on preg- nancy rate in the group.218 In men with varicocele, supplementation with CoQ 10 (100 mg/day) for 3 months resulted in a 40% increase in seminal plasma antioxidant status and a small improvement in semen parameters.219 Administration of 200 mg/day of ubiqui- nol (reduced form of CoQ 10 ) over 26 weeks in a group of 228 men with unexplained infertility resulted in significant improvements in sperm density, motility, and morphology.220 These results were sup- ported in a 6-month trial of 60 men where 150 mg ubiquinol daily was found to increase sperm count and motility.221 Although CoQ 10 supplementation has been shown to be of benefit in improving var- ious parameters of male infertility, CoQ 10 intake from food was not found to be related to semen parameters (sperm concentration, total and progressive motility, and morphology) among subfertile men. A study of 211 participants showed that these men had a mean dietary CoQ 10 intake of 19.2 mg/day (ranging from 2 to 247 mg/day). Intake estimates varied greatly and were based on a validated food frequency questionnaire.222

## -Arginine

The amino acid arginine is required for the replication of cells, mak- ing it essential in sperm formation. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) uses l-arginine to synthesize nitric oxide, which can protect spermatozoa from lipid peroxidase damage. Via its role as a precursor to nitric oxide synthesis, arginine is required for angiogenesis, spermatogenesis, and hormone secretion.223 Some studies have shown that l-arginine can improve sperm count and motility.185,224 Stress, in particular, has been found to decrease the levels of arginine in sperm-production pathways. Arginine supple- mentation is often but not always an effective treatment for male infer- tility. The critical determinant appears to be the level of oligospermia. If sperm counts are less than 20 million/mL, arginine supplementation is less likely to be of benefit. To be effective, the dose of l-arginine must be at least 4 g/day for 3 months. In perhaps the most favorable study, 74% of 178 men with low sperm counts had significant improvements in sperm counts and motility after arginine therapy.225 One double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover clin- ical trial examined the effects of Prelox, a combination of 80 mg/day of Pycnogenol and 3 g/day of l-arginine aspartate.226 The results showed an improvement in semen parameters in 50 males with idiopathic infertility over a treatment period of 4 weeks. Also observed were sig- nificant increases in ejaculate volume, concentration, and number of spermatozoa as well as the percentage of vital spermatozoa compared with placebo. The percentage of spermatozoa with good progressing motility also increased significantly, whereas the percentage of immo- tile spermatozoa decreased. These results appear to be due to a com- bination of the antioxidant activity of Pycnogenol and/or the activity of l-arginine in stimulating the activity of endothelial NOS, leading to enhanced motility of spermatozoa. In a small pilot study, Pycnogenol (200 mg daily for 90 days) alone was shown to improve sperm mor- phology by 38% and the mannose receptor binding assay scores by 19%.227

## 1470SECTION 6 Diseases


Two small preliminary studies into the use of probiotics for improving male fertility have been carried out recently, opening new avenues for treatment of male infertility. In one study, nine men with asthenozoospermic were administered two different antioxidant probiotic strains (Lactobacillus rhamnosus CECT8361 and Bifidobacterium longum CECT7347) for 6 weeks. Each capsule contained an equal combination of both strains corresponding to 109 cfu/day. Results showed a significant improvement in sperm motility and a decrease in DNA fragmentation and intracellular ROS. Cell via- bility was not affected by the treatment. The authors concluded that the results were due to the antioxidant activity of the probiotic strains.228 The second randomized trial of 41 men with idiopathic oligoasthe- noteratospermia found that treatment with a proprietary probiotic/ prebiotic therapy (Flortec) over 6 months improved the quality and quan- tity of spermatozoa to a larger extent than placebo. Flortec is made up of Lactobacillus paracasei B21060 5 × 109 cells, arabinogalctan 1243 mg, oligo-fructosaccharides 700 mg, and l-glutamine 500 mg. The probiotic/ prebiotic treatment improved the volume of the ejaculate, sperm concen- tration, number of ejaculated spermatozoa, motility, and the percentage of typical forms. The men’s FSH, LH, and testosterone levels also improved. The improvements may be mediated by normalization of subtle alter- ations in hypothalamic–pituitary function, an antioxidant effect, and pos- sibly even improvements in the prostatic microenvironment.229 However, an alternative theory relating to the improvements seen in this study has been proposed.230 Improvement in gut bacteria leads to improvement in intestinal mucosa barrier function, thereby resolving “leaky gut” and endotoxin-containing gut bacteria migrating into the systemic circula- tion. Endotoxin is a powerful immune stimulant, with recent data linking endotoxin activation of the immune system with impaired Leydig and Sertoli cell function via systemic inflammation and hypogonadism. Earlier reports have shown that Lactobacillus probiotics exert a beneficial effect on testicular function in mice via modulation of the immune system.230

## Panax ginseng (Korean Ginseng)

Current scientific investigation suggests that Panax ginseng (Chinese or Korean ginseng) may be supportive in the treatment of male infer- tility. Both botanicals have a long history of use as male “tonics.” In studies with animals, Panax ginseng has been shown to improve the growth of the testes, raise sperm formation and testosterone levels, and increase sexual activity and mating behavior. It is classed as an energy tonic, indicated when there is lowered vitality and therefore impaired physical performance and sexual function. The active con- stituents (ginsenosides) have been shown to enhance nitric oxide production, which is useful in regulating the capacitating process of spermatozoa and the acrosome reaction, thus improving fertilization sperm motility.231,232 Additionally, ginsenosides have been shown to affect different levels of the hypothalamic–pituitary–testicular axis,233 which can assist in modulating stress-induced infertility or lowered testosterone from insufficient dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) syn- thesis. In clinical trials, Panax ginseng has been shown to increase testosterone levels as well as sperm counts and motility in patients with oligospermia, some of whom had varicocele,233 and to improve erection and libido.234,235 An RCT of infertile male patients with varicocele (n = 80) found that supplementation with Korean red ginseng root powder (500 mg three times a day) resulted in significant improvements in sperm con- centration, viability, motility, and morphology. The study participants were divided into four groups: nonvaricocelectomy with placebo or treatment; varicocelectomy with placebo or treatment. All groups except for the nonvaricocelectomy with placebo group showed similar improved sperm parameter results at the end of the trial.236 For additional information and references, see Chapter 99.

## Pygeum africanum (Pygeum)

Pygeum africanum may be effective in improving fertility in cases where diminished prostatic secretion plays a significant role. Pygeum has been shown to increase prostatic secretions and improve the com- position of the seminal fluid.237–239 Specifically, Pygeum administra- tion to men with decreased prostatic secretion has led to increased levels of total seminal fluid plus increases in alkaline phosphatase and protein content. Pygeum appears to be most effective in men in whom alkaline phosphatase activity is reduced (i.e., <400 IU/cm3) and there is no evi- dence of inflammation or infection (i.e., absence of white blood cells and immunoglobulin A[IgA]). The lack of IgA in the semen is a good indicator of clinical success. In one study, the patients with no IgA in their semen demonstrated an increase in alkaline phosphatase from 265 to 485 IU/cm3.239 In contrast, those with IgA showed only a mod- est increase, from 213 to 281 IU/cm3. Pygeum extract has also shown an ability, in a double-blind clinical trial, to improve the capacity of patients with benign prostatic hypertro- phy (BPH) or prostatitis to achieve an erection, as determined by noc- turnal penile tumescence.240 BPH and prostatitis are often associated with erectile dysfunction and other sexual disturbances. Presumably by alleviating the underlying condition, Pygeum can improve sexual function.

## Tribulus terrestris

Tribulus terrestris has been used traditionally in Ayurvedic medicine as a tonic and aphrodisiac and in European folk medicine to increase sexual potency. Protodioscin, one of the steroidal saponins, is consid- ered the chief constituent responsible for the herb’s effects on libido and sexual functioning. Of prime importance is correct sourcing of Tribulus to ensure its effectiveness. All of the data and clinical out- comes have been based on a leaf extract from Bulgaria, which has been shown to be highest in protodioscin. Therefore, if a Tribulus product is made from the root or fruit of the plant or is obtained from anywhere other than Eastern Europe, it will probably contain low levels of proto- dioscin and therefore not be effective. In animal studies, Tribulus has been shown to increase the levels of certain sex hormones, including testosterone, and also to improve nitric oxide synthesis241; however, these same results have not been observed in some human studies.242 One possible explanation is that there were differences in the extract and plant parts of the Tribulus used as well as the fact that many of the studies have comprised healthy males with normal testosterone levels rather than males with testoster- one deficiency. Tribulus appears to enhance male fertility through its ability to increase sperm count, viability, and libido; however, the published material is unclear, reporting older studies that were poorly designed and results that are not sufficiently definitive. A number of older papers supporting the extract product Tribestan highlight significant efficacy; however, owing to poor study design and lack of reliability, it is difficult to rely on these findings, which include increased ejacu- late volume, sperm concentration, and motile sperm243 and improved conception rates.244 More recent studies have also produced conflict- ing results. In a recent prospective, randomized, double-blind, pla- cebo-controlled trial, Tribestan (500 mg three times per day for weeks) was found to successfully improve sexual function in men with mild to moderate erectile dysfunction (n = 180).245 These results are in conflict with a previous study in which 400 mg of Tribulus treatment

## 1471CHAPTER 185 Infertility, Male

(400 mg twice per day for 30 days) was found to be no better than placebo at improving erectile dysfunction, possibly due to suboptimal dosing and/or too short a study period.246 A recent in vitro study found that the addition of Tribulus to human sperm enhanced sperm motility, number of progressive motile spermatozoa, and curvilinear velocity. Sperm viability was also signifi- cantly enhanced.247 Tribulus had an enhancing effect on sperm motility and viability after cryopreservation.248 A human randomized trial of male patients with idiopathic infertility found no significant improve- ment in levels of testosterone or semen parameters after 3 months of treatment with Tribulus (750 mg/day).249 However, a trial of 65 men with abnormal semen evaluation found that administering Androsten (250 mg dried extract per capsule, including 37.5 mg protodioscin) three times per day over 12 weeks resulted in a significant enhancement of sperm count and motility but not morphology.250 In conclusion, the exact role of Tribulus in male infertility is still inconclusive and con- troversial, and there may be a need to determine different mechanisms of action other than the current hypothesis that its desirable effects are due to androgen-enhancing properties.251 Further large, robust studies are needed to reconcile the conflicting results to date.

## Astragalus membranaceus

In experimental studies, Astragalus membranaceus has been observed to increase the motility of sperm in semen.252 Studies show that Astragalus increases the motility of sperm in semen, but it also increases the motility of washed sperm, which is of special relevance to those seeking ART treatment.253 Additionally, it has been shown to increase sperm motility and progression.254

## Turnera diffusa (Damiana)

The traditional application of damiana was for “its positive aphrodi- siac effects, acting energetically on the genito urinary organs of both genders where it was highly indicated for sexual weakness and debil- ity,”255 and “its ability to act as a stimulant tonic of the sexual appara- tus especially if there is enfeeblement of the central nervous system.”256 Modern clinicians continue to prescribe damiana in this context and find it is especially beneficial when there is sexual debility, erectile dif- ficulty, and depression. Human studies are lacking; however, a number of animal studies show promising supportive research. Turnera diffusa has been shown to facilitate the sexual behavior of male rats with sexual dysfunction, to reduce ejaculation latency,257 to produce a restorative effect in sexually exhausted male rats, and to hasten their recovery.258 It has also been observed to suppress aromatase activity, leading to the hypothesis that it may increase levels of testosterone.259

## Mucuna pruriens (Velvet Bean)

Velvet bean has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for endurance against stress, general resistance against infection, retardation of the aging pro- cess, and eventual improvement of male sexual function; it has been known to alleviate disorders, including psychogenic impotence and unexplained infertility.260 One paper showed that M. pruriens seed powder produced dramatic improvements in 70% of study partici- pants and helped fight stress-mediated poor semen quality; it has also acted as a restorative and invigorating tonic/aphrodisiac in infertile subjects.261 The same researchers reporting these positive effects deter- mined that they were achieved through the regulation of steroidogen- esis and resulting improvements in semen quality.262 Specifically, this herbal treatment significantly improved testosterone, LH, dopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline levels in infertile men and reduced lev- els of FSH and prolactin. Sperm count and motility were also signifi- cantly improved in infertile men. In a follow-up study, it was found that treatment with Mucuna pruriens regulated steroidogenesis and improved semen quality and significantly improved testosterone, LH, dopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline levels in infertile men. Levels of FSH and prolactin were reduced. Sperm count and motility were also significantly recovered in infertile males after treatment.263 A 3-month study of M. pruriens seed powder administered to infer- tile men (n = 180) found a significant improvement in seminal plasma metabolic profile. Improvements were seen in alanine, citrate, glycero- phosphocholine, histidine, and phenylalanine concentrations in sem- inal plasma.264

## Withania somnifera (Withania)

Withania has shown considerable antistress and adaptogenic effects. To investigate the effects of Withania on male fertility, 75 normal healthy fertile men (control subjects) and 75 men undergoing infer- tility screening participated in a 3-month clinical trial. The men in the Withania group received 5 g of the powdered root daily. Before and after the treatment, semen analysis, antioxidant vitamins, and serum sex hormone levels were determined. Results showed that Withania inhibited lipid peroxidation and improved sperm count and motility. Treatment also significantly increased serum testosterone and LH and reduced the levels of FSH and prolactin (PRL), all beneficial effects in infertile men.265 A pilot study of 46 men with oligospermia found that supplemen- tation with Withania somnifera (675 mg/d of high concentration, full-spectrum root extract) over 90 days resulted in a 167% increase in sperm count, 53% in semen volume, and 57% increase in sperm motil- ity compared with placebo. Improvement and regulation of serum tes- tosterone and LH levels were also observed in the treatment group.266 The molecular mechanism of W. somnifera on semen quality was demonstrated to act via repairing disturbed concentrates of lactate, alanine, citrate, glycerophosphocholine, histidine, and phenylalanine in seminal plasma, thereby normalizing seminal plasma metabolites. W. somnifera actions include regulating reproductive hormones, fatty acid metabolism, and enzymatic activity of the TCA cycle.267 A 3-month study into the effect of W. somnifera on stress-related male fertility found that treatment with W. somnifera powder (5 g/day dried root powder) resulted in a decrease in stress; improved antioxidant levels; and improvement in sperm concentration, motility, and lique- faction time. Treatment also resulted in increased serum testosterone and LH levels. Cortisol levels in the treatment groups were significantly decreased after treatment.268 A 3-month treatment of normozoosper- mic, oligozoospermic, and asthenozoospermic men (n = 75) with W. somnifera (5 g/day root powder) showed that semen quality was improved by restoring the altered levels of intracellular ROS in sper- matozoa and cell death and improving essential metal ion (Cu2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, and Au2+) concentrations.269

## Nigella sativa (Black Cumin)

Nigella sativa is an herb displaying antioxidant properties. The main antioxidant components are thymoquinone and unsaturated fatty acids (linoleic and oleic acid). A study of infertile men with abnormal semen parameters (n = 68) found that treatment with N. sativa seed oil (2.5 mL twice daily) over 2 months improved sperm count, motility, morphology, and semen volume compared with placebo.270 This study is supported by prior animal studies showing that N. sativa improves sperm parameters, semen Leydig cells, reproductive organs, and repro- ductive hormones.271

evaluation is often necessary. It is advisable to encourage a detoxifica- tion program at the start of treatment so as to optimize spermatogene- sis and the subsequent cohort of spermatozoa. Additionally, nutritional status should be optimized, environmental pollutants identified and eliminated, lifestyle practices modified, and fertility-enhancing botani- cals consumed. It is also crucial to avoid all xenobiotics, pollutants, and toxicants owing to their disruptive endocrinological effects.

as “indeterminate” when the disease has features of both Crohn’s dis- ease and ulcerative colitis. Over time, the disease may morph into one predominant disease pattern or remain indeterminate.

## Common Features of Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative

<!-- chunk -->

## Colitis

• The colon is frequently involved in Crohn’s disease and is invari- ably involved in ulcerative colitis. • Although rarely, patients with ulcerative colitis who have total colon involvement may experience a so-called backwash ileitis. Thus both conditions may cause chronic inflammatory changes in the distal small intestine. • Patients with Crohn’s disease often have close relatives with ulcer- ative colitis, and vice versa. • When there is no granulomatous reaction in Crohn’s disease of the colon, the two lesions may resemble each other clinically as well as pathologically. • There are many epidemiological similarities between the two dis- eases, including age, race, gender, and geographic distribution. • The two conditions are associated with similar extraintestinal man- ifestations. • There appear to be etiological parallels between the two conditions. • Both conditions are associated with a higher frequency of colonic carcinoma and extraintestinal cancers.

## Etiology

The epidemiological and etiological data on ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are quite similar.1 The incidence and prevalence of the two diseases differ slightly, with most studies showing UC to be more common. Overall, the incidence of CD is rapidly rising in Western cultures.2 The annual incidence of CD in North America is reported to be 3.1 to 20.2 per 100,000 with a prevalence of 201 per 100,000 population.2 The current estimate of the incidence of UC in Western Europe and the United States is approximately 6 to 8 cases per 100,000; the estimated prevalence is approximately 286 cases per 100,000.3 The incidence of CD is rising in Western cultures.2 Overall, between 1 and 1.6 million Americans have IBD, with an overall prevalence of 504 per 100,000 in the pop- ulation.4 The incidence of IBD has been rising in newly industrial- ized countries in Africa, Asia, and South America, including Brazil and Taiwan. IBD may occur at any age, but it most often occurs between the ages of 15 and 35 years. Females are affected slightly more frequently than males. White people have the disease two to five times more often than African or Asian Americans, and Jews have a threefold to sixfold higher incidence than non-Jews.3 Theories about the etiology of IBD can be divided into several groups, as follows (Fig. 186.1): • Genetic predisposition • Gut dysbiosis • Immunological abnormality • Dietary factors • An assortment of miscellaneous concepts implicating psychoso- matic, vascular, traumatic, and other mechanisms

## Genetic Predisposition

Although the search for a specific genetic marker for IBD has been futile, several factors suggest a genetic predisposition. As already men- tioned, IBD is two to five times more common among white than non- white people and three to six times more common among Jews than non-Jews. In addition, multiple members of the same family have CD or UC in 15% to 40% of cases.5

## Gut Dysbiosis

Many microorganisms have been hailed as putative causes of IBD; however, in spite of numerous attempts to confirm a bacterial, myco- bacterial, fungal, or viral etiology, the idea that a transmissible agent is responsible for IBD is still a hotly debated subject. Viruses—rotavirus, Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, measles virus, and an uncharac- terized RNA intestinal cytopathic virus—and mycobacteria continue to be favored candidates. Gastrointestinal infections with Aeromonas bacteria (Aeromonas sobria and Aeromonas hydrophila) and the yeast Candida albicans can trigger a flare of disease, and all patients with IBD should be tested for these infections at the start and during the course of their illness.6 Overall, a state of gut dysbiosis has been well character- ized for both forms of IBD whereby bacteria and fungi have alterations in composition and biodiversity.6

## Antibiotic Exposure

Before the 1950s, CD was found in select groups with a strong genetic component. Since that time there has been a rapid climb in developed countries, particularly the United States, and in countries that previ- ously had virtually no reported cases. In fact, CD has spread like an epi- demic since 1950. Are antibiotics to blame? Penicillin and tetracycline have been available in oral form since 1953. The annual increase in prescriptions of antibiotics parallels the rise in the annual incidence of CD. Comparative statistics have shown that wherever antibiotics have been used early and in large quantities, the incidence of CD is now quite high. Over the years, researchers have sought to identify CD as an infectious process. The problem may be that the infectious agent is a component of the normal intestinal flora that suddenly produces immunostimulatory toxins or becomes invasive as a direct result of sublethal doses of antibiotics. Administration of sublethal amounts of antibiotics has been shown to induce a capacity for toxin production in intestinal organisms. When microbes are not given a full lethal dose, their usual response is to adapt and become even stronger in virulence and numbers. Other medications that have been implicated as etio- pathogenic include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and, most recently, isotretinoin (Accutane). Antibiotic exposure is now being

linked more to CD than UC. A total of 15 observational studies (8748 IBD patients) were systematically evaluated and confirmed that anti- biotic exposure was linked with CD but not with UC.7 The antibiotics that were most strongly linked to CD onset included the penicillins, cephalosporins, metronidazole, and fluoroquinolones, whereas the effect of the tetracycline-family antibiotics was unclear.

## Immune Mechanisms

An overwhelming amount of evidence points to immunological derangements in IBD, but whether they are causal or secondary phe- nomena remains unclear. Theories relating humoral mechanisms, immunological regulatory defects, and cell-mediated reactions to the etiology of IBD have all been proposed, but the current evidence seems to indicate that these derangements are probably secondary to the dis- ease process.8


Despite the fact that a dietary etiology of CD is barely considered (if mentioned at all) in most standard medical and gastroenterology texts, several lines of evidence strongly support dietary factors as being the most important etiologically, as recently reviewed by Limketkai et al.9 The incidence of CD is increasing in cultures consuming the Western diet, but it is virtually nonexistent in cultures consuming a more primitive diet.10–15 Food is the major factor in determining the intestinal environment, so the considerable change in dietary habits over the past century could explain the rising incidence of IBD. Several studies that have analyzed the preillness diets of patients with CD have found they habitually eat more refined sugar, chemically modified fats, and fast food and less raw fruits, vegetables, omega-3–rich foods, and dietary fiber than do healthy people (Table 186.1).10–14 In one study, the preillness intake of refined sugar in patients with CD was nearly twice that in controls (122 g/day vs. 65 g/day).14 One researcher found that before the onset of disease, patients with CD had eaten cornflakes more frequently than controls.16 Although other researchers could not verify this specific finding, cornflakes are high in refined carbohydrates and are derived from a very common allergen (corn). Much of contro- versy over the role of preillness diet in the etiology of CD is largely due to the fact that the only way to assess this diet is from postdiagnostic interviews. Studies in which the interview has taken place within the first 6 months of diagnosis tend to be more supportive than studies in which the interview was conducted more than 7 months after diagno- sis. Increased refined sugar intake and high overall carbohydrate intake precede the development of CD.17 Along these lines, patients with UC show higher consumption of refined carbohydrates than do control subjects.18 Increased consumption of chemically modified fats (e.g., those found in margarine) may be involved in the etiology of UC.19 Interestingly, high consumption of a fast-food diet is an antecedent of both UC and CD.20 Another important dietary factor that is entirely overlooked in the standard texts is the role of food allergy. Support for this hypothesis is offered in clinical studies that have used an elemental diet, total paren- teral nutrition, or an exclusion diet with great success in the treatment of IBD.16,21–25 The role of food allergy is discussed in greater detail later in the chapter, as is the effect of dietary fiber in the etiology and treat- ment of IBD (see “Therapeutic Considerations”). A reduced intake of omega-3 oils and an increased intake of omega-6 oils are also being linked with the growing rise of CD in Japan. Because the genetic background of the Japanese is relatively homoge- neous, this higher incidence is most likely due to the incorporation of Western foods in the diet. To examine the contribution of diet to the increased incidence of CD in Japan, the incidence and daily intake of a number of dietary components were compared annually between and 1985. The analysis showed that the greater incidence of CD was strongly correlated with increased dietary intake of total fat, animal fat, omega-6 fatty acids, animal protein, milk protein, and the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids. It was less correlated with intake of total protein, was not correlated with fish protein, and was inversely correlated with vegetable protein. Multivariate analysis showed that higher intake of animal protein was the strongest independent factor, followed by an increased ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids.26 Correction of this increased ratio by reduction of omega-6 oil intake and an increase of omega-3 oil intake may lead to significant clinical benefit through an effect on eicosanoid metabolism (discussed later).

## Miscellaneous Factors

Psychosomatic factors such as mental and emotional stress can pro- mote exacerbation of IBD, so stress management techniques may prove useful for some patients.27


IBD is the end result of a complex interplay of several factors. This sec- tion discusses the key nutritional, microbial, and toxic issues that must be addressed for the successful management of this difficult disease.

## Control of Causative Factors

<!-- chunk -->

## Natural History of Crohn’s Disease

Little is known about the natural course of CD because virtually all patients with the disease undergo standard medical care (drugs and/ or surgery) or alternative therapy. The only exceptions are patients in clinical trials who are assigned to the placebo group.28–30 However, even these patients do not represent the natural course of the disease because they are seen frequently by physicians and other members of a healthcare team and are taking medication, even if it is only in the form of a placebo. If proper evaluation of therapies for IBD is to occur, there must be a greater understanding of its natural history. This is partic- ularly important for alternative practitioners because it is commonly believed that standard medical care often interferes with the normal efforts of the body to restore health. Some aspects of the “natural” course of CD support this idea, especially when coupled with the lim- ited efficacy of current medications and surgery and their known tox- icity. However, heroic measures do have their place in many instances and should be used when appropriate. Researchers in the National Cooperative Crohn’s Disease Study (NCCDS) reviewed 77 patients who received placebo therapy in part 1 of

the 17-week study.28,29 They all had active disease, as defined by a CD activ- ity index (CDAI) higher than 150. Of the patients completing the study: • None died. • Only 7 (9%) suffered a major worsening of their disease (i.e., either a major fistula developed or the patient required abdominal surgery). • Twenty-five (32%) suffered a lesser worsening (increase in the CDAI to >450 or presence of fever of 100°F for 2 weeks). • Treatment was considered to have failed in 25 (32%) because their CDAIs remained higher than 150. • Twenty (26%) achieved clinical remission. On at least one occasion during the 17 weeks of therapy, 49% of the patients were found to have a CDAI lower than 150. The patients who showed a favorable response to the placebo con- tinued to be observed with placebo therapy for up to 2 years (part 1, Phase II). Interestingly, although none of these patients’ intesti- nal radiographs showed worsening during Phase I or Phase II, 18% showed improvement. Of the patients whose disease responded to pla- cebo (20; 26% of the 77), the majority (70%) remained in remission at 1 year, and a fair number (45%) remained in remission at 2 years. These results indicate that many patients undergo spontaneous remis- sion, approximately 20% at 1 year and 12% at 2 years. However, when another factor is considered, the “success” of placebo therapy rises dramatically. Of patients in the placebo group who had no previous history of steroid therapy, 41% achieved remission after 17 weeks. In addition, 23% of this group continued in remission after 2 years, com- pared with only 4% of the group with a history of steroid use. The European Cooperative Crohn’s Disease Study (ECCDS), although different in some methodological details, is quite similar to the NCCDS.28,30 In the ECCDS, 110 patients constituted the placebo group, 68 patients with prior treatment and 42 patients with no prior treatment. The results of the study showed that 55% of the total pla- cebo group achieved remission by 100 days, 34% remained in remis- sion at 300 days, and 21% remained in remission at 700 days. Like the NCCDS, the ECCDS demonstrated that patients with no prior therapy have a greater likelihood of remission. Although one group of researchers did not advocate placebo ther- apy, they did carefully point out that once remission was achieved, 75% of the patients continued in remission at the end of 1 year and up to 63% at 2 years regardless of the maintenance therapy used. These results would suggest that the key is achieving remission, which, once attained, can be maintained by conservative nondrug therapy rather than the “medicines we are currently using with their limited efficacy and known toxicity.”28

## Eicosanoid Metabolism in Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Patients with IBD show greatly increased levels of inflammatory chemi- cals in the colonic mucosa, serum, and stool samples. Specifically, these patients show an increase in the synthesis of the lipoxygenase products, leu- kotrienes, and mono-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (mono-HETEs).31–35 These compounds are produced by neutrophils and are known to amplify the inflammatory process and cause smooth muscle contraction. Release of lipoxygenase products is promoted by activation of the alternative com- plement pathway. The therapeutic efficacy of sulfasalazine and corticoste- roids is due to their effect on eicosanoid metabolism. Sulfasalazine is an inhibitor of both cyclooxygenase and neutrophil lipoxygenase, whereas corticosteroids inhibit phospholipase A 2 and thus block the release of ara- chidonic acid from the membrane phospholipid pool. Sulfasalazine also inhibits the degranulation of mast cells. Several naturally occurring com- pounds, such as the polyphenols (quercetin, curcumin, resveratrol, etc.), also interact favorably with these enzymes (Fig. 186.2). The formation of these inflammatory compounds can be decreased by reducing or eliminating the consumption of omega-6–rich foods (corn, beef, liver, pork, lamb, and milk/dairy products) and increas- ing the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids through a higher intake of cold-water fish (salmon, mackerel, herring, and halibut). These fish are good sources of the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Meta-analyses of double-blind studies with fish oil supplements (2.7– 5.1 g total omega-3 oils) have demonstrated an ability to prevent or delay relapses in both CD and UC.36,37 The Cochrane Collaboration recently published a systematic review evaluating 214 publications and identified only 15 randomized controlled trials (RCT). Only four studies were of sufficient quality to be included in the analysis. Enteric-coated omega-3 essential fatty acid (EFA) supplementation reduced the 1-year relapse rate by half, with an absolute risk reduction of 31% and a number needed to treat (NNT) of only 3. A much larger RCT asked whether omega-3 fatty acids could sustain remission once it was achieved. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Epanova Program in Crohn’s Study 1 [EPIC-1] and EPIC-2) were conducted between January and February 2007 at 98 centers in Canada, Europe, Israel, and the United Quercitin Glycyrrhiza giabra Cell membrane Phospholipase A2

However, botanicals found in nature and food at therapeutic doses can work on the exact same pathways and block the metabolism of arachidonic acid into proinflammatory mediators.

States. Data from 363 and 375 patients with quiescent CD were evaluated in EPIC-1 and EPIC-2, respectively. Patients with a CDAI score of less than 150 were randomly assigned to receive either 4 g/day of omega-3 free fatty acids or placebo for up to 58 weeks. No other treatments for CD were permitted. Clinical relapse is defined by a CDAI score of 150 points or greater and an increase of more than 70 points from the baseline value, or initiation of treatment for active CD. In both EPIC-1 and EPIC-2, there were no significant differences in the CD relapse rate for placebo versus fish oils.38 Flaxseed oil is also of value. Flaxseed oil contains alpha-linolenic acid, an essential omega-3 fatty acid that has anti-inflammatory effects and can be converted to EPA in limited amounts.39

## Mucin Defects in Ulcerative Colitis

Mucins are an ill-defined class of high-molecular-weight, carbohy- drate-rich (85% by weight of N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, sialic acids, N-acetylglucosamine, and fructose) glycoproteins thought to be largely responsible for the viscous and elastic characteristics of secreted mucus. Alterations in mucin composition and content in the colonic mucosa have been reported in patients with UC.39–42 The factors respon- sible for these changes appear to be a dramatic drop in the mucous con- tent of the goblet cells (proportional to the severity of the disease) and a diminution of the major sulfomucin subfraction (designated “species IV,” according to diethylaminoethanol-cellulose differentiation). In con- trast, these abnormalities are not found in patients with CD. It is signifi- cant that although the mucin content of the goblet cells returns to normal during remission, the sulfomucin deficiency does not. The specific com- ponents of the sulfomucin and the cause of its lower concentration have not yet been determined. These mucin abnormalities are also thought to be a major factor in these patients’ higher risk of colon cancer. Many of the herbs used historically in the treatment of UC are demulcents; that is, agents that soothe irritated mucous membranes and promote the secretion of mucus. This effect appears to be very beneficial and supports the use of demulcents in UC.

## Intestinal Microflora

The intestinal microflora is extraordinarily complex and contains more than 400 distinct microbial species.43,44 Accurate simultaneous quanti- fication of all possible species is not possible with current conventional culture techniques. In addition, measurement techniques such as stool cultures do not indicate bacterial metabolic activity, locations of growth within the gastrointestinal tract, or turnover rates. These last two factors may prove to be the more important determinants of the role of the intestinal bacterial flora in IBD than the actual numbers of specific bac- terial species. In an effort to describe a nonspecific (qualitative or quan- titative) alteration in the intestinal flora, the term dysbiosis is often used (see Chapters 9 and 28 for a full discussion of this important topic).43 The fecal flora of patients with IBD has been found to con- tain higher numbers of gram-positive anaerobic coccoid rods and Bacteroides vulgatus, a gram-negative rod.43 Studies have indicated that these alterations in fecal flora are not secondary to the disease, and alterations in the metabolic activity of the various bacteria are thought to be more important than alterations in the number of bacteria per se. In addition, specific bacterial cell components (which vary even within the same species) are thought to be responsible for promoting lympho- cyte cytotoxic activity against the colonic epithelial cells.43,44 Fig. 186.3 illustrates the potential role of gut dysbiosis in IBD disease pathogene- sis, and Fig. 186.4 demonstrates the interaction of dietary factors with the gut microbiome in disease risk.

gut microbes, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, and dysfunctional immune responses, engaging Tregs, T-helper 1 (Th1), and Th17, are implicated in IBD pathogenesis. During homestasis, gut microbes induce an immune tolerance phenotype in the host, whilst in inflammatory conditions like IBD, antigens from dysbiotic microbes activate Th1 and Th17 cells, resulting in tissue injury, decreased mucus layer, and microbial pen- etration and persistence in the intestinal tissues. This mucosal injury results in further uptake of microbial antigens, TLR ligands, and viable organisms that perpetuate the immune responses.

## Carrageenan

Interestingly, researchers investigating the intestinal flora of UC often use the carrageenan (a sulfated polymer of galactose and d-anhydro- galactose extracted from red seaweeds, principally Eucheuma spinosum and Chondrus crispus) model to induce the disease in animals experi- mentally. In the initial experiments reported by Marcus and Watt45 in 1969, 1% and 5% carrageenan solutions were provided as the exclusive source of oral fluids for guinea pigs. Over a period of several days, the animals lost weight, demonstrated anemia, and had bloody diarrhea. Gross anatomic studies after sacrifice at 20 and 45 days revealed a loss of haustral folds, mucosal granularity, pseudopolyps, and strictures; microscopic examination showed crypt abscesses, lymphocytic infiltra- tion, capillary congestion of the lamina propria, and gross ulcerations. These results have since been confirmed by numerous investigators and in studies involving other animal species, including primates.46–49 In its native state, the carrageenan polymer has a molecular weight of 100,000 to 800,000 Da, but in the studies, it is degraded by mild acidic hydrolysis to yield products with weights in the vicinity of 30,000 Da. Carrageen compounds are used by the food industry as stabilizing and suspending agents, with polymers of different molecular weights being used for a variety of purposes. Typically, carrageenans used in the food industry have a molecular weight greater than 100,000 Da. Carrageenan is widely used in milk and chocolate milk products (e.g., ice cream, cottage cheese, milk chocolate) because of its ability to stabilize milk proteins. As suggestive as the animal studies are in linking UC with carra- geenan and despite the higher consumption of carrageenan in Western diets, at this time there appears to be no correlation between the human consumption of carrageenan and the development of UC. In one study, no lesions of IBD were observed in healthy human subjects fed enor- mous quantities of degraded carrageenan.50 However, differences in intestinal bacterial flora are probably responsible for this discrepancy, because germ-free animals do not display carrageenan-induced damage. On further examination, it was discovered that the bacterium linked to the carrageenan-induced damage in animals is a strain of B. vulga- tus.43 As mentioned earlier, this organism is found in much higher con- centrations (six times as high) in the fecal cultures of patients with IBD. When all the data are evaluated, they appear to imply that although car- rageenan can be metabolized into nondamaging components in most human subjects, those individuals with an overgrowth of B. vulgatus may be at risk. Strict avoidance of carrageenan appears warranted at this time for patients with IBD until further research clarifies its safety for them.

## Aspirin and Intestinal Permeability

A very interesting study evaluated 30 patients with CD and first-degree relatives of patients with CD for intestinal permeabil- ity by means of the lactulose/mannitol ratio. First-degree relatives had a 110% higher intestinal permeability after ingesting acetylsali- cylic acid, compared with an increase of 57% in the control subjects. Thirty-five percent were “hyperresponders.”51 A familial permea- bility defect causing increased permeability would be a significant predisposing factor for CD, because a leaky gut is associated with a higher incidence of food allergy and greater absorption of intestinal toxins (see Chapter 19).

## Endotoxemia and the Alternative Complement Pathway

Endotoxemia is associated with both CD and UC.51,52 Endotoxemia- induced activation of the alternative complement pathway could explain some of the extraintestinal (i.e., outside the gastrointestinal tract) manifestations of IBD (discussed later). Whole-gut irrigation significantly reduces the endotoxin pool in the gut and has been shown to have a very beneficial antiendotoxemia effect.53 Colonic irrigation may offer similar benefit. However, colonic irrigation during an acute inflammatory flare may be contraindicated.

## Extraintestinal Manifestations

More than 100 disorders, known as extraintestinal lesions (EILs), con- stitute a diverse group of systemic complications of IBD.54,55 The most common EIL in adults is arthritis, which is found in about 25% of patients. Two types are typically described, the more common being peripheral arthritis affecting the knees, ankles, and wrists. Arthritis is more common in patients with colon involvement. The severity of symptoms is typically proportional to disease activity.54,55 Less frequently, arthritis primarily affects the spine. Symptoms are low back pain and stiffness, with eventual limitation of motion. This EIL occurs predominantly in men with human leukocyte (HLA)-B 27 and is fairly indistinguishable from typical ankylosing spondylitis. In fact, it may antedate the bowel symptoms by several years. There is probably a consistent underlying factor in both the progression of ankylosing spondylitis and IBD.54,55 Skin manifestations are also common, being seen in approximately 15% of patients. Typical lesions are erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, and aphthous ulcerations. Recurrent aphthous stomati- tis occurs in approximately 10% of patients.54,55

Serious liver disease (i.e., sclerosing cholangitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis) is also a common EIL, affecting 3% to 7% of the patients with IBD. It probably relates to the increased endotoxin load associated with IBD. If patients are demonstrating liver enzyme abnor- malities, hepatoprotection appears indicated, with botanical medicines such as Silybum marianum (i.e., silymarin) and curcumin.56–58 Other common EILs are as follows54,55: • Thrombophlebitis • Finger clubbing • Ocular manifestations (episcleritis, iritis, and uveitis) • Nephrolithiasis • Cholelithiasis • In children: failure to grow, thrive, and mature normally

## Malnutrition

Many nutritional complications occur during the course of IBD.59–61 Because these complications can have a significant influence on the morbidity and perhaps also the mortality of these patients, every effort should be made to ensure optimal nutritional status. The major mech- anisms that contribute to nutritional depletion in patients with IBD are listed in Box 186.1. A decreased food intake is the most important mechanism of nutri- tional deficiency in patients with IBD, and a deficient calorie intake is the most common nutritional deficit in patients requiring hospital- ization. Often the patient feels significant pain, diarrhea, nausea, and/ or other symptoms after a meal, resulting in a subtle diminution in dietary intake. Protein-calorie malnutrition and associated weight loss are prevalent in 65% to 75% of patients with IBD.59 Malabsorption can be anticipated in patients with extensive muco- sal involvement of the small intestine and in those who have undergone resection of segments of the small intestine. Particularly common is fat malabsorption, which results in significant loss of calories as well as the loss of fat-soluble vitamins and minerals. Involvement of the ileum or surgical resection of that area typically leads to malabsorption of vita- mins (in particular vitamin B 12 ) and bile acid. Because of the cathartic effect of bile acids on the colon, the malabsorption may result in chronic watery diarrhea. Electrolyte and trace mineral deficiencies should be sus- pected in patients with a history of chronic diarrhea, whereas calcium and magnesium deficiencies may be a result of chronic steatorrhea. Increased secretion of protein into the intestinal lumen and nutri- ent loss due to the exudative and inflammatory nature of IBD are com- mon. In particular, there is a significant loss of plasma proteins across the damaged and inflamed mucosa. The loss of protein may exceed the ability of the liver to replace plasma proteins despite a high pro- tein intake. The chronic loss of blood often leads to iron depletion and anemia. The drugs most commonly used in the allopathic treatment of IBD are corticosteroids and sulfasalazine, both of which increase nutri- tional needs. Corticosteroids are known to have the following effects: • Stimulate protein catabolism • Depress protein synthesis • Decrease the absorption of calcium and phosphorus • Increase the urinary excretion of ascorbic acid, calcium, potassium, and zinc • Increase blood glucose, serum triglyceride, and serum cholesterol levels • Increase the requirements for vitamin B 6 , ascorbic acid, folate, and vitamin D • Decrease bone formation • Impair wound healing Sulfasalazine has been shown to have the following effects62: • Inhibits the absorption and transport of folate • Decreases serum folate and iron • Increases the urinary excretion of ascorbic acid The last consideration in the causes of nutrient deficiency in patients with IBD involves the nutritional consequences of a chronic inflammatory and/or infectious disease. This topic has not been fully investigated; the only conclusion that currently can be drawn is that protein requirements may be raised in patients with acute exacerba- tions of IBD. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate signifies a rise in both protein breakdown and protein synthesis. Typically, patients with IBD require perhaps as much as 25% more protein than the usual recommended allowance.59–61

## Prevalence of Nutritional Deficiencies

The prevalence of nutritional deficiencies is quite high in hospitalized patients with IBD. Although it is generally agreed that the prevalence of nutritional deficiencies is greater in hospitalized patients (who typically are more severely ill) than in outpatients, a great number of ambulatory patients with CD display one or more nutrient deficiencies as well.63 In addition to the deficiencies listed in Table 186.2, low levels of vitamin K, copper, niacin, and vitamin E have been reported.59

## 1480SECTION 6 Diseases


The importance of correcting nutritional deficiencies in patients with IBD cannot be overstated. Deficiencies of both macronutrients and micronutrients cause alterations in gastrointestinal function and structure, which may lead to a vicious cycle—the secondary effects of malnutrition on gastrointestinal tract function and struc- ture may further exacerbate malabsorption, further reducing nutri- ent status. Foremost in nutritional therapy is providing adequate caloric intake. It should be assumed that the majority of patients suffer from micronutrient deficiency, although the deficiency is often subclinical and can be detected only by appropriate labora- tory investigation. In general, patients with IBD should be started on therapeutic vita- min supplements of at least five times the recommended dietary allow- ances (RDAs). Several minerals may also have to be supplemented at equally high levels. Dietary treatment involves the use of either an ele- mental diet or an elimination diet (described later).

## Elemental Diet

The elemental diet has been shown to be an effective nontoxic alter- native to corticosteroids as the primary treatment of acute IBD (Table 186.3).16,21–23 Such a diet is one that is purported to contain all essen- tial nutrients, with protein being provided only as predigested or free- form amino acids. The improvements noted on an elemental diet, however, are probably not primarily related to nutritional improve- ment but could be a result of alterations in the intestinal flora (which have been noted to occur in patients consuming an elemental diet). A stronger case could be made for a secondary immune mechanism being bypassed during elemental feeding: the elemental diet is serving as an allergy-elimination diet. The main drawbacks of the widespread use of elemental diets are their poor palatability and their hyperosmolality, which often result in diarrhea. In addition, hospitalization is often required for satisfactory administration, and relapse is quite common when patients resume normal eating. An elimination diet, rather than an elemental diet, may be a more acceptable alternative in the treatment of acute and partic- ularly of chronic IBD.

## Elimination (Oligoantigenic) Diet

Although food allergy has long been considered an important etiologi- cal factor in the pathogenesis of IBD, studies using an elimination diet in the treatment of IBD have been performed only recently (elimina- tion diets are described in Chapter 14).24–26 These studies demonstrate that an elimination diet is the primary therapy of choice in the treat- ment of chronic IBD. The most common offending foods were found to be wheat and dairy products. An alternative approach is to determine the actual allergens with laboratory methods, preferably a method that measures reactions mediated by both immunoglobulins G (IgG) and E (IgE). The aller- gens are then avoided, or a rotary diversified diet is used as appropriate (see Chapter 46).

## Minerals


Zinc deficiency, a well-known complication of CD, occurs in approx- imately 45% of patients with the disorder.64 Low serum zinc concen- trations, low hair zinc levels, malabsorption of zinc, altered urinary excretion of zinc, and impaired taste acuity are commonly found in patients with CD.60,64 The deficiency of zinc is due to low dietary intake, poor absorption, and excess fecal losses.60–62,64 Zinc deficiency may be the direct cause of the following complications of CD64–66: • Poor healing of fissures and fistulas • Skin lesions (acrodermatitis) • Hypogonadism • Growth retardation • Retinal dysfunction • Depressed cell-mediated immunity • Anorexia • Chronic diarrhea Many patients with CD show no response to oral or intravenous zinc supplementation because such patients appear to have a defect in the tissue transport of zinc. Intravenous supplementation results in a tremendous rise in urinary zinc excretion but insignificant clinical results. Several clinical trials using oral zinc sulfate have shown the same lack of positive effect.67 Administration of zinc in the oral picolinate form may be more advantageous than other forms of zinc, possibly improving both intes- tinal absorption and tissue transport, although one study displayed no significant difference in zinc absorption between zinc sulfate and zinc picolinate in patients with pancreatic insufficiency.68 Zinc citrate may also be an appropriate alternative. In any event, every attempt should be made to ensure that adequate tissue stores of zinc are maintained because disease activity is correlated with zinc deficiency. Parenteral zinc administration may be needed in some cases. Although less than ideal, intravenous administration of zinc is often the only way to attain even marginal zinc levels in patients with CD.67


Magnesium deficiency is often seen in patients with IBD.60,69,70 However, a poor correlation exists between serum magnesium lev- els—which may be low in only a few patients— and intracellular mag- nesium levels, which are commonly decreased in patients with IBD.60

Patients with low intracellular magnesium levels may present with the following problems60: • Weakness • Anorexia • Hypotension • Confusion • Hyperirritability • Tetany • Convulsions • Electrocardiographic or electroencephalographic abnormalities These symptoms are generally responsive to parenteral magnesium supplementation. A daily intravenous dose of 200 to 400 mg of elemental magnesium may be necessary for patients not responding to oral supplementation. Patients with IBD may require this route of supplementation owing to magnesium’s somewhat cathartic action and poor absorption in those with a short bowel. Oral supplementation should be with magnesium chelates (i.e., citrate, aspartate) rather than inorganic magnesium salts (i.e., carbonate).

<!-- chunk -->

## Iron

Iron deficiency anemia is very common in IBD, largely because of chronic blood loss through the gut.60 Serum ferritin levels are the most useful indices of iron status. A serum ferritin concentration of greater than 55 ng/mL indicates adequate iron reserves in bone mar- row, whereas a concentration of less than 18 ng/mL is highly predictive of iron deficiency (see Chapter 23 for further discussion). The clini- cian should attempt to increase the patient’s iron stores by improv- ing absorption, as with supplemental vitamin C, rather than through direct iron supplementation, which promotes intestinal infection.71


Patients with IBD are also at risk for the development of calcium defi- ciency, probably owing to the following factors60: • Loss of absorptive surfaces • Steatorrhea • Corticosteroid use • Vitamin D deficiency

## Potassium

Diarrheal diseases are often associated with potassium and other elec- trolyte deficiencies. Although symptoms of potassium deficiency are quite rare in patients with IBD, levels of this mineral are probably below optimum. In one study, nutritional support to correct potas- sium deficiency resulted in significantly reduced rates of surgical complications.72

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamins


Low serum retinol levels are found in approximately 20% of patients with CD and are correlated with the activity of the disease.60,66 Vitamin A can profoundly affect the metabolism and differentiation of the intes- tinal epithelial mucosa because it can increase the number of goblet cells, the production of mucins, and the secretion of mucus; moreover, it can restore normal barrier function. Preliminary case reports indi- cated that vitamin A may be of therapeutic use in CD.73,74 However, long-term controlled trials have shown that vitamin A (50,000 IU twice daily) has no therapeutic effect in the majority of patient with CD.75,76 It should be kept in mind, however, that certain individuals may respond to vitamin A therapy and that zinc supplementation will often normalize disturbances of vitamin A metabolism because zinc is a necessary component of retinol-binding protein.66


Vitamin D deficiency is quite common in IBD, with laboratory evi- dence of this in 75% of patients with CD and 35% of patients with UC.60,77 It is probably due to decreased absorption of 25-hydroxyvita- min D. Patients with IBD are at increased risk for the development of metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis and osteomalacia. This relates to previously mentioned factors in calcium deficiency. Vitamin D plays an important role in supporting proper immune regulation, much like probiotics; both influence T-regulatory cell function and dampen proinflammatory cytokines produced in animal models of IBD. Clinical studies using vitamin D at supraphysiological doses are under way.


Vitamin E deficiency can occur in IBD, as observed in one case report.78 The patient had a 25-year history of CD and had undergone multiple small bowel resections. Presenting symptoms relating to vitamin E deficiency were as follows: • Bilateral visual field scotomata • Generalized motor weakness • A broad-based gait with marked ataxia • Brisk reflexes • A bilateral Babinski response This patient’s serum vitamin E concentration was 0.03 mg/dL (normal is 0.8–1.2 mg/dL), and in vitro peroxide hemolysis was 100% (normal is <10%). Supplementation with 270 IU/day of vitamin E eventually brought complete recovery over a period of 2 years. Vitamin E supplementation is also indicated because of its abil- ity to inhibit the formation of leukotrienes and reduce free-radical damage.79

## Vitamin K

Vitamin K deficiency, resulting in the formation of abnormal pro- thrombin (deficient in gamma-carboxyglutamic acid), is quite com- mon in patients with IBD.80,81 It also contributes to the osteoporosis and osteopenia that are so often seen in patients with CD.82 The best laboratory test to diagnose early vitamin K deficiency before lowered serum levels is to measure the incomplete gamma-carboxylation of specific serum proteins such as osteocalcin and prothrombin. Low vitamin K status has been linked to bone disease by incomplete car- boxylation of osteocalcin and coronary artery disease by unknown mechanisms. Vitamin K 2 deficiency is tested my measuring PIVKA II (protein in the absence of vitamin K carboxylation) and/or uncarbox- ylated osteocalcin by laboratories such as Quest and LabCorp as well as many designer specialty laboratories.

<!-- chunk -->

## Folic Acid

Low serum concentrations of folic acid are common in IBD, with reports of occurrence ranging between 25% and 64% of cases.60,82–84 The drug sulfasalazine exacerbates the condition by interfering with folate-dependent enzymes and with the intestinal folate transport sys- tem.85 A folate deficiency promotes further malabsorption through alteration in the structure of the intestinal mucosal cells.86 These cells have a very rapid turnover (1–4 days) compared with red blood cells (RBCs; 3–4 months); therefore deficiency affects mucosal cells much earlier than RBCs. Testing CD patients for elevations in serum homo- cysteine or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for enzymes involved in the methylation of folate, such as methyl-tetrahydrofolate reductase, may provide valuable diagnostic tools for the early detection of aberrant folate metabolism in patients with CD. Patients with UC, on the other hand, require supplemental folate to reduce their higher risk of colon cancer.

## 1482SECTION 6 Diseases


There is a significant correlation between vitamin B 12 absorption and the extent of terminal ileal disease and/or resection.60,87 Overall, abnor- mal Schilling test results are found in 48% of patients with CD. When ileal resection exceeds 90 cm, the Schilling test result is abnormal in all patients and does not improve with time. If the length of the resection or the extent of the inflammatory lesion is less than 60 cm, adequate absorption may occur.

<!-- chunk -->

## Ascorbic Acid

A low vitamin C intake is common in patients with IBD, particularly in those on a low-fiber diet.60,88 Ascorbic acid levels in serum and leu- kocytes are significantly lower in patients with CD than in matched controls.60,88 Vitamin C is thought to be particularly important in the prevention of fistula formation. It has been shown that patients with fistulas have lower ascorbic acid levels than patients without them.89

<!-- chunk -->

## Antioxidant Defenses

Increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant defenses in the mucosa are hallmark features of IBD.90 Patients with IBD have height- ened oxidative stress and associated protein and DNA oxidative dam- age).90 Likewise, IBD patients have serum and mucosal deficiencies in antioxidant defenses such as selenium-dependent glutathione peroxi- dase and copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, along with cofactors for these enzyme systems (i.e., zinc, copper) and others (i.e., ascorbate, vitamin E, vitamin A), as previously described in this chapter.90

## Other Nutrients

Obviously, patients with IBD are at risk for the development of any nutrient deficiency, including nutrients not discussed here. However, there is probably no real need for laboratory investigation to determine micronutrient deficiencies other than for the nutrients discussed here.60

## Recommendation for a High-Potency Multivitamin/

## Multimineral Formula

It is absolutely essential that patients with IBD take a high-potency multivitamin/multimineral supplement comprising all the known vitamins and minerals. Table 186.4 lists recommendations for an opti- mal intake range. In addition, patients with IBD should consume additional antiox- idants (rationale provided previously). The two primary antioxidants in the human body are vitamins C and E. Vitamin C is an “aqueous phase” antioxidant, whereas vitamin E is a “lipid phase” antioxidant. Recommended doses in patients with IBD are as follows: • Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols with approximately 40% gamma-to- copherol): 400 to 800 IU • Vitamin C (ascorbic acid): 1000 to 3000 mg

## Curcumin

Turmeric, the major spice in curry, is a natural spice made from the herb Curcuma longa, a member of the ginger family. In addition to being a culinary staple, it has been used in Ayurvedic medicine since ancient times. The major chemical constituents of turmeric are cur- cuminoids, the most prominent of which is curcumin. Recently, the investigational focus has shifted toward the role of curcumin as an intracellular signaling agent, and studies have demonstrated that, much like green tea polyphenols, curcumin is an inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)- κ B and leads to downstream regulation and inhibition of proin- flammatory genes and cytokines (see Fig. 186.2).91 Administration of curcumin has also been reported to modulate a host of other cytokines and signaling pathways, including iNOS, MMP-9, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α ), JNK, p38, AKT, JAK, ERK, and PKC.92 Four studies involving curcumin administration in murine colitis models showed clinical and histopathological improvement and, where mea- sured, decreased inflammatory cytokine production.93–95 These find- ings were echoed in three further studies involving rodent models of colitis.96–98 In 2005 Holt and colleagues reported the preliminary results of a pilot study involving open-label administration of a curcumin prepa- ration to five patients with UC and five patients with CD. Of these patients, 9 reported improvement at the conclusion of the 2-month study. Of the five patients with UC, four were able to decrease or elim- inate their medications.99 In a larger randomized, double-blind, mul- ticenter trial involving 89 patients with quiescent UC, administration of 1 g of curcumin twice daily resulted in both clinical improvement and a statistically significant decrease in the rate of relapse.100 Given its excellent safety profile, its plausible mechanism for affecting inflam- mation, and the results just described, curcumin is poised to have a prominent role in the future management of IBD. Table 186.5 sum- marizes the results of the randomized controlled clinical trials for cur- cumin in ulcerative colitis.

## Boswellia

The Ayurvedic herb Boswellia serrata (Indian frankincense) contains boswellic acids, which inhibit leukotriene biosynthesis in neutro- philic granulocytes by noncompetitive inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase.101 During a small 6-week trial, 350 mg three times a day of Boswellia gum

resin was as effective as sulfasalazine (1000 mg three times a day) in reducing symptoms or laboratory abnormalities of patients with active UC.102 The rate of remission was 82% with Boswellia and 75% with sulfasalazine.103 In a randomized, double-blind study from Germany, a proprietary Boswellia extract, H15, was found as effective as mesala- zine in improving symptoms of active CD.104 Table 186.6 summarizes the results of the randomized controlled clinical trials for Boswellia in inflammatory bowel disease.

## Quercetin

The plant flavonoid quercetin appears to be particularly indicated in the treatment of IBD. Flavonoids in general are considered natural biological response modifiers.105,106 Quercetin, as perhaps the most pharmacologically active flavonoid, has remarkable effects on a variety of enzyme systems,105,106 and many of the enzymes thus affected are important in the secretory, contractile, and motility processes asso- ciated with the inflammatory response: the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators from mast cells, basophils, neutro- phils, and macrophages; migration and infiltration of leukocytes; and smooth muscle contraction. Quercetin’s effect on these enzymes and processes is likely due to a common action—antagonizing calmodulin.107 When bound to calm- odulin, calcium activates a great variety of enzymes, including those involved in cyclic nucleotide metabolism, protein phosphorylation, secretory function, muscle contraction, microtubule assembly, gly- cogen metabolism, and calcium flux. Quercetin is believed to interact directly with calmodulin and calcium channels. This has been shown in many experimental studies and would explain quercetin’s effect on such a wide number of enzymes. Quercetin and many other flavonoids have been shown to be potent inhibitors of mast cell and basophil degranulation.108–111 A generally accepted hypothesis for this action is that quercetin inhib- its receptor-mediated calcium influx, thereby inhibiting the primary signal for degranulation. However, quercetin is also active under con- ditions in which the calcium channel mechanism is not operative, indicating that other mechanisms are responsible as well. Quercetin has been shown to inhibit many of the inflammatory processes attributed to activated neutrophils.112 This is probably due to its membrane-stabilizing action, potent antioxidant effect (which prevents the production of free radicals and inflammatory leukot- rienes), and inhibition of the enzyme hyaluronidase (thus prevent- ing the breakdown of the collagen matrix of connective tissue and ground substance). Quercetin’s membrane-stabilizing effect could also account for its action in preventing mast cell and basophil degranula- tion. The effect also inhibits inflammation by decreasing neutrophil lysosomal enzyme secretion.112 (Neutrophils and monocytes contain lysosomes that, on secretion of their contents, contribute greatly to the inflammatory process.) Quercetin has been shown to inhibit many steps in eicosanoid metabolism. Probably of most significance in IBD is its inhibition of phospholipase A 2 and lipoxygenase enzymes.105,106,113 The net result is a significant reduction in the formation of leukotrienes. Excessive leukotriene formation has been linked to asthma, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, gout, and possibly cancer as well as IBD.114,115 The leu- kotrienes C 4 , D 4 , and E 4 (composing the slow-reacting substances of

anaphylaxis [SRS-A]) are derived from arachidonic acid and are times as potent as histamine in promoting inflammation. Leukotrienes promote inflammation by causing vasoconstriction (thereby increas- ing vascular permeability) and other smooth muscle contraction and by promoting white blood cell (WBC) chemotaxis and aggregation. The reduction of leukotriene formation has significant anti-inflamma- tory effects, particularly in IBD. (For more information on quercetin, see Chapter 81). Despite the overwhelming evidence supporting the role of quercetin in preventing and improving inflammation in IBD, only three of six animal model–based studies showed a positive effect. Authors have speculated that the methylation of quercetin in the gut is variable in IBD, which could explain the inconsistent results observed thus far. Clinical trials in humans are thus far lacking, so no conclu- sions can be drawn.

## Aloe Vera

Aloe vera gel has a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the produc- tion of the reactive oxygen metabolites prostaglandin E2 and (at high doses) interleukin (IL)-8 by human colonic epithelial cells grown in tissue culture.116 When administered via the oral route, aloe vera gel at 100 mL twice a day for 4 weeks produced a clinical response signifi- cantly more often than placebo (response ratio 5.6) in patients with UC.117 Remission occurred in 30% of patients taking aloe vera gel and 7% of those receiving a placebo. In this clinical trial, aloe also reduced histological disease activity, whereas placebo did not. No significant side effects were described in the aforementioned trials on aloe vera for UC, although it should be noted that aloe vera gel is often used as a laxative. Acemannan, an extract of aloe vera, concentrated to a mucopolysaccharide (MPS) concentration of 30% of solid weight, has been demonstrated to reduce symptoms and indices of inflammation in controlled studies of patients with UC.118

## Bastyr Formula (Modified Robert Formula)

Although no research has been done to document its efficacy, an old naturopathic remedy, the Robert formula or its modification (Bastyr formula), has a long history of use in IBD (Box 186.2). It is composed of the following botanical medicines: • Althea officinalis (also known as marshmallow root)—a demulcent with soothing effects on the mucous membranes • Baptisia tinctora (also known as wild indigo)—used for gastrointes- tinal infections • Echinacea angustifolia (also known as purple coneflower)—anti- bacterial and used to promote normalization of the immune system (see Chapter 75) • Geranium maculatum—a gastrointestinal hemostatic • Hydrastis canadensis (also known as goldenseal)—inhibits the growth of many enteropathic bacteria (see Chapter 86) • Phytolacca americana (also known as poke root)—used for healing ulcerations of the intestinal mucosa • Symphytum offinale (also known as comfrey)—anti-inflammatory and a promoter of tissue growth and wound healing • Ulmus fulva (also known as slippery elm)—a demulcent The cabbage powder is used because of its documented ability to heal gastrointestinal ulcers (see Chapter 207), pancreatin is used to assist in the digestive process (see Chapter 100), niacinamide is used for its anti-inflammatory effects, and duodenal substance is used because it also heals gastrointestinal ulcers.

## Butyrate Enemas in Ulcerative Colitis

The short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)—mainly acetate, propionate, and butyrate—arise in the colon as end products of bacterial carbohydrate fermentation. These SCFAs function as primary energy sources for the luminal colon cells, especially in the distal segments. Decreased levels or decreased utilization of SCFAs leading to impaired cellular energet- ics have been hypothesized to play a major role in UC (Fig. 186.5). On the basis of this hypothesis, several clinical trials have been conducted with enemas providing SCFAs (usually composed of either butyrate as a sole agent in concentrations ranging from 80 to 100 mmol/L or SCFA combinations composed of acetate 60 mmol/L, propionate 25 mmol/L, and butyrate 40 mmol/L; Table 186.7). Excellent preliminary results in pilot studies have led to a well-designed double-blind study.73,119 In this study, 47 patients with distal UC randomly received either a combination of SCFAs, butyrate, or a placebo in an enema form retained for 30 minutes twice daily.73 The primary end point of the study was the disease activity index composed of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance, and physician rating of disease activity as well as endoscopic examination. After 8 weeks of therapy, there was a drop in activity in all three groups, with the butyrate group show- ing the lowest disease activity. Endoscopic examination demonstrated less disease in the butyrate and SCFA combination groups. Complete remission occurred in 47% receiving SCFAs, 38% receiving butyrate, and 25% receiving placebo. This study and others indicate that butyr- ate and SCFA enemas may prove to be useful adjuncts in the treatment of UC. There is a total of four studies demonstrating improved healing of patients with left-sided UC that is refractory to standard medical therapy.

## Prebiotics

Prebiotics are nondigestible food ingredients that stimulate the growth or modify the metabolic activity of intestinal bacterial species that have the potential to improve the health of their human host. The criteria associated with the notion that a food ingredient should be classified as a prebiotic are that it remain undigested and unabsorbed as it passes through the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and that it be a selective substrate for the growth of specific strains of beneficial bac- teria (usually lactobacilli or bifidobacteria) rather than for all colonic bacteria. Prebiotic food ingredients include bran, psyllium husk, resis- tant (high-amylose) starch, inulin (a polymer of fructofuranose), lact- ulose, and various natural or synthetic oligosaccharides, which consist of short-chain complexes of sucrose, galactose, fructose, glucose, malt- ose, or xylose. The best-known effect of prebiotics is to increase fecal water content, relieving constipation. Bacterial fermentation of prebi- otics yields SCFAs like butyrate. Several studies have suggested ben- efits of various prebiotics for the treatment of patients with UC. For instance, when oat bran at 60 g/day (supplying 20 g of dietary fiber) was given to patients with UC, fecal butyrate was increased by 36%, and abdominal pain improved.120 A dietary supplement containing fish oil and two types of indigestible carbohydrate, FOS and xanthan gum, mucinIgA Tight junction Antimicrobial peptides apoptosis

Fig. 186.5 Role of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the regulation of mucosal immune responses. SCFAs regulate intestinal mucosal immunity by exerting their effects on various immune cells. SCFAs regulate intestinal barrier integrity by inducing intestinal epithelial cell secretion of interleukin-18 (IL-18), antimicrobial peptides, and mucin and upregulating the expression of tight junctions. SCFAs induce neutrophil migration to inflammatory sites and enhance their phagocytosis ability. SCFAs regulate T-cell function not only through the GPCR pathway but also through the inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDAC). The differentiation of T cells is mediated both by SCFA regulation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the direct action of SCFAs on T cells. SCFAs regulate the generation of T-helper type-1 (Th1), T-helper type-17 (Th17), and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in different cytokine milieu. SCFAs also inhibit intestinal macrophage production of proinflamamtory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), through inhibition of HDAC, and possibly induce intestinal immunoglobulin A (IgA) production by B cells. Moreover, SCFAs inhibit carcinogenesis by promoting apoptosis and suppressing the proliferation of tumor cells. (Original figure published in Sun M, et al.

allowed a reduction of glucocorticoid dose as compared with a placebo in patients with steroid-dependent UC.121 Other prebiotic trials for UC included a Japanese germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) containing hemicellulose-rich fiber; given at a dose of 20 to 30 g/day, it was found to increase stool butyrate concentration,122 decrease the clinical activ- ity index of patients with active disease,123 and prolong remission in patients with inactive disease.124 A mixture of Bifidobacterium longum and inulin-derived FOS administered for 1 month as monotherapy to patients with UC produced improvement in sigmoidoscopic appear- ance, histology, and several biochemical indices of tissue inflammation versus a placebo control.125

## Probiotics in Inflammatory Bowel Disease

The term probiotics refers to beneficial bacteria and yeasts that can be administered orally to achieve a therapeutic benefit. The results of studies for the use of probiotics in IBD are summarized in Table 186.8. Overall, patients with UC do benefit from using probiotics during an active flare of their disease, and there is a benefit of probiotics for maintaining remissions. The studies to date have shown inconsistent results with all strains of probiotics for CD overall. However, supple- mentation with the beneficial yeast Saccharomyces boulardii is a safe and effective treatment for patients with CD, helping reduce diarrhea, intestinal inflammation, and the risk of relapse.126,127 Common doses of S. boulardii are 250 mg three to four times a day. Likewise, supple- mentation with Lactobacillus-GG has proved to be of benefit in patients with CD; the customary dose is 1010 colony-forming units (CFUs) in enteric-coated tablets twice a day.128,129

## Fecal Calprotectin

Calprotectin is a protein secreted into the intestinal lumen in direct proportion to inflammation. Measurement of calprotectin in stool samples has been shown to be a sensitive and specific noninvasive assessment for inflammation in patients with IBD, and the test is help- ful for distinguishing IBD from other, noninflammatory gastrointesti- nal conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome.130

The CDAI was developed as a monitoring tool in the NCCDS.131 It met the basic requirements necessary for the study—providing uniform clinical parameters that could be assessed and producing a consistent numerical index for recording the results of the study of several centers over several years. In general, CDAI scores below 150 indicate a better prognosis than higher scores. The CDAI is a very useful way to monitor the progress of therapy.

## Monitoring of the Pediatric Patient

Pediatric patients with IBD present a particularly difficult problem in that it is often very difficult for them to achieve normal growth and development. Growth failure occurs in 75% of children with CD and in 25% of children with UC.62 The pediatric patient with IBD should be evaluated at least twice yearly. Evaluation should include a perti- nent history, clinical anthropometry, Tanner staging, and appropri- ate laboratory testing. Box 186.3 outlines the necessary components of a comprehensive, twice-yearly nutritional evaluation in pediatric patients with IBD. An aggressive nutritional program should be insti- tuted, including supplements (it may be necessary to use enteral or parenteral methods in some patients), which is similar to the approach outlined for the adult patient, with the doses adjusted as appropriate. The CDAI is not as accurate in monitoring the disease in children as it is in adults. To overcome this shortcoming, Lloyd-Still and Green132 devised a clinical scoring system for IBD in children. It is divided into five major divisions (the maximum score is in parentheses): general activity (10), physical examination and clinical complications (30), nutrition (20), radiography (15), and laboratory (25). An elevated score (i.e., scores in the 80s) represents good status, whereas scores in the 30s and 40s represent severe disease.

## 1487CHAPTER 186 Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis)


It is important to recognize that in some patients, CD and UC are life-threatening diseases that at times require emergency treatment. A small percentage of patients who have severe colitis may experience severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization. This is more common in patients with UC, who typically present with a fever of 101°F or higher; profuse, constant, loose, bloody stools; anorexia; and apathy and prostration; and although abdominal signs may be normal, physi- cal examination will uncover a distended abdomen, tympany, absence of bowel sounds, and even rebound tenderness. For the typical patient, IBD is a chronic disease requiring long-term therapy and follow-up. The first step is to identify and remove all fac- tors that may be initiating or aggravating the inflammatory reaction, such as food allergens and carrageenan. The patient is started on a diet that maximizes macronutrients and micronutrients while minimizing aggravating foods and nonfoods. A broad-based, individualized nutritional supplementation plan is necessary for all patients with IBD. Particularly important are the nutrients zinc, magnesium, folic acid, and vitamin A. Nutritional sup- plements are used as appropriate to correct deficiencies, normalize the inflammatory process, and promote healing of the damaged mucosa. Botanical medicines are used to promote healing and normalize the intestinal flora.


All allergens—as well as wheat, corn, dairy products, and carrageenan-containing foods—should be eliminated. The diet should be high in complex carbohydrates and low in sugar and refined carbohydrates. Fiber is poorly tolerated in Crohn’s disease with luminal narrowing, whereas complex carbohydrates are prebiotic for fostering healthy enteric flora and have been shown to be helpful for ulcerative colitis.133


• Multivitamin and mineral supplements with trace mineral cofac- tors for antioxidant systems • Magnesium: 200 mg/day. Higher dosages may be required. • Zinc picolinate or carnosine: 37.5 mg of zinc L carnosine or 50 mg of picolinate. Please be cautioned that long-term use of zinc supplements can deplete the body’s copper storage and lead to neurologic problems. • Vitamin E: 400 to 800 IU/day mixed tocopherols • Fish oil: 4,000-5,000 mg of combined EPA/DHA daily. • Choose one of the following: • Quercetin: 400 mg 20 minutes before meals • Grape seed extract (>95% procyanidolic oligomers): 150 to mg/day • Pine bark extract (>90% procyanidolic oligomers): 150 to mg/day • Prebiotics (inulin, fructose oligosaccharides, etc.): 5 g/day • Short-chain fatty acid enemas (60 mL of 80–100 mmol/L) nightly for left-sided colitis


• Curcumin from turmeric (C. longa): 1000 two to three times a day before meals • Boswellia extract: equivalent to 400 mg boswellic acids three times a day • Aloe vera: Choose one of the following: • Aloe vera gel: oral preparations can be consumed at a dose of 100 mL a day . Diarrhea is a potential side effect. The prepara- tion needs to be a “latex-free” distilled preparation that is 100% pure aloe gel. Otherwise there is a risk of toxicity. • Aloe vera juice: a variety of different preparations types and concentrations make accurate dose recommendations difficult. They can be consumed orally as a beverage or tonic. • Acemannan: 400 to 800 mg/day • Bastyr formula: 2 to 3 “00” capsules with each meal

## 1489CHAPTER 187 Insomnia and Other Sleep Disorders

In both obstructive and central sleep apnea, obesity is the major risk factor, and weight loss is the most important aspect of long-term management. People with sleep apnea experience periods of anoxia (oxygen deprivation of the brain) with each apneic episode, which ends in arousal and a reinitiation of breathing. Seldom does the sufferer awaken enough to be aware of the problem. However, the combination of frequent periods of oxygen deprivation (20 to several hundred times per night) and the greatly disturbed sleep can significantly diminish the sufferer’s quality of life and lead to serious problems.5 The most common treatment of sleep apnea is the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). In this procedure, the patient wears a mask over the nose during sleep, and pressure from an air blower forces air through the nasal passages. The air pressure is adjusted so that it is just enough to prevent the throat from col- lapsing during sleep. The pressure is constant and continuous. Nasal CPAP prevents airway closure while in use, but episodes of apnea return when CPAP is stopped or used improperly. Surgery to reduce soft tissue in the throat or soft palate should be used only as a last resort because it is often unsuccessful and may aggravate the condition. Laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty is a highly promoted surgical option. In this procedure, lasers are used to surgically remove excessive soft tissue from the back of the throat and the palate. About 90% of sleep apnea sufferers receive benefit initially. However, within a year, many people regress or end up worse than before the procedure as a result of the formation of scar tissue.5

## Normal Sleep Patterns

Human sleep is perhaps one of the least understood physiological pro- cesses. Its value to human health and proper functioning is without question. Sleep is absolutely essential to both the body and the mind. Impaired sleep, altered sleep patterns, and sleep deprivation impair mental and physical function. Normal adult sleep–wake patterns repeat themselves on an approx- imately 24-hour cycle, of which sleep constitutes one third. Exactly how much sleep is required varies from one person to the next. Sleep tends to decrease with age, but whether this tendency is a normal or abnormal progression is unknown. A 1-year-old baby requires about 14 hours of sleep a day, a 5-year-old about 12 hours, and adults about 7 to 9 hours. Women tend to require more sleep than men. The elderly tend to sleep less at night but doze more during the day than do younger adults. From observations of eye movement and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, sleep is divided into two distinct types: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep. During REM sleep, the eyes move rapidly and dreaming takes place. When people are awak- ened during non-REM sleep, they report that they were thinking about everyday matters but rarely report dreams. Non-REM sleep is divided into stages 1 through 4 according to the level of EEG activity and ease of arousal. As sleep progresses, there is a deepening of sleep and slower brainwave activity until REM sleep ensues, when suddenly the brain becomes much more active. In adults, the first REM sleep cycle is usually triggered 90 minutes after going to sleep and lasts about 5 to 10 minutes. After the flurry of activity, brain- wave patterns return to those of non-REM sleep for another 90-minute sleep cycle. Each night, most adults experience five or more sleep cycles. REM sleep periods grow progressively longer as sleep continues; the last sleep cycle may produce a REM sleep period that can last about an hour. Non-REM sleep lasts approximately 50% of this 90-minute sleep cycle in infants and about 80% in adults. As people age, in addition to less REM sleep, they tend to awaken at the transition from non-REM to REM sleep.

## The Importance of Adequate Sleep

Adequate sleep is absolutely necessary for long-term health and regen- eration. Many physiological processes occur during sleep, but perhaps the most important are the increased secretion of growth hormone (GH) and the scavenging of free radicals in the brain.

## 1490SECTION 6 Diseases

Many of the benefits of sleep are probably mediated through GH. As an anabolic hormone, GH has been called by some the “antiaging” hormone. GH stimulates tissue regeneration, liver regeneration, mus- cle building, breakdown of fat stores, normalization of blood sugar, and a host of other beneficial processes in the body. It also helps con- vert fat to muscle. Small amounts of GH are secreted at various times during the day, but essentially all secretion of GH occurs during sleep. Sleep is required to ensure minimal neuronal damage from free radicals accumulated during waking. Most people can tolerate a few days without sleep and fully recover. However, chronic sleep depriva- tion accelerates aging of the brain, causes neuronal damage, and pro- duces nighttime elevations in cortisol.6


Insomnia is initiated or maintained by several psychological and phys- iological factors, which should be addressed before inducing sleep pharmacologically (Fig. 187.2). Counseling and/or stress-reduction techniques (including biofeedback and hypnosis) may be indicated in many cases. The following topics are discussed in this chapter as they relate to the promotion of sleep: • Exercise • Progressive relaxation • Nocturnal glucose levels • Serotonin precursor and cofactor therapy • 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) • Cofactors for serotonin synthesis • Melatonin • Restless legs syndrome and nocturnal myoclonus • Botanicals with sedative properties


Regular physical exercise is known to improve general well-being and promote improvement in sleep quality.3 Exercise should be performed in the morning or early evening, not before bedtime, and should be of moderate intensity. Usually 20 minutes of aerobic exercise at a heart rate between 60% and 75% of maximum (maximum heart rate is approximately 220 minus the patient’s age in years) is sufficient.

<!-- chunk -->

## Progressive Relaxation

Progressive relaxation is based on a simple procedure comparing ten- sion with relaxation. Each muscle is first forcefully contracted for a period of 1 to 2 seconds and then relaxed. Because the procedure goes progressively through all the muscles of the body, a deep state of relax- ation results. The procedure begins with contraction of the muscles of the face and neck, with the contraction held for at least 1 or 2 seconds. Next, the upper arms and chest are contracted and then relaxed, fol- lowed by the lower arms and hands. The process is repeated progres- sively down the body—abdomen, buttocks, thighs, calves, and feet. This whole practice is repeated two or three times or until sleep is produced.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nocturnal Glucose Levels

Increased nocturnal blood glucose volatility may be an important cause of sleep-maintenance insomnia, especially when there are rapid drops in blood glucose levels. The brain is highly dependent on glucose as an energy substrate, and a quick drop in blood glucose level pro- motes awakening via the release of glucose regulatory hormones (e.g., epinephrine, glucagon, cortisol, and GH). Increased nocturnal blood glucose volatility and/or hypoglycemia must be ruled out in mainte- nance-type insomnia (see Chapter 181).

## Serotonin Precursor and Cofactor Therapy

Serotonin is an important initiator of sleep. The synthesis of central nervous system (CNS) serotonin depends on the availability of trypto- phan (discussed in more detail in Chapter 76, 5-HTP).

## Tryptophan

l-Tryptophan has shown modest effects in the treatment of insom- nia,7–9 and although not every patient responded to l-tryptophan in clinical trials, those who have experienced dramatic relief. It is gen- erally more effective in sleep-onset insomnia and less effective in sleep-maintenance insomnia. Advantages of l-tryptophan versus over- the-counter (OTC) and prescription pills include limited distortions

## 1491CHAPTER 187 Insomnia and Other Sleep Disorders

of normal sleep processes and no withdrawal symptoms. Doses smaller than 2000 mg are generally ineffective. The sleep-promoting effect of l-tryptophan is believed to be due to enhanced serotonin synthesis, but there is evidence to suggest that other mechanisms may also be responsible or contributory, includ- ing l-tryptophan–enhanced melatonin synthesis. Administration of l-tryptophan causes a massive elevation of plasma melatonin con- centration.10 Although l-tryptophan reduces sleep latency, it exerts effects in normal subjects that are at odds with the serotonin system, such as reducing REM sleep and increasing non-REM sleep.11,12 Drugs that prevent the conversion of tryptophan to serotonin enhance these effects. From this information, it is concluded that some of l-trypto- phan’s effects on sleep do not involve the serotonin or melatonin sys- tem. As discussed in Chapter 87, the effects of l-tryptophan can be negated by conversion via the kynurenine pathway. This conversion can be partially inhibited by niacin (30 mg is an appropriate dose), thereby enhancing the effects of l-tryptophan. The insomnia-relieving and sleep-promoting actions of l-trypto- phan appear to be cumulative, because it often takes a few nights for l-tryptophan to start working. In a double-blind study, the effects of 3 g of l-tryptophan on sleep performance, arousal threshold, and brain electrical activity during sleep were assessed in 20 males with chronic sleep-onset insomnia.13 After a sleep laboratory screening night, all subjects received placebo for three consecutive nights; then 10 subjects received l-tryptophan and 10 received a placebo for six nights. All sub- jects received placebo on two withdrawal nights. l-Tryptophan had no effect on sleep latency during the first three nights of administration. However, on nights four through six of administration, sleep latency was significantly reduced. Consistent with other studies, this study found that unlike sleeping pills (benzodiazepines especially), l-tryp- tophan did not alter sleep stages, impair performance, or alter brain electrical activity during sleep. This study indicates that l-tryptophan should be used for a minimum of 1 week to gauge its effectiveness in chronic insomnia. Administration of high-dose l-tryptophan (4 g) during the day can promote sleep. This indicates that the consumption of foods high in tryptophan during the day may contribute to daytime sleepiness, and an evening meal high in tryptophan in relation to com- peting amino acids may promote sleep. The important cofactors vitamin B 6 , niacin, and magnesium should be administered along with the tryptophan to ensure its conversion to serotonin. Also, because other amino acids compete with tryptophan for transport into the CNS across the blood–brain barrier and insulin increases tryptophan uptake by the CNS, protein consumption should be avoided near administration, and a carbohydrate source such as fruit or fruit juice should accompany the tryptophan.

<!-- chunk -->

## 5-Hydroxytryptophan

5-HTP is one step closer to serotonin than l-tryptophan and does not depend on a transport system for entry into the brain. Several clinical studies have shown 5-HTP to produce dramatically better results than l-tryptophan in promoting and maintaining sleep.14–17 One of the key benefits of 5-HTP is its ability to increase REM sleep (typically by about 25%) while increasing deep sleep stages 3 and without lengthening total sleep time.11,12 The dosage recommendation of 5-HTP is 100 to 300 mg, 30 to 45 minutes before retiring. The patient should start with the lower dose for at least 3 days before increasing it. For more information, see Chapter 87.

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin B Complex

B vitamins play a significant role in the manufacture of serotonin, and deficiencies can affect both sleep quality and sleep quantity. Niacin has been reported to have a sedative effect, probably owing to its peripheral dilating action and shunting of tryptophan metabolism toward sero- tonin synthesis. Cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 2005–2006 found inde- pendent inverse associations between serum vitamin B 12 and sleep duration as well as between folate and sleep disturbance.18 A study of 87 adults aged 21 to 45 years found that insomniacs consumed sig- nificantly less energy, carbohydrates, folic acid, and vitamin B 12 than normal sleepers.19 Further, intakes of protein, fat, and thiamine were significantly different in insomniacs.


Magnesium is a cofactor in the synthesis of serotonin as well as an N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonist and gamma-ami- nobutyric acid (GABA) agonists and seems to play a key role in the regulation of sleep. One double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted to determine the efficacy of magnesium supplementation to improve insomnia in elderly individuals.20 Forty-six elderly subjects randomly allocated into the magnesium or the placebo group received 500 mg magnesium or a placebo daily for 8 weeks. Compared with the placebo group, in the experimental group, dietary magnesium sup- plementation brought about statistically significant increases in sleep time, sleep efficiency, and concentration of serum melatonin and also resulted in a significant decrease in sleep-onset latency and serum cor- tisol concentration.

<!-- chunk -->

## Melatonin

Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland, and its production is based on light cues, increased at night and inhibited during the day. Supplementation with melatonin has been shown in several studies to be effective in helping induce and maintain sleep in children and adults, people with normal sleep patterns, and those with insomnia. However, the sleep-promoting effects of melatonin are most apparent only if melatonin levels are low.21 In other words, melatonin has a sed- ative effect only when endogenous melatonin levels are low. Melatonin appears to be most effective in treating insomnia in the elderly, in whom low melatonin levels are common.22 In one study, 26 elderly insomniacs with lower-than-normal mel- atonin levels were given 1 to 2 mg of melatonin 2 hours before the desired bedtime for 1 week. Rapid- and slow-release melatonin prepa- rations were used. Both sleep latency and sleep quality were evaluated. Although there was no discernible difference in sleep onset or sleep efficiency (time asleep as a percentage of total time in bed) between the two forms, the slow-release form yielded better effects on sleep maintenance.23 A 2017 meta-analysis assessed the therapeutic effects of exogenous melatonin in treating primary sleep disorders.24 The results showed that melatonin had significant effects on sleep-onset latency in primary insomnia, delayed-sleep-phase syndrome, and regulation of the non-24 sleep–wake syndrome compared with placebo. Doses as low as 0.1 and 0.3 mg have been shown to produce a sed- ative effect when melatonin levels are low.25 Common doses of mela- tonin range from 0.2 to 3 mg. Although melatonin appears to have no serious side effects at recommended doses, melatonin supplementation could conceivably disrupt the normal circadian rhythm. In one study, a dosage of 8 mg/day for only 4 days resulted in significant alterations in hormone secretions.26 For more information, see Chapter 92.

## Restless Legs Syndrome and Nocturnal Myoclonus

Restless legs syndrome and nocturnal myoclonus are significant causes of insomnia. Restless legs syndrome is characterized during waking by an irresistible urge to move the legs. Almost all patients with restless legs syndrome have nocturnal myoclonus,1 a neuromuscular disorder characterized by repeated contractions of one or more muscle groups,

## 1492SECTION 6 Diseases

typically of the leg, during sleep. Each jerk usually lasts less than seconds. The patient is normally unaware of the myoclonus and com- plains only of either frequent nocturnal awakenings or excessive day- time sleepiness, but questioning of the sleep partner often discovers the myoclonus. If there is a family history of restless legs syndrome (present in about one third of all cases of the syndrome), high-dose folic acid, 35 to 60 mg daily, can be helpful.27 Doses in this range require a pre- scription because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration limits the amount available per capsule to 800 mcg. Restless legs syndrome is also a common finding in patients with malabsorption syndromes.27 Serum ferritin levels should also be measured to determine iron stores. The association between low iron levels and restless legs syn- drome was documented in clinical studies more than 30 years ago. One study reproduced these observations, finding serum ferritin levels to be lower in 18 patients with restless legs syndrome than in 18 control subjects.28 Serum iron, vitamin B 12 , folic acid, and hemoglobin levels did not differ in the two groups. A rating scale with a maximum score of 10 was used to assess the severity of symptoms of restless legs syn- drome. Serum ferritin levels were inversely correlated with the severity of symptoms. Fifteen of the patients with the syndrome were treated with iron (ferrous sulfate) at a dosage of 200 mg three times daily for months. The severity of restless legs syndrome improved by an average of 4 points in 16 patients with an initial ferritin level lower than mg/L, by 3 points in 4 patients with ferritin levels between 18 and mg/L, and by 1 point in 5 patients with ferritin levels between 45 and 100 mg/L. The conclusion of the study is an important contribution to the understanding of the development of restless legs syndrome in elderly patients, and iron supplements were found to produce a signif- icant reduction in symptoms. In addition to restless legs syndrome, low serum ferritin levels have been found in psychiatric patients experiencing a condition called akathisia, coming from a Greek word meaning “cannot sit down.” Akathisia is a drug-induced state of agitation and can significantly impair restful sleep. The drugs that most commonly produce akathisia are antidepressants, such as fluoxetine (Paxil, Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft). The level of iron depletion correlates with the severity of akathisia. Anyone suffering from drug-induced akathisia should ask his or her physician to perform a serum ferritin assessment. If serum ferritin levels are below 35 mg/L, the physician should recommend that the patient take 30 mg of iron bound to either succinate or fumarate twice daily between meals. If this recommendation causes abdominal discomfort, the patient should try 30 mg with meals three times daily.

## Botanicals With Sedative Properties

Numerous plants have sedative action. Plants commonly prescribed as aids in promoting sleep include the following: • Valeriana officinalis • Passiflora incarnata • Humulus lupulus • Scutellaria lateriflora • Matricaria chamomilla Of the herbs listed, the one with the most clinical research is Valeriana officinalis (see Chapter 123). More than 20 double-blind clinical studies have substantiated valerian’s ability to improve sleep quality and relieve insomnia.29,30 Additional research is warranted, but these studies show that extracts of valerian root improve sleep quality and sleep latency. The studies demonstrated that valerian was as effec- tive in reducing sleep latency as small doses of barbiturates or ben- zodiazepines. Although these latter compounds also increase morning sleepiness, valerian usually reduces morning sleepiness.


Treatment should be conservative and include some means of addressing the psychological factors contributing to insomnia. Metabolically, the foremost component of treatment is the elimina- tion of any factors known to disrupt normal sleep patterns, including the following: • Stimulants (e.g., coffee, tea, chocolate, coffee-flavored ice cream) • Alcohol • Hypoglycemia • Stimulant-containing herbs (e.g., ephedra, guarana) • Marijuana and other recreational drugs • Numerous OTC medications • Prescription drugs If this approach produces no response, more aggressive measures can be taken. Once a normal sleep pattern has been established, the recommended supplements and botanicals should be slowly decreased. If the patient suffers from restless legs syndrome, 5 to 10 mg/day of folic acid should be added to the therapy. Nocturnal myoclonus can be aided with 400 IU/day of natural vitamin E.


The patient should institute a regular exercise program that elevates the heart rate to 60% to 75% of maximum for at least 20 minutes a day.


The following supplements should be taken 45 minutes before bedtime: • Niacin: 100 mg (decrease dose if uncomfortable flushing interferes with sleep induction) • Vitamin B 6 : 50 mg (if unresponsive, use P5’P) • Magnesium: 250 to 500 mg • Tryptophan: 3 to 5 g, or 5-HTP, 100 to 300 mg • Melatonin: 3 mg


The following botanical medicines should also be taken 45 minutes before bedtime: Valeriana officinalis • Dried root (or as tea): 2 to 3 g • Tincture (1:5): 4 to 6 mL (1 to 1½ tsp) • Fluid extract (1:1): 2 to 4 mL (½ to 1 tsp) • Dry powdered extract (0.8% valerenic acid): 150 to 300 mg

antibodies developed in a U.S. serviceman heavily infested with Endolimax nana, an allegedly nonpathogenic ameba.45 Metronidazole rapidly reversed all abnormalities. Amebic arthritis may be an example of parasitical rheumatism, an inflammatory polyarthropathy produced by circulating antigen–antibody complexes.46,47 Reiter syndrome (arthritis, uveitis, and urethritis) has been reported as a complication of infection with two other intestinal protozoa, Cryptosporidium48–50 and Cyclospora.51 Cyclospora cayetanensis has also provoked Guillain- Barré syndrome, a severe autoimmune neuropathy.52 Chagas heart disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, may also have an autoimmune etiology because some individuals clearly pro- duce autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells during infection.53 E. histolytica contains a soluble lectin that is mitogenic for T lym- phocytes.54,55 Activation of helper T cells by this lectin may induce replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vivo. In one report, soluble E. histolytica protein, although not mitogenic itself, induced HIV replication in tissue culture of lymphocytes obtained from three of seven men with chronic HIV infection.56 Infection with E. histolytica and other parasites may promote the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in HIV-infected individ- uals.57,58 Epidemiological evidence associated preexisting intestinal protozoan infection with the appearance of Kaposi’s sarcoma among homosexual men in the United States.59 Although the influence of treat- ing intestinal protozoan infection on the course of HIV infection has not been systematically studied, the treatment of intestinal helminth infestation decreased the HIV viral load among African patients with AIDS.60 Synergism between intestinal parasites and other lymphotro- phic retroviruses was considered an explanation for the pathogenesis of Burkitt lymphoma61 and adult T-cell leukemia and/or lymphoma.62

## Helminths and Immune Modulation

In recent years, the potential for beneficial immune modulation with specific parasites has also emerged. Helminths, or multicellular organ- isms that are either parasitical or free-living, appear to downmodulate both the innate and adaptive immune systems and may block the same inflammatory pathways that are responsible for allergies and autoim- munity (Fig. 188.2). Infection with parasitical worms causes the host immune system to polarize into a Th2 response (preventing Th1 or Th17 immune response) characterized by Th2 cytokines. Helminth ES products can cause the differentiation of macrophages toward the M2 phenotype, resulting in a Th2 immune response. ES products can also prevent dendritic cell synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and promote the production of immunoregulatory molecules such as interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF- β ). A regulatory T cell (Treg) phenotype is also induced, promoting the protection/

suppression of inflammation produced by a Th1 autoimmune disease. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) function as immunoreg- ulators, producing reactive oxygen/nitrogen species that inhibit the function of T cells.63 Currently, one fourth of the world’s population may be infected with helminths, and it has been proposed that for much of human his- tory, this rate would have been near 100%, which has sparked the “old friends” hypothesis—that is, that humans have coevolved with vari- ous organisms, including helminths, that act as inducers of immuno- regulatory circuits. Areas with higher infections rates also have lower rates of autoimmune disease, and human and animal trials are sug- gestive of a potential benefit in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, asthma, and celiac disease.64,65 As the excretory products are better understood, it may be that specific molecular therapy can replace the use of live organisms, although clinical trials have generally proven safe.


Protozoan infection may be diagnosed with stool examination; how- ever, comparison of the results of stool microscopy and duodenal aspi- ration has consistently shown that stool may fail to contain identifiable parasites even at the height of acute giardiasis.66,67 Some authorities have suggested empirical treatment for intestinal parasites in high-risk groups, such as immigrants to the United States from Asia, the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and have justified this approach on a cost-effective basis, given the safety of current medical therapies.68 A similar case might be made for treating chronically ill patients at high risk for parasitical infection because of residence, travel, sexual practices, or the context in which illness occurred. Specific recommendations for laboratory testing are also available, including the recommendation for the use of a Giardia/Cryptosporidium enzyme immunoassay in areas where Giardia is more common and the use of a modified acid-fast stain when Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, or Cystoisospora are suspected, for example.69

## Artemisia annua

Numerous naturally occurring substances have antiprotozoan activity. The most extensively studied is Artemisia annua (sweet Annie or qin- ghao), a plant that yields the lactone artemisinin (qinghaosu), which is the basis for a new class of antimalarial compounds widely used in Asia and Africa.70 Artemisinin is thought to owe its antiprotozoan effects to its content of endoperoxides and killing of parasites through oxidation. Its activity, at least in the treatment of Simian malaria, is enhanced by coadministration of cod liver oil and diminished by coadministration of vitamin E. Artemisinin has low toxicity. In addi- tion to its antibiotic activity, it stimulates macrophages, an important component of the immune response to protozoan infestation.71 It has demonstrated antiparasitical activity against protozoan parasites such as Leishmania spp., Trypanosoma spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, Eimeria tenella, Acanthamoeba castellanii, Naegleria fowleri, Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia, and Babesia spp., with both low cost and low toxicity.72 Artemisinin may induce abortion if given during pregnancy.

## Berberine

The alkaloid berberine can be extracted from the roots of several plant species, notably Berberis aquifolium (Oregon grape), Hydrastis canadensis (goldenseal) root, and Coptis chinensis (goldthread). Berberine has protostatic and protocidal activity against E. histolytica, G. lamblia, and B. hominis.73–75 It has shown benefit in the treatment of giardiasis in children.76

## Allium sativum and Juglans nigra

Allium sativum (garlic) and Juglans nigra (black walnut) have a long history of use as antimicrobials. Allicin inhibits the growth of E. histo- lytica in culture77 and may be responsible for the antimicrobial activity of garlic.78 Human studies on the efficacy of garlic and black walnut in treatment of protozoan infections are lacking.

## Intestinal Bacterial Milieu

The intestinal bacterial milieu may be important in the treatment of protozoan infestation, especially for colonic organisms like E. histolytica. Pathogenic strains of E. histolytica are able to evade lysis by both classic and alternative pathways of complement. Intestinal bacteria, Escherichia coli in particular, are necessary for complement resistance and for amebic virulence.79 Additionally, children with very high rates of infection with E. histolytica are more likely to be symptomatic (diarrheal disease) depending on the composition of their microflora, specifically an increase in Prevotella copri colonization.80 Gitler and Mirelman81 suggested that ingested bacte- ria lowered the redox potential within the parasite and allowed the amebae to escape destruction by oxidative enzymes.81 Animal studies have also documented that dysbiosis is associated with a decrease in the surface expression of CXCR2 on neutrophils, impairing neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection.82 Mirelman et al.83 reported that one can reversibly change the zymodeme patterns of E. histolytica isolates from nonpathogenic to invasive by culturing ame- bae with the gut flora of patients who have either invasive disease or no symptoms. Optimal treatment of protozoan infection requires not only the administration of antimicrobial substances but also strategies aimed at enhancing the function of intestinal resistance factors such as secre- tory immunoglobulin A (IgA), both neutrophil and phagocyte function, and the creation of a bacterial milieu that is not parasite friendly.

# CONCLUSION

Intestinal protozoan infestation is a significantly underrecognized cause of systemic illness. Undiagnosed infestations with Giardia spp., E. histolytica, and other organisms have been associated with diverse diseases, such as arthritis; asthma; Reiter syndrome; urticaria and uve- itis; CFIDS; increased rate of progression of HIV infection; and a wide range of systemic dysfunction, such as fatigue, malabsorption, muscle weakness, and myalgia. Effective eradication of protozoa can result in surprisingly quick and complete clinical response.

## Dietary Fiber

The treatment of IBS through an increase in dietary fiber has a long, though irregular, history.2 Patients with constipation are much more likely to show a response to dietary fiber than are those with diarrhea. One problem that has not been addressed in studies on the therapeutic use of dietary fiber is the role of food allergy. The type of fiber often used in both research and clinical practice is wheat bran.5 Wheat and other grains are among the most commonly implicated foods in mal- absorptive and allergic conditions, and food allergy is a significant etio- logical factor in IBS, so the use of wheat bran is usually contraindicated. Increasing dietary fiber from fruit and vegetable sources rather than cereal sources may offer more benefit to some individuals, although in one uncontrolled clinical study, there was no significant difference in improvement when a diet composed of 30 g of fruit and vegetable fiber and 10 g of cereal fiber was compared with a diet consisting of the opposite ratio.6 Although the two diets resulted in similar significant improvements in abdominal pain, bowel habits, and state of well- being, the presence of large quantities of potentially allergenic cereal fiber in both diets would probably have obscured any differences. One type of fiber that may be useful and that is without the aller- genic component of a wheat-based fiber is partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG). The guar plant, Cyamopsis tetragonolobus, has been grown in India and Pakistan since ancient times. PHGG is a natural water-soluble dietary fiber derived from the guar plant.7 One study of 134 patients found that consumption of 6 g/day of PHGG decreased the frequency of IBS symptoms such as abdominal spasms, flatulence, and abdominal tension.8 The researchers concluded that PHGG works well in cases of altered intestinal motility and is easy to use because of its nongelling properties, unlike unhydrolyzed gum, which is much higher in viscosity and more difficult to incorporate into the diet. A recent study has shown that the guar gums when combined with the antibiotic rifaximin (Rifaxam) provide an additional benefit to eradi- cating dysbiosis in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) asso- ciated with IBS.9 Put simply, for most cases of IBS, nonwheat sources of fiber, such as vegetables and fruits, may be the best choice to help reduce symptoms. For some cases of IBS, especially those with a strong diarrheal component, cooked vegetables in small quantities at first may be most helpful. Because each case is unique, clinical judgment and close patient monitoring are needed. In some cases, fiber may aggra- vate diarrhea and is therefore contraindicated. For a more detailed explanation of dietary fiber, see Chapter 132.

## Food Allergy/Intolerance

The importance of food allergies in the etiology of IBS has been recog- nized since the early 1900s.10,11 Later studies have further documented the association between food allergy and the irritable bowel.12–15 The type of food allergy most significant in IBS is believed to be nonimmu- nologic, so food intolerance rather than food allergy may be a more appropriate diagnosis. According to double-blind challenge methodol- ogies, the majority of patients with IBS (approximately two thirds) have at least one food intolerance, and some have multiple intolerances.12 Foods rich in carbohydrates, as well as fatty food, coffee, alcohol, and hot spices, are most frequently reported to cause symptoms.1 The most common allergens are dairy products (40%–44%) and grains (40%– 60%).14 Because in most cases the reaction appears to be related to prostaglandin synthesis or immunoglobulin G (IgG)–mediated rather than immunoglobulin E (IgE)–mediated reactions, skin tests and the IgE-radioallergosorbent test are poor indicators of food intolerance in these patients. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) allergen challenge test or ELISA IgE/IgG 4 may be a better indicator (see GI, Gastrointestinal; IBS, irritable bowel syndrome.Data from Palsson OS, Whitehead WE, van Tilburg MA, et al.

pathophysiology. Stress, abuse, and emotional feelings influence bowel symptoms via activation of the brain’s central circuitry called the emo- tional motor system (EMS) to produce autonomic and neuroendocrine responses. Bowel symptoms then cause more distress, triggering the release of mediators (cytokines, cortisol, and adrenaline) that act on the EMS, producing a feed-forward cycle of bowel symptoms and emo- tional distress.

## Sugar

Meals high in refined sugar can contribute to IBS as well as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth by decreasing intestinal motility.18 When blood glucose levels rise too rapidly, gastrointestinal tract peristalsis slows down. Because glucose is absorbed primarily in the duodenum and jejunum, the message affects this portion of the gas- trointestinal tract most strongly. The result is that the duodenum and jejunum become atonic. A diet high in refined sugar may be the Bile acid

Fig. 189.2 Overview of the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the etiology of IBS has not yet been completely elucidated, various factors have a role, including the composition of the gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, immune cell reactivity and sensitivity of the enteric nervous system, the brain–gut axis (spinal, vagal, or pelvic pathways), and the brain. The figure highlights those mediators that are probably involved in IBS pathology. The plus symbols indicate whether a mediator activates or inhibits its tar- get cell; those in parentheses denote actions established in animal models, and those without parentheses are effects demonstrated in humans (human tissue). 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine (also known as serotonin); CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; GDNF, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor; IL, interleukin; PAR2, pro- teinase-activated receptor 2; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.

## Dietary FODMAPs

FODMAPs are short-chain carbohydrates that are osmotically active and fermentable (degradable by intestinal bacteria yielding large amount of gases, like hydrogen or carbon dioxide, thus causing abdominal bloating). FODMAPs include oligosaccharides such as fructans, which are chains of fructose with one glucose molecule on the end. Only minimal amounts of fructans may be absorbed in the human intestine. They may interfere with the absorption of fructose, thus aggravating symptoms in fructose malabsorption. Foods rich in fructans are wheat (white bread, pasta, pastries, cookies), onions, and artichokes; other not commonly problematic foods containing fruc- tans are asparagus, leeks, garlic, chicory roots, and chicory-based cof- fee substitutes. Fructans with more than 10 molecules of fructose in a chain are known as inulins, and those with fewer than 10 fructoses are referred to as fructo-oligosaccharides or oligofructoses. Fructans cause problems mainly in fructose malabsorption. Galactans (e.g., stachyose and raffinose) are chains of fructose with one galactose molecule on the end. They act much like fructans. The main foods rich in galac- tans are legumes (soy, beans, chickpeas, lentils), cabbage, and brussels sprouts.58-60

<!-- chunk -->

## Disaccharides. Lactose (milk sugar). Lactose is found in dairy

products, but it may also be found in chocolate and other sweets, beer, preprepared soups and sauces, and so on. Lactose is poorly absorbed by individuals with lactose intolerance, SIBO, and small intestinal inflammation (Crohn’s disease, celiac disease).

<!-- chunk -->

## Monosaccharides. Fructose (fruit sugar). Fructose-rich foods

include honey, dried fruits (prunes, figs, dates, or raisins), apples, pears, sweet cherries, peaches, agave syrup, watermelon, and papaya. Fructose is often added to commercial foods and drinks as high-fruc- tose corn syrup. Fructose causes symptoms even in healthy people if ingested in excess and especially in those with fructose malabsorption or SIBO.

<!-- chunk -->

## Polyols. These are also known as sugar alcohols (appearing as artifi-

cial sweeteners in commercial foods and drinks). Sorbitol may appear in “sugar-free chewing gum” and “low-calorie foods”; it appears nat- urally in stone fruits (peaches, apricots, and plums). Xylitol naturally appears in some berries. A pack of chewing gum containing sorbitol or xylitol may cause bloating or diarrhea in a healthy child and especially in persons with fructose malabsorption or SIBO. Other polyols—like mannitol, isomalt, erythritol, arabitol, erythritol, glycol, glycerol, lac- titol, and ribitol—may be problematic in fructose malabsorption and SIBO. Recent work indicates that FODMAP short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine are important triggers of func- tional gut symptoms. Open studies have suggested that three out of four patients with IBS will respond well symptomatically to the restriction of FODMAP intake,19 as confirmed by a randomized, placebo-controlled rechallenge trial.20 Breath hydrogen testing helps identify which specific sugars behave as FODMAPs in the individual. Due to a recent series of articles on the low-FODMAP diet in IBS, a number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been published, all showing efficacy for reducing IBS symptoms (Table 189.1).18–20


Probiotics are dietary supplements containing live microorganisms that, when ingested, exert a beneficial effect on the host. Among the most commonly used and studied species are Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Saccharomyces boulardii. The association between IBS and SIBO is well established.21 Pimentel and colleagues have demonstrated that successful treatment of SIBO with antibiotics improved IBS symptoms. The results of a meta-analysis of randomized controlled clini- cal trials using probiotics to treat IBS symptoms are shown in Figs. 189.3, 189.4, and 189.5.21 Zhang and colleagues looked at a number of issues related to strain, duration, and dosing of probiotics. The authors report in their methodology section that 1392 randomized clinical tri- als were eligible using the Rome III criteria for the diagnosis of IBS. Of these, 21 met criteria for inclusion, and 17 were used for data synthesis. IBS symptoms and quality of life were improved for both single strains and multistrain formulations. IBS symptom improvement was not dif- ferent whether the probiotic was administered for less than or greater than 8 weeks. Likewise, IBS symptom improvement was not different according to whether the probiotic daily dose was greater or less than 10 billion colony forming units.61 In summary, probiotics may prove to be key components in the comprehensive approach to treating IBS. Probiotic supplementation appears to be indicated in IBS (see Chapter 105, Probiotics).

## Enteric-Coated Volatile Oils

Peppermint oil, and presumably similar volatile oils, inhibits gastro- intestinal smooth muscle action in both laboratory animal prepara- tions and humans. Clinically, peppermint oil has been used to reduce colonic spasms during endoscopy,27 and an enteric-coated peppermint oil (ECPO) capsule has been used in the treatment of IBS.28 Enteric coating is believed to be necessary because menthol (the major constit- uent of peppermint oil) and other plant monoterpenes in peppermint oil are rapidly absorbed.29 This rapid absorption tends to limit effects to the upper intestine, resulting in relaxation of the cardioesophageal sphincter and common side effects, such as esophageal reflux and heartburn, after administration. A transient hot, burning sensation in the rectum during defecation, due to unabsorbed menthol, has been noted by some patients taking the ECPO. Most of the studies have used ECPO at a dosage of 0.2 mL twice daily between meals.67 A meta-analysis of five studies supported the efficacy of peppermint oil in IBS.30 A well-designed study of ECPO involved 110 patients with symptoms of IBS.31 The patients took one capsule of either ECPO (0.2 mL) or a placebo three to four times daily 15 to 30 minutes before meals for 1 month. The effects of peppermint oil on IBS are summarized in Table 189.2. A summary of the findings of a meta-analysis conducted by the author and colleagues demonstrat- ing the effects of ECPO on the major symptoms of IBS and associated adverse events is provided in Table 189.3. These results are impressive, especially given the safety of ECPO.

## Herbal Formulas

For centuries, botanicals have been used for medicinal purposes; they are now a commonly used remedy for IBS. The appeal of botanicals likely stems from their accessibility and perceived safety as “natural” products. Various botanical preparations have been studied in IBS, with varied results. Of the 75 randomized trials for combination herbal therapy identified in one systematic review, only three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were considered to be high quality. In a study of 116 patients, both standard and individualized combination Chinese herbal medicine significantly improved bowel symptoms. The benefit of individualized herbal treatment was maintained at 14 weeks after completion of treatment. Another study in 208 patients demonstrated efficacy with the herbal preparations STW 5 and STW 5-II.32 The most recent of the three trials randomized 119 patients to a standard prepa- ration of traditional Chinese medicine extracts containing 11 herbs or

placebo. However, the use of this herbal formulation for diarrhea-pre- dominant IBS did not improve symptoms. Although no research has been done to document its efficacy, an old naturopathic remedy called Robert’s formula has a long history of use in this condition. The Tibetan herbal formula known as Padma Lax also showed efficacy for patients with constipation-predominant IBS in one 3-month double-blind, randomized pilot study. A small num- ber of patients did have loose stools with this formula, but this effect was easily remedied by lowering the dosage.33

## Miscellaneous Considerations

<!-- chunk -->

## Psychological Factors

Mental/emotional problems—anxiety, fatigue, hostile feelings, depres- sion, and sleep disturbances—are reported by almost all patients with IBS.34 The severity and frequency of such symptoms tend to correlate with these psychological factors. Anxiety predicts a high degree of food-related symptoms in IBS.1 Especially significant is sleep quality; poor sleep quality results in a rise in symptom severity.35 Several theories link psychological factors with the symptoms of IBS. The “learning model” holds that when exposed to stressful sit- uations, some children learn to develop gastrointestinal symptoms to cope with the stress. Another theory holds that IBS is a manifestation of depression, chronic anxiety, or both. Personality assessments of IBS sufferers have shown them to have higher anxiety levels and a greater feeling of depression.36 However, these studies were based on postmor- bid personality assessments, and it has since been determined, with premorbid personality assessment, that IBS sufferers have normal per- sonality profiles. Therefore many of the psychological symptoms may be either secondary to the bowel disturbances (particularly malabsorp- tion) or due to a common etiological factor (e.g., stress, food allergy, or gut microbial dysbiosis; Figs. 189.6 and 189.7).68 Greater colonic motility during exposure to stressful situations has been shown to occur in both normal subjects and sufferers of IBS.37 This finding apparently accounts for the greater abdominal pain and irregular bowel function seen in patients with IBS and normal subjects during periods of emotional stress. Distressed patients with IBS are also known to have decreased immune function, as evidenced by lower per- centages of activated T cells and natural killer cells.38 This finding sug- gests that patients with long-term IBS have lowered immune function, which may leave them susceptible to a host of other illnesses. Some researchers believe that IBS sufferers have difficulty adapting to life events, although this belief has not been well demonstrated in clinical studies. Psychotherapy, in the form of relaxation therapy,39 biofeed- back,40 hypnosis,40 counseling,41 or stress-management training,42 has been shown to reduce symptom frequency and severity and to enhance the results of standard medical treatment of IBS. Hypnosis, which the

## Physical Medicine

An increase in physical exercise also appears helpful for patients with IBS. Many find that daily leisurely walks markedly reduce symptoms, probably owing to the known stress-reducing effects of exercise. A specific massage therapy known as foot reflexology was evaluated in a small study of 34 individuals; no benefit for patients with IBS was found.46


Because IBS is a multifactorial disease, the approach to the patient requires consideration and integration of the following factors: • Dietary fiber • Determination and elimination of food allergies/intolerances • Stress reduction • Exercise As necessary, peppermint oil and Robert’s formula may be used to temporarily ameliorate symptoms. Also, because the diagnosis is typically made by exclusion, a careful diagnostic evaluation is always indicated.


Fiber-rich foods (see Chapter 132, Dietary Fiber) are to be increased, and foods that are allergenic, contain refined sugar, or are highly pro- cessed are to be eliminated, along with FODMAPs.

## Prevalence

Chronic kidney disease is recognized as a public health problem world- wide. In the United States, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the general population is approximately 14%. More than million, or about 15% of, Americans have some form of CKD, and as shown in Fig. 190.2, the rate is increasing relentlessly. CKD, regard- less of the type or cause, leads to complications of decreased kidney function, kidney failure, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). African Americans and Mexican Americans are more likely to develop CKD than Caucasians.3–5 End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is defined as the last stage (stage 5) of CKD. The number of persons progressing to ESRD continues to rise by about 21,000 cases per year, making it one of the most expensive diseases to manage medically.6 African Americans are about 3.5 times more likely to develop ESRD than Caucasians, and Hispanics are 1.5 times more likely to develop ESRD than non-Hispanics.7,8 In children, the main causes of kidney disease are birth defects, hereditary disease, infections, systemic diseases, nephrotic syndrome, trauma, and blockage of the urinary tract or reflux. Kidney failure in children from birth to age 4 is usually the result of birth defects and inherited conditions, with hereditary diseases, nephrotic syndrome, and the effects of systemic disease seen between the ages of 5 to years. Glomerular function diseases primarily affect older children, up to age 19. Kidney disease affects children in various ways, ranging from treat- able disorders without long-term consequences to life-threatening conditions to acute kidney disease that develops suddenly, lasts a short time, and then resolves. The effects of both acute and chronic kidney disease can be serious, with long-lasting consequences, or completely clear once the underlying cause has been treated. Children with CKD face additional challenges, such as negative self-image; behavioral, learning, and relationship problems; and delayed language and motor skills.9 In the allopathic model, the belief is that CKD generally does not go away with treatment and tends to become worse over time, eventually H 2 O H 2 O H 2 O H 2 O H 2 O NaCl NaCl NaCl NaCl NaCl NaCl HCO 3 – HCO 3 –HCO 3 – H+H + H+ Urea Urea K+ Collecting duct Loop of Henle Bowman’s capsule Cortex Medulla Some drugs and poisons Nutrients Proximal tubuleDistal tubule Urine (to renal pelvis) Glucose Amino acids Some drugs Reabsorption Secretion Blood Filtrate composition Fig. 190.1 Kidney excretion of toxins.

leading to kidney failure. This is because symptoms are managed with medications in hopes of slowing down the progression of the disease. In contrast, naturopathic therapies act to remove the cause and restore normal homeostasis as per the laws of healing and the therapeutic order.10 One of the reasons CKD is increasing is that many patients do not have symptoms until later stages of the disease process. Additionally, many early cases are missed as a result of a lack of screening on routine physical examinations and/or adequate screening laboratory studies.

## Risk Factors

Although CKD and ESRD are found universally, certain ethnic groups exhibit faster rates of disease progression than others. In a study com- paring estimated creatinine clearance rates (eGFRcreat) and cystatin C levels, the authors found that kidney function decline varied sig- nificantly by race/ethnicity, and these differences were present even among those without albuminuria upon initial evaluation.11 Overall, blacks and Hispanics had higher rates of decline compared with whites, whereas Chinese and whites had similar rates of kidney func- tion decline. Additionally, in Hispanics, researchers found that rates of decline varied significantly by country of origin, with the highest among Dominicans and Puerto Ricans. Sociodemographics and comorbidities were not found to be a factor.12 In a review article by Stenvinkel, the rate of prevalence of CKD was significantly higher in men compared with women. Women with CKD are more likely to be found in stages 1 to 4 compared with men.13 Obesity was found to convey a threefold risk of developing CKD compared with hypertension and diabetes. Several other studies looked at hyperlipidemia, hypertension, changes in estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rates, and inflammation and their relationship to development of CKD.14–16 Comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, can accelerate the rate of decline in CKD, and CKD itself contributes to the acceleration of CVD and diabetes. The GFR is estimated to decline about 1.0 mL min−1 per year in the elderly, and therefore deterioration of renal function can be considered a “normal” aging process. Rates of decline in the elderly are highly vari- able and depend on lifestyle, diet, and overall health status. The decline in the eGFR depends on the CKD stage and baseline values, with a faster decline the higher the baseline eGFR and a slower rate of decline with lower baseline eGFRs. Baseline eGFR values are a better predictor of CKD progression than age, gender, and stage of renal disease.17 It has also been suggested that social isolation, loneli- ness, and poverty may also contribute to deterioration in kidney func- tion as well as other diseases.18 An association of blood type and the development of CKD has been examined, with the most prevalent blood group among renal failure patients being blood group A (45.7%), followed by blood group O (30.4%), blood group B (17.3%), and blood group AB (6.6%). This is due to the presence of lectins that stimulate the production of anti- bodies, with the circulating immune complexes affecting glomerular basement membrane function. The disruption causes changes that contribute to filtration and eventual loss of kidney function.19,20

## Excessive Salt in Diet

Excessive salt consumption is another significant factor contributing to the degeneration of the kidneys.21 Mean intake of sodium in a global pop- ulation is estimated at 3.95 g/day (equivalent to 10.06 g/day of salt), and in the United States, the average intake of sodium is 3.4 g/day (equivalent to 8.7 g/day of salt).22 Studies have shown a connection between NaCl intake and acid–base balance, with high-salt diets causing a decrease in pH and moderate metabolic acidosis.23,24 In response to acidosis, the kidney implements adaptive processes to restore the acid–base balance. These include the removal of the nonmetabolizable anions, the conserva- tion of citrate, the enhancement of kidney ammoniagenesis, and urinary excretion of ammonium ions, resulting in the lowering of urinary pH, hypocitraturia, hypercalciuria, and nitrogen and phosphate wasting.25 Some researchers have hypothesized that excessive salt in the diet is a sig- nificant contributor to loss of kidney function with aging.

## Excessive Phosphates in Diet

The primary sources of “hidden” phosphates are additives used as processing aids, such as acid balancing (especially in carbonated bev- erages), leavening of bread, color and moisture retention, anticaking, and flavorings. It appears that a substantial portion of the population consumes more than the tolerable upper limit of 4000 mg/d and sig- nificantly more than the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 700 mg/d for adults. Eliminating phosphates is difficult for the kidneys. Excessive intake of phosphates damages the tubules, increases fibro- sis, which blocks the blood vessels, and decreases the GFR. Increasing phosphate levels in the blood is one of the early signs of kidney fail- ure.26 Serum phosphorous levels in the “high-normal” range ( ≥ 4.0 mg/ dL but < 4.5mg/dL) have been associated with a twofold-higher risk of developing new-onset CKD and ESRD in the general population.27 An observational study showed that every 0.5-mg/dL increase in serum phosphorous demonstrated a 40% greater risk for incident ESRD.28

## Toxic Metals

Cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, platinum, and uranium are all nephrotoxic. Although each is significant, the most common, as well as the most researched, are cadmium and mercury. Cadmium is a significant kidney toxicant. It has a worrisome half- life of over 10 years, making it very difficult to excrete. The kidney holds 50% of the total body burden of cadmium, which increases the nephrotoxicity. The current cadmium exposure experienced by indi- viduals living in the United States has reached levels that adversely affect kidney health in a significant proportion of the population.29 As the kidneys degenerate, they not only lose their ability to excrete toxins but are less able to perform other normal physiological functions. The kidneys have a high affinity for mercury. Within a few hours of exposure, 50% of the mercury that gets into the blood ends up in the kidneys. Mercury damages both the glomeruli and the tubules. Proximal tubular necrosis, especially along the straight renal segments in the inner cortex and outer stripe of the outer medulla, is a promi- nent feature of inorganic mercury nephrotoxicity.30 Much of the tissue damage appears to result from poisoning of the kidney mitochondria, so there is not enough adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for the cells to protect themselves from the toxins they are excreting.31

## Persistent Organic Pollutants

Because persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are mostly fat soluble, they are particularly damaging to the kidneys. Many of these chemicals are classified as halogenated hydrocarbons and are so difficult to detox- ify or excrete that they have half-lives measured in months to years. Fluorinated hydrocarbons (e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] polymers such as Teflon, perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA], and per- flourooctanesulfonic acid [PFOS]) damage the kidneys by passive diffusion into the tubules, where they poison the mitochondria. The resulting damage creates inadequate energy production, impairing active excretion; increases oxidative stress as the damaged mitochon- dria leak highly oxidative electrons and oxygen; and causes cell death, producing progressive loss of kidney function.32

## Glyphosate

Epidemiological research has found a strong correlation between gly- phosate use and the kidney failure epidemic. Of course, association does not prove causation. Animal research shows that chronic expo- sure at very low dosages causes kidney damage. A 2-year study that involved 0.1 ppb of glyphosate in rats’ drinking water resulted in cellu- lar kidney abnormalities and significant chronic kidney deficiencies.33 Research conducted in Sri Lanka found that those who drank well water contaminated with glyphosate had a higher incidence of kidney failure in proportion to concentrations starting at 0.7 ppb, and farmers spraying glyphosates in the fields had a 5.4-fold increased incidence of kidney disease.34 The European standard for water contamination is 0.1 ppb, whereas the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard is an inexplicable 700 ppb.35

## Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

Most nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were ini- tially available only by prescription. Later, when the patents expired, NSAIDs became available over the counter. Acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin, and COX-2 inhibitors have all been shown to cause kidney damage when used chronically.36–38,74,75 Chronic consumption (>3 years) of single and/or combinations of NSAIDs is known to cause irreversible analgesic nephropathy.39 Fig. 190.3 summarizes the risks. As can be seen, these drugs greatly increase the risk of kidney failure. Note that this is kidney failure; loss of kidney function is much more prevalent. Discontinuing the use of NSAIDs results in some recovery of function even in patients with kidney failure. After 6 months of stopping NSAIDs, those with the most damaged kidneys still had a doubling of kidney function.

# CLASSIFICATIONS OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

There are several classifications of kidney disease, each with their own characteristics. Understanding the etiology of CKD is helpful in determining the therapy needed. This is specifically important in naturopathic medicine due to the large number of therapeutic options available to the clinician.

<!-- chunk -->

## Minimal-Change Nephropathy

Minimal-change nephropathy, also termed minimal-change disease (MCD), is believed to be primarily a disease of children but is found in adults as well. It is most often seen between the ages of 24 to months, with males showing a higher incidence. The male-to-female predominance changes, as well as the incidence of development, with advances in age. The onset of the disease is insidious and usually discovered after the development of edema. Kidney biopsy shows minimal changes in the glomerular structure, tubules, and interstitial areas, and thus the name minimal-change nephropathy. Hypertension and a reduction in renal function are usually not seen, nor is hematuria or the presence of red cell casts found with glomerulonephritis. A low serum albumin and proteinuria, an elevated serum cholesterol, and edema are the hall- marks of this disease. MCD is associated with primary idiopathic nephrotic syndrome but can be secondary to NSAID use; exposure to heavy metals, such as mercury and lead; and in children with AIDS. Additionally, Hodgkin’s disease and lymphoproliferative disorders must also be kept in mind with a presentation of MCD.

## Membrane-Proliferative Glomerulonephritis

Membrane-proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is generally con- sidered to be an immune complex disorder characterized by mesangial cell proliferation and deposits in the basement membrane of the C3 component of complement and immunoglobulins. The condition can further be divided into types I and II depending on the morphological presentation, age of onset, serum concentrations of C3, and the pres- ence of serum nephritic factors and lipodystrophy. As with many of the renal diseases, there are disagreements as to whether these are separate entities or part of a natural history of the disease. Type I MPGN is the most common presentation and is a slowly progressive disease. About 30% to 40% of individuals affected will remain clinically stable even with persistent proteinuria. Type I dis- ease is characterized by a persistent 1+ to 2+ proteinuria and urinary sediments, which may contain low levels of erythrocytes and red blood cell (RBC) casts. Occasionally, a marked hematuria along with higher levels of protein will be seen at the beginning of the disease, which will revert to chronic levels after the initial insult. In type II MPGN disease, an acute nephritis with macroscopic hematuria is the most common presentation. This presentation is more likely to have accompanying edema, hypertension, and signs of renal failure compared with an acute type I episode. Because of this, type II MPGN disease progresses more rapidly to renal failure than type I. About 20% of patients will remain stable for considerable peri- ods of time despite the larger protein losses and low levels of uremia. MPGN may also be associated with other diseases, such as immune-complex diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], mixed cryoimmunoglobulinemia), malignancy (leukemia, lympho- mas, light-chain disease), chronic liver disease (chronic active hepa- titis, cirrhosis), and infectious diseases (bacterial, endocarditis, AIDS), and with Down syndrome, drug addiction, sarcoidosis and sickle cell disease.

## Membranous Nephropathy

Membranous nephropathy is the most common form of nephropathy found in adults (usually over 30) with an unexplained or idiopathic proteinuria. The diagnosis is made after renal biopsy, which shows a thickened glomerular basement membrane and subendothelial depos- its. Medications or an associated systemic illness seem to play a role, and the disease may be present for years before it is detected. The first presentation may be heavy proteinuria, followed soon after by the signs and symptoms of progressive renal failure. Microscopical hematuria may also be present in a few cases. Males are affected more often than females, and hypertension and azotemia may not be present until later in the disease process. The subsequent nephrotic syndrome presents with malaise, edema, and anorexia. Occasionally anasarca is also present. Elevated choles- terol and triglyceride levels are found, and there may be a predisposi- tion to the formation of thrombosis, especially of the renal veins. Membranous nephropathy is believed to be an immune-mediated disease because immunoglobulin G (IgG) and complement C3 are found with special staining. These could be formed locally or be depos- its of circulating immune complexes. Secondary antigens have been found associated with hepatitis B surface and e antigens as well as thy- roid antigens associated with thyroiditis.

## Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy

Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy, otherwise known as Berger’s disease, represents about 10% of all patients who reach end-stage renal failure and is the most common form of primary glomerulonephri- tis found worldwide. The histopathological findings are similar to those of Henoch–Schönlein purpura, which may represent a more systemic form, and together with glomerulonephritis are termed pri- mary IgA nephropathy. Secondary forms are the result of conditions in which circulating IgA becomes deposited in the glomerulus.

is commonly seen with celiac disease, chronic liver disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, IgA monoclonal gammopathies, HIV infection, certain can- cers, and mycosis fungoides. Although the disease is found in all age groups, children and young adults are more commonly affected, with a higher ratio of males to females. Most commonly, the person will present with macroscopic hematuria along with an upper respiratory tract infection. The per- son is usually asymptomatic but may present with fatigue, malaise, or muscle soreness or pain. Children and some adults may complain of loin pain. A distinction from post-streptococcal nephritis (PSN) can be made because the symptoms usually occur 10 to 14 days after infection, and the patient may have had a fever before the onset. Additionally, hypertension and peripheral edema, commonly seen with PSN, are usually not seen with IgA nephropathy. Hematuria may last hours to days and may become intermittent with periods of no bleeding and then recur several months or years later after a febrile illness. Occasionally the hematuria is also accompa- nied by proteinuria of varying degrees, usually less than 1 g/day. Henoch–Schönlein purpura, which is found more often in chil- dren, may also have associated arthralgia with a lack of joint swelling and inflammation; a skin rash primarily over the legs and lower trunk that rapidly becomes purpuric; and severe abdominal pain, ileus, and bloody diarrhea. Less commonly, the presentation will be a nephrotic syndrome with renal insufficiency and hypertension.

## Acute Post-Streptococcal and Postinfectious

<!-- chunk -->

## Nephropathy

Acute post-streptococcal and post-infectious glomerulonephritis are a result of the deposition of circulating immune complexes in the glomerulus. This is often due to the presence of group A beta hemo- lytic streptococcus (BHS) after pharyngitis or a skin infection (cellu- litis, impetigo). Other microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites, have been implicated as well. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is the most com- monly encountered form of glomerulonephritis in children, with sub- clinical asymptomatic cases occurring 4 times more frequently than acute disease. There is some association with disease development in families, which may also be due to blood type and the presence of cer- tain human leukocyte antigens (HLAs).19,20 There appears to be a 2:1 male-to-female ratio even though susceptibility to BHS infection is not sex related. The onset of the disease is usually abrupt and follows an infection with group A BHS. There is a latent period of 7 to 21 days after the infection before symptoms, such as edema and hematuria, occur. Periorbital edema is commonly observed. Hypertension may be pres- ent, resulting in headaches, visual disturbances, and altered sensorial states. Coma and convulsions may occur in severe cases. Circulatory congestion due to fluid retention results in dyspnea, cough, orthopnea, and cardiac and pulmonary changes suggesting pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure. PSGN should always be considered in patients presenting with cardiovascular or upper respiratory diseases of rapid onset. Diagnosis is made by urinalysis positive for hematuria and RBC casts. However, white blood cell (WBC), tubular epithelial, and granu- lar casts are also commonly found and reflect the degree of pathology present. Serum creatinine levels tend to remain stable, but blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels may rise somewhat. Changes in electrolyte bal- ance will parallel changes in metabolic acidosis or alkalosis and need to be monitored frequently. Anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titers begin to rise about 10 to 14 days post–streptococcal pharyngitis, peak at about 4 weeks, and return to normal levels between 1 and 6 months later. The magnitude of the titer does not seem to correlate to the degree of kidney involvement. Depression of hemolytic complement activity (C3) is present almost 100% of the time but also does not correlate to the degree of kidney involvement.

## Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis

Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is defined as an idio- pathic primary glomerular disease characterized by a rapidly progress- ing deterioration in renal function over a period of days to weeks to a few months. The definition is somewhat complicated because a rapid deterioration of kidney function can occur with a variety of illnesses. The cause of illness must be ruled out before a diagnosis of RPGN can be obtained. If untreated, the condition will commonly progress to end-stage kidney failure or death. Diagnosis is by kidney biopsy confirming renal failure to be related to circulating antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies. A rela- tionship to primary alveolar disease, such as Goodpasture’s disease, has been suggested but not proven. The disease can be divided into three types, suggesting a vasculitis type of disease, circulating immune com- plexes as a pathogenesis, and possibly a relationship to HLA antigens and specific disease activity.40,41

## Nephrotic Syndrome

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a recognized condition that can be the result of several diseases and is not considered a disease itself but rather a collection of symptoms due to kidney failure. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by very high levels of urinary protein, low levels of serum total protein, swelling of the extremities (especially around the eyes), and high serum cholesterol. Nephrotic syndrome can be caused by diseases that affect the glo- merular filtration of the kidneys, such as focal segmental glomerulo- sclerosis (FSGS) or membranous nephropathy and are termed primary NS. Systemic diseases such as diabetes or lupus (secondary NS) can also cause nephrotic syndrome. Most cases of nephrotic syndrome in adults have secondary causes, with diabetes being the most common.42,43

# DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

As previously mentioned, many patients with CKD have no knowl- edge of its presence until it is at somewhat of an advanced stage. This is because of the body’s substantial organ reserve and ability to adapt to chronic conditions, or the person believes that it is due to another disease or part of the aging process. Signs and symptoms may be minimal at first, and the patient may complain of feeling run-down or fatigued. The skin may become ruddy, dry, itchy, and perhaps yellowish in color. Mental processes and movements may become slower, and as the disease advances, the per- son may become anorexic and have cramping, numbness, and tingling of the extremities and may complain of insomnia. At a minimum, a fasting chemistry screen and lipid levels should be ordered and include BUN, creatinine, and uric acid levels to assess kidney filtration. A complete blood count (CBC) to determine whether there is anemia, along with a fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and insulin level to rule out metabolic syndrome or diabetes, and inflam- matory markers such as serum ferritin, high-sensitivity C-reactive pro- tein (hsCRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) should also be considered. Additionally, a routine urinalysis with microscopical examination should be performed, and if albumin is present, then a total protein/ creatinine ratio is required to assess protein loss. A 24-hour urine creatinine clearance can follow this to establish a baseline to evaluate patient response to therapy.44

## 1513CHAPTER 190 Kidney Disease

Several parameters, if noted early on, suggest developing kid- ney disease. One of the earliest manifestations is the development of microalbuminuria with a normal (calculated) GFR.45 A change in the slope of serum creatinine levels over time is a predictor of decreasing kidney function, with a greater slope correlat- ing with a greater decrease in function. The association of low serum albumin corresponding with a faster rate of GFR decline was more consistently noted in studies of diabetic patients than nondiabetic patients. The effect that dyslipidemia has on kidney decline is based on high levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, or low-density lipoprotein and low levels of high-density lipoprotein. Several studies looking at indi- vidual or the totality of these parameters showed varying results, sug- gesting that there may be some association. Smoking seems to have an effect on changes in GFR, with smokers being found to have a greater rate of deterioration.45 The GFR can be estimated from serum creatinine levels by using prediction equations that also account for age, sex, race, and body size. Two such equations are the Cockcroft–Gault and the Abbreviated MDRD study equations. The MDRD equation has largely replaced the Cockcroft–Gault equation because it is believed to be more accu- rate and precise for persons with a GFR of less than approximately mL/min per 1.73 m2 and does not require height and weight. Thus it is easily calculated and can be included with routine laboratory panels. C Cr

In these cases, the Cockcroft–Gault equation may pro- vide a better assessment. The value of using both equations is in individuals with extremes of age and body size, severe malnutrition or obesity, diseases of skeletal muscle, paraplegia or quadriplegia, vegetarian diet, or rapidly chang- ing kidney function. They can also be used to determine the dose of potentially toxic drugs that are excreted by the kidneys. Other screening parameters of note are the serum calcium/phos- phorus ratio and calcium X phosphorus, which is an assessment of the kidney’s ability to balance calcium and phosphorus as well as to assess parathyroid function, response to vitamin D, and renal cal- cinosis. As serum calcium levels fall, there is a rise in phosphorus, resulting in symptoms of hypocalcemia. However, changes noted over time on routing chemistry screens may provide a clue for devel- oping kidney disease. The normal calcium/phosphorus ratio = (2.5 ± 0.4), and the normal calcium X phosphorus = (N = < 40 and abnor- mal = 60 or >).

# STAGES OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

Kidney disease is recognized as a chronic, progressive disease and is classified according to the following stages:

<!-- chunk -->

## Stage 1—Signs of mild kidney disease but with normal or better GFR

(greater than 90% kidney function)

<!-- chunk -->

## Stage 2—Signs of mild kidney disease with reduced GFR (indicating

60%–89% kidney function).

<!-- chunk -->

## Stage 3—Signs of moderate chronic renal insufficiency (where the

GFR indicates 40%–59% kidney function)

<!-- chunk -->

## Stage 4—Signs of severe chronic renal insufficiency (where the GFR

indicates 15%–29% kidney function).

<!-- chunk -->

## Stage 5—Signs of end-stage renal failure (where the GFR indicates less

than 15% kidney function).


<!-- chunk -->

## Case Management

Considering the many different causes of chronic kidney disease, comorbid disease management is as important as the management of the kidney disease itself. This has been one of the challenges facing phy- sicians as medicine has become more compartmentalized, with spe- cialists treating isolated organ systems. Polypharmacy is increasingly recognized as contributing to morbidity, negative health outcomes, and decreasing the quality of life.46 Polypharmacy is particularly rele- vant to kidney function because many of these drugs, such as antihy- pertensive medications, directly affect kidney function. In children affected with any type of kidney disease, it is import- ant to consider that the kidney is still maturing. This may present a dilemma. In prolonged cases, severe damage can take place, altering kidney-centered parameters and affecting growth and development, as well as predisposing the person to an earlier development of kidney failure. However, in a disease state of shorter duration, a developing kidney has a greater chance of complete recovery if recognized and treated early. A treatment regimen that considers the type of kidney disease, precipitating etiology, duration, and expected changes in the patho- physiology of the disease must be developed. This may consist of dietary modifications, allergen identification, and control of hyper- tension and diabetes if present. The goal of treatment is to relieve the perturbing insult on the kidney and allow healing and restoration of normal function to occur. Therefore periodic follow-up visits are needed once the initial insult has been eliminated or has reached equilibrium. Education of the patient as to the possible course of the disease, the patient’s susceptibility to it, and the significance of prevention to maintain the disease or the recovered level of health is important. A periodic routine urinalysis is beneficial for screening, especially after any febrile or respiratory illness.

## Dialysis

Patients on renal dialysis present additional challenges for the clinician because each requires different levels of monitoring and follow-up. Hemodialysis is commonly performed 3 times per week, requiring the patient to be connected to a dialyzer that cleans the blood. This procedure takes between 3 and 5 hours and requires frequent blood testing to monitor electrolyte and protein balance. Peritoneal dialysis,

<!-- chunk -->

## 1514SECTION 6 Diseases

on the other hand, is carried out at home by the patient and is achieved through continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or contin- uous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD). From a holistic perspective, it is much easier for the clinician to treat patients on CAPD and CCPD than hemodialysis simply because the mechanism of dialysis CAPD and CCPD works with the body’s alternative filtering mechanism, the omentum, to achieve dialysis rather than filtering the blood, which necessitates a rebalancing of blood chemistry. However, both methods increase the likelihood of sepsis due to contamination of fluids. Therapies to prevent sepsis seem to work better with CAPD and CCPD than hemodialysis. Additionally, the balancing of blood chemistry and working with the patient’s dietary requirements are also easier to address.47

# NUTRITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS IN ACUTE AND

# CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE

The goals of nutritional therapy in ESRD are to maintain the body’s chemical composition as close to that of normal to preserve protein stores until renal function is normalized. Nutritional therapy in acute renal failure (ARF) is complicated because of the rapid and fluctuating progression of the disease, in contrast to ESRD, which is slower and more predictable. Diets with high-quality protein and high carbohydrate (2200 calo- ries) intake, with an excess of 500 mL of water above the daily output, are desired. Intake of water, electrolytes, and minerals must be closely monitored, especially in patients undergoing dialysis, to avoid fluid overload while minimizing abnormal concentrations of these sub- stances. Protein restriction must occur to decrease the accumulation of nitrogenous wastes as well as other inorganic ions, such as sulfates and phosphates, which result from protein metabolism. A sufficient intake of calories and vitamins is needed to minimize catabolism of protein stores. High-carbohydrate diets in patients with renal failure were found to reduce endogenous protein catabolism, decreasing the BUN.

<!-- chunk -->

## Water and Mineral Balance

Patients with ARF often show greater impairment of water, mineral, and electrolyte excretion than do patients with ESRD, even though the creatinine clearances may be similar. This is due to an inability of the body to adjust to the rapid changes occurring with ARF as opposed to the slower rate of change with ESRD. Water intake may need to be negative to balance the serum ion concentration. Water loss must account for the patient’s temperature, any surface loss through burns or open wounds, the rate of ventilation, and the humidity of the air. In afebrile patients without burns, fluid losses of 400 to 600 mL/day are seen. Water loss can be monitored by measuring weight changes and the differences between fluid intake and output, as well as calculation from body composition analysis. Edema and hypernatremia indicate an excess of salt and water, whereas postural hypotension suggests volume loss. In patients with edema, hypernatremia requires water and salt restriction until the serum sodium concentration is normalized and the edema is reduced. In patients with postural hypotension, careful use of salt and/or blood or colloid is needed to correct the volume deficit. Hyperkalemia usu- ally requires dialysis to remove potassium because it is primarily due to renal impairment.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dietary Protein Requirements

Patients with ESRD are in neutral or positive nitrogen balance with ingestion of 40 g/day of high-quality protein but can go into negative balance with only 20 g/day. It has been shown that 0.5 to 0.8 gm/kg/ day of protein is needed to maintain a neutral nitrogen balance and that higher amounts are needed with patients on dialysis. Patients on hemodialysis need higher protein amounts due to loss from the pro- cedure. This also includes peritoneal dialysis. One g/kg/day is needed, and if the person is restricted to less, he or she will go into negative nitrogen balance. Essential amino acids (AAs) need to be part of the regimen because a person lacking only one of the essentials AAs will develop a nega- tive nitrogen balance as the rate of protein synthesis decreases in the absence of the amino acid. Branched-chain AAs have been shown to increase muscle protein synthesis while decreasing muscle degra- dation. Branched-chain AAs, which include leucine, isoleucine, and valine, showed a decline in degradation, especially leucine, which, by itself, can decrease catabolism. Protein-sparing effects were noted not only during the administration of the amino acid solution but up to a week after administration.

<!-- chunk -->

## General Principles of Nutrient Administration

1. Adequate calories and nitrogen should be administered with a min- imal amount of water. 2. High-quality protein should be administered in sufficient amounts to achieve neutral nitrogen balance but not so high as to increase urea nitrogen levels. 3. Sodium intake should be adjusted to achieve sodium output unless edema is present. If edema is present, then sodium should be restricted to a quantity less than the daily excretion. Potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate should be monitored to make sure adequate serum concentrations are maintained. 4. Patients should be encouraged to eat, and the minimal dietary requirements for renal insufficiency should be followed unless there is a catabolic illness requiring a greater intake of protein.

## Nutritional Therapies for Chronic Kidney Disease

There are a considerable number of natural therapies that can be used for patients with CKD, not only to support kidney function and decrease rates of decline but also to support the other emunctories that must compensate for decreased kidney function. Therefore liver and skin support for detoxification and elimination are important to address as part of a comprehensive CKD program. As with all natural therapies, individualization of treatment plans is important because patients with CKD will present with their own unique presentations due to the stressors of the disease process. Most of the causes of kidney damage can be controlled by helping people make better choices. The key environmental nephrotoxic agents include cadmium, mercury, fluorinated hydrocarbons, and glyphosate. Decreasing exposure is primarily accomplished by modifying lifestyle choices. This includes eliminating or significantly reducing consump- tion of conventionally grown foods (e.g., soybeans), eliminating tobacco smoking, avoiding genetically modified organism (GMO) foods, elim- inating or reducing consumption of large fish (e.g., tuna), avoiding nonstick coatings on pots and pans, and avoiding clothing that is water- proof but breathable. Some of the most immediate benefits can be seen by decreasing toxins of choice, such as excessive dietary salt, excessive dietary phosphates, and drugs such as NSAIDs. Organic, mostly plant- based foods should be consumed when possible. Eating organic foods has been shown to measurably decrease POP levels within 3 days.48


Vitamin C supplementation in patients with CKD, especially those on dialysis, has been reviewed in several studies looking at its antioxidant effects for lipid peroxidation, enhancement of cellular function, and

its role in mobilizing iron to form hemoglobin. Because there is a high turnover of RBCs in patients with CKD, iron stores will increase due to chronic inflammation and loss from dialysis. Vitamin C plays a key role in mobilizing iron for hemoglobin formation. However, in CKD, an increase in oxidation may occur because of ascorbate, causing addi- tional stress to already-uremic patients. Depending on the study, levels of 60 to 300 mg per day or 1 to 1½ g per week are recommended above intake from food sources.49,50


Patients with CKD show reduced levels of 1- α hydroxylase, the enzyme that converts calcifediol/25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) to its more active form, calcitriol/1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH] 2 D). Because of this, patients with CKD are most often supplemented with a vitamin D replacement of the active form of 1,25-dihydroxvi- tamin D.51 Because extra-renal 1- α hydroxylation does occur, some nephrologists recommend supplementing with the unactivated form of vitamin D, allowing the extra-renal sites to regulate calcium and phosphorus balance.52 The half-life of calcifediol/25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) is to 3 weeks except in renal failure, where it will last up to 2 to 3 times that. The half-life of calcitriol/1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH] 2 D is 3 to 6 hours, but the pharmacological activity can last 3 to 6 days. When administering vitamin D, the serum calcium and phosphorus levels should be checked monthly to adjust dietary intake because of changes in kidney production as well as supplementation. In dialysis patients, they should be checked weekly.51,53


Vitamin E has been shown to be an excellent protector and stabilizer of cell membranes, especially in RBCs and lung tissue. This is because of its antioxidant properties, anti-inflammatory, and anti–platelet aggre- gation effects. Vitamin E was shown in one study to lower the pro- tein/creatinine ratios while somewhat increasing the mean GFR.54,55 Asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA), an inhibitor of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, is elevated in CKD and is considered a risk factor for the development of arteriosclerosis. A study evaluating the effects of ADMA concluded that vitamin E supplementation increased the bioavailability of nitric oxide, lowering the risk of arteriosclerosis.56

## Fish Oil

Consumption of fish, either in the diet or supplemented fish oils, shows a reduction in the development of CKD.57 Fish oil supports kidney function through anti-inflammatory effects and the regu- lation of blood pressure.55 Fish oil has also been found to slow the progress of kidney disease in patients with IgA nephropathy. Fish oils have also been found to protect renal function in patients undergoing Cyclosporin therapy for psoriasis as well as with renal transplant.58,59

<!-- chunk -->

## Flax Oil

Flax oil, a source of alpha-linoleic acid, has been found to be beneficial because it reduces renal injury in experimental polycystic kidney dis- ease by decreasing associated interstitial nephritis.60 This is due in large part to its anti-inflammatory properties and its ability to alter the renal content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which promotes the formation of less inflammatory classes of renal prostanoids.61

<!-- chunk -->

## N-Acetylcysteine

N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is believed to promote the production of glu- tathione, an antioxidant that prevents damage to important cellular components caused by free radicals, lipid peroxidation, and heavy metals. NAC is used for the treatment of acetaminophen toxicity as well as a mucolytic in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic obstruc- tive pulmonary disease. NAC also provides protection in patients with CKD by increasing glutathione production and reducing exposure to acetaminophen and contrast dyes.62,63 Additionally, NAC has been shown, along with the iron chelator deferoxamine and Ginkgo biloba extract, to protect against cisplatin lipid peroxidation, with NAC and deferoxamine having the greatest effect.64

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha-Lipoic Acid

Alpha-lipoic acid (ALP) has been shown to attenuate the effects of other antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, especially in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Additionally, ALP increased renal cor- tical glutathione levels in patients with diabetes.65 Another study looked at the effects of ALP on doxorubicin-induced renal dam- age and found that there was greater mitigation of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis parameters with pretreatment with ALP. These studies suggest that ALP, used in conjunction with other antioxidants, provides additional protection against oxida- tive stress in CKD.66

<!-- chunk -->

## Carnitine

Carnitine supplementation slows the rate of kidney function loss while improving skeletal and cardiac muscle function as well as decreasing anemia, all found in CKD patients. Carnitine slows the rate of kidney function loss, and its deficiency is a common occurrence in dialysis patients, where supplementation has been shown to decrease hospital use in this group.67,68

<!-- chunk -->

## Curcumin

Curcuma longa is a potent antioxidant that protects against pro- tein loss, albuminuria, and hyperlipidemia as well as decreasing kidney damage due to free-radical formation. Additionally, it was found to increase glutathione and glutathione peroxidase activ- ity while eliminating kidney microsomal and mitochondrial lipid peroxidation.69,70

<!-- chunk -->

## Glandulars

Dietary use of renal protomorphogen (kidney tissue extract) helps decrease circulating immune-complex damage in autoimmune disease as well as provide nutrients and growth factors for renal regeneration. Many cultures use organ-specific nutrients when treating specific dis- ease conditions like CKD, as well as to support normal growth and development.


Homeopathic prescriptions for patients with CKD have, in many cases, slowed, stopped, or reversed the progress of the disease. This is partic- ularly seen in patients with acute kidney failure whose course is often rapid and severe, requiring lesional, fundamental, and constitutional prescriptions. In patients with CKD, prescriptions are more often con- stitutional or miasmic due to the slowly evolving nature of the disease. Often used in conjunction with other natural therapies, a wide variety of homeopathic medicines are used to direct the healing process or with dialysis patients to reduce the risk of sepsis and toxemia.71


Botanical medicines, such as Aconite napellis, Arctostaphylos uva ursi, Atropa belladonna, Eupatorium purpureum, Juniperus officinalis, Galium aparine, Rheum palmatum, Salviae militorrhizae, and Solidago odora, are commonly used for CKD. Botanical medicines work differ- ently than drugs in that they contain several different constituents that affect a variety of parameters of kidney function.72–74

## 1516SECTION 6 Diseases

<!-- chunk -->

## Salvia Militorrhizae

As an example, Salvia militorrhizae increases blood flow to the kidney by decreasing platelet adhesion, enhances urea and creatinine clear- ance, stabilizes the glomerular basement membrane by enhancing electrical charge, provides antioxidant and free-radical neutralization, and decreases lipid peroxidation due to the presence of magnesium lithospermate B. It also affects blood pressure by enhancing prosta- glandin E2 for vasodilation while limiting the effects of thromboxane A2 that contribute to vasoconstriction.75

## Hydrastis, Phytolacca, Bryonia, and Baptisia

Herbal medicines such as Echinacea, Hydrastis, Phytolacca, Bryonia, and Baptisia, when used in combination, reduce the risk of the devel- opment of sepsis in dialysis patients. The combination is taken pro- phylactically and at an increased dosage at the first signs of developing sepsis. The formula is often used in conjunction with homeopathic Pyrogenum and/or Echinacea and has been found to quickly restore normal homeostasis.76

## Gotu kola

Traditional Chinese medicine has used Gotu kola to treat kidney dis- eases for centuries. Asiaticoside has been shown to improve microcir- culation and reverse fibrosis in humans with varicose veins. Its direct benefits for the kidneys have only been shown in animals but are encouraging. In rats, G. kola showed a protective effect for Adriamycin- induced nephropathy, resulting in dramatically improved kidney function.77 Another study combined G. kola in conjunction with nar- ingenin and showed decreased fibrosis formation in the kidneys.78

## Dark Chocolate

Dark chocolate consumption improves oxygenation of the kidneys in all individuals. The benefit is directly proportional to catechin levels.79 Animal research has shown that catechins also protect the kidneys from oxidative stress from toxic drugs like cyclosporine.80

## Blueberry

Blueberry anthocyanins specifically protect the kidneys from bowel-derived endotoxins. Fig. 190.4 shows how blueberries increase the GFR in normal kidneys (but the increase is not statistically significant) and completely pro- tect the kidneys from the dramatic lowering of GFR caused by gut toxins in those with impaired function.81

## Zingiber officinale

There is ample animal research showing that Zingiber officinale not only improves kidney function but is especially beneficial in protecting the kidney from cadmium. The primary mechanism of protection appears to be ginger’s ability to decrease inflammation and oxidative damage to kidney tissue exposed to a variety of toxins. The anti- inflammatory benefits of ginger in the kidney result from its antioxidant proper- ties and the epigenetic downregulation of proinflammatory genes.82 Several animal studies have shown that ginger can protect the kid- neys from cadmium. One study found the anti-inflammatory effects

of ginger to be strong enough to prevent most of the kidney damage from cadmium.83 Another found almost no histological kidney dam- age when ginger was fed along with cadmium.84 Animal research has also shown kidney protection from alcohol, malathion, carbon tetra- chloride, chromates, fructose, gentamycin, ischemia, lead, and cancer drugs.85–87 Fig. 190.5 shows restoration of kidney function in rats that already had diabetes.87 Herbal medicines have also been found to contribute to the devel- opment of CKD when used incorrectly, misidentified, or contami- nated. Consulting a botanical material medica before prescribing for CKD is highly recommended.88


There is no substitute for vigorously avoiding all causes of kidney dam- age, especially environmental toxins and NSAIDs.

## Stone Formation

Conditions favoring stone formation can be divided into two groups: factors increasing the concentration of stone crystalloids and factors favoring stone formation at normal urinary concentrations (Fig. 191.2). The first group includes a reduction in urine volume (dehy- dration) and an increased rate of excretion of stone constituents. The second group is related to urinary stasis, pH changes, foreign bodies, and reduction of normal substances that solubilize stone constituents. See Tables 191.1 and 191.2 for an outline of the diagnostic possibilities.


<!-- chunk -->

## Stone Composition

Diagnosing the type of kidney stone is critical to identifying the appro- priate therapy. Careful evaluation of the following criteria usually determines the composition of the stone if one is not available for chemical analysis: • Diet • Underlying metabolic or disease factors • Serum and urinary calcium, uric acid, creatinine, and electrolyte levels • Urinalysis • Urine culture Table 191.3 summarizes the findings in the major types of kidney stones.


Calcium-containing stones are composed of calcium oxalate, calcium oxalate mixed with calcium phosphate, or very rarely calcium phos- phate alone. The high incidence of calcium-containing stones in afflu- ent societies is directly associated with the following dietary patterns: • Low amounts of fiber5 • Intake of highly refined carbohydrates6,7

• High alcohol consumption8 • Large amounts of animal protein8,9 • High intake of fat10 • High intake of soft drinks11 • High intake of fructose12 The classification of most stones as either “idiopathic” or “hyper- calciuria” reflects an ignorance of the dietary factors that induce hyper- uricemia, hypercalciuria, and stone formation. The cumulative effect of these dietary factors is undoubtedly the reason for the rising inci- dence of kidney stones. As a group, vegetarians have a lower risk of stone development. Studies have shown that even among meat eaters, those who ate higher amounts of fresh fruits and vegetables had a lower incidence of stones.13 Bran supplementation, as well as the simple change from white to whole-wheat bread, has resulted in lower urinary calcium levels.5 Dietary factors may also play a role in acidifying or alkalinizing urine. Depending on the type of stone, this ability to alter urinary pH may help treat and prevent stones.14 In one study, 12 healthy men were given a standardized diet plus cranberry, black currant, or plum juice. These subjects then provided 24-hour urine collections for evaluation. The researchers found that cranberry juice decreased the urinary pH and significantly increased the excretion of oxalic acid and the rela- tive supersaturation for uric acid. Black currant juice increased urinary pH, excretion of citric acid, and loss of oxalic acid. Plum juice effected no change.15 The researchers concluded that black currant juice could support the treatment and prevention of uric acid stones through its alkalizing effect. Conversely, because cranberry juice acidifies urine, it could be useful in the treatment of brushite and struvite stones as well as for urinary tract infections.16 Increased fluid intake has been recognized as one of the main approaches to decrease urine supersaturation. An increase in the urine volume results in a decrease in stone prevalence. Numerous random- ized controlled trials (RCTs) have found that consumption of more than 2 L/day of water17 or increased fluid intake to achieve a urine out- put of more than 2.5 L/day18 lowers the long-term risk of kidney stone recurrence by approximately 60% versus no treatment. One trial, conducted in stone-forming men with a baseline soft drink consumption of more than 160 mL/day, reported a reduction in self-reported physician-confirmed episodes of renal colic in those randomized and advised to abstain from soft drink intake versus no intervention for 3 years. Total fluid intake was similar in both groups.11

# DIET

In one study, high levels of dietary calcium in men younger than age 60 were associated with decreased stone formation, but there was no effect in men older than age 60, nor was a supplemental dietary intake of more than 500 mg of calcium associated with an increased risk of stones.19 The specific type of stone was not elucidated in this study, and it was assumed that the majority of kidney stones reported by the cohort population consisted predominantly of calcium oxalate, as in the gen- eral population. The cause of this age-specific difference is unclear. Dietary calcium may bind to dietary oxalate in the intestine, thereby reducing oxalate absorption and the subsequent concentration of uri- nary oxalate. Both vitamin D deficiency and a diminished ability to absorb dietary calcium are more prevalent in older people.19

<!-- chunk -->

## Sodium and Salt

Regarding dietary salt content, observational studies suggested a strong relation between sodium consumption and hypercalciuria, but more recent evidence has challenged this idea. High sodium intake is known to reduce renal tubular reabsorption of calcium, thereby increasing the amount of calcium excreted in the urine (Fig. 191.3).20 Also, a high-sodium diet is known to increase urine pH and has been proposed to reduce urine citrate.21 Other studies show a positive association between urinary sodium and calcium excretion and suggest that stone formers may be more sensitive to the calciuric effect of sodium.22 Nouvenne et al.23 found that when patients with idiopathic calcium stones were treated with sodium restriction (60 mmol/day) and high fluid intake, a reduction of 100 mmol of urinary sodium was accom- panied by a reduction of 64 mg/day in urinary calcium, with 30% of patients achieving normal urine calcium. In contrast, other data, specifically in patients with hypocitra- turia (not hypercalciuria), demonstrated that dietary sodium sup- plementation resulted in increased voided volume and decreased calcium-oxalate supersaturation.24 This must be carefully examined because these patients were followed for only a short period of time and were already using pharmacological interventions for stone

disease. Although results continue to be conflicting, reduced dietary sodium is a general recommendation given to most patients with a history of kidney stones.

## Fructose

Sports drinks have become increasingly popular within the past decade. The content of citrate in such beverages would be expected to increase urine citrate excretion and urine pH, providing protec- tion against both calcium and uric acid stones. However, the pur- posely high sodium content of sports drinks, promoted as useful for “rehydration” in athletes, might be associated with increases in urine calcium excretion. In addition, the ingestion of significant amounts of sucrose and fructose in these drinks could also be associated with increases in calcium excretion.7 Fructose, a component of corn syrup frequently added to sports drinks and sodas as a sweetener, would also be an undesirable way for most stone formers to increase urine volume, given its recent links to hyperuricemia, metabolic syndrome, and stones.25,26 Citrate is an important inhibitor of the aggregation and growth of calcium-oxalate and calcium-phosphate crystals. In the past, dietary interventions to increase citrate have included lemonade and orange juice.27,28 The results with lemonade are conflicting, with one study showing an increase in urine volume but not in urine citrate.29 Another citrus juice, grapefruit, may prove to be effective in increasing urinary citrate levels and reducing the BONN risk index score, suggesting an overall protective effect on crystallization. Although the urinary oxa- late levels may be increased, crystallization is decreased and offset by increased citrate.30–32 Regular consumption of grapefruit juice should be avoided, how- ever. In one large-scale study, women drinking 8 oz of grapefruit juice daily increased their risk of stones by 44%. Hyperoxaluria is a metabolic risk factor for stone disease. Dietary oxalate may contribute as much as 80% of the urine oxalate.33,34 Therefore a low-oxalate diet may provide benefit for patients with hyperoxaluria. In addition, adequate dietary calcium to minimize intestinal oxalate absorption has been shown to be beneficial. Borghi et al.,35 in a randomized trial in men with recurrent calcium-oxalate stones, achieved a significant reduction in oxalate excretion and the incidence of recurrent stones for patients on a normal-calcium (1200 mg/day), low-animal-protein, low-salt diet compared with a low-cal- cium diet (400 mg/day).

## Dietary Recommendations for Patients With High Urine

<!-- chunk -->

## Oxalate

<!-- chunk -->

## Low-Oxalate Diet

A low-oxalate diet is a common prescription for recurrent calcium- oxalate kidney stones. The ultimate goal is to reduce the level of oxalic acid being excreted in the urine. It appears that people with recurrent kidney stones have a tendency to absorb higher levels of dietary oxa- lates, up to 50%,33 compared with normal subjects not prone to kidney stones, who absorb only 3% to 8% of dietary oxalate. A low-oxalate diet is usually defined as less than 50 mg of oxalate per day, so foods in the high- and moderate-oxalate categories have to be curtailed. Box 191.1 provides an estimate of the oxalate content of food, which is highly variable. The level of oxalate in a particular food in published reports can vary twofold to fifteenfold. Differences in climate, soil quality, state of ripeness, or even which part of the plant is analyzed will also affect the value. Although the role of oxalates in the development and risk of kid- ney stones is unclear, with some research showing only a modest cor- relation, clinically it would be prudent for stone formers to reduce intake. However, the stringency of following a low-oxalate diet must be considered and tailored to the patient and his or her potential comorbidities.36

<!-- chunk -->

## Weight and Carbohydrate Metabolism

Weight control and the correction of carbohydrate metabolism are important because excess weight and insulin insensitivity lead to hypercalciuria and are high-risk factors for stone formation.37,38 After glucose ingestion, there is a rise in urinary calcium, and phosphate reabsorption decreases. This leads to a low plasma phosphate con- centration, which stimulates the production of 1,25-dihydroxycho- lecalciferol and results in increased intestinal absorption of calcium; concurrently; it also causes hypercalciuria. The ingestion of sucrose and other simple sugars causes an exaggerated rise in the urinary cal- cium-oxalate content in approximately 70% of people with recurrent kidney stones.39

<!-- chunk -->

## Gut Flora

Studies are beginning to find a correlation between the proper balance of intestinal flora and a lower risk of oxalate kidney stones. Oxalate homeostasis depends in part on the intestinal anaerobic bacterium Oxalobacter formigenes. It now appears that O. formigenes contributes to oxalic acid homeostasis and that its absence may predispose individ- uals to idiopathic calcium-oxalate kidney stone disease.39 This bacte- rium is found primarily in the colon, and its loss through prolonged, widespread use of antibiotics is associated with an increased risk of hyperoxaluria and calcium-oxalate stone formation.40 Studies in ani- mals and human volunteers have indicated that, when administered therapeutically, O. formigenes can repopulate the gut and reduce the urinary oxalate concentration after an oxalate load, hence reducing the incidence of calcium-oxalate kidney stone formation.41 More recent human studies have developed showing an inverse correlation with O. formigenes colonization and recurrent nephrolithiasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and idiopathic calcium nephrolithiasis, thus suggesting this unique commensal may confer some protection against future kidney stone disease.42

## Nutrients

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnesium and Vitamin B

<!-- chunk -->

## 6

A magnesium-deficient diet accelerates the deposition of calcium in renal tubules in rats.43 Magnesium has been shown to increase the sol- ubility of calcium oxalate and inhibit the precipitation of both calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate.44–46 A low ratio of urinary magne- sium to calcium is an independent risk factor for stone formation.47 Supplemental magnesium alone has been shown to be effective in pre- venting recurrences of kidney stones. When magnesium is used in conjunction with vitamin B 6 , an even greater effect is noted.48,49 Pyridoxine is known to reduce the endog- enous production and urinary excretion of oxalates,50,51 and patients with recurrent oxalate stones have abnormal activation levels of erythrocyte glutamate pyruvate transaminase, erythrocyte glutamic- oxaloacetic transaminase (EGOT), urinary glutamic-pyruvic acid trans- aminase, and urinary glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, indicating clinical insufficiency of vitamin B 6 as a cofactor and impaired glu- tamic acid synthesis. These levels return to normal after 3 months of treatment.51 Induced pyridoxine deficiency in rats has been shown to produce oxaluria and calcium-oxalate lithiasis (which is prevented by magnesium supplementation).50 Several studies have confirmed the benefits of vitamin B 6 as a sole agent in reducing urine oxalate, albeit with a small population size. Doses between 200 to 500 mg have been shown to normalized hyper- oxaluria in those with calcium-oxalate stones. However, other studies have questioned the benefit of B 6 as a sole agent, with a large review

showing no risk association with vitamin B 6 and kidney stone inci- dent.52 In this large review, the cohorts with the highest vitamin B 6 intake also had the highest use of calcium supplementation, which was not accounted for in the risk incidence of nephrolithiasis. Calcium may have provided a protective effect and altered the risk association.

<!-- chunk -->

## Glutamic Acid

Depressed levels of glutamic acid (from vitamin B 6 deficiency or for other reasons) are significant in the formation of kidney stones because a higher concentration of glutamic acid in the urine induces precipita- tion of calcium oxalate. Glutamic acid supplementation in rats signifi- cantly reduces the incidence of calculi, and it may do so in humans as well.53 Supplementation with glutamic acid may, however, be super- fluous if adequate vitamin B 6 levels are attained.


Although most doctors still tell their patients with kidney stones to avoid calcium supplements, this advice is mostly outdated. A strong body of evidence has emerged refuting the general trend to restrict cal- cium supplementation in patients with kidney stones. One study has even shown that calcium supplementation reduces oxalate excretion.54 This study measured urinary oxalate excretion after calcium supplementation and the administration of oxalic acid. Calcium was given in the form of calcium carbonate or calcium citrate malate at a dose of 300 mg elemental calcium daily. Compared with baseline assessment, calcium supplementation significantly reduced oxalate absorption and excretion. Another study evaluated calcium intake and the dietary profiles in 37 outpatients with kidney stones and 45 control subjects. Dietary calcium, assessed from 4-day dietary records, was significantly lower for patients with urinary calculi.55 A third study further supporting the benefits of calcium intake is a 5-year randomized trial compar- ing the effect of two diets in 120 men with recurrent calcium-oxalate stones and hypercalciuria.56 Upon completion, the men consuming the normal-calcium diet experienced a 51% reduction in the risk of stone recurrence. During follow-up, urinary calcium levels dropped aGreater than 200 mg per serving. bGreater than 50 mg per serving. cGreater than 100 mg per serving.

## 1525CHAPTER 191 Kidney Stones

significantly in both groups, but urinary oxalate was reduced in the normal-calcium-intake group and increased in the low-calcium-intake group. Finally, one large prospective epidemiological investigation also reported that kidney stones were more likely to manifest in individuals with the lowest daily calcium intakes (516 mg) than in those with the highest daily calcium intakes (1326 mg).57 These studies clearly demonstrate that calcium supplementation (300–1000 mg daily) may prove to be an effective preventive measure against calcium-oxalate kidney stones. One large trial, however, of more than 36,000 postmenopausal women with no history of kidney stones showed, compared with placebo, a 17% increased risk of self-reported urinary tract stones in women who consumed 1000 mg of calcium carbonate plus 400 IU of vitamin D daily. For postmenopausal women, the implications of cal- cium carbonate ingestion may differ from those for younger women and men, for unknown reasons. Calcium absorbability comes into question in this population of women, particularly when the elemental form used is carbonate.58 This study contradicts other data indicating that vitamin D supplementation can be provided to postmenopausal women who are not stone formers and who are vitamin D–insufficient without fear of an increased risk of kidney stones.59

<!-- chunk -->

## Citrate

Low urinary citrate excretion is known to pose a risk for nephrolithi- asis.60 Although urinary calcium rises in patients consuming calcium citrate, some of citrate’s effects inhibit the formation of kidney stones. Specifically, citrate has the ability to reduce urinary saturation of cal- cium oxalate and calcium phosphate and to retard the nucleation and crystal growth of calcium salts. The use of potassium or sodium citrate in the treatment of recurrent urinary saturation of calcium oxalate has been shown to be effective in clinical studies, ending stone formation in nearly 90% of the subjects.61 For example, in one study, 31 mmol/ day of potassium citrate provided to recurrent stone formers who were also hypocitraturic resulted in a drop of stone formation from 0.7 to 0.13 per year.62 Another 3-year, double-blind study of 57 people with a history of calcium stones and low urinary citrate levels revealed that those given potassium citrate developed fewer kidney stones than they had previ- ously. In comparison, the group given a placebo had no change in their rate of stone formation.63 However, rather than potassium or sodium citrate, magnesium citrate appears to offer the greatest benefit. Magnesium citrate slows the growth rate of brushite crystals, nucle- ation rate, and supersaturation of urine. In addition, because magne- sium competes with calcium in binding oxalates in both the gut and urine, the ratio of magnesium to calcium in the urine is used in esti- mating stone risk.64

## Vitamin K

The urinary glycoprotein, a powerful inhibitor of calcium-oxalate monohydrate growth, requires posttranscriptional carboxylation of glutamic acid to form gamma-carboxyglutamic acid. Vitamin K is an essential factor for this carboxylation to occur.65 Impairment of glu- tamic acid formation or a vitamin K deficiency reduces the formation of this glycoprotein. The presence of vitamin K in green leafy vegeta- bles may contribute to the lower incidence of kidney stones among vegetarians.66

<!-- chunk -->

## Uric Acid Metabolism

The level of dietary purine consumption is linearly related to the rate of urinary uric acid excretion.67 This relationship is important because hyperuricosuria is a causative factor in recurrent calcium-oxalate stones. High levels of supplemental folic acid promote purine-scaveng- ing and xanthine oxidase inhibition, resulting in decreased excretion of uric acid (see Chapter 174). Higher urine pH also helps with uric acid solubility68; however, manipulation of urine pH is a complex task because it will be affected not only by diet and hydration status but also by weight and body mass index (BMI). Higher BMIs have been associ- ated with lower urine pH.69,70 Including a weight-reduction goal when appropriate may benefit patients with uric acid stones or low urine pH, although the long-term benefits are unknown.


There are limited clinical trials with the use of medicinal herbs for kid- ney stones, and those that exist are poorly designed. We focus briefly on the traditional in vitro and in vivo use of a number of botanicals. Anthraquinones isolated from the Rubia, Cassia, and Aloe species bind calcium and significantly reduce the growth rate of urinary crys- tals when used in oral doses lower than the laxative dose.71,72 Rubia tinctura, Rumex, Rheum, Polygonum aviculare, Aloe,73 Senna, Rhamnus alnus, and Mitchella repens are sources of these anthraquinones and may be used to prevent stone formation; during acute attacks, they may help reduce the size of the stone. The furanocoumarin-containing herb Ammi visnaga has been shown to be unusually effective in relaxing the ureter and allowing the stone to pass.74 This action is due to its calcium channel–blocking capabilities, which act primarily on the ureters. Atropine and papav- erine have similar but less active smooth muscle–relaxing effects. Peucedanum, Leptotania, Ruta graveolens, and Hydrangea contain similar furanocoumarins that also promote smooth muscle relax- ation, and all of these herbs have historical uses in the treatment of kidney stones. Eupatorium purpureum (gravel root), as its name implies, has tradi- tionally been used for treating urinary stones (“gravel”). The Eclectics, physicians who employed natural therapies at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, considered it as mildly astringent, a stimulant, and a tonic with a specific action on the urinary tract.66 It was said to have the power to dissolve concretions. One of several reasons why kidney stones are painful when they are passed is because they produce spasm in the ureters. Spasmolytic herbs have been clinically effective for controlling ureteral spasm in such cases, whereas diuretic herbs are also used to push sufficiently small stones through the ureters more slowly and tolerably. Currently, the use of these herbs is more dependent on tradition than on scientific data. Some of the more popular spasmolytic herbs that have been reliably effective in this realm include Ammi visnaga (khella) fruit, which is also strong enough to use for angina pectoris and acute asthma, and Lobelia, Piscidia piscipula (Jamaican dogwood) bark, gelsemium, and western pasque flower. Hyoscyamus niger (henbane) herb is also useful; it is an even stronger anticholinergic antispasmodic—like belladonna but with an affinity for the genitourinary tract.75 In two clinical trials, participants with a history of nephrolithia- sis and with radiographic stones present at baseline were randomized to Orthosiphon grandiflorus extract 2.5 g in tea twice daily or to sodium- potassium citrate 5 to 10 g three times daily for 18 months.24 Serial ultrasound was used to measure mean annualized reduction in stone diameter at 18 months. The two treatments were equally effective at reducing stone size over a year’s time, with far fewer adverse effects in the tea group.76 Phyllanthus niruri has been shown to inhibit calcium-oxalate crys- tallization in the test tube. Although reportedly diuretic in rodent and human studies,77,78 low-dose studies find that it is not significantly diuretic in rats, although it still significantly dissolves stones.78

## 1526SECTION 6 Diseases

In one clinical trial, 69 subjects were randomized to extract capsules 450 mg of Phyllanthus three times daily or to placebo for 3 months.79 Among those randomized to receive P. niruri, there was a reduction of hypercalciuria in those patients who had this problem initially, but no significant effect on calculus elimination or calculus size was observed.

## Sleep Position

Even though the etiology of recurrent unilateral kidney stones is unclear, patients with recurrent renal calculi most often present with calculi on the same side. Data from the literature support the notion that sleep posture may contribute to alterations of renal hemodynam- ics. Researchers studied 110 patients who suffered from kidney stones confined to one side of their bodies. Of these patients, 93 consistently favored sleeping with one side in a dependent position. Further study showed that the side of the stone was identical to the dependent sleep side in 76%, with positive predictive values of right-side-down and left-side-down sleep postures for ipsilateral stone formation at 82% and 70%, respectively.80

## Stress

One case-control study of 200 patients with symptomatic kidney stones and 200 matched controls demonstrated a statistically signifi- cantly higher rate of kidney stone formation in people who had more stressful life events. Such events were defined as those that the subjects perceived as highly stressful by inflicting an intense emotional effect on them, with apprehension and distress, for at least 1 week.81 It is hypothesized that stressful events may encourage the loss of litholy- tic urinary constituents such as magnesium and citrate.82 The sympa- thetic “fight-or-flight” response may increase vasopressin release, thus contributing to a more hypertonic urine.83 Furthermore, the stress response results in a stimulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary axis, resulting in increased release of not only vasopressin but also adre- nocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This stress response and increased ACTH can directly increase parathyroid hormone, resulting in hyper- calcemia and subsequent hypercalciuria.84 Furthermore, the stress adaptation response via the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis may chronically increase cortisol secretion, which has a similar physiologi- cal effect as vasopressin on the renal tubules, thus further contributing to hypertonic urine.

## Toxin Exposure

Hair mineral analysis may be of value because many heavy met- als (mercury, gold, uranium, and cadmium) are nephrotoxic. Cadmium, in particular, has been shown to greatly increase the incidence of kidney stones. A prospective study of coppersmiths showed a 40% incidence of kidney stones, which correlated with elevations of serum cadmium concentration.85 Additional studies analyzed populations living in cadmium-contaminated environ- ments and found that higher urinary calcium excretion correlated with higher urinary cadmium levels and an increased risk of urinary stone disease.86,87 Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) constitute a group of chemi- cals generated from vehicle exhaust, asphalt, coal tar, wildfires, agri- cultural burning, soil, charbroiled foods, and tobacco smoke. Data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES III), 2011–2012 examined the potential link between uri- nary PAH and kidney stones.88 In 5560 American adults aged 20 to 80, urinary 2-hydroxyfluorene (odds ratio [OR] 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]; 1,02–1.78), 3-hydroxyfluorene (OR = 1.35, 95% CI; 1.07–1.70), 1-hydroxyphenanthrene (OR = 1.48, 95% CI; 1.08–2.03), 1-hydroxypyrene (OR = 1.36, 95% CI; 1.05–1.77), and 2-hydroxynaph- thalene (OR = 1.25, 95% CI; 1.00–1.58) were significantly associated with kidney stones. Interestingly, researchers examining data from NHANES III found that individuals with the highest dietary zinc intake (>15 mg/ day) were associated with a significantly increased risk of kidney stone disease compared with those with lower dietary zinc intake (<7 mg/day).89

## Vitamin C and the Risk of Oxalate Stones

Vitamin C is often cited in the medical literature as a potential factor in the development of calcium-oxalate kidney stones. Numerous studies have now demonstrated that in persons not undergoing hemodialy- sis or suffering from recurrent kidney stones, severe kidney disease, or gout, high-dose vitamin C therapy does not cause kidney stones. Vitamin C ingestion of up to 10 g/day has not had any effect on urinary oxalate levels.90,91 On the contrary, several human trials consistently indicate that a large percentage of individuals—regardless of kidney stone history, age, gender, and race—ingesting 1000 to 2000 mg of ascorbic acid for only short periods experience hyperoxaluria to some degree. A more recent clinical study concurs with previous studies in demonstrating mean increases in total oxalate excretion with ascorbic acid supplementation.91 Another recent double-blind, crossover RCT of 50 healthy adults compared vitamin C with metabolites (Ester-C) to ascorbic acid. Only 41% of subjects on vitamin C with metabolites experienced an increase in 24-hour oxalate, which is 25% fewer compared with ascorbic acid. This implies that if one needs to consume vitamin C, Ester-C may be most beneficial for stone formers; however, the beneficial effects of Ester-C are still controversial.92

## Inositol Hexaphosphate

Inositol hexaphosphate (also known as phytic acid or IP6), a naturally occurring compound found in whole grains, cereals, legumes, seeds, and nuts, is known for its antineoplastic activity. One trial showed that the use of 120 mg per day of IP-6 significantly reduced, within in days, the formation of calcium-oxalate crystals in the urine of people with a history of kidney stones.93 One literature review reported several human studies demonstrating the effectiveness of phytic acid against four types of kidney stones.94


Effective treatment of kidney stones requires accurate differentiation between the various stone types and recognition and control of any underlying metabolic diseases or structural abnormalities of the uri- nary tract. Tables 191.1 and 191.2 list diagnosable causes of kidney stones. Prevention of recurrence is the therapeutic aim in the treatment of kidney stones. Because dietary management is effective, inexpensive, and free of side effects, it is the treatment of choice. The specific treat- ment is determined by the type of stone and may include the following: • Reducing urinary calcium • Reducing purine intake • Avoiding foods high in oxalate • Increasing intake of foods with a high magnesium/calcium ratio • Increasing intake of vitamin K–rich foods For all types of stones, increasing urine flow to dilute the urine is vital. Enough fluids should be consumed to produce urine with a spe- cific gravity lower than 1.015 and urinary volume of at least 2000 mL daily.

## 1527CHAPTER 191 Kidney Stones

As far as lifestyle changes are concerned, if stones occur on one side only, it may be helpful to avoid sleeping on that side. Stress-reduction techniques and counseling should be considered for anyone with stones and a history of significant stress.

## Acute Obstruction

Surgical removal or lithotripsy may be necessary; the following agents may also be used: • Ammi visnaga extract (12% khellin content): 250 mg three times a day • Rubia tinctura, Rumex crispus, or A. vera at doses lower than used for laxative effect

<!-- chunk -->

## Calcium Stones


• Increase intake of fiber, complex carbohydrates, and green leafy vegetables. • Decrease intake of simple carbohydrates and purines (meat, fish, poultry, yeast). • Increase consumption of foods with high magnesium/calcium ratios (barley, bran, corn, buckwheat, rye, soy, oats, brown rice, avocados, bananas, cashews, coconut, peanuts, sesame seeds, lima beans, potatoes). • If the stones are oxalate, reduce consumption of oxalate-containing foods (black tea, cocoa, spinach, beet leaves, rhubarb, parsley, cran- berries, nuts). • Limit consumption of dairy products.


• Vitamin B 6 : 25 mg/day • Vitamin K: 2 mg/day • Magnesium: 600 mg/day • Calcium: 300 to 1000 mg/day • IP6: 120 mg/day


Use any of the following agents in a dose less than that used for laxative effect: • R. tinctura • R. crispus • A. vera


Avoid aluminum compounds and alkalis.

<!-- chunk -->

## Uric Acid Stones


• Decrease consumption of purines (see list given for calcium stones). • Ensure adequate fluid intake and a high alkali load, with plenty of fruits and vegetables.


Folic acid: 5 mg/day


Alkalinize urine: citrate, bicarbonate, black currant juice.

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnesium–Ammonium–Phosphate Stones


• Eradicate infection (see Chapter 163). • Acidify urine with ammonium chloride (100–200 mg three times a day).

<!-- chunk -->

## Cystine Stones


Avoid methionine-rich foods (soy, wheat, dairy products except whole milk, fish, meat, lima beans, garbanzo beans, and mushrooms; all nuts except coconut, hazelnut, and sunflower seeds).


Alkalinize urine: optimal pH is 7.5 to 8.

<!-- chunk -->

## Brushite and Struvite Stones

Acidify urine with cranberry juice.

## 1529CHAPTER 192 Leukoplakia

to monitor efficacy, were among the first to evaluate vitamin A and beta-carotene for leukoplakia. The micronucleus test is a useful indi- cator of the neoplastic tendency of epithelial cells because it provides immediate information about genotoxic damage. Micronuclei are formed during chromatid or chromosomal breakage, with the rate of formation tied closely to carcinogenesis in the oral cavity. This rate is a good predictor of cancer, which typically takes years or decades to generate clinically recognizable signs. On the basis of the results of the micronucleus test, Stich et al. found that these two dietary factors, particularly beta-carotene, were effective in decreasing the mean pro- portion of cells with micronuclei on the buccal mucosa in those who chew Asian betel nut and tobacco.15,16 The subjects continued to chew betel nut and tobacco during the study. The epidemiological and experimental data documenting the protec- tive effect of carotenoids and retinoids against epithelial cancers are over- whelming. The inverse relationship between serum retinol and carotene levels and cancer incidence holds true for oral carcinomas as well.17,18 Dosages used in clinical studies testing vitamin A in the treatment of leukoplakia generally were fairly high (i.e., 150,000–900,000 IU/ day) but extremely effective.11–14 Because beta-carotene appears to be as effective as retinol in decreasing the levels of micronuclei and has a much higher therapeutic index, beta-carotene should probably be the treatment of choice for this condition. (Note: Vulvar leukoplakia is also responsive to retinol and could therefore respond to beta-carotene as well.)19,20 However, the only head-to-head comparison study of the two supplements did find an advantage for retinol (see Table 192.1). In this study, 160 men and women with leukoplakia were randomly assigned to receive oral vitamin A (retinyl acetate 300,000 IU/week for 12 months; n = 50), oral beta-carotene (360 mg/week for 12 months; n = 55), or placebo (n = 55).21 The complete regression rates were 10% in the placebo arm, 52% with vitamin A, and 33% with beta-carotene. Homogeneous leukoplakias and smaller lesions responded better than nonhomogeneous and larger lesions. No major toxicities were observed even in the group given prolonged vitamin A supplementation.

# LYCOPENE

A randomized controlled trial of the carotenoid lycopene conducted over 5 months found no significant difference in the clinical response of subjects taking 8 mg lycopene orally twice daily compared with those taking 4 mg twice daily. Both groups had significantly greater responses than those in the control group. Histological assessment was significantly better in the group taking 8 mg of lycopene.22

# OTHER ANTIOXIDANTS

Antioxidants in addition to beta-carotene may be helpful in treating leu- koplakia. For example, studies have shown alpha-tocopherol (400 IU twice daily for 24 weeks) to produce a 65% response rate.23 However, it makes the most sense to use a combination of antioxidant nutrients (includ- ing using mixed tocopherols rather than just one of the eight isomers), given their beneficial interactions and their limitations as monotherapy. Preliminary results using a combination of vitamin C (1000 mg/day), beta-carotene (30 mg/day), and vitamin E (400 IU/day) are encouraging.24

# CURCUMIN

Curcumin has recently shown promise in vitro as a chemopreventive agent for leukoplakia.25

# ANTHOCYANINS

Black raspberry extract has demonstrated reduction of DNA damage and mutagenesis in cell studies of oral leukoplakia, supporting a role for this anthocyanin in the inhibition of oral carcinogenesis.26


Because leukoplakia is due to a combination of excessive carcinogenic irritation in the context of marginal or low levels of vitamin A, the approach is simple: eliminate all sources of irritation and establish optimal vitamin A, beta-carotene, and antioxidant levels. Particularly significant irritation results from the smoking or chewing of tobacco, the chewing of betel nut, and exposure to ultraviolet light.

# SUPPLEMENTS

• Vitamin A: 25,000 IU/day • Beta-carotene: 30 to 90 mg/day • Lycopene 8 mg twice daily • Vitamin C: 1000 to 3000 mg/day • Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols): 400 IU/day • Curcumin: 500 mg twice daily • Black raspberry extract: 500 mg daily

## Incidence, Onset, and Course

Although not common, lichen planus occurs in 6 per 1000 patients seen by dermatologists, with an annual prevalence of 4.4 per 1000 peo- ple in the United States. However, oral lichen planus may be the most common cause of white lesions in the mouth, occurring in 0.5% to 1% of dental patients. Women tend to be affected more than men, and the age at onset is 30 to 60 years. Onset can be acute or insidious, with lesions remaining for months to years. Diagnosis is commonly made via history, physical examina- tion, and biopsy if necessary. The course of oral lichen planus may be chronic, lasting from months to years. Approximately two thirds of patients experience spontaneous resolution within 1 year. Recurrence is uncommon in both forms, being seen in less than 20% of patients. Patients with mucous membrane involvement usually have a more prolonged course, possibly lasting months to decades, although 50% experience remission within 2 years. The incidence of oral squamous cell carcinoma in individuals with oral lichen planus is 5% higher than in those with lesions in other locations. A significant increase of malig- nant transformation risk has been noted among smokers (odds ratio [OR] = 2, 95% confidence interval [CI]; 1.25–3.22), alcoholics (OR = 3.52, 95% CI; 1.54–8.03), and HCV-infected patients (OR = 5, 95% CI; 1.56–16.07), compared with patients without these risk factors.4 The list of possible causative medications is long. The most common are gold, antimalarial agents, penicillamine, thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), quinidine, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.5 The interval between administration of the offending agent and the development of lichenoid drug eruptions is usually a few months, ranging from days to several years.5

## Dental Amalgams

Dental amalgams appear to play a role in the etiology of oral lichen pla- nus. In one study, 161 patients with chronic lichenoid reactions (142) or oral lichen planus (19) underwent replacement of mercury amalgam fillings with alternative substances. Five patients served as controls, receiving no restoration. Evaluation 6 to 12 months after restoration showed that 95% of the patients with chronic lichenoid reactions had marked improvement or complete restoration of normal mucosa. The effect was more apparent for those with gold crowns than those with CM (palladium-based) crowns. In the oral lichen planus group, those areas of lesions in contact with amalgam showed an improve- ment in 63% of patients, but lesions at other sites were not affected.6 A second study found that if gold crowns are already present, patients should undergo patch testing for gold allergy; removal of the crowns should be considered in those with positive results.7 The former study downplays the significance of patch testing for mercury because many patch-negative patients still responded to amalgam removal. However, in cases of positive patch-test reactions to mercury compounds, partial or complete replacement of amalgam fillings will lead to a significant improvement in nearly all patients.8,9

## Photodynamic Therapy

Phototherapy, especially with narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB), is effective, but caution must be taken because of the risk of keob- nerization (i.e., injury to the skin can cause further formation).10 A retrospective analysis of 50 patients with generalized cutaneous lichen planus treated by broad-band (n = 7) or narrow-band (n = 43) ultra- violet B radiation showed a complete response in 70%; 85% of these responders were still in remission after a median of 34.7 months.11 Another report involves a 64-year-old man with lichen planus of the penis that did not respond to steroids.12 In this case, photodynamic therapy was preceded (4 hours before treatment) by application of 5-aminolevulinic acid (20%) ointment. The area was irradiated with a Paterson-Whitehurst lamp (Paterson Institute, Christie Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom) at a center wavelength of 630 nm and a rectangular passband of 27 nm. The dose was gradually increased to J/cm2 at a fluence rate of 55 mW/cm2 to prevent edema and phimosis. Treatment was repeated after 6 weeks. The lesions resolved completely after another 4 weeks, with no recurrence at 6 months. Photodynamic therapy with medium-dose ultraviolet A-1 has successfully treated ulcerative lichen planus of the feet in another case.13

## Vitamin Deficiencies

Correction of low levels of vitamins B 1 and B 6 in patients with oral lichen planus (OLP) resulted in both clinical and subjective improve- ment in the majority treated but did not produce complete remission of the lesions.14 In 77 patients with lichen planus (cutaneous lichen planus [CLP], 49 cases; OLP, 28 cases), compared with the control group (19.82 mg/ dL), the level of ascorbic acid was significantly lower, both in patients with CLP (8.47 mg/dL, p = 0.001) and in those with OLP (8.04 mg/ dL, p = 0.001).15 In patients with lichen planus, it was found that the deficiency of ascorbic acid increases with age. In addition, the urinary concentrations of ascorbic acid were significantly lower in patients with lichen planus associated with infections, compared with patients with lichen planus without infections. An additional study found that patients with OLP had a signifi- cantly higher frequency of deficiencies in hemoglobin (men < 13 g/dL, women < 12 g/dL), iron (<60 μ g/dL), and/or vitamin B 12 (< 200 pg/ mL) and abnormally elevated blood homocysteine levels than healthy control participants.16

## Vitamin A and Beta-Carotene

Six patients with hypertrophic lichen planus of the palms or soles used topical retinoic acid (0.1% in petroleum jelly base) three times daily for 3 weeks. This frequency caused irritation, so application was switched to two to three times every other day. Regression occurred after 2 to weeks. The duration of treatment was unspecified in the study report. Two cases showed slight recurrences after 3 to 4 months.17 A second study compared topical retinoic acid 0.05% (RA) and flu- ocinolone acetonide 0.1% (FA) applied four times daily. Thirty-three patients with varying stages of OLP were alternately given RA (15) or FA (18); 56% of patients receiving FA improved, but only 13% of patients receiving RA improved. The extent of change was greater in the FA group as well.18 Small doses of vitamin A acid locally applied produced improvement or regression in hypertrophic lichen planus of the palms or soles in a small number of patients.19 Retinaldehyde gel 0.1% showed good clinical efficacy in 17 patients with OLP, resulting in 6% disappearance and 82% improvement of lesions, confirmed by the downregulation of filaggrin and CK-10 as markers of terminal dif- ferentiation.20 In a trial of seven patients with lichen planus of either the penis or anal region, application of 0.1% retinoic acid in Orabase overnight and 10 mg (33,330 IU) of oral retinoic acid three to four times daily for 3 days to 3 weeks resulted in improvement or resolution in all cases.21 In another study, 18 patients with mucosal dysplasia (10 leukopla- kia, 4 lichen planus, 3 erythroplasia, 1 leukokeratosis) were evaluated for serum vitamin A, beta-carotene, and levels of cis-retinoic acid,

which were low normal. All patients received beta-carotene 30 mg four times daily. Disease worsened in one patient, remained stable in nine, and improved in eight, with eventual complete resolution in six of those with improvement. Patients with stable disease were then treated with isotretinoin (Accutane 10 mg three times daily) in conjunction with beta-carotene; three showed improvement. The response to treat- ment was much higher in smokers (30 packs per year or more) than in nonsmokers.22

## Synthetic Retinoids

After topical therapy with 0.1% 13-cis-retinoic acid for 8 weeks, resto- ration of physiological cell morphology was observed in a small group of patients with OLP.23 Both 0.05% and 0.18% isotretinoin also appear to be effective in significantly improving atrophic-erosive OLP.24 A prospective, open-label, single-arm pilot study was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral alitretinoin taken at 30 mg once daily for up to 24 weeks in the treatment of severe OLP refrac- tory to standard topical therapy.25 At the end of treatment, 40% of patients had a >50% reduction in disease severity as measured by the Escudier severity score. Therapy was well tolerated. Adverse events were mild and included headache, mucocutaneous dryness, musculoskeletal pain, increased thyroid-stimulating hormone, and dyslipidemia.

## Glycyrrhizin

Seventeen patients with OLP and hepatitis C were divided into two groups; nine received intravenous glycyrrhizin, and eight were given information on dental hygiene. The treatment group received 40 mL of a 0.2% solution of glycyrrhizin daily for 4 consecutive weeks. Six of the nine treated patients demonstrated clinical improvement. The patients who responded tended to have only mildly raised serum alanine trans- aminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST).26

## Aloe Vera

Thirty-four women with vulval lichen planus, with erosive and ulcer- ative lesions in 83% and 17%, respectively, were randomized into two groups to receive either topical aloe gel or placebo. Of 17 patients treated with Aloe vera, 14 (82%) improved clinically by at least 50% after 8 weeks of treatment, whereas 1 (5%) of 17 placebo-treated patients had a similar response (P < 0.001). Neither group experienced side effects.27

## Hyaluronic Acid

A total of 124 patients with erosive OLP participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy of a top- ical 0.2% hyaluronic acid (HA) preparation for 28 days. Application of topical HA produced a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in soreness scores compared with placebo for up to 4 hours postapplication; there was also a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in the size of the erosive/ ulcerated area after 28 days of treatment compared with baseline. Very frequent applications should be considered to obtain a more signifi- cant clinical benefit.28

<!-- chunk -->

## Purslane

Twenty patients with OLP received 235 mg of purslane per day for months, and 17 received a placebo. Approximately 83% of the purs- lane patients responded with partial or complete clinical improvement, compared with partial improvement in 17% of the placebo group. According to visual analog scale (VAS) scores, a partial or complete response was observed in all purslane-treated patients, whereas 71% of the controls demonstrated partial responses (P < 0.001).29


If the lesions are oral and the patient has significant metal-based fill- ings, heavy-metal detoxification and replacement of the metal fillings should be considered. Correction of vitamin and mineral deficiencies may aid in treat- ment benefit.
