# Foreword

It was with great pleasure that I read the first book of Yifan Yang in 2002. This was Chinese Herbal Medicines: Comparisons and Characteristics. What was so refreshing about Comparisons and Charac- teristics was the clear and detailed description of the functions of the different temperature and taste properties, so that the reader understood why dif­ ferent herbs have different actions. The author then developed this into the excellent contrasts of similar herbs based on differences in temperature, taste, and action. This is vital to the clinical practice of herbal medicine. If the practitioner does not under­ stand the detailed differences between herbs, then they cannot make effective herb combinations. Chinese Herbal Formulas: Treatment Principles and Composition Strategies carries on this good work and greatly enlarges upon it. To make safe and effec­ tive herb combinations, the practitioner must under­ stand the structure of herbal formulas and the principles underlying their construction. We can say that herb combinations are made up of working units: single herbs, herb pairs and herb trios. For each of the main syndrome groups, whether Exterior Wind syndromes or Deficiency syndromes, Yifan Yang discusses the main herb pairs, herb trios, and single herbs that are the foun­ dation for herb formulas to treat that syndrome. Then she organizes these working units into the categories of Chief, Deputy, Assistant, and Envoy, according to their importance and their role in the combination. This is followed by clear analysis of famous formulas on that syndrome. It is hard to overemphasize the clinical impor­ tance of understanding how to use pairs and trios as the foundation of herb formulas. It gives great flexi­ bility and precision to the practitioner. Without this understanding, practitioners can only use set for­ mulas or their very simple modifications. With this understanding the practitioner can make combina­ tions to meet the changing needs of individual patients that are specific, sophisticated, effective and safe. The author has also given most useful practical details, such as adjusting dosage according to patient’s constitution and diet, or according to season and climate. She has emphasized contra­ indications, both for Chinese herbal medicine in general and for each Chinese syndrome group in particular. It is obvious that Yifan Yang is a thought­ ful, careful, and successful practitioner who has made a life’s work of communicating her clinical skills and theoretical knowledge for the benefit of others. I, for one, am very grateful. Jeremy Ross, UK x

# Preface

Chinese herbal formulas, which have been shown to be effective for a wide range of applications, form one of the main therapeutic modalities of tradi­ tional Chinese medicine. As clinical experience has accumulated over the generations, so the number of formulas has increased steadily over time. The formula classic Sheng Ji Zong Lu (Comprehensive Recording of Sage-like Benefit) (ad 1111–1117), for example, contains approximately 20 000 formulas covering disorders in multiple disciplines. For cen­ turies, practitioners have tried to find ways to sum­ marize these formulas in order to better apply them in clinical practice as well as to study their underly­ ing strategies to assist the creation of new formulas. Traditionally, the primary method of learning to become a practitioner of Chinese herbal medicine has been through focusing on a large number of classical formulas. Students memorize the composi­ tions and indications of these formulas, remember the associated treatment strategies and use them as examples to create their own formulas for clinical use. This method of learning has obvious strong points. As each formula is designed to treat a specific condition, it is in fact a detailed, vivid individual case study of a specific treatment. Unfortunately, this method also has some weaknesses. First, the basic rules which govern the principles and strategies of formula composition are not introduced directly, nor are they arranged in any systematic order. As a result, students often have to spend additional time mastering the skill of formula composition in the course of years spent learning hundreds of classical formulas. Second, because these principles and strategies are not emphasized as essential knowledge in the study of herbal formulas, but merely passed on as background information, some practitioners are much more interested in seeking effective pre­existing formulas to treat ailments instead of creating their own formulas according to the pre­ cise syndrome differentiation. These efforts subse­ quently often yield less than satisfactory therapeutic results. Furthermore, as the number of new formu­ las increases over time, students and practitioners are easily overwhelmed by the amount of new infor­ mation instead of following essential principles and focusing on learning to create their own formulas. As a teacher and practitioner of Chinese herbal medicine, I have searched for a new way of studying, teaching and practicing. In this book, I have aimed to summarize from a large number of formulas the basic rules which inform treatment principles and composition strategies. I hope by training practition­ ers to follow these principles and use these strateg­ ies that they will be able to select appropriate herbs independently and to compose individualized for­ mulas to treat various syndromes. In this book, 19 of the most commonly seen syndromes, along with more than 60 sub­syndromes, are discussed. They are carefully analyzed and divided into principal syndrome and secondary syn­ drome, represented by main symptoms and second­ ary symptoms respectively, with specific signs of the tongue and the pulse. Associated disorders, as identified by modern medicine, are also mentioned. After the syndromes are clearly identified, the treat­ ment principle and plan are explained, together with cautions. Following that, the principles of herb selection used to compose the formulas and the various treatment strategies are introduced, along with carefully selected herbs which are recom­ mended to perform the functions of chief, deputy, assistant or envoy. This will allow practitioners to feel comfortable in selecting the most appropriate chief and deputy herbs from a number of recom­ mended herbs to treat the main and secondary symptoms in the syndrome, as well as selecting the assistant and envoy to make the formula more bal­ anced and effective. Each of the recommended herbs is explained with details on its specific func­ tion in treating one possible disorder in the syn­ drome. Through the incorporation of selected herbs, each carries out a specific role in the overall strategy. Finally, some outstanding classical formulas are included in each chapter to serve as examples. They are analyzed with particular regard being given to the strategies used in their composition in order to help inspire practitioners to create new formulas. In this book, I have also introduced additional discussions on a few subjects that deserve extra xi Preface attention. These include dosage management in different situations, the sequence of treatment, special strategies for treating complicated cases and contraindications to the use of Chinese herbal for­ mulas. I feel this extra emphasis is warranted because these are topics that are difficult to master in actual clinical practice and are often ignored in the commonly used formula textbooks. For students and junior practitioners, this book offers a method of learning formula composition in a clear and concise fashion. For experienced practi­ tioners, this book offers a comprehensive discussion of various syndromes and their differential diag­ noses, as well as treatment methods and strategies that may bring a deeper understanding of the theo­ ries of traditional Chinese medicine and help to improve their diagnostic skills and their knowl­ edge of appropriate herb selection, as well as their analytical abilities to create formulas that have better clinical efficacy and minimal potential side effects. Lastly, I would like to share my enthusiasm for Chinese herbal formulas. I feel a well­composed formula is like a military troop with herbs as its soldiers. When well coordinated with smart strate­ gies, they bring glorious triumphs. A formula is also like a piece of music, with strategy its soul and herbs its notes. The subtle or heavy chords along with the flowing rhythms create beautiful melodies. They carry the brilliant thoughts of traditional Chinese medicine, and I believe they will continue to be sung for generations to come. Yifan Yang January The Netherlands xii

# Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to my teachers at Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medi- cine where I studied and worked for 13 years, estab- lishing a firm foundation of knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine which has enabled my further development in this profession. I would particularly like to thank Professor Wang Mianzhi and Professor Li Qingye from the Department of Chinese Herbal Formulas. Under their guidance, I studied a large number of formulas from classical literature and eminent doctors throughout history, and learned to recognize their underlying philosophies, strategies and treatment methods. Through this approach, I gained a deeper understanding of formulas and the essentials of formula composition. My subsequent clinical and teaching experience gave me the courage and the enthusiasm needed to start writing this book. I would like to thank Mr Dominic Harbinson from England, Mr A. van Dinteren MD from the Netherlands and Mr Xin Yang MA MRCP from the USA for their valuable suggestions which have helped to improve the language, content and style of the manuscript. I am grateful to a group of herb- alists who helped me to check the manuscript and gave indispensable advice. They are: Mrs Wil Hauser, Mrs Khiem Tan-Lim MD, Mr Ray Marien, Mr Hans Nauphousen and Mr Ramon Stol from the Netherlands. I would also like to thank Mr Jun Wong PhD and Mr Martin Jacobs MSc for assisting me with the figures in the book and Mr Charles Wauters for helping me to check the pharmaceutical names of the herbs with his knowledge as a pharmacist. I am grateful to Mr Dan Bensky and Mr Randall Barolet from the USA and their publisher because I have used the English translations of formula names, titles of source texts and some Chinese herbal medicine terms given in their book Chinese Herbal Medicine – Formulas and Strategies. I hope these well-translated names and terms can be used as standard terminology to benefit practitioners and students in learning and communication in this profession. Finally, I would like to thank the editors from Health Professions, Elsevier Ltd for their expertise in the process of publishing this book. xiii

## The text

• In the text, herb names are given in Pinyin. The pharmaceutical name of the herb follows the first mention of the herb. • In each chapter of Part II, the text generally follows the same structure and sequence. However, because of the characteristics of some syndromes, I have deviated slightly from this structure and sequence in order to make it easier to study and to compose formulas (e.g. in Chapter 11, Syndrome of blood stagnation and formula composition). • This book mainly considers individual syndromes, such as the syndrome of Spleen-Qi deficiency, and it discusses the composition of individualized formulas, such as a formula to tonify the Spleen-Qi. In practice, a syndrome can be much more complicated. The sections on Common accompanying symptoms and treatment offer more possibilities for herb selection in complicated situations. To treat a syndrome with different kinds of secondary syndromes, such as Spleen-Qi deficiency with dampness accumulation or food accumulation, a practitioner should consult different chapters to compose an effective formula. • In the sections Associated disorders in western medicine, some disease names are mentioned. However, it should be borne in mind that a disease in western medicine may involve more than one syndrome in traditional Chinese medicine. As such, the diseases mentioned here are only intended to help the reader to understand the syndrome and to have some corresponding orientation in western medicine. • The principles, methods and strategies introduced in each chapter of this book are abstracted from a large number of formulas, integrating the knowledge of single herbs, herbal combinations, syndrome differentiation, treatment methods and treatment sequence. They are the essential part of this book. • In the sections Structure of the formula and selection of herbs, a herb may sometimes be assigned a different position in the formula structure (e.g. it may serve as a chief or as a deputy) according to the nature of the presenting syndrome and the understanding of the herb’s function. • In the sections Structure of the formula and selection of herbs, although the selected herbs are, in general, suggestions for readers, they can also be considered as examples. A practitioner may select other herbs that have the same or similar functions by following the selection principle. • Throughout the book, banned toxic herbs are marked with an asterisk (*) following the name of the herb. Banned and protected substances are marked with two asterisks (**). Please note that Traditional Chinese Medicine takes the standpoint that all harsh herbs that have strong effects on pathogenic factors in the body can easily cause side-effects and that these herbs all belong to the toxic herbs group. Practitioners should always keep firmly in mind, not only the banned toxic herbs that are potential causes of damage to the liver, kidney and heart in Western medicine, but also the herbs (which are not always flagged with an asterisk in this book) with strong properties and functions that may bring the same risks if they are not used in the correct situation, at the correct dosage and for the correct duration of time. • Most of the formulas in the sections Examples of classical formulas have been selected from the textbook of Chinese Herbal Formulas (4th edition) which is used in universities of traditional Chinese medicine in the People’s Republic of China. These formulas follow the composition and dosages given in the original text. Some formulas that are not in the 4th edition of this textbook have been directly selected from the text of the original source. • The dosages in the sections Examples of classical formulas have been taken from the xiv

original texts. They are only used for studying the ratios, and cannot be directly applied in practice because different systems of measurement prevailed in different dynasties in Chinese history. Moreover, some formulas were recorded in pharmaceutical handbooks, and the dosages of the herbs given in these handbooks were for making a large stock of pills for the pharmacy. In practice, practitioners should prescribe a dosage by consulting the sections Dosages for individual herbs and Dosage in herbal formulas in Part I of this book, and Appendix I, Daily dosages for individual crude herbs above 6–9 grams. • Some classical formulas are selected and analyzed more than once in different chapters because they can treat more than one syndrome, and some strategies in the formula can be viewed from different perspectives. • This book is intended to introduce a new method of creating appropriate formulas according to syndrome differentiation. It is not meant to be a substitute for books that follow the classical style of teaching formula composition via the study of individual formulas. Indeed, these two methods of studying Chinese herbal formulas may enhance and enrich each other. • The herb and formulas index may help practitioners who have mastered the basic functions and characteristics of single herbs to make their own formulas quickly.

## The figures

• The figures are intended to present an overview of the pathological processes involved in the various syndromes. • Pathogenic factors, triggers and aggravating factors are shown in star-shaped frames. • The main pathological changes are shown in ellipse-shaped frames. • Symptoms are shown in rectangular frames.

This is because herbal combinations have several advantages compared to the use of single herbs . First of all, herbal combinations may have wider applications than single herbs . For instance, when pathogenic heat accumulates in the Lung and Stomach, and the Qi of these two organs is deficient, a single herb can hardly treat this syndrome completely whereas a herbal combination can achieve an effective therapeutic result . Second, a herbal combination can reduce the side effects of individual herbs . Each single herb has its specific characteristics, which bring a unique effect to treatment, but these characteristics may also become a weak point . For example, Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata) is an excellent herb to tonify the blood and Kidney-essence but its cloying nature places an extra burden on the Stomach, which may impair its tonifying action . However, if it is used with Sha Ren (Amomi xanthioidis fructus), which promotes Qi movement and removes any accumulation of dampness, this side effect can be reduced . Third, a herbal combination can have a much stronger effect than that of individual herbs, and may even induce a new effect . For example, Huang Qi (Astragali radix) is able to tonify and raise the Spleen-Qi and increase muscular strength . Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) and Sheng Ma (Cimicifugae rhizoma) have an ascending property but neither of them can tonify the Qi nor strengthen muscular contraction . However, if these three herbs are used together, the effect of raising the Qi and strengthening muscular contraction becomes much stronger . This combination can be used to treat weakness, heaviness of muscles and prolapse of internal organs due to Spleen-Qi deficiency .

## herbal combination

Since a herbal combination has obvious advantages in treatment, the relationships between the herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have been carefully studied and certain types of relation- ship are identified. They are called the seven rela- tions between herbs, e.g. mutual accentuation, mutual enhancement, mutual counteraction, mutual suppression, mutual antagonism, mutual incompat- ibility and single effect. Some of these are very useful in treatment, but some are harmful and therefore must be avoided. 1.1 Mutual accentuation (Xiang Xu ) In this type of combination, two herbs with similar functions are used together to increase the thera- peutic effect, achieving a safer and more effective therapeutic result than the use of a larger dosage of a single herb. For instance, Jing Jie (Schizonepetae herba) and Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix) can expel wind and release the exterior much more strongly when they are used together. Jin Yin Hua (Lonicerae flos) and Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus) can more effectively reduce heat-toxin if they are used together. Da Huang (Rhei rhizoma) and Mang Xiao (Natrii sulfas) can promote bowel movement to treat severe constipation more effectively and safely than the use of Da Huang (Rhei rhizoma) alone. 1.2 Mutual enhancement (Xiang She ) This type of combination involves two herbs that have different functions. The first directly targets the pathological condition and the second increases the therapeutic effect of the first. For instance, Zhi Mu (Anemarrhenae rhizoma) nourishes the Yin of the Kidney and clears heat in the Lower-Jiao, while Huang Bai (Phellodendri cortex) reduces empty-heat in the Lower-Jiao and is therefore able to enhance Zhi Mu’s function of nourishing the Yin. In addition, this type of combination is widely used to correct the side effects of a particular herb, to prolong the action of a herb in a steady way, to moderate the movement of Qi and to harmonize the internal organs. In this type of combination, the first herb treats the main disorder and its dosage and function are larger and stronger than those of the second herb. The second herb serves to reduce the side effects and to moderate the speed and the temperature of the first. For example, sweet Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) can mod- erate the speed of hot Fu Zi (Aconiti radix lateralis preparata)* and can also reduce the harsh purging effect of Da Huang (Rhei rhizoma). Moreover, some special strategies have been developed from this type of combination to achieve efficient therapeutic effects. For example, upward- moving and downward-moving herbs, and dispersing and restraining herbs may be used at the same time. 4


The first herb treats the disorder and the second herb, which has different or opposite properties, directional tendency and functions, serves as its assistant. In this way, it keeps the action of the first herb steady and moderate. For instance, when the aim of treatment is to strengthen the exterior, the sweet and warm Huang Qi (Astragali radix) is used to tonify and stabilize the Defensive-Qi. It is com- bined with a small amount of Fang Feng (Saposh- nikoviae radix), which is pungent and warm, and which is used to disperse wind from the exterior, thereby ensuring that Huang Qi does not trap the wind in the superficial region of the body. Fang Feng thus enables Huang Qi to achieve the desired ther- apeutic outcome without any side effects. Another example is when one wants to strengthen the Heart-Qi and treat restlessness and palpitations. Here Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) is often selected as it directly tonifies Heart-Qi. Ren Shen is combined with a small amount of Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) which is very sour and has a stabilizing and binding ability. It can stabilize the Heart-Qi which Ren Shen generates. Moreover, when the Heart-Qi is weak, it may find it hard to accept strong tonify- ing action and Ren Shen used on its own may lead to restlessness and palpitations at the start of treat- ment and may further consume Heart-Qi. In this condition, Wu Wei Zi can reduce the harsh effects of Ren Shen and make its action more moderate and longer lasting. There are many examples that illustrate the ben- efits of this type of herbal combination. Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) descends and clears fire from the Stomach, but it may also suppress Stomach-Qi and cause discomfort in the Stomach. If Sheng Ma (Cimicifugae rhizoma) is prescribed at the same time, it can ascend and disperse the Stomach-Qi constraint and Stomach-fire, thereby reducing the side effects of Huang Lian. 1.3 Mutual counteraction (Xiang Wei ) In this combination, the characteristic side effects or toxicity of a single herb can be minimized or neutralized by another. This combination strategy is often used when processing harsh and toxic herbs. For example, the toxic effects of Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) can be reduced by Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens). 1.4 Mutual suppression (Xiang Sha ) In this type of combination, the first herb suppresses or minimizes the toxicity of the second herb. For instance, Lü Dou (Phaseoli radiati semen) can reduce the toxicity of Ba Dou (Crotonis fructus)*, while Ge Hua (Puerariae flos) can reduce the toxic effects of alcohol. 1.5 Mutual antagonism (Xiang Wu ) In this type of combination, some herbs can reduce the therapeutic effect of others. For instance, Lai Fu Zi (Raphani semen) can reduce the ability of Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) to tonify the Qi. This type of herbal combination and effect should be avoided in treatment. The Chinese medical tradition has iden- tified 18 antagonistic substances: • Liu Huang (Sulfur)* antagonizes Po Xiao (Glauberis sal) • Shui Yin (Hydrargyrum)* antagonizes Pi Shuang (Arsenicum)* • Lang Du (Euphorbiae Fischerianae radix)* antagonizes Mi Tuo Seng (Lithargyrum)* • Ba Dou (Crotonis fructus)* antagonizes Qian Niu Zi (Pharbitidis semen)* • Wu Tou (Aconiti radix)* antagonizes Xi Jiao (Rhinoceri cornu)** • Ya Xiao (Nitrum) antagonizes San Leng (Sparganii rhizoma) • Ding Xiang (Caryophylli flos) antagonizes Yu Jin (Curcumae radix) • Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) antagonizes Wu Ling Zhi (Trogopterori faeces) • Rou Gui (Cinnamomi cassiae cortex) antagonizes Chi Shi Zhi (Halloysitum rubrum). 1.6 Mutual incompatibility (Xiang Fan ) In this type of relationship, as soon as the two herbs are used together, a dangerous effect can arise so the use of this type of combination is absolutely forbidden. Traditionally there are 19 substances involved: 5 Theories and concepts in the composition of Chinese herbal formulaspart I • Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) is incompatible with Gan Sui (Euphorbiae kansui radix)*, Da J1∨ (Knoxiae radix)*, Yuan Hua (Genkwa flos)* and Hai Zao (Sargassum) • Wu Tou (Aconiti radix)* is incompatible with Chuan Bei Mu (Fritillariae cirrhosae bulbus), Gua Lou (Trichosanthis fructus), Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma), Bai Lian (Ampelopsitis radix) and Bai Ji (Bletillae tuber)** • Li Lu (Veratri nigri radix et rhizoma) is incompatible with Ren Shen (Ginseng radix), Sha Shen – Bei Sha Shen (Glehniae radix)/Nan Sha Shen (Adenophorae radix), Ku Shen (Sophorae flavescentis radix), Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix), Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix), Xi Xin (Asari herba)*, Shao Yao – Chi Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix rubra)/Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora). 1.7 Single effect (Dan Xing ) This is a special pattern in herbal relationships. Some herbs can be used alone to treat a simple syndrome or to achieve special effects based on their charac- teristics. Some herbs can be used alone because they have reasonably balanced properties and functions. For instance, in critical conditions, Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) can be used on its own in a large dosage to rescue the Yang and Qi from collapse. Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix), which can cool the blood, clear heat and promote blood circulation, is often used alone in conditions where heat is con- suming the Yin and blood, leading to blood stagna- tion. Dang Gui (Angelicae sinensis radix) can also be used alone as it has a moderate action in promoting blood circulation and tonifying the blood. Of the above seven types of relationship, those of mutual accentuation and mutual enhancement are commonly used in treatment; mutual counter- action and mutual suppression can also be used, especially to reduce herbs’ side effects or toxicity. The single herb effect is only used in a limited number of disorders; relations of mutual antagonism and mutual incompatibility should be avoided in treatment. In addition to these relationships, there is another kind of relationship between herbs in treatment. In this type of combination, two herbs work as one unit although they have different properties and func- tions, and in this case they are equally important. Together they treat a condition with which a single herb would not be able to deal. For example, to treat warm and cold coexisting in one syndrome, where Yang and Qi deficiency generate cold while stagna- tion of Qi generates heat, the patient may, on the one hand, have a cold, weak and sensitive Stomach and prefer warm drinks and compresses; on the other hand, the patient may have a dry mouth with a bitter taste and heartburn. In this situation, the pungent and warm Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) which can disperse cold is used with the bitter and cold Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) which can reduce the accumulated heat. Without this combi- nation, it is almost impossible to treat this syndrome effectively. Another example is when one needs to regulate the Lung-Qi, clear heat and relieve short- ness of breath. The pungent and hot Ma Huang (Ephedrae herba)* is used to stimulate the Yang and disperse the Lung Qi; the sweet and cold Shi Gao (Gypsum) is used to descend the Lung-Qi and clear the heat of the Lung. This combination can regulate the Qi and smooth the breath. (See Figure I.1 on page 34.)

## 2 The process of


With this knowledge of herbal combinations, a herbal formula can be composed. The purpose of prescribing formulas in clinical practice is to achieve maximum therapeutic effect with minimum side effects. To practice traditional Chinese herbal med- icine, practitioners are required to be able to compose formulas by themselves for treating differ- ent syndromes. Composing a formula is a process where several conditions must be fulfilled. First, one must make a clear syndrome differentiation, establish the treat- ment principles, select treatment methods and figure out the most suitable strategies. One should then follow the model of formula structure, select- ing appropriate herbs to play specific roles in the formula and ensuring that treatment strategies are fully expressed. 2.1 Syndrome differentiation Clear and correct syndrome differentiation is very important for selecting a suitable treatment method and creating an effective formula. Detailed differen- 6


tiation of a syndrome should include the following parts. Principal syndrome and main symptoms The principal syndrome where the main pathologi- cal development is identified manifests through a series of main symptoms. For example, the main symptoms indicating an exterior wind-cold syn- drome are chills and fever, headache and generalized body pain. These result from the invasion of wind and cold at the superficial region of the body, the failure of the Defensive-Qi to spread, and obstruc- tion in the blood circulation. Secondary syndrome and secondary symptoms A secondary syndrome develops from the principal syndrome and manifests in a series of secondary symptoms. When the principal syndrome is treated, the secondary syndrome may disappear as well. For example, in an exterior wind-cold syndrome, since the superficial region is obstructed, the Lung-Qi is unable to disperse so the nose may be blocked and there may be shortness of breath. As soon as the wind-cold is expelled from the superficial region of the body, the Lung-Qi obstruction disappears and the secondary symptoms disappear too. A secondary syndrome might be a coexisting syndrome that is less important at the time of treat- ment. For example, in an acute condition of Liver- Yang ascending and generating Liver-wind, the patient may also have a syndrome of Spleen-Qi deficiency but this is less important for treatment in this acute condition. Secondary symptoms are accompanying symp- toms that are not key symptoms in terms of syn- drome identification but they should still be treated seriously. For example, in an exterior wind-heat syndrome, although cough is not as important a symptom as sore throat in terms of syndrome iden- tification, it should still be treated as it causes suf- fering to the patient. Tongue and pulse These are essential diagnostic methods for syn- drome identification as well as for giving a prognosis regarding the development of and recovery from the disease. A practitioner can obtain objective informa- tion from these diagnostic procedures. 2.2 The treatment principle The treatment principle takes the main syndrome in a complex condition as the target for treatment. In the process of treatment, the syndrome will change and the treatment principle will thus change too. For instance, in a syndrome of Liver-Yang ascending and generating Liver-wind, the treatment principle should be to intensively and quickly descend Liver- Yang and extinguish Liver-wind. Once the Liver- Yang has returned to its original place and the Liver-wind has disappeared, a syndrome of defi- ciency of Spleen-Qi and stagnation of Liver-Qi may then become the main syndrome. The treatment principle should change to that of spreading the Liver-Qi and strengthening the Spleen. 2.3 The structure of a formula Following the treatment principle, which is estab- lished in accordance with the syndrome differentia- tion, a formula can be composed. A formula is neither a group of herbs that treat all symptoms nor a combination that only treats the main syndrome. It has a structure where herbs are organized in order to meet the needs of the treatment. The structure of a formula contains four parts, namely: the chief, the deputy, the assistant(s) and the envoy. Each of these has specific functions in the formula. Chief (Zhu , Jun ) The chief is the ingredient that directly treats the principal syndrome, which is manifested by the main symptoms. The chief can be one ingredient, but it can also be a herbal combination. Generally speaking, the chief has a relatively large dosage within the formula as a whole, and it enters the meridians where the pathological changes are manifest. Deputy (Fu , Chen ) • The deputy is the ingredient that has the function of accentuating and enhancing the effect of the chief ingredient to treat the principal syndrome. • The deputy serves as the main ingredient acting directly against a coexisting syndrome. The deputy can be one herb, a herbal combina- tion, or several groups of herbal combinations, 7 Theories and concepts in the composition of Chinese herbal formulaspart I according to the needs of treating the principal syn- drome and the coexisting syndromes. Assistant (Zuo ) • The assistant accentuates and enhances the therapeutic effect of the chief or deputy ingredients, or directly treats secondary symptoms. The ingredient that has this function can be considered a helping assistant. • The assistant moderates or eliminates the toxicity or harsh properties of the chief or deputy ingredients. The ingredient that has this function can be considered a corrective assistant. • The assistant has a function or a moving tendency which goes against the chief ingredient but which is helpful in fulfilling the therapeutic effect and which may be used in complicated and serious conditions. The ingredient that has this function can be considered a strategic assistant. Since this role may require a range of actions, there are often several herbs or herbal combinations acting as assistants in any one herbal formula. Envoy (Shi ) The envoy serves as a guide to bring the rest of the herbs into the meridian or region where the main pathological change exists, allowing their actions to focus on this specific region. In most cases, the chief carries out this function as it must enter the place where the pathological change is located. The envoy harmonizes and integrates the actions of the other ingredients in order to balance the action, temperature, speed and direction of the formula. (See Figure I.2 on page 34.) 2.4 Principles, methods and strategies of selecting appropriate herbs when composing a formula In order to compose effective formulas, the princi- ples, methods and strategies of selecting herbs are very important. They enable a practitioner to compose formulas to treat a variety of syndromes. The principles, methods and strategies introduced in each chapter of this book are abstracted from a large number of formulas, integrating the knowledge of single herbs, herbal combinations, syndrome differentiation, treatment methods and treatment sequence. They are the essential part of this book. Before composing a formula, the relevant syn- drome is first identified. The syndrome is analyzed and divided into the principal syndrome and the secondary syndrome, which are manifested in the main symptoms and the secondary symptoms, with specific signs on the tongue and the pulse. These are the first steps in selecting the appropriate herbs to fulfill different roles in the formula. Moreover, the syndrome analysis evaluates the development of the disorder of the internal organs with regard to the pathological change. This provides another clue to assist the selection of the herbs in the formula. For instance, if Liver-Qi stagnation is diagnosed, it follows that the Liver can easily attack the Spleen, so in the formula some herbs that strengthen the Spleen should be prescribed. Similarly, if the patient has a Yang constitution, the stagnation of Liver-Qi can quickly generate Liver-fire, so some herbs that prevent the generation of fire or prevent the heat becoming strong should be added as well. In a con- dition of excess heat in the Lung, one should be aware that strong fire can easily consume both the Yin and the Qi, so one should not only prescribe herbs to reduce fire, but also herbs that nourish the Yin and tonify the Qi. Next, an appropriate treatment principle to treat the presenting syndrome is established. For example, to treat an excess heat syndrome in the Lung, the treatment principle is to reduce the heat, nourish the Yin, regulate the Lung-Qi and, at a later stage, strengthen the Lung-Qi. As soon as a treatment principle is established, the composition plan and treatment strategies can be arranged. For instance, to treat the syndrome of excess heat in the Lung and Stomach, one would first prescribe herbs that have sweet-cold, bitter- cold or salty-cold properties, and which have the functions of clearing heat and reducing fire in the Lung and Stomach. Second, herbs that are sweet and cold and that can nourish body fluids and protect the Yin, which has been severely consumed by the excess heat, should be selected. Herbs that can tonify the Qi should be selected if the Qi is weak- ened severely by the heat. Herbs that moderate the actions of the harsh herbs in the formula, and reduce their side effects, should also be added. The composition plan and the treatment strate- gies are effected by appropriate herbs, which are selected carefully according to their properties, 8


functions and characteristics. Take again the treat- ment of excess heat in the Lung and Stomach as an example. Shi Gao (Gypsum) is selected as the chief in the formula because it has cold, sweet and pungent properties, enters the Lung and Stomach meridians and can directly and intensively reduce excess heat in the Lung and Stomach. Zhi Mu (Anemarrhenae rhizoma) is selected as deputy because it is moisten- ing and cold. On the one hand it can accentuate the function of Shi Gao to reduce the excess heat; on the other hand it can nourish the Yin, which has been badly damaged by the heat, thereby directly treating the secondary syndrome. Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) and Jing Mi (non-glutinous rice) are selected as assistants to tonify the Qi of the Spleen and to protect the Stomach from injury by the pathogenic heat and the bitter, cold and heavy herbs.

## 3 Dosages for individual herbs

3.1 Standard dosages for individual herbs Generally speaking, the most common dosage for most crude herbs in Chinese texts is about 3–9 g orally per day. Modern concentrated herbal powder is six times stronger than crude herb, thus the common dosage for most single herbs is 0.5–1.5 g per day. According to my own experience, this dosage can be reduced to 0.2–0.5 g. A list specifying the dosages for individual herbs can be found in Appendix I. 3.2 Exceptions Minerals Minerals can be used at 30 g per day in traditional decoctions. Examples are Shi Gao (Gypsum), Ci Shi (Magnetitum), Long Gu (Mastodi fossilium ossis), Mu Li (Ostrea concha), Zhen Zhu Mu (Concha mar- garitifera usta), Shi Jue Ming (Haliotidis concha) and Wa Leng Zi (Arcae concha). If concentrated powder is prescribed, the dosage should be about 1–2 g. Lightweight herbs Herbs that are light in weight should be prescribed at lower dosages, 0.5–3 g for crude herbs and 0.1– 0.5 g for concentrated powders. Examples are Tong Cao (Tetrapanacis medulla), Deng Xin Cao (Junci medulla), Ma Bo (Lasiosphaera) and Chan Tui (Cicadae periostracum). Poisonous herbs Dosages for all poisonous herbs should be learned by heart. Since the toxic dose varies for each indi- vidual, the therapeutic range for these herbs is small and only experienced doctors should prescribe them. Poisonous herbs in reasonably common use are Fu Zi (Aconiti radix lateralis preparata)*, Wu Tou (Aconiti radix)*, Xi Xin (Asari herba)*, Ma Huang (Ephedrae herba)*, Yang Jin Hua (Daturae flos)*, Lei Gong Teng (Tripterygii wilfordii caulis)*, Wu Gong (Scolopendra)*, Quan Xie (Scorpio)*, Bai Hua She (Agkistrodon acutus)*, Mang Chong (Tabanus)*, Zhe Chong (Eupolyphaga seu opisthoplatia)*, Shan Dou Gen (Sophorae tonkinensis radix)*, Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma), Tian Nan Xing (Arisaematis rhizoma), Bai Fu Zi (Typhonii rhizoma praeparatum)*, Wei Ling Xian (Clematidis radix), Xian Mao (Curculinginis rhizoma), Wu Zhu Yu (Evodiae fructus), Hua Jiao (Zanthoxyli fructus) and Yuan Zhi (Polygalae radix). Poisonous substances that are suitable for special pathological situations but which are rarely used are Ku Lian Pi (Meliae cortex), He Shi (Carpesii fructus), Gua Di (Pedicellus cucumeris), Li Lu (Veratri nigri radix et rhizoma), Chang Shan (Dichroae febrifugae radix), Gan Sui (Euphorbiae kansui radix)*, Da J1 ∨ (Knoxiae radix)* Yuan Hua (Genkwa flos)*, Shang Lu (Phytolaccae radix), Qian Niu Zi (Pharbitidis semen)*, Ba Dou (Crotonis fructus)* and Zhu Sha (Cinnabaris)*. 3.3 Variations from the normal dosage range Bland herbs, which promote urination and leach out dampness, can be used in relatively large doses; these include Fu Ling (Poria), Yi Yi Ren (Coicis semen) and Che Qian Zi (Plantaginis semen). Tonifying herbs can also be used in relatively large doses; these include Huang Qi (Astragali radix), Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata), Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) and Bai He (Lilii bulbus). Aromatic herbs that open the orifices, expel wind-heat or wind-cold and promote Qi movement should be used in relatively small doses; these include Bing Pian (Borneol), Su He Xiang (Styrax), 9 Theories and concepts in the composition of Chinese herbal formulaspart I Bo He (Menthae herba), Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix), Xin Yi (Magnoliae flos), Bai Zhi (Angelicae dahuri- cae radix), Mu Xiang (Aucklandiae radix)** and Sha Ren (Amomi xanthioidis fructus). Herbs that are used alone should be prescribed in relatively large doses; when they are prescribed as part of a formula, the dosage should be smaller.

## 4 Dosage in herbal formulas

4.1 General principles The dosages of herbs in a formula should follow the standard dosages of the individual herbs. However, dosages may be varied within the normal dosage range according to the position each herb occupies in the formula. Generally speaking, a relatively large dose of the chief herb(s) should be prescribed, whereas envoy herbs should be given at small dosages. The dosages of the deputies and the assist- ants depend on their number and the strength of the functions required of them. In a small formula (i.e. one that contains less than five herbs), the dosages should be relatively large. In a medium-sized formula (containing 9–12 herbs), medium-sized dosages should be used. In a large formula (containing more than 20 herbs), the dosages should be low. 4.2 Adjusting dosage to reflect the presenting syndrome The dosages of the individual herbs in a formula should be varied according to the presenting syn- drome. For instance, the usual dosage for Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) is 6–9 g per day. It is pungent and neutral, and can effectively ascend and spread the Liver-Qi. It is very often used as the chief herb in formulas to treat Liver-Qi stagnation. However, in situations where Liver-Qi stagnation is accompanied by blood deficiency, a smaller dosage of Chai Hu (e.g. 6 g), should be prescribed to ensure that its Qi dispersing effect does not consume or weaken the blood. If the presenting condition features Liver-Qi stagnation with Spleen-Qi deficiency and an accu- mulation of dampness in the Upper- and Middle- Jiao, Chai Hu should be prescribed at a relatively large dosage, such as 9 g, because it needs more strength to disperse in order to overcome the damp- ness. In a case with Liver-Qi stagnation, Liver-Yin deficiency and Liver-Yang rising, Chai Hu should be prescribed at a very low dose, such as 3 g, or even removed from the formula altogether to prevent its ascending property from exacerbating the tendency of Liver-Yang to rise. 4.3 Adjusting dosage during the course of the treatment When treating acute diseases, or the active stage of chronic diseases, the dosages of herbs in a formula should be large. When the disorder is under control, the dosages should be reduced. Formulas that open the orifices, induce sweating, vigorously purge accu- mulation by promoting bowel movement and induce vomiting are used only once. Afterwards, the dosage must be adjusted according to the patient’s condi- tion. For instance, to treat severe constipation due to severe obstruction of food, Qi, blood and fire- toxin in the abdomen, a vigorously purging formula should be given to eliminate accumulation. But only a single dose should be given. If the condition of the patient does not improve and the syndrome remains the same, this formula should be given again. As soon as the patient has a bowel movement, use of the formula should cease, and a gentle formula to regulate the Qi, moisten the intestines and protect the Spleen should be prescribed. Formulas that contain strong herbs to treat acute and excess syndromes should not be used at high dosages for more than 4 weeks. These include for- mulas that: • disperse the Lung-Qi • disperse wind, cold and dampness • strongly reduce heat-toxin • purge and drain downward • break up Qi stagnation • remove congealed blood • remove food stagnation • sedate the Heart-shen and descend the Liver-Yang. In treating chronic diseases, or after intensive treatment for acute disorders lasting 1–4 weeks, the herbs in a formula should be prescribed at lower dosages. Herbs that tonify or harmonize the func- tions of the internal organs should be added. Intensive treatment can be repeated, according to the disease and the patient’s condition. Gentle tonifying herbs can be used for months or even years at low doses to keep the patient’s condi- 10


tion stable, to strengthen the body’s resistance and to maintain a good health. It is good to have breaks in long-term treatment of chronic disorders. The best time to do this is in the summer because summer-heat or damp-heat may weaken the function of the Spleen at this time, and the herbs may overburden the Spleen and cause digestive disorders. 4.4 Adjusting dosage to take account of the patient’s constitution and diet Relatively large dosages can be prescribed for young people, people with good constitutions and people in good physical condition when they suffer from acute excess syndromes. Small dosages are pre- scribed for elderly people, people with weak constitutions and people who suffer from chronic diseases. Foodstuffs and drinks possess warm or cold prop- erties which may influence the action of herbs. Generally speaking, coffee, spices, mutton, liver, fat, oil and nuts can easily generate heat. Most fruit, vegetables and cold beverages have a cold nature and can bring cold into the body. Milk products and fat may generate phlegm. This should be taken into consideration when prescribing the herbs in a formula. 4.5 Adjusting dosage according to the patient’s age The elderly In elderly people, the Qi, blood and essence are no longer strong, the movement of Qi and the circula- tion of blood are not smooth, the digestion of food and the metabolism of water become slow, and the mood is often unstable. Consequently, herbs should be prescribed with extra care. • Herbs should be prescribed at lower dosages within the normal range. • Gentle tonifying herbs can be used at low dosages for a long period of time to strengthen the body’s resistance or to maintain good health. • Tonifying herbs should initially be prescribed at low dosages because their cloying nature may cause indigestion. If all is well, the dosages may be gradually increased. • Herbs that promote digestion, calm the mind and spread the Liver-Qi should be used in chronic disorders and when the patient is recovering from disease. Children Children have special physiological and pathological characteristics. As their internal organs, muscles and bones are delicate and their physiological functions are not fully developed, children become ill more easily than adults, and their diseases develop quickly. Therefore, the proper formula with suitable dosages of herbs should be given at the appropriate time. The common daily dosage of individual herbs for children is as follows: • infant: 1/10 of the adult dosage • infant–1 year old: 1/6 of the adult dosage • 1–2 years old: 1/4 of the adult dosage • 2–4 years old: 1/3 of the adult dosage • 4–6 years old: 1/2 of the adult dosage • 6–14 years old: 2/3 of the adult dosage. Children who are thin and weak • Herbs should be given in dosages at the lower end of the normal dose range. • Gentle herbs that tonify the Spleen and Kidney can be used at low dosages for a long period of time to support the child’s development. • Tonifying herbs should initially be given at low doses, and then gradually increased, because their cloying nature may cause indigestion. Herbs that promote digestion should be prescribed at the same time. • Herbs that calm the mind and spread the Liver-Qi should be used when treating stressed and sensitive children.


• the adult dosage referred to here is the average adult dosage. • the dosage given is for children with a normal weight and height for their age. • the dosage can be varied within the normal range according to the disease and the patient’s constitution as well as the experience of the practitioner. 11 Theories and concepts in the composition of Chinese herbal formulaspart I Obese children • Dosage should be at the upper end of the normal dose range for children. It should not be the same as the dosage for an adult with the same weight. • Use herbs that reduce phlegm, food stagnation and dampness. Herbs that tonify the Qi and activate the Qi movement can be used if necessary. • Sport and a healthy diet should be recommended as part of the treatment. 4.6 Adjusting dosage according to the season and climate In addition to the nature of the presenting disorder and the patient’s constitution, seasonal and climatic factors should also be considered. In summer or in places with a warm dry climate, pungent, warm and bitter herbs should not be used at high doses because the pores of the body are not tightly closed and so the body fluid can easily be consumed by heat. This precaution relates to herbs that induce sweating, expel wind and cold, disperse the Lung-Qi, dry dampness and increase urination. In winter or in cold places, cold, bitter, sour and astringent herbs should be prescribed in a relatively low dose. This precaution relates to herbs that clear heat, cool blood and drain downward. In humid places, herbs that transform dampness, activate the Qi movement and promote digestion should be used in relatively large doses because the herbs need extra strength to overcome the dampness. 4.7 Adjusting dosage to reflect particular times in the patient’s life At times of great stress and high emotion, or of severe physical exertion and tiredness, the body becomes more sensitive, and herbs should be prescribed at lower dosages than normal. For instance, to treat severe tiredness due to Spleen- Qi and Heart-blood deficiency, herbs that tonify the Qi and blood should be used in the formula but their doses should be very low because any strong stimulation and tonification may cause further dis- order in the body. If the patient suffers from insom- nia and anxiety, formulas that calm the mind and sedate the Heart-spirit should be used first. At the time of menstruation, or if the patient has a bleeding wound, or immediately after surgery, herbs that promote Qi and blood should be prescribed at low dosages. If the patient is breast-feeding, herbs that are very warm or cold or that have harsh properties should not be used or only prescribed in low doses. 4.8 Adjusting dosage in light of the patient’s medical history The dosages prescribed should take proper account of the patient’s medical history. When patients suffer from chronic liver or kidney disease, the selection of the herbs and their dosages should be determined carefully to avoid placing an unnecessary workload on these weakened organs. At the same time, herbs that protect these organs and promote their function should also be included. For instance, acute or chronic liver diseases are mainly differentiated into a syndrome consisting of Spleen- Qi deficiency, damp-heat and heat-toxin accumula- tion, and herbs that treat this syndrome can be used. Chronic kidney diseases are mainly differentiated as Kidney-Yang and Spleen-Yang deficiency, dampness accumulation and heat-toxin in the blood. Herbs that treat this syndrome should be used in appropri- ate doses to help restore kidney function. If a patient has recently undergone surgery, the Qi and blood need time to get strong again, so pungent, very warm or very cold herbs should only be used in low doses. In situations where western drugs are used together with herbs and have similar functions, such as inducing sweating, stimulating blood circulation, removing congealed blood, purging the intestines and sedating the mind, the dosage of the drug or the herbs should be reduced.

## applications

5.1 Decoctions Preparation Place the dry herbal ingredients in an earthenware or stainless steel pot and add cold water until the water level is 3–4 cm above the herbs. Leave the herbs to soak in the water for at least 1 hour. Place 12


the pot on the cooker and apply strong heat to bring it to the boil. Once the liquid is boiling, turn the heat down, simmer the herbs for 20 minutes, and then strain the decoction from the pot into a receptacle. Pour another 200 ml of cold water onto the herbs in the pot and cook for a further 20 minutes. Strain the resulting liquid into the receptacle holding the first decoction, thus mixing the two decoctions together. The total liquid obtained should be about 200–250 ml. (Herbs that expel wind-cold or wind- heat should be cooked for 10 minutes less and tonifying herbs should be cooked for 10 minutes longer each time.) Finally, divide the decoction into two or three doses and take these over the course of the day, warming each dose before drinking it. Applications Decoction is the most common form of administra- tion of Chinese herbal medicine. Decoctions are usually taken orally. They can be absorbed quickly and have the strongest action of all of the traditional types of preparation. Formulas can be varied according to clinical need. The decoction method is used particularly for serious and acute conditions. Decoctions can also be used topically as herbal baths for the whole body or for the affected regions of the body. Decoctions do, however, have some obvious drawbacks. They need a reasonable amount of time to prepare, especially in chronic diseases; they do not always taste pleasant; they are not easy to trans- port or to store. Nowadays, some herbal pharmacies have made some improvements in this respect, offering to cook decoctions for their patients and delivering the herbal medicine in sealed vacuum- packed bags that may be stored in a refrigerator for a few days. 5.2 Powders Preparation The dry raw herbal ingredients are ground into coarse or fine powders. Coarsely ground powders can be prepared in the same way as decoctions, though they require a shorter cooking time. Finely ground powders can be prepared by simply adding boiling water at the time of administration. Some fine powders can be applied topically for skin disor- ders, muscle strains and wounds. Applications Powders can be used in small dosages. They are easy to prepare, administer, transport and store. Powders are less wasteful than decoctions. Their main draw- back is that their action is not as strong as decoc- tions. They are often used for sub-acute, chronic and mild cases. 5.3 Pills Preparation The dry raw herbs are ground into powder and are mixed either with water or with a viscous medium and shaped into pills. These may be of different sizes, depending on the practitioner’s specification.

## Special preparation procedures

Because some herbs have particular properties, special procedures are required for their preparation. Decocting first: Some substances are heavy and do not readily release their active ingredients into the decoction. they therefore need to be cooked for minutes before adding the other herbs. Most of these ingredients are mineral substances, such as Ci Shi (Magnetitum), Long Gu (Mastodi fossilium ossis), Mu Li (Ostrea concha), Shi Jue Ming (Haliotidis concha) and Shi Gao (Gypsum). Some toxic herbs, such as Fu Zi (Aconiti radix lateralis preparata)* and Wu tou (Aconiti radix)*, should also be cooked for longer to reduce their toxicity. Decocting later: Some aromatic or pungent herbs have active ingredients that will be destroyed by long cooking and these should be added to the pot minutes before the end of cooking. Examples are Bo He (Menthae herba), Qing Hao (Artemisiae annuae herba), Huo Xiang (Agastachis herba) and Xiang ru (Moslae herba). also, in order to increase certain actions, some herbs are cooked for less time than normal. For instance, Da Huang (Rhei rhizoma) can be cooked for a shorter time to increase its purgative action. Some rare, expensive herbs, such as ren Shen (Ginseng radix), should be prepared separately. Herbs that are traditionally used in powder form should be added to the prepared decoction without cooking; an example is San Qi (Notoginseng radix) powder. Gels and syrups such as E Jiao (Asini corii colla), Yi tang (Maltose), honey and egg yolks, should be dissolved in the prepared decoction without cooking. 13 Theories and concepts in the composition of Chinese herbal formulaspart I Applications Generally speaking, pills are used for chronic condi- tions and for reasonably stable conditions where frequent changes of formula are unnecessary. Pills are convenient to use, transport and store. Moreo- ver, ingredients that should not be cooked at high temperature (e.g. aromatic ingredients) can be pre- pared in this way. Since the weight of each pill is the same, the herbal dosage can be managed more easily by patients than when they are taking decoc- tions or powders. Furthermore, the pill form is an ideal solution for herbs that have a strong smell and/ or an unpleasant taste, or which bring irritation to the stomach. Pills can reduce wastage compared with decoctions, especially for expensive and rare herbs. The disadvantage of pills is that, because their ingredients are fixed, they cannot readily be adjusted to match change in the presenting syndrome. • Pills made with honey: Honey is often used as the binding agent when making pills. Its sweetness moderates the tastes of the herbal ingredients while also moderating and stabilizing the effects of the herbs in the formula. Pills made with honey are especially suitable for chronic conditions. • Pills made with water, alcohol or vinegar: Pills made with water are easier to absorb than other types of pill because there is no viscous medium. They are small in size and are easy to swallow. As alcohol or vinegar brings a dispersing or softening action, pills made in this way are used for specific therapeutic purposes. Generally speaking, pills processed with alcohol may bring stronger and quicker therapeutic effects, while pills processed with vinegar guide the herbal ingredients specifically to enter the Liver meridian. • Pills made with paste: Because the herbal ingredients are mixed with paste (made from rice or wheat flour), this type of pill is absorbed slowly and is especially suitable for ingredients that are toxic or have harsh actions which can easily irritate the stomach. This type of pill is also used for chronic conditions when gentle and steady effects are required. 5.4 Syrups Preparation Syrups are made by adding cane sugar to a liquid herbal decoction. Applications Sugar has moistening and tonifying properties. Herbal syrups are often used for mild cases, such as to moisten the Lung. Because they taste sweet, they are more readily accepted by patients, especially by children. 5.5 Herbal teas Preparation The dry raw herbs are cut into small pieces and made into a tea by infusing in boiling water. The herbal tea is drunk from time to time over the course of the day just like drinking normal tea. Applications Herbal teas are used for mild disorders such as the common cold, sore throat or indigestion. 5.6 Distilled medicinal liquids Preparation: The distilled liquid is collected after the aromatic, fresh herbs are cooked. Applications: Distilled medicinal liquids are light in smell, taste and function. Fresh herbs that clear heat and nourish the body fluids are often used in this form, especially in the summer. 5.7 Medicinal alcohol drinks Preparation The herbs are soaked in alcohol made from rice or sorghum for at least 1 month. Applications Since alcohol has dispersing and fast moving proper- ties, it can increase the effect and speed of the herbs. Medicinal alcohol drink is often used for chronic disorders. Herbs that tonify the body, such as Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) and Gou Qi Zi (Lycii fructus), and herbs that disperse wind, damp and cold to treat Bi syndrome, such as Wu Jia Pi (Acan- thopanacis cortex), are often prepared in this way. Herbal alcohol drink is usually taken once a day in small amounts of 10–20 ml. 14


5.8 Special pills (Dan) Preparation and application Dan originally referred to the sublimated mineral ingredients containing mercury and sulfur for topical and oral use. Some expensive, concentrated and especially effective herbal pills made with paste for oral use may also be called Dan. 5.9 Injections Preparation These are made by extracting the active ingredients of herbs, and preparing and sterilizing them to modern pharmaceutical standards for subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous use. Applications Injections rely on small but precise doses of herbal extracts. They have rapid effects on the body and, unlike orally administered medicines, their thera- peutic action is not dependent on the condition of the stomach and intestines. 5.10 Medicinal lotions and creams Preparation The herbal ingredients are ground into a fine powder and mixed with water, Vaseline or other media. Applications These are applied topically to the affected area and are often used for skin disorders, ulcers, infections and trauma. They work directly on the focus of the disease. They work constantly and are steadily absorbed by the body. 5.11 Plasters Preparation The herbal ingredients are cooked with water, strained and heated until a paste is formed. This paste is then smeared onto strips of plaster and stored ready for use when needed. Applications Plasters are applied topically to affected muscles and joints. Herbs that promote blood circulation, expel wind, dampness and cold to treat trauma and Bi syndrome are often prepared in this way. Plasters work directly on the focus of the disease, and are slowly absorbed by the body. The disadvantage of plasters is that skin irritation may arise if they are used frequently. 5.12 Lozenges Preparation Lozenges are taper-shaped pills. They are made from herbal powders with the addition of a viscous medium. Applications Lozenges are used orally or topically. In the latter case, they should be diluted with water and applied to the affected area. Herbs that promote blood circulation and treat trauma are often used in this form. They are easy to transport and store. 5.13 Powdered herbal extracts Preparation Using modern techniques, the ingredients are extracted at high or low temperatures, concen- trated, combined with certain media and turned into powders. Applications They are prepared by adding boiling water at the time of administration. They are taken in small dosages and are easy to transport and store. They can be used for a range of disorders, in both acute and chronic conditions. The composition of formu- las can be varied easily. 5.14 Pills, tablets and capsules made from powdered herbal extracts Preparation Pills, tablets and capsules can be made from the powdered herbal extracts described above. Applications They are taken in small doses and are quick and strong acting. They are easy to administer, transport and store. 15 Theories and concepts in the composition of Chinese herbal formulaspart I

## 6 Administration

The administration of herbal medicine should take into account the following principles. 6.1 Taking herbal medicine warm Herbal medicine that is administered orally should always be taken warm. If the herbal medicine is a decoction, it should be taken when it is warm; herbal medicines that expel wind-cold are better taken hot. If the medicine is a powdered herbal extract, it should be dissolved in boiling water and taken once it has cooled down slightly. Herbal pills, tablets or capsules should generally be taken with warm water. However, an exception is made to these two principles if the patient suffers from an excess heat syndrome in which the heat is so strong that it is impossible to accept any warm drinks. In this case, since the administration of warm fluids may cause vomiting, herbal medicines can be taken cool. 6.2 Appropriate frequency Usually, herbal medicine is taken three times a day – in the morning, afternoon and evening. • In acute and critical conditions, the herbal medicine should be taken every 4 hours, even during the night. • When treating chronic diseases, herbal medicine can be taken twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. Once the patient’s condition improves, the frequency may be reduced and the herbal medicine can be taken once a day, every other day, or even twice a week to maintain the condition of the patient. • The frequency of administration should be adjusted in some conditions; these include herbal medicines which induce sweating or which have a purgative action. • Herbal medicines that eliminate parasites should be taken only once a day for a maximum of 3 days. • Herbal medicines that reduce swelling, pain and irritation in the mouth, gums or throat should be retained in the mouth as long as possible before swallowing; they may be swilled around the mouth or gargled. 6.3 Timing of the administration To maximize absorption of the herbs, herbal medi- cines are usually taken 1 hour before or after meals when the stomach is relatively empty. However, there are some exceptions: • Tonifying herbs are best taken 1 hour before meals. • Herbal medicines that promote digestion and strengthen the Stomach should be taken directly after meals. • Herbal medicines that irritate the stomach should be taken after meals. • Herbal medicines that drain downwards or eliminate parasites should be taken in the morning on an empty stomach. • Herbal medicines that calm the mind and improve sleep should be taken before going to bed. • Herbal medicines that control the attack of diseases such as asthma and malaria should be taken 1–2 hours before an attack.

## 7 Treatment principles and

<!-- chunk -->

## their sequence

In traditional Chinese herbal medicine, the treat- ment strategy and the composition of herbal formu- las should follow a certain sequence, taking into account the following principles. 7.1 Regarding the human body, the body and the mind, and the body and the environment as integral parts In treatment, pay attention to the relationships between: • the internal organs, and between the internal organs and their related structures and orifices • the body and the mind, the patient’s mental state, emotions, life experience and personality • the body and the environment, which includes the climate, season and time, as well as the person’s working and private life, and the culture and society in which they live. Regard each individual as unique in terms of their constitution, age, physical condition, diet and lifestyle. 16


7.2 Making a clear differentiation of the relevant syndrome(s) Before commencing treatment, make a differentiat- ion of the relevant syndrome(s) from the symptoms and signs so as to clarify the cause, location and nature of the pathogenic factors involved, and assess the relative strength of the body’s resistance and the pathogenic factors. 7.3 First making clear the relationship of Ben (the root or cause) and Biao (the manifestation) Ben is more important than Biao, but the concepts are relative. In syndrome differentiation: • the state of the body’s resistance is the Ben; the pathogenic change is the Biao • the cause of the disease and the main pathological changes are the Ben; the symptoms are the Biao • Zang organs and basic material substances of the body are the Ben; the orifice, structures and functions are the Biao • the original, primary disease is the Ben; secondary diseases are the Biao. 7.4 Treat the Ben first and the Biao later As a general rule, treat the Ben first and the Biao later. In an acute condition, however, treat the Biao first if it is pronounced as otherwise it may quickly cause further pathological change. Once the acute stage has passed, treat the Ben. When it is impos- sible to choose between the two, treat the Ben and the Biao together. 7.5 Eliminating exogenous pathogenic factors Exogenous pathogenic factors should always be eliminated from the body. Once that has been accomplished, focus on restoring the healthy balance of the body. When exterior pathogenic factors are com - plicated by interior pathogenic factors, treat the exterior factors first or treat both at the same time; do not treat only the interior pathogenic factors. If an exterior syndrome arises during the treat- ment of a chronic disorder, the exterior syndrome should be dealt with first. For example, if a patient contracts an acute wind-heat invasion while having treatment for blood deficiency syndrome, the wind- heat invasion should be prioritized and treated first. 7.6 Strengthening the body’s resistance The purpose of treatment is not only to eliminate pathogenic factors, but also to strengthen the body’s resistance, to maintain and improve the physical condition and constitution, to harmonize the Yin, Yang, Qi and blood, to re-establish the balance of the body, and to achieve a healthy mind and body. For example, to treat a bacterial infection, which often infers a damp-heat syndrome in TCM differ- entiation, the aim of treatment is not to kill the bacteria, but to eliminate damp-heat, promote the function of the Spleen and fortify the body’s resist- ance, thereby restoring health. 7.7 Treating complicated syndromes In a condition where a deficiency syndrome is com- plicated by an excess syndrome, treat the excess syndrome first; if the excess is caused by the defi- ciency, treat both the excess and deficiency. Never treat only the deficiency because the cloying nature of the tonifying herbs may prevent the proper elim- ination of the pathogenic factors. For example, if accumulation of damp-phlegm in the Lung coexists with Spleen deficiency, the phlegm should be elim- inated first; after that, the Spleen can be tonified. If the phlegm accumulation is caused by weakness of the Spleen (failing to transform dampness and phlegm), treatment should aim to tonify Spleen-Qi and remove phlegm at the same time. 7.8 Stopping treatment in time During the course of treatment, be sure to strengthen the condition of the body so as to enable it to cure the disorder and restore internal equilibrium. Once the therapeutic effect has been achieved, treatment should stop. 17 Theories and concepts in the composition of Chinese herbal formulaspart I 7.9 Paying close attention to protect the Stomach and Spleen During treatment, pay close attention to protect the Stomach and Spleen. Not only are these organs the source of the body’s Qi and blood, they are also responsible for the absorption of the herbal medi- cines (when these are administered orally). If the Stomach and Spleen are too weak and sensitive, treatment is more difficult. 7.10 Paying attention to special groups of patients and their physical characteristics Women Women have special physiological characteristics which should be considered when composing herbal formulas. First of all, blood is considered more important for women because they experience men- struation, pregnancy, delivery and breast-feeding, and these directly draw on the blood. When treating women, it is important to consider the changes in the blood and to tonify the blood at the appropriate time. Before menstruation, the blood is flourishing and Qi and blood stagnation can easily arise, so prior- ity should be given to spreading the Liver-Qi. During and after menstruation, the blood is weakened but has a tendency to grow again, so the aims of treat- ment should be firstly to tonify the blood, and secondly to nourish the Yin and spread the Liver-Qi. In a normal pregnancy, the Qi and blood are flourishing in the Chong and Ren meridians. This can often give rise to heat so cold herbs that reduce heat and soothe the Stomach-Qi are often used. After delivery, and while the mother is nursing the newborn baby, the Qi and blood are often weak- ened, therefore warm herbs that tonify the blood and Qi tend to be used. Children Children have special physiological characteristics. Their internal organs and structures are tender and fragile, the Qi and blood are not yet strong and their physiological functions are not fully developed. As such, they are easily attacked by exogenous patho- genic factors and disorders can develop quickly. In treatment, herbs that act quickly against the patho- genic factors and stop their development should be used promptly and in sufficient dosage. However, as soon as the therapeutic effect is achieved, the herbal treatment should be stopped since children gener- ally recover quicker than adults as they have less medical history, stress and emotional disturbance. With proper diet, rest, exercise and care, children can recover completely. When treating chronic conditions in children, pay special attention to tonifying the Kidney in order to support their physical and mental development. Use small dosages of effective herbs which are mild in taste and smell as some children have difficulties taking herbs that have an unpleasant smell and taste. The elderly Generally speaking, the Qi and blood of elderly people are not as strong as they once were, and their bones and tendons are no longer firm. Their metab- olism and digestion are slow. Furthermore, many of them become fragile mentally, especially when they have lost their loved ones or if they suffer from illness and social isolation. When treating elderly people, use herbs that promote digestion, tonify the Kidney, calm the mind and spread the Liver-Qi. Postoperative patients and patients with chronic diseases In the course of chronic disease, or after surgical operations, the Qi and blood are weakened. Damp- ness, phlegm and food tend to accumulate in the body because the Qi is too weak to eliminate them. Treatment therefore needs to tonify the Qi and promote digestion, eliminating any accumulation of dampness, phlegm or food. Patients with special eating habits Food can directly influence a person’s physical con- dition and constitution. Spicy and fatty foods, coffee and alcohol bring warmth to the body. If they are consumed in large amounts, they may generate heat and consume the Yin of the body. Most vegetables, fruits and cold drinks may bring cold and fluid to the body. If they are consumed in large amounts, the Yang of the body can be injured. Vegetarians should pay close attention to the nutritional value of the food they eat and should prepare their meals properly, otherwise their Qi and blood may be weakened, and malnutrition and illness may occur. The consumption of excessive amounts of sweet, fatty foods and dairy products may give rise to the accumulation of dampness or damp-heat in the 18


body. All of the above factors should be considered when prescribing herbal medicine. Patients suffering from stress, insomnia, emotional disturbance and exhaustion At certain times, patients may experience extreme stress, anxiety, insomnia, tiredness and exhaustion, and at these times the body becomes very sensitive because the balance of Yin and Yang, and the normal relationship between the internal organs, are dis- turbed. In treatment, it is important to take into account all the relevant factors, such as how the Qi and the blood tend to move, the sensitivity of the body and the mind, and the possible coexistence of heat and cold, as well as weakness and excess. Herbal formulas should be gentle and balanced, and their administration should be carefully considered, as any strong reaction to the treatment may cause more disturbance to the patient’s condition.

## methods and their applications

8.1 Inducing sweating This method is used particularly to treat exterior syndromes. In Chinese herbal medicine, pungent and warm ingredients which enter the Bladder and Lung meridians, and which directly stimulate the Yang and Qi, are combined with herbs that stimu- late the circulation of Qi and blood. By stimulating the Qi and Yang, opening the pores and inducing sweating, one can expel wind and cold from the superficial region of the body. 8.2 Purgation This method is used to treat excess interior syn- dromes involving accumulations of food, toxic sub- stances, feces or fluid. In Chinese herbal medicine, purgation is carried out by using herbs that enter the Large Intestine and which stimulate the intestine, move downwards and promote bowel movement, or by using herbs that enter the Lung and Kidney meridians and which promote urination. Ingredients that activate Qi movement in the Stomach, Liver and Lung are often used at the same time so as to enhance the purgative action. The strength of the purgative action can be adjusted so as to treat severe or mild, acute or chronic conditions. 8.3 Inducing vomiting This method is used to remove poison from the Stomach. In Chinese herbal medicine, this method is carried out by using ingredients that enter the Stomach meridian, move upwards and directly induce vomiting so as to eliminate the toxic sub- stance from the Stomach. This method is only used for acute conditions. 8.4 Harmonizing This method is used to treat disharmony between internal organs, and between Qi and blood. It is also used to treat syndromes in which warm and cold pathological factors coexist, and syndromes in which deficiency coexists with excess. This method is carried out by combining upward- and downward- moving ingredients, dispersing and restraining ingre- dients, warm and cold ingredients, and tonifying and reducing ingredients. Ingredients that regulate Qi are always important here. 8.5 Warming the interior This method is used to treat internal cold syn- dromes. It is carried out by using pungent and hot ingredients that enter the Heart, Spleen and Kidney meridians, disperse cold, warm the interior, open up the meridians and promote Qi movement. Herbs that are sweet and slightly warm, enter the Spleen and Kidney, tonify the Qi of the internal organs and gently promote the function of the Yang are also selected since Yang and Qi are closely related. 8.6 Clearing internal heat This method is used to treat internal heat syn- dromes. In Chinese herbal medicine, cold ingredi- ents that enter the regions where heat exists are applied. These ingredients have the functions of reducing heat, relieving fire-toxin, cooling the blood and generating body fluids. 8.7 Reducing This method is used to reduce and soften accumula- tions of food, masses and nodules that are formed by phlegm and congealed blood. This method is 19 Theories and concepts in the composition of Chinese herbal formulaspart I carried out by using salty, bitter and pungent ingre- dients, which can soften hardness or break up accu- mulations. These should always be combined with herbs that promote Qi and blood circulation. 8.8 Regulating Qi This method is used to treat syndromes of Qi stag- nation. It involves the use of pungent and aromatic ingredients that enter the Liver, San Jiao, Lung, Stomach and Large Intestine meridians. These ingredients can directly stimulate Qi movement, smoothing its flow or spreading it through these organs and regions. They are often combined with purgative herbs and herbs that reduce accumula- tions of food and/or phlegm so as to assist the func- tion of regulating the Qi. 8.9 Regulating blood This method is used to treat blood stagnation. It is carried out by using pungent, aromatic herbs that enter the Heart, Pericardium, Liver and Gall Bladder meridians. These ingredients can directly stimulate blood circulation. To enhance their effect, they are combined with herbs that activate the Qi. 8.10 Reducing dampness This method is used to treat syndromes involving dampness. When dampness is in the Upper-Jiao and in the superficial region, pungent or aromatic ingred- ients which enter the Lung, Spleen and Bladder meridians, and which can disperse dampness are used. When dampness is in the Middle-Jiao, bitter- warm and pungent-warm ingredients which enter the Spleen meridian and which can dry, dissolve and transform dampness are used. This method can also be effected by using bland and bitter ingredients that enter the Bladder meridian. These ingredients can dissolve and leach out dampness from the Lower-Jiao. Ingredients that promote digestion, regulate the Qi and tonify the Spleen are often selected to assist in the treatment of dampness. 8.11 Eliminating phlegm This method is used to treat syndromes involving phlegm by transforming, drying and eliminating it. This method is carried out mainly by using pungent and bitter ingredients that enter the Spleen, Stomach and Lung meridians. These ingredients have dispers- ing and ascending, as well as reducing and descend- ing abilities; they can directly transform and dissipate phlegm. This method can also be effected by using bitter and warm ingredients that can dry dampness. Bland ingredients that can leach out water by increasing urination, ingredients that promote food digestion and purge accumulations, and ingredients that regulate the Qi are also used so as to prevent the formation of phlegm, thereby assisting the ingre- dients that directly dissolve, dry or eliminate the phlegm. 8.12 Tonifying This method is used to treat different kinds of defi- ciency syndromes. It is carried out by using sweet, slightly warm ingredients that enter the five Zang organs. These ingredients tonify the Qi, blood, Yin and Yang of these organs. Ingredients that regulate the Qi and promote digestion are also used to assist the tonifying ingredients. 8.13 Stabilizing and binding This method is used to treat any abnormal discharge of the essential substances of the body (i.e. essence, blood and body fluids). It also treats any abnormal consumption of the Qi, or any slippage of structures or organs from their original positions due to Qi deficiency. However, as this method does not treat the cause of these disorders, it should be used only for a short period of time and in acute condi- tions. This method is carried out by using sour, astringent, calcined substances that can directly sta- bilize the Qi, blood and body fluids, stop discharge and prevent further leakage. Herbs that can tonify and stabilize the Qi, blood, Yin and Yang are used at the same time in order to treat the cause of the problem. 8.14 Calming the mind This method is used to sedate the spirit, calm the mind and regulate the function of the Heart in order to treat anxiety, restlessness, palpitations and insom- nia. This may be achieved by using salty and cold herbs, especially minerals, which enter the Heart, Liver and Kidney meridians. These ingredients can 20


sedate the Heart-spirit and descend the Yang of the Liver in acute, severe and excess conditions. The method may also be carried out by using sweet, cold or warm ingredients that can nourish the Yin and tonify the Qi and blood, so as to treat chronic syndromes. Alongside these ingredients, some other herbs are also used, including pungent herbs that enter the Heart, Pericardium, Liver and Gall Bladder meridians and that can circulate the Qi and blood, and/or pungent and bitter ingredients that can remove phlegm in order to re-establish the connection between the Heart and Kidney and calm the mind. 8.15 Extinguishing wind This method is used to treat internal wind syn- dromes. It is effected by using minerals and herbs which enter the Liver and Heart meridians and which can strongly and directly anchor Liver-Yang and subdue Liver-wind in order to treat severe and acute conditions when the Liver-Yang arises quickly and stirs up wind. Herbs that nourish Liver-Yin and enable it to control Liver-Yang are used in sub-acute or chronic conditions featuring Liver-Yang ascending with underlying Liver-Yin deficiency. 8.16 Opening the orifices and reviving the Shen (Heart-spirit) This method is used to treat locked-up syndrome, an acute, severe and excess syndrome, which may occur on its own or develop from some severe dis- eases. The pathological change in this case is a sudden disturbance of Qi and blood, resulting in the obstruction and blockage of the sense orifices and of the associations between the internal organs by rebellious Qi, blood, phlegm and ascendant Yang. Characteristic symptoms in this syndrome show obvious signs of blockage of the orifices and a locked body, such as loss of consciousness, locked jaw, clenched fists, rigid limbs and the stoppage of urina- tion and bowel movements. The method is carried out by using very pungent or aromatic ingredients that can move quickly, acti- vate the Qi movement, open up the blockage and reconnect the sensory orifices with the Shen and the internal organs, opening the orifices and reviving the Shen. Herbs that intensively eliminate phlegm are often administered at the same time, as phlegm can easily be formed in this disturbed state and may directly obstruct and block the orifices. 8.17 Moistening dryness This method is used to treat syndromes of dryness that can be caused either by exogenous dryness or through the depletion of body fluids during the course of certain diseases, or through excessive use of certain drying medicines, herbs or spicy food. The etiology may also involve long-term stress which generates heat that in turn consumes the Yin and body fluids. This method is carried out by using herbs to gently disperse dryness, regulate the Lung-Qi, trans- form phlegm, clear heat and moisten the Lung in exogenous dryness syndromes, and by using herbs to nourish the Yin and fluid of the Lung, Kidney, Stomach and Large Intestine in endogenous dryness syndromes.

## treatment strategies

9.1 Antagonistic treatment This is a basic, regular treatment strategy used in most common cases. It infers an antagonistic therapy, which directly fights against the cause of the disor- der and the main pathological changes. These include treating: • a cold syndrome by warming • a warm syndrome by cooling • weakness by tonifying • excess by reducing • stagnation by activating the movement of the Qi • scattered essential substances of the body by binding-up and stabilizing. 9.2 Following the symptoms while giving the treatment The treatment strategy here partially follows the symptoms of the disease. This strategy is only used in extreme cases and is used together with the antagonistic method. For example, when there is extreme heat in the body, cold herbs are needed, but they may not be readily accepted by the body because of the tension created by the antagonistic 21 Theories and concepts in the composition of Chinese herbal formulaspart I nature of heat and cold. In these circumstances, a small amount of warm herb can be added to a formula consisting predominantly of cold herbs in order to help the body accept the cold herbs. Simi- larly, when extreme cold accumulates in the body, it may be hard for it to take hot herbs so a small amount of cold herb can be added to a formula in which warm herbs predominate in order to reduce the antagonism between the medicine and the syn- drome. Other methods of reducing this tension include using sweet herbs and taking the herbal decoction at a cooler temperature. 9.3 Using ‘shortcuts’ to eliminate pathogenic factors This is a strategy that considers the location of the pathogenic factors and takes the shortest route to eliminate them from the body. By using such ‘short- cuts’, pathogenic factors can be eliminated easily, quickly and effectively, with minimal harm being done to the body. For instance, when the disorder is located in the superficial aspect of the body, the method of inducing sweating should be used. When the poisoning substance is in the Stomach, the vom- iting method can be used. If there is an accumula- tion in the Large Intestine, the method of purging the intestines can be applied. 9.4 Indirect tonification To tonify the body, besides using the antagonistic method to directly tonify deficient organs or sub- stances, there are other strategies which are said to be indirectly tonifying. These strategies are often used in a formula alongside the direct tonifying method. The strategy of indirect tonification is based on the relationship between Qi and blood, and between Yin and Yang, as well as by the idea that the Qi is the commander of the blood, that the blood is the carrier of the Qi; that the generation of Yin depends on the stimulation of the Yang, and that the gen- eration of Yang depends on the nourishment of the Yin. The following methods may all be considered examples of indirect tonification. • According to Five-Element theory, when the ‘child’ organ is weak, one can tonify its ‘mother’ organ to strengthen it. For instance, when the Lung-Qi is weak, one can tonify the Spleen in order to strengthen the Lung-Qi. • When blood is weak, first tonify the Qi in order to accelerate the function of blood production, and, at the same time, tonify the essence as essence and blood can transform into each other. As Yin is a part of blood, one can tonify the Yin when there is dryness and heat in the blood. This method is also used in critical situations where the patient has lost a large amount of blood in a short period of time, and it is impossible to generate the blood quickly, even with blood transfusion. At this time, Ren Shen and Huang Qi should be used first to strengthen the Qi in order to control and generate the blood. • When the Yin is deficient, the Qi can be tonified in order to accelerate the generation of Yin. When Yang is deficient, the Qi can be tonified in order to strengthen the Yang because Qi is a part of Yang in a broad sense. This strategy often brings quick results. • To tonify either the Kidney-Yin or the Kidney- Yang, a large amount of herbs that tonify the Kidney-essence should be applied as Kidney- essence is the fuel for the Yang and a substantial source of the Yin. When Kidney-essence is sufficient, the Yang acts on the Yin and generates the Kidney-Qi. • When Kidney-Yang is weak, the Kidney-Yin should be tonified in order to assist the long- term generation of the Yang. In the formula, herbs that tonify Kidney-essence (from which the Yang is generated) are used along with the hot and pungent Yang tonic herbs. • When Kidney-Yin is weak, the Kidney-Yang should be tonified. In the formula, herbs which tonify Kidney-essence are used to tonify the Yin, the material part of the body. In addition, a very small amount of hot and pungent herbs is used to activate the Kidney-Yang and thereby stimulate the growth of the Yin. • When the Qi is deficient in general, the Spleen-Qi can be tonified first in order to generate the Qi of the other organs. 9.5 Paying special attention to protect and strengthen the Spleen In TCM, the Spleen and Stomach are considered as the principal organs in strengthening the physical condition and are called the foundation of life. The 22


concept of the earth being the center can be found in classical Chinese texts on philosophy and agriculture. Postnatal growth and development depend on our digestion. The Spleen and Stomach are respon- sible for receiving, digesting and transforming food and drink into essence, Qi, blood and fluid, so they are very important organs. The Lung-Qi, generated from the Spleen-Qi, disperses the essence, Qi, blood and body fluids throughout the entire body, accelerates the function of the intestines and elimi- nates waste from the body. Furthermore, as the Spleen and Stomach are located in the Middle-Jiao, which, by ascending and descending the water and the Qi, connects the Upper- and Lower-Jiao, they are in a key location to control the body’s physiology and pathology. Moreover, in practice, it is easier and quicker to strengthen the body through the Spleen than through other approaches, because it is easier to restore and tonify the post-heaven essence and Qi than it is to strengthen the pre-heaven essence and Qi which are stored in the Kidney. 9.6 Paying special attention to tonify the Kidney The Kidney plays a key role in the body because the Yin, Yang, Qi and essence of the Kidney are the principal substances of life, and the Kidney deter- mines the constitution and vitality of each individ- ual. Moreover, the Yin, Yang, Qi and essence of the Kidney are the origin of the Yin, Yang, Qi and essence of the other organs, so the condition of the Kidney determines the condition of the whole body. There are many very effective methods to treat Kidney deficiency based on the understanding of the relationship between the Yin, Yang, Qi and essence of the Kidney, and a series of strategies have been created. For instance, when treating Kidney-Yin deficiency, a small amount of herbs that tonify the Yang is added to a large amount of herbs that tonify the Yin. The aim of this is to warm and activate the Yang so as to power the generation of the Yin. Con- versely, when treating Kidney-Yang deficiency, some herbs that tonify the Yin are added to the herbs that tonify the Yang because the Yin is regarded as the root of the Yang. When tonifying either the Yin or the Yang, a large amount of herbs that tonify the Kidney-essence is applied; this is because the Kidney-essence provides the fuel for the Yang and the substance for the Yin. When the Kidney-essence is sufficient, the Yang acts on the Yin, and then generates the Kidney-Qi. As the Kidney is regarded as the root of life, many methods to indirectly strengthen the other organs through tonifying the Kidney have been created. For instance, when treating Spleen-Yang and Qi defi- ciency, herbs that tonify the Kidney-Yang and Qi are used in order to warm and generate the Spleen- Yang and Qi. When treating cough, shortness of breath and asthma caused by Lung-Qi deficiency, herbs that tonify the Kidney are applied in order to grasp the Qi and regulate breath. When treating chronic cough, thirst, rapid hungering, dry eyes and blurred vision caused respectively by deficiency of Lung-Yin, Stomach-Yin and Liver-Yin, herbs that first tonify the Kidney-Yin are applied in order to generate the Yin of these organs. To treat many emotional disorders, such as fear, anxiety, restless- ness, poor memory and poor concentration, the method of tonifying the Kidney is also often used. Since the Kidney-Qi and essence determine the development of the body, the method of tonifying the Kidney plays an important role in the treatment of retardation in children, menstruation disorders and learning difficulties in young people, infertility and menopause syndrome in adults, and declining function in the elderly. Since the Kidney-Qi and essence are inherited from our parents and do not increase after we are born, tonifying the Kidney cannot be achieved in a short period of time. However, with this idea in mind, we can take steps to conserve our Kidney-Qi and essence throughout our lifetime. There are many ways to tonify and protect the Kidney, such as Chinese herbal therapy, Qi Gong exercise, Chinese dietary therapy and a healthy lifestyle. All of these can prevent disease, maintain health and ensure longevity. By this means, a person with a weak constitution can live a happy and healthy life, and someone with a strong constitution can live longer than average. 9.7 Strong tonification and gentle tonification In strong tonification, either herbs with strong toni- fying properties or large doses of herbs that are gentle in action are used to tonify severe weakness of Qi, blood, Yin and Yang. This method can gener- ally be divided into strong tonification of the Yang and Qi, and strong tonification of Yin and blood. 23 Theories and concepts in the composition of Chinese herbal formulaspart I Strong tonification of the Yang and Qi is espe- cially used for critical conditions. For instance, when the Yang is very weak and there is excess internal cold, the Yang and Qi should be strengthened and stimulated promptly so as to expel the cold and rescue the Yang. Strong tonification of the Yang and Qi is also used if the Yin and blood of the body are suddenly weakened by heavy sweating, vomiting, diarrhea and blood loss. As the Yin and blood are substantial aspects of the body which cannot be replaced rapidly, herbs that strongly and quickly strengthen the Qi are deployed in these cases to secure and hold the blood and the Yin. Strong tonification of the Yin and blood is used for severe weakness of the blood and essence, such as in conditions of advanced wasting in diabetes, or starvation and dyscrasia in advanced cancer. Strong tonification is a particularly relevant therapeutic approach for young patients and for patients whose Spleen and Stomach are not impaired as the strong tonic herbs tend to be rich, sweet and cloying, and hence not easily digested. In gentle tonification, either herbs that have gentle tonic properties or small doses of herbs with strong tonifying action are used to gradually tonify the Qi, blood, Yin and Yang in order to treat defi- ciency syndromes. This method is used much more often than the strong tonification method as defi- ciency syndromes tend be chronic conditions, and cases involving chronic deficiency are more often seen in clinical practice than acute cases. Also, in chronic cases, all the organs and their func- tions are impaired and this makes it difficult for the body to tolerate strong tonifying herbs which are sweet, rich and cloying and often bring about diges- tive disorders, or which may be harsh in action and lead to new disturbances of Yin and Yang, Qi and blood. For example, if patients with dyscrasia are prescribed rich, sweet herbs that are too heavy to be digested by those whose digestive function is com- promised, they can actually lose their appetite instead of putting on weight. A gentle method is thus more suitable for syndromes involving chronic deficiency. 9.8 Strategies for reducing interior excess heat Besides the method of directly reducing excess heat in the related organ, there are other strategies to reduce it. • According to Five-Element theory, when there is an excess condition in the ‘mother’ organ, the ‘child’ organ can be reduced or cleared. For instance, to reduce heat in the Liver, herbs that reduce Heart-fire can be used. • When there is heat in the Zang organs, the corresponding Fu organ can be reduced. For example, by clearing and leaching out heat in the Small Intestine, Heart-fire can be reduced. • When heat is intense in many organs and places, first the heat in the Yang Ming organs (the Stomach and Large Intestine) should be reduced as these organs are the ‘sea of heat’. Once the heat is reduced in the Yang Ming organs, the heat in the entire body can be reduced more quickly and effectively. • To reduce excess heat in the entire body, Heart- fire, which is often generated by different emotions, can be reduced directly. 9.9 Strategies for treating Qi stagnation Stagnation of Qi exists either alone or in many pathological conditions. There are a range of differ- ent strategies to treat Qi stagnation. Spreading Liver-Qi, or regulating Liver-Qi, is the primary treatment for Qi stagnation, especially when the Qi stagnation is directly caused by emo- tional disturbance. This is because the Liver-Qi, as well as the Qi of the San Jiao and Gall Bladder, can accelerate the Qi movement in the entire body. Regulating the movement of Qi in the Lung, Stomach and intestines is important as the physical functions of these organs depend on the movement of the Qi. It is also important to re-establish the proper direction of Qi movement between the internal organs. For instance, the Spleen-Qi should ascend and Stomach-Qi should descend; the Kidney-Qi should ascend and Lung-Qi should descend; the Kidney-water should ascend and Heart-fire should descend. Regulating the Qi of these organs may assist the normal Qi movement of the body. Lastly, eliminating the stagnation of blood, food, dampness and phlegm may also assist the movement of the Qi and reduce Qi stagnation. 9.10 Strategies for treating internal dampness and water Accumulations of dampness and water are not just pathological products arising from certain bodily 24


disorders, they are also pathogenic factors in their own right and can cause further pathological change. There are different strategies to treat accumulations of dampness and water in the body, as follows. • Activate the Qi movement, accelerate water metabolism and eliminate dampness. • Use warm and pungent herbs to disperse the dampness. • Use aromatic herbs which have a unique dispersing and transforming action to penetrate the dampness in the Upper- and Middle-Jiao and eliminate it. • Warm the interior in order to dry dampness. • Leach out dampness by using bland herbs that promote urination. • Tonify the Kidney-Yang and strengthen the Spleen-Qi to accelerate water metabolism and transform dampness. 9.11 Strategies for treating heat and cold coexisting in one syndrome When pathogenic heat and cold coexist in one syn- drome, the treatment is difficult as warming the interior may increase the heat, and clearing heat may add to the cold. However, there is a special treat- ment strategy for dealing with this complicated condition, i.e. using pungent-warm herbs and bitter- cold herbs together. The pungent and warm proper- ties can disperse cold, while bitterness and cold can clear heat. At the same time, the pungent herbs can lift the Qi upwards and the bitter herbs can direct the Qi downwards. These two groups of herbs can reduce the conflict between cold and heat, open up obstruction, and separate and eliminate both the cold and heat. 9.12 Strategies for harmonizing Ying and Wei In conditions of deficiency and disharmony between the Defensive (Wei) aspect and the Nutritive (Ying) aspect, warm sweet herbs, which can strengthen the Yang and stimulate the Defensive-Qi in the superfi- cial region of the body, are used. At the same time, sour and cold herbs that can nourish the Nutritive- Ying are also used. When these two groups of herbs are used together, harmony between the Defensive- Qi and the Nutritive-Yin aspects can be restored. At the same time, sweet warm herbs that enter the Spleen meridian are deployed to tonify the Spleen and strengthen the source of the Nutritive-Yin and Defensive-Qi. With this combination, the Ying and Wei become strong and balanced. 9.13 Strategies for tonifying the entire body in a balanced way In many chronic diseases, deficiency often exists in more than one organ and the Qi, blood, Yin and Yang are all involved. Since patients with chronic disease are generally weak and their digestive func- tion often impaired, they are unable to tolerate strong tonification or large numbers of herbs that tonify different organs at the same time. In these cases, it is wise to use small amounts of herbs to get the maximum effect. The herbs should be gentle and able to strengthen the body in a slow but bal- anced way. To achieve this goal, some strategies need to be applied. First of all, choose sweet warm herbs that enter the Spleen meridian and tonify weakness in general, without consuming or injuring the Qi, blood, Yin or Yang. Herbs that regulate the Spleen and promote digestion are deployed at the same time so as to strengthen the source of Qi and blood and to ensure that the tonic herbs are properly absorbed. When the Spleen is strong, it can support other organs and improve the patient’s overall condition. One also needs herbs that are sweet, pungent and warm to gently and steadily tonify the Qi and Yang. Their sweet taste, together with the first group of sweet herbs, will minimize the possibility of injury to the Yin of the body. Sour and cold herbs that nourish the blood and Yin are also used, along with herbs that integrate and stabilize the actions of the whole formula.

## herbal medicine

10.1 Contraindications and cautions relating to syndromes Certain formulas are contraindicated, or should only be used with caution, when patients have certain 25 Theories and concepts in the composition of Chinese herbal formulaspart I conditions, even though the formulas contain herbs that make them balanced. After all, each formula has a principal action and a specific application. Therefore, a clear and correct syndrome differentia- tion will ensure that the practitioner avoids the mistake of making a wrong formula. Specific con- traindications and cautions relating to the applica- tions of herbal formulas are discussed separately in each chapter. However, there are some general prin- ciples that should be noted here. • Compose a formula using herbs of appropriate strength to treat the presenting syndrome. In this way, one can treat the syndrome effectively and avoid unnecessarily consuming the Qi and blood. • When the patient’s Yang is weak, formulas that activate the Qi movement should not be used intensively because the Qi and the Yang have the same origin. • When Qi, Yang, fire and wind are ascending in an acute pathological condition, herbs that move Qi, blood or Yang upwards and outwards should be used with caution. Relevant formulas here are those which treat Bi syndrome or exterior syndrome caused by wind, damp and cold, formulas that disperse and spread the Liver-Qi and formulas that treat headache caused by Qi and blood stagnation. • If the Qi and Yang are weak and sinking, formulas that move downwards should be used with caution. The relevant formulas here are those that reduce heat and those that purge or break up accumulation of phlegm, Qi and blood. Since these formulas are very active in stimulating the Qi and blood, they may also consume the Qi. Patients may feel tired, especially if they are already Qi deficient. • Generally speaking, formulas that release the exterior, warm the interior and expel wind- dampness and wind-cold are pungent or warm in nature. Their energetic tendencies are ascending and dispersing, especially those that contain herbs which can cause sweating. Overdose may disperse the Qi widely, consume the Yin of the body and cause other complications. When treating patients who are deficient in Yin or Qi due to their constitution, chronic disease, stress or dietary habits, these formulas should be used with caution. • If there is an acute exterior syndrome, formulas that tonify the body and formulas that stabilize and bind the Qi, blood and essence should not be used because they will retain the pathogenic factors in the body. If the patient’s body resistance is weak, a small amount of herbs that tonify the Qi can be used in a formula with herbs that expel exogenous pathogenic factors in order to assist the expulsion of these pathogenic factors. • Formulas that drain downwards are, in principle, not suitable for patients who suffer from exterior syndromes. It is better first to treat the exterior condition and then to drain downwards. Otherwise, the treatment may lead the exogenous factors into the deeper regions of the body. • When a patient who has Qi deficiency suffers from constipation, formulas that tonify and ascend the Qi should be used with caution as they can worsen the constipation. • If the patient sweats easily, which suggests that pores are open at that time, formulas that induce sweating should not be used because they are so strong that they may cause overdispersion of Qi and body fluids. • When dampness occupies the superficial region of the body, it may be helpful to induce a mild sweat as this will open the pores and expel the dampness there. However, heavy sweating is not helpful as dampness tends to linger, and heavy sweating can injure the Yin of the body. • If there are accumulations of phlegm, water, food, fire, Qi and blood in the body, formulas that tonify the body and formulas that stabilize and bind the Qi, blood and essence should not be used because they will retain the pathogenic factors in the body and lead to more complicated conditions. The correct procedure is to remove the pathogenic factors (and especially the substantial pathogenic factors) first, and then to begin treatment with tonic herbs. If the accumulations are caused by deficiency of Qi, blood, Yin or Yang, it will not be possible to remove these pathogenic factors completely without adding tonifying herbs to formulas that reduce accumulations. The ratio of the two types of herb must be varied in accordance with the relative strength of the pathogenic factors and the body’s resistance. • Sweetness may cause retention of dampness in the Middle-Jiao. When treating phlegm and dampness, which are excessive lingering pathogenic factors, formulas that contain herbs 26


that are sweet or sour in taste may cause retention of dampness and phlegm and so should be avoided or used with other herbs to reduce these undesirable effects. • Formulas that actively and intensively remove phlegm, especially invisible phlegm, may cause unpleasant feelings and sensations at first because they provoke the movement of phlegm in the body. The practitioner should warn the patient about this in advance. • When using mineral substances that can suppress Stomach-Qi, Lung-Qi and Kidney-Qi, causing Qi stagnation and constipation, one should exercise caution in treating patients who suffer from disorders that involve the aforementioned organs. • The stomach is considered as the first step on the way to achieving therapeutic results when herbs are taken orally. If the stomach of the patient is weak or sensitive, strong formulas with harsh and cloying herbs and mineral substances should not be chosen. Moreover, formulas that promote blood circulation are also quite strong in action and have strong smells and tastes that can easily overburden the stomach. Consequently, they should be used with caution. When prescribing these formulas for patients who have weak stomachs, it is advisable to use low dosages and short courses of treatment, or to add herbs specifically to protect the stomach. In this way, it will be possible for the herbs to be absorbed by the body. • Formulas that drain downward, promote Qi movement and blood circulation, remove or break up accumulations can also drain and stimulate Qi and blood. As such, they are not suitable for use in conditions involving bleeding. • Formulas that cool the blood and stop bleeding may cause blood stagnation as many herbs are cold, astringent or partially charred. As soon as the bleeding stops, herbs that prevent congealed blood should be used. 10.2 Contraindications relating to herbal combinations which have dangerous or antagonistic effects In classical texts, three groups of herbs are identified which are forbidden to be used together, otherwise toxicity and side effects may occur. 1. Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) is incompatible with Gan Sui (Euphorbiae kansui radix)*, Da J1∨ (Knoxiae radix)*, Yuan Hua (Genkwa flos)* and Hai Zao (Sargassum). 2. Wu Tou (Aconiti radix)* is incompatible with Chuan Bei Mu (Fritillariae cirrhosae bulbus), Gua Lou (Trichosanthis fructus), Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma), Bai Lian (Ampelopsitis radix) and Bai Ji (Bletillae tuber)**. 3. Li Lu (Veratri nigri radix et rhizoma) is incompatible with Ren Shen (Ginseng radix), Sha Shen – Bei Sha Shen (Glehniae radix)/Nan Sha Shen (Adenophorae radix), Ku Shen (Sophorae flavescentis radix), Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix), Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix), Xi Xin (Asari herba)*, Shao Yao – Chi Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix rubra)/Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora). As Gan Cao and Wu Tou are very commonly used, the first two groups of these herbs should be learned by heart. There are nine pairs of herbs that are traditionally forbidden to be used together as it is believed that these combinations can minimize or neutralize their therapeutic effects: • Liu Huang (Sulfur)* antagonizes Po Xiao (Glauberis sal) • Shui Yin (Hydrargyrum)* antagonizes Pi Shuang (Arsenicum)* • Lang Du (Euphorbiae Fischerianae radix)* antagonizes Mi Tuo Seng (Lithargyrum)* • Ba Dou (Crotonis fructus)* antagonizes Qian Niu Zi (Pharbitidis semen)* • Wu Tou (Aconiti radix)* antagonizes Xi Jiao (Rhinoceri cornu)** • Ya Xiao (Nitrum) antagonizes San Leng (Sparganii rhizoma) • Ding Xiang (Caryophylli flos) antagonizes Yu Jin (Curcumae radix) • Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) antagonizes Wu Ling Zhi (Trogopterori faeces) • Rou Gui (Cinnamomi cassiae cortex) antagonizes Chi Shi Zhi (Halloysitum rubrum). Among these nine pairs, the first five are rarely used in clinical practice because their functions are so different that they can hardly be combined to treat one syndrome and some of them are so poisonous that they are rarely used nowadays. However, as the last four pairs can be used to treat the same syn- drome, they must be memorized by heart. 27 Theories and concepts in the composition of Chinese herbal formulaspart I Debate as to the truth or otherwise of these two lists has continued from the distant past to the present day. Their veracity still needs to be proved by scientific research. It is reported that, in practice, some of the forbidden pairs are used in certain special cases. Nevertheless, these two lists should be given special consideration in clinical practice, while noting that most of the herbal pairs in the lists are such unlikely combinations that it is hard to imagine a syndrome or a condition for which such pairs might be needed. 10.3 Cautions relating to dietary habits Cautions relating to dietary habits mean, on the one hand, that certain kinds of food should not be taken in certain syndromes or diseases; on the other hand, certain kinds of food should not be taken when certain herbs or formulas are used. Generally speaking, during herbal treatment, patients should avoid cold, raw, heavy and spicy food. It is wise to suggest that patients drink light tea instead of coffee, that they should not take fresh drinks and fruit directly from the refrigerator and that they should eat vegetables cooked for a short time instead of salads. If patients have had a heavy meal, it is good to take some tea or orange juice afterwards to help remove fat. They should also be encouraged to avoid heavy meals, to take semi-skimmed instead of whole milk, and to minimize their intake of candy, sugar, chocolate and alcohol as these may increase damp- ness in the body. For patients who suffer from a cold syndrome, raw and cold food should be avoided. For patients who suffer from a heat syndrome or a syndrome where the Liver-Yang is ascending, spicy, heavy food, coffee and alcohol should be avoided. For patients who suffer from syndromes of damp-phlegm or damp- heat accumulation, sweet heavy food, milk products, nuts and alcohol should be avoided. Patients who suffer from skin disorders or have wounds which are characterized by itching, oozing and redness should avoid seafood, spicy food and alcohol. Some herbs mentioned in classical texts are con- traindicated with certain foods. For instance, all of the substances that tonify the blood should not be taken with strong tea. In addition: • Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix) and Fu Ling (Poria) should not be taken with vinegar • Sheng Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix), Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata) and He Shou Wu (Polygoni multiflori radix) are contraindicated with onion, garlic and radish • Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix), Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma), Jie Geng (Platycodi radix) and Wu Mei (Mume fructus) are contraindicated with pork • Tu Fu Ling (Smilacis glabrae rhizoma) and Shi Jun Zi (Quisqualis fructus) are contraindicated with tea • Chang Shan (Dichroae febrifugae radix) is contraindicated with onion. 10.4 Cautions during pregnancy During pregnancy, herbs can influence physiological changes in both the pregnant woman and the fetus, especially during the first 3 months. Generally speaking, it is better to keep the pregnancy natural, avoiding all kinds of treatment if they are not really necessary at that time. • With regard to the strength and characteristics of herbs, formulas that contain poisonous or harsh herbs should not be used. Examples are Ba Dou (Crotonis fructus)*, Qian Niu Zi (Pharbitidis semen)*, Da J1∨ (Knoxiae radix)*, Shang Lu (Phytolaccae radix), Ban Mao (Mylabris)* and She Xiang (Moschus)**. • Formulas that break up congealed blood should not be used in pregnant women. They may contain herbs such as Tao Ren (Persicae semen), Hong Hua (Carthami flos), San Leng (Sparganii rhizoma), E Zhu (Curcumae rhizoma), Shui Zhi (Hirudo) and Mang Chong (Tabanus)*. • Formulas that promote blood circulation should be used with caution. If they really need to be used in treating disorders such as tumor, bleeding and severe pain due to blood stagnation in pregnancy, herbs that promote blood circulation can be used at low doses and the treatment course must be controlled carefully. An example is using Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan (Cinnamon Twig and Poria Pill). • Formulas that sedate Liver-Yang and calm the Heart-shen containing minerals such as Ci Shi (Magnetitum), Shi Jue Ming (Haliotidis concha) and Mu Li (Ostrea concha) move downwards. They should be used with caution in pregnant women. 28


• Formulas that promote bowel movement containing harsh herbs such as Da Huang (Rhei rhizoma), Fan Xie Ye (Sennae folium) and Mang Xiao (Natrii sulfas) move downward, and should be used with caution. • Formulas that treat dampness should be used with caution in pregnant women as these formulas often contain herbs that have aromatic, pungent and bitter properties, which can easily move Qi and blood and drain dampness, and may endanger the fetus. • Formulas that promote Qi movement, reduce food accumulation, and remove and break up phlegm accumulation can drain and stimulate Qi so they are not suitable for use in pregnancy. Examples include formulas that contain Mu Xiang (Aucklandiae radix)**, Qing Pi (Citri reticulatae viride pericarpium), Bing Lang (Arecae semen), Zhi Shi (Aurantii fructus immaturus), Lai Fu Zi (Raphani semen), Zhe Bei Mu (Fritillariae thunbergii bulbus) and Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma). • Formulas with very pungent and warm herbs such as Fu Zi (Aconiti radix lateralis preparata)*, Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma) and Rou Gui (Cinnamomi cassiae cortex) to warm the Lower-Jiao should be used with caution. • Formulas that contain mineral substances are heavy for the stomach. If they are prescribed for pregnant women who are weak in the Stomach, they should be taken after meals. 10.5 Cautions during breast-feeding The quality of the mother’s milk can directly influ- ence the health of the baby. Generally speaking, the milk of a mentally and physically healthy mother nourishes and promotes the development of her baby. A mother who breast-feeds her baby should be aware of the following points: • When she takes food or herbal formulas that contain very hot, spicy and pungent ingredients, these properties may be passed on to the baby via the breast milk and bring certain problems. Hot, spicy and pungent ingredients will tend to make the baby restless, and cause crying at night, skin rashes and eye infections. • When she takes food or herbal formulas that contain very cold and pungent ingredients, these properties may cause the baby to have abdominal cramps and diarrhea, as well as restlessness and crying at night. • If the nursing mother is in poor health or if she is poorly nourished, the quantity and quality of her milk can be insufficient for the baby’s development. • When she is under strong emotions and stress, the baby may suffer abdominal cramps and poor digestion, and may easily get ill and cry in the night. 10.6 Cautions relating to the use of herbal formulas alongside western drugs Quite commonly, when patients seek Chinese herbal medicine treatment, they have already been prescribed western medicines. A TCM practitioner should be aware of this and should use herbal for- mulas with consideration for the effects of the western drugs. Although herbal formulas have not yet been ana- lyzed from the perspective of modern pharmacodyn- amics and pharmacokinetics, and the interactions between drugs and herbs seem more complicated than can be revealed by the linear analytical models of pharmacology, one can study the actions of the western drugs from a TCM perspective and make a differentiation. For example, drugs that bring stim- ulating, exciting effects and promote metabolism have Yang characteristics while drugs that bring inhibiting, tranquilizing, narcotic effects and slow down the metabolism have Yin characteristics. Drugs that stimulate the function of the sympa- thetic nervous system belong to the Yang and those that stimulate the function of the parasympathetic nervous system belong to the Yin. As the effects of stimulants and inhibitors can be complicated, it is important to consider the effect of drugs on the body as a whole in order to make a differentiation, just as one considers the diet, the mental state and climate. Cautions relating to western drugs and herbal formulas with similar effects • If patients are on drugs for hypertension, tachycardia, anxiety and insomnia, herbs that strongly sedate Heart-shen and descend the 29 Theories and concepts in the composition of Chinese herbal formulaspart I Liver-Yang should be used with caution in the herbal formula. • If patients are on antibiotics, which are considered cold substances that reduce heat and heat-toxin, formulas which strongly reduce fire and which are cold and bitter in nature should be used with caution. • If patients are on prednisone or other adrenocortical hormones, herbal formulas that contain hot herbs which stimulate Kidney-Yang and Heart-Yang should be used with caution. • If patients are on antidepressants or antipsychotics which are considered to slow down the movement of Qi, herbal formulas containing sweet, astringent and sour herbs that stabilize and bind the Qi, fluid and blood, and that suppress the Qi movement should be used with caution. • If patients are on anticoagulants, herbal formulas that promote blood circulation and break up congealed blood should be used with caution. • If patients are on drugs to stop pain, herbal formulas that treat Bi syndrome, which contain warm, pungent and dispersing herbs, should be used with caution. • If patients are having radiotherapy or chemotherapy to treat cancer, formulas that strongly soften hardness, reduce accumulation, and activate Qi and blood circulation should be used with caution. • If patients are on diuretic drugs, herbal formulas that promote urination and drain dampness should be used with caution. • If patients are on antispasmodic drugs, formulas that stabilize and bind should be used with caution. Cautions relating to western drugs and herbal formulas with antagonistic effects • If patients are on sleeping pills, tranquilizers or beta-blockers, all of which have sedative effects, herbal formulas that stimulate the Qi and excite the Yang should be avoided. Formulas that strongly tonify the Qi should be used with caution. • If patients are on anti-allergic and anti-asthmatic drugs, herbal formulas that stimulate the Qi and excite the Yang should not be used. Formulas that contain sweet and sour herbs that can slow down the Qi movement should also be avoided. • If patients are on antispasmodic drugs, formulas that stimulate and tonify the Qi and Yang should not be used. • If patients are undergoing a course of radiotherapy or chemotherapy, herbal formulas that quickly promote blood circulation and stimulate the Qi should not be used to avoid bleeding and metastasis. Formulas that strongly tonify the Qi should not be used on their own in order to minimize the possibility of promoting the growth of the tumor. • If patients are on drugs that suppress the body’s immune system, formulas that strongly tonify the Qi and stimulate the Yang should be used with caution.

## herbal formulas

The possibility of combining western drugs with Chinese herbal formulas or single herbs is based on clinical reality. Quite often patients who look to Chinese herbal medicine for treatment have already been prescribed western drugs. On the one hand, it is very necessary to use these drugs for treating certain diseases that cannot be adequately treated by Chinese herbal medicine. On the other hand, western drugs may be unable to adequately treat the disease, and may even have strong side effects, so Chinese herbal medicine may also be necessary. In this situation, the effects of western medicine on the body should be considered in the differentiation and treatment with Chinese herbal medicine. There is much evidence to show that Chinese herbal med- icine can assist western drugs in the treatment of certain diseases, making them more effective while at the same time reducing their side effects. To ensure that Chinese herbal formulas which are prescribed for use alongside western drugs are com- posed correctly, it is necessary to have a general idea of the main effects of western drugs on the body from the perspective of TCM. There are several examples, as set out below. 11.1 Antibiotics Antibiotics are applied for treating bacterial infec- tions. In TCM, infections are considered to be 30


syndromes of heat, heat-toxin or damp-heat and antibiotics are considered as bitter and cold sub- stances that can strongly and quickly reduce heat and heat-toxin, but that often injure the Qi and Yang of the Spleen and Stomach and may cause nausea, diarrhea and unpleasant sensations in the body. At the same time, they often suppress fire and cause Qi stagnation, leading to a hidden fire in the body. Quite often, after patients finish their course of antibiotics, the infection recurs and even becomes chronic. In this case, a formula should be composed using low doses of cold bitter herbs which have similar functions to the antibiotics but with a broader spectrum, along with herbs that can strengthen the Middle-Jiao, transform the dampness and promote digestion as well as dispersing the constrained Qi and heat. In this way, infections can be cured with minimal side effects from the antibiotics. 11.2 Drugs for treating hypertension Before receiving drug treatment, patients with hypertension often have a syndrome of Liver-Yang ascending with Kidney-Yin and Liver-Yin deficiency. The drugs for treating hypertension can quickly descend the Qi and Yang of Liver, but they may suppress the Liver-Qi. They may also slow down water metabolism and blood circulation. Therefore the syndrome can change into one of Liver-Qi stag- nation with Kidney-Yin and Liver-Yin deficiency, or Liver-Qi stagnation with dampness accumulation in the Middle-Jiao. Once they have started using western medicine, patients’ symptoms may change from irascibility, headache and dizziness to tiredness, irritability and frustration. Sometimes, the blood pressure cannot be controlled in a stable way using drugs, and the syndrome of Liver-Yang ascending with deficiency of the Liver-Yin and Kidney-Yin continues to prevail. This is because patients often instinctively want to overcome the unpleasant sensations and feelings that occur when the Liver-Yang suddenly descends as a result of the drug treatment, so they try to feel fit and active and thereby force the Qi and Yang to move upwards. In this process, constrained heat can be generated. This constrained Qi and heat may lead to therapy-resistant hypertension. This can obvi- ously be found in the pulse diagnosis. Since the syndrome has changed, the herbal for- mulas should be created using herbs that spread the Liver-Qi and promote blood circulation. Herbs that nourish the Kidney-Yin and Liver-Yin, reduce con- strained heat and improve sleep should be pre- scribed at the same time. 11.3 Anticoagulants Anticoagulants are used to prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular accidents. Most patients who are on anticoagulants are elderly people with chronic heart and vascular diseases. From a TCM perspec- tive, the blood becomes thicker and tends to coagu- late when heat (often generated by stress and emotional disturbance) consumes the blood, or when phlegm accumulates as a result of Spleen deficiency. Kidney deficiency is a potential cause of this as the Kidney-Qi weakens with age and is unable to maintain the proper functioning of the Spleen and Liver. After using anticoagulants, although the blood becomes thinner, the patient’s pulse is still wiry and the tongue is often red with a sticky coating. These signs indicate that there is still heat and phlegm accumulation in the body. In the treatment, herbs should be used to tonify the Kidney, strengthen the Spleen, spread the Liver-Qi and calm the mind. These herbs will prevent heat generation and phlegm accumulation. Meanwhile, pungent ingredients that can quickly promote Qi movement and blood circu- lation should be used with caution. 11.4 Drugs for treating hyperlipidemia In TCM, hyperlipidemia is considered to be a syn- drome in which an underlying deficiency of the Kidney coincides with Spleen-Qi deficiency and an accumulation of damp-phlegm due to improper diet and poor digestion, along with stagnation of Qi and blood due to a lack of physical exercise and long-term stress – both of which tend to worsen the condition of the Spleen. Western drugs can reduce the hyper- lipidemia in a reasonably short period of time but the underlying conditions of Spleen and Kidney have not been changed and the stress is still there. Moreover, this quick change in the body’s metabolism places an extra burden on the Spleen and can eventually worsen the condition of this organ. In a common case of hyperlipidemia, herbal for- mulas can be composed and used alongside western drugs. It should be possible to regulate the Liver, 31 Theories and concepts in the composition of Chinese herbal formulaspart I Spleen and Stomach, transform dampness and promote digestion, particularly the metabolism of fats. If hyperlipidemia has developed and has resulted in detectable damage to the heart, brain and vascular system, herbs to strongly remove dampness and phlegm, clear heat, stimulate Qi movement and blood circulation, nourish the Yin and pacify the Liver should be added to the formula. In all condi- tions, herbs that tonify the Spleen and Kidney should be prescribed. 11.5 Drugs for treating diabetes After using drugs to treat type II diabetes, blood glucose levels usually return to normal and the typical symptoms of hunger and thirst tend to dis- appear. However, the cracks on the patient’s tongue, which indicate Yin deficiency, remain unchanged. The tongue coating is thicker than it was before using the drugs, indicating the accumulation of dampness and phlegm. The patient’s pulse is often deep and weak, especially in the Spleen and Kidney positions, which indicates that the underlying defi- ciency has not improved. In herbal treatment, it is necessary to tonify the Kidney and Spleen-Qi in order to nourish the Yin of the Stomach and the Lung. At the same time, herbs that eliminate dampness or damp-heat should also be used. 11.6 Hypnotic and sedative drugs Hypnotic and sedative drugs are often used in the treatment of mental disorders. From a TCM per- spective, they have the function of sedating the Heart-shen and descending the Liver-Yang. Some of them have an intense sedating action that can directly suppress the Qi and Yang and cause sudden Qi and blood stagnation, especially when the patient first starts taking these drugs. Patients may feel tired and weak; they may also have a heavy or a light sensation in the head, dizziness and poor concentra- tion. When patients instinctively try to overcome these unpleasant sensations and feelings, Qi and Yang try their best to move upwards. In this process, constrained heat can be generated. The constrained Qi and heat may lead to therapy-resistant insomnia and anxiety. From a TCM perspective, when the Qi is not able to accelerate water metabolism and food digestion, phlegm-heat is formed and may occlude the mind, leading to mild but chronic insomnia, restlessness and anxiety. Moreover, if the blood is deficient in the Liver and is unable to house the Hun, the person will not be able to sleep soundly even with the aid of hypnotic drugs. In these situations, treatment procedures in TCM that are similar in approach to the hypnotic and sedative drugs should not be used, or used only with caution. Instead, procedures that disperse con- strained Qi, clear heat, promote digestion, and remove dampness and phlegm should be applied. Herbs and a diet that tonify the blood should be used for a long period of time. All of these can assist western drugs to calm the mind in an effective way and to reduce their side effects. TCM treatment can thus shorten the course of treatment required with hypnotic and sedative drugs and reduce their dosage. 11.7 Antidepressants Antidepressants are recommended when patients are unable to cope with their depression, anxiety or chronic pain on their own or with the aid of psycho- therapy. From a TCM perspective, tricyclic antidepres- sants have a descending tendency and a sedating action. They can suppress the Qi and Yang, slow down digestion and water metabolism, cause stagna- tion of Qi and blood, and the accumulation of damp- ness and water. Thus patients may put on weight and feel tired and experience a feeling of heaviness in the body. When dampness and phlegm persist- ently accumulate in the body and block the merid- ians, depression may get worse in the long term. In TCM treatment, by strengthening the function of the Spleen, removing the dampness and phlegm, and promoting Qi movement, patients can feel much more comfortable. Some antidepressants such as the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors can stimulate the Yang of the Kidney and Heart. They are used mainly for treating atypical depression, agoraphobia and social phobia. However, in TCM terms, if there is stagnant heat in the Liver, MAO inhibitors can bring unsatisfactory results in treatment, and may have strong side effects that usually occur before the depression is effectively relieved. Since these drugs may stimulate the Yang of the Kidney and Heart, they can be dangerous if the will-power of the patient is stimulated suddenly and quickly as this may give patients the impulsive mental strength to commit suicide. 32


The working of selective serotonin reuptake inhib- itors is difficult to analyze according to TCM but they can either excite the Kidney-Yang or sedate the Heart-shen. For patients who take antidepressants from these last two groups, TCM treatment should be applied according to careful syndrome differentia- tion, to remove the obstruction, harmonize the Qi and blood, and balance the Yin and Yang in order to prevent and reduce the side effects of the drugs. St John’s wort and Ginseng are also frequently suggested for treating mild depression. According to syndrome differentiation in TCM, they are only suitable for treating patients who suffer from depression due to deficiency of Qi and Yang. If the patients have a Yin deficiency, internal heat or con- strained heat due to stress and anxiety, these herbs may lead to restlessness and insomnia, and may make the condition worse. In this case, a Chinese herbal formula based on syndrome differentiation is more effective than that of using only these herbs. 11.8 Drugs for treating hypothyroidism In TCM, hypothyroidism is considered a syndrome of Spleen-Qi deficiency and accumulation of damp- ness or damp-phlegm in the body. Although western drugs may help to keep thyroid hormone levels normal, symptoms such as tiredness, coldness, weight gain and constipation may still exist. In the differentiation of the syndrome, many patients still show signs of Spleen-Qi deficiency and accumula- tion of dampness in the body, therefore treatment should be given to tonify the Spleen-Qi, activate Qi movement and leach out dampness. 11.9 Radiotherapy and chemotherapy These therapies are mainly used for cancer treat- ment and are considered as heat-toxin in TCM. When the cancer cells are killed, the body is severely injured too. The Yin and the Qi in particular are seriously depleted and weakened by the extreme heat. Moreover, these therapies can cause further disturbances in the body such as deficiency of Kid- ney-essence and blood, blood stagnation, bleeding, empty-heat in the blood or up-flaring of empty-heat. Therefore, during herbal treatment, herbs that nourish the Yin, tonify the Qi and reduce heat-toxin should be used. Once the course of therapy is completed, it is still necessary to tonify the Yin and the Qi and to reduce the empty-fire. It is recommended that herbs to tonify the Kidney are used for a long period of time. 11.10 UVB phototherapy, psoralen plus UVA photochemotherapy (PUVA) For treating psoriasis, UVB phototherapy and PUVA are effective treatments that permit rapid control of the disease, but their side effects are similar to those of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. While these treatments can suppress the pathogenic change and rapidly improve the skin lesions, the heat penetrates into the blood, consumes the blood and Yin, and generates heat-toxin. Once the therapy is finished, the heat quickly arises and the skin lesions appear again, even worse than before the treatment, and the skin becomes more sensitive in general. In herbal treatment, one needs to reduce the heat-toxin, cool the blood, promote blood circulation and nourish the Yin. 11.11 Glucocorticoids (adrenocortical hormones) Glucocorticoids have potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. This is particularly evident when they are administered at pharmaco- logical doses. A variety of synthetic glucocorticoids, some far more potent than cortisol, have been created for therapeutic use, such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone, dexamethasone and beta- methasone. Glucocorticoids are widely used as drugs to treat arthritis and dermatitis. In pharmacological doses, they are used to suppress various allergic, inflamma- tory and autoimmune diseases. They are also admin- istered as post-transplant immunosuppressants. Nevertheless, they do not prevent infection and they also inhibit subsequent regenerative processes. Excessive glucocorticoid levels have side effects on many systems, such as the inhibition of bone forma- tion, delayed wound healing, muscle weakness and an increased risk of infection. 33 Theories and concepts in the composition of Chinese herbal formulaspart I From a TCM perspective, autoimmune disease is caused by deficiency of both Yin and Yang of the Kidney. When under stress, the Kidney works hard to compensate for the weakness; empty-fire is gen- erated and this rapidly ascends. The Qi is disturbed and internal wind, especially Liver-wind, is gener- ated. This pathological change brings a rapid change in the patient’s condition which manifests as an acute allergic reaction. Glucocorticoids have a rapid effect that is similar to that of Kidney-Yang and Kidney-Qi, stabilizing the patient’s condition in a short time; however, the deficiency is not addressed. With a very high dose of glucocorticoids, patients become restless and their tongue becomes redder. This empty-heat can further consume the Kidney- Qi, weaken the body’s resistance and eventually leads to an increased risk of new infections. Thus, when composing a herbal formula for a patient who is on glucocorticoids, herbs that can steadily tonify the Kidney-Qi and Kidney-Yin should be prescribed, along with herbs that cool the blood and calm inter- nal wind. Once the dose of glucocorticoids has been reduced or even stopped, herbs that tonify the Kidney-Qi, Kidney-Yin and Kidney-Yang should be given for a long period of time.

## banned herbs

Traditional Chinese herbal medicine has a long history, dating back 5000 years to the beginning of the Chinese civilization. It is the result of people’s effort to utilize nature for survival and is developed on the basis of long-term observation, study and practice under the guidance of ancient philosophy. However, as the relationship between humans and nature has changed with time, some ingredients in TCM have become unavailable or protected and banned by legislation. Traditional herbal medicine must accommodate such change. Alongside the usage of cultivated herbs and synthetic ingredients in clinical practice, one can also use herbs with similar actions as substitutes. However, one must always bear in mind that, due to the specific func- tion and characteristic of each herb, the therapeutic result of the substituted herb will never be com- pletely the same as the original one. The suggested substitutes are as follows: • Xi Jiao (Rhinoceri cornu)** can be replaced by Shui Niu Jiao (Bubali cornu). It can also be replaced by Da Qing Ye (Isatidis folium) and Sheng Ma (Cimicifugae rhizoma) at a ratio of 10 : 1. • Hu Gu (Tigris os)** can be replaced by Qian Nian Jian (Homalomenae rhizoma) and the bones of cat, pig or ox. • Ling Yang Jiao (Antelopis cornu)** can be replaced by Shan Yang Jiao (Naemorhedis cornu). It can also be replaced by Shi Jue Ming (Haliotidis concha) and Qing Dai (Indigo naturalis) with a small amount of Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) and Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex). • Lu Rong (Cervi cornu)** can be replaced by the combination of Ba Ji Tian (Morindae radix) and Rou Gui (Cinnamomi cassiae cortex). It will also be helpful if venison is included in the patient’s diet. • Gui Ban (Testudinis carapax)** can be replaced by the combination of Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata) and Shan Zhu Yu (Corni fructus). Meat and bone-marrow are also recommended in the patient’s diet. • Bie Jia (Trionycis carapax)** can be replaced by Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata) and Sheng Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix) with Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex). • She Xiang (Moschus)** and Niu Huang (Bovis calculus)** should be replaced by synthetic versions. • Tian Ma (Gastrodiae rhizoma)** can be replaced by Gou Teng (Uncariae ramulus cum uncis), Man Jing Zi (Viticis fructus), Ju Hua (Chrysanthemi flos) or Bai Ji Li (Tribuli fructus) to pacify the Liver and extinguish Liver-wind, or combined with Xia Ku Cao (Prunellae spica), Di Long (Pheretima) and Jiang Can (Bombyx batrycatus) to eliminate wind-phlegm. • Shi Hu (Dendrobii caulis)** can be replaced by the combination of Sheng Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix) and Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata). • Gou Ji (Cibotii rhizoma)** can be replaced by Gu Sui Bu (Drynariae rhizoma). • Bai Ji (Bletillae tuber)** can be replaced by Zi Zhu Cao (Callicarpae folium). • Mu Xiang (Aucklandiae radix)** can be replaced by Chuan Mu Xiang (Vladimirae 34

When the Defensive-Qi cannot reach the surface of the body and fails to bring warmth to the skin, one may have chills and aversion to wind and cold. • When the Defensive-Qi pits its efforts against the pathogenic factors and tries to eliminate them, fever is produced. Because the Defensive-Qi cannot spread its Qi on the surface of the body, it accumulates beneath the surface and fever is produced. • Because the pores close tightly, there is no sweating. • Since the pathogenic factors are wind and cold, which cannot injure the body fluid, patients do not feel thirsty. • No thirst and no sweating are the two key symptoms for differentiating between this syndrome and wind-heat syndrome, which manifests as fever, chills with sweating and thirst. • Wind-cold, as a Yin pathogenic factor, often firstly attacks the Yang region – the back of the body where the Bladder meridian passes. When the Qi and blood are not able to flow properly in this meridian, headache, stiffness of the neck and back, and general pain may appear. • Skin relates to the Lung. When the superficial region is blocked by wind-cold, the Lung-Qi is unable to properly disperse and descend, and a blocked or runny nose, shortness of breath and cough may develop. • Since the disorder is acute, the internal organs are not affected, the tongue is normal and the coating is thin and white. The pulse is superficial and tight in a severe case, and slightly superficial in a common case. Other syndromes may coexist: • If dampness also invades the body, which happens in a humid place, it can cause a heavy sensation of the body. • Sometimes heat can also be generated when the body’s resistance is strong and the pores are closed tightly. Patients may have a bitter taste in the mouth and feel thirsty, indicating the existence of heat. (See Figure 1.1 on page 54.)

## 1 Wind-cold syndrome

Wind-cold syndrome is caused by exogenous patho- genic wind and cold. According to different condi- tions of health and constitutions, the reaction of the body can be different, thus an excess or a deficiency condition can develop. 1.1 Excess condition Main symptoms Chills, fever, no sweating, no thirst. Secondary symptoms Headache, stiffness of the neck and back, general pain, blocked nose, runny nose, sneezing, shortness of breath, cough. Coexisting symptoms Heaviness of the head and body, nausea, vomiting, a bitter taste in the mouth and thirst. Tongue Normal tongue body with a white coating. Pulse Slightly superficial in a common case; superficial and tight or superficial and wiry in a severe case. Associated disorders in western medicine Common cold, influenza, acute respiratory infec- tions, edema and allergy. Analysis of the syndrome This syndrome arises when the exterior cold is severe and the superficial region of the person is firm. • When the cold, which has a contracting nature, attacks the body, the pores are quickly and tightly closed as a reaction, either from the cold itself or from the reaction of the Defensive-Qi. 39 Exterior syndrome and formula compositionChapter When the Nutritive-Yin is weakened, the Defensive-Qi is eventually weakened as well. In a deficiency condition where the cold is not severe and the Defensive-Qi is not strong, the pulse is neither tight nor wiry, but soft. • The pathological process in the superficial region may affect the Qi movement of both the Bladder and Lung meridians; however, the symptoms are not as severe as in the excess condition. • When the Qi in the Bladder meridian is obstructed, patients may suffer from headache, general pain or stiffness. • When the Lung-Qi fails to disperse and descend properly, a blocked and runny nose, sneezing, shortness of breath and cough may develop. (See Figure 1.2 on page 54.) Treatment principles • In the excess condition: Stimulate the Yang and Qi, open the pores and induce sweating so as to expel wind-cold. • In the deficiency condition: Harmonize and strengthen the Defensive-Qi and Nutritive-Yin so as to release the exterior. Main symptoms Chills, fever, slight sweating, aversion to wind. Secondary symptoms Headache, general pain or stiffness of the body, blocked nose, runny nose, sneezing, shortness of breath, cough. Tongue Normal tongue body with a white coating. Pulse Superficial and soft. Associated disorders in western medicine Common cold, influenza, acute respiratory infec- tions and allergies. Analysis of the syndrome The superficial region is the first defense of the body against exterior pathogenic factors. It depends on the balanced functions of Qi and blood there, spe- cifically the Defensive-Qi and Nutritive-Yin, both of which are directly transformed from food and drink. The Defensive-Qi holds the Nutritive-Yin, circu- lates in the superficial region of the body, brings warmth and nutrition to this region and controls the appropriate opening and closing of the pores. A deficiency syndrome arises if the Defensive-Qi is weak. • When the exterior pathogenic wind-cold attacks the superficial region of the body, the Defensive-Qi is not strong enough to close the pores, and the pathogenic wind and cold can easily invade the body. • The exogenous wind, which has a moving and dispersing nature, opens the pores, thus patients may have an aversion to wind and have chills. • When the Defensive-Qi pits its efforts against the pathogenic wind-cold and tries to eliminate it, fever is produced. • When the pores cannot close tightly, the Nutritive-Yin flows out, manifesting as sweats. 1.2 Deficiency condition 40


Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Stimulate the Yang and Qi, induce sweating and expel wind-cold Jing Jie (Schizonepetae herba) and Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix) Jing Jie and Fang Feng are the most commonly used herbs to treat mild or common cases of wind-cold syndrome. Both herbs are pungent and warm, and can expel wind and cold. In a place with a temper- ate climate, where wind and cold do not close the pores tightly, they are often applied as chief herbs in the formula for treating exterior wind-cold syn- drome, in either excess or deficiency conditions. They treat related diseases in modern medicine such as the common cold, influenza, certain stages of infectious childhood diseases, skin diseases and allergies in which an exterior syndrome exists. Comparing Jing Jie with Fang Feng, Jing Jie is lighter and more dispersing. It is pungent but not strong, slightly warm but not drying. It is especially good at expelling wind. Fang Feng is sweet, pungent and warm, and enters the Bladder, Lung and Spleen meridians. As its sweet taste moderates the pungent taste, Fang Feng is less strong in dispersing the wind on the surface of the body than Jing Jie. However, as Fang Feng is warmer than Jing Jie and enters the Spleen meridian, it is especially good at expelling dampness and cold in the regions deeper than the body surface, such as the subcutaneous region and muscles that are controlled by the Spleen. When the patient feels pain and heaviness of the muscles, Fang Feng is more suitable to be used than Jing Jie. Since wind-cold attacks both the skin and the subcutane- ous region, Jing Jie and Fang Feng are often used together. Xiang Ru (Moslae herba), Zi Su Ye (perillae folium) and Huo Xiang (agastachis herba) These three herbs are pungent and warm, and enter the Lung and Spleen meridians. They can expel wind-cold in the superficial region of the body as well as eliminate dampness, which often affects the body in a humid climate or is due to cold drinks. They can be selected as chief herbs separately or in groups in a formula. Xiang Ru is the warmest of these three herbs. It is able to induce sweating, disperse wind and damp- ness, and release the exterior. It is especially useful


1. avoid overdispersing the Qi and consuming the Yin: Formulas that release the exterior contain pungent and warm herbs. their action tendencies are ascending and dispersing, especially the formulas that can cause sweating. too large a dosage may disperse the Qi too much, consume Yin and cause complications. among patients who are deficient of Yin or Qi due to their constitution, chronic diseases, stress or dietary habit, the formulas should be used with caution. 2. Caution in bleeding conditions and pregnancy: as pungent herbs have a moving property, these herbs should be used with caution in bleeding conditions or in pregnancy. 3. Choose appropriate dosage: the dosage of the herbs in the formula should be adjusted to suit the condition of the individual, the syndrome and the season. For elderly people, children, people with a weak constitution and for mild syndromes, at a place of gentle climate and in the summer, the dosage should be less. For adults with a strong constitution, for treating severe syndromes, in winter or in a cold place, the dosage should be larger. 4. Induce proper sweating: Sweating is the means of expelling the exterior pathogenic factors, especially wind and cold. the dosage of herbs should be adjusted according to the reaction and any changes in the symptoms. a mild sweat over the whole body is required. after sweating, patients should feel better. heavy sweat can injure the Yin and the body fluid, and must be avoided. 5. Use only in a short treatment course: as eliminating wind-cold is not difficult in common cases, formulas to release the exterior should not be used for a long period of time. a period of 3 days is recommended. If the exogenous pathogenic factors have not been removed completely, another 3-day course can be prescribed. With regard to herbs that may cause heavy sweating, the dosage and treatment course should be adjusted according to the reaction of the patient after each use. 41 Exterior syndrome and formula compositionChapter when there is fever, general pain and heaviness of the body but no sweating. This herb is also called Summer Ma Huang because it has a similar but gentler action than Ma Huang (Ephedrae herba)* in the function of inducing sweating. Xiang Ru is more suitable for use in the summer when the pores are not closed as tightly as in the winter. It also has the function of transforming dampness in the Middle- Jiao and treating abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea and edema, but this function is not as strong as that of the other two herbs. Zi Su Ye is a light and aromatic herb. It can gently disperse and expel wind-cold in the superficial region of the body and release the exterior. It is used in a mild case of wind-cold syndrome since it is less warm and pungent than Xiang Ru and it is not able to induce sweating and disperse dampness. However, as it can relieve nausea by soothing the Stomach-Qi, it is an ideal herb to alleviate exterior syndrome that is accompanied by dampness in the Middle-Jiao, such as in gastritis. Huo Xiang is an excellent herb to expel wind, cold and dampness; it can also transform dampness in the Middle-Jiao. Compared with Xiang Ru, it is stronger in transforming dampness in the Middle- Jiao; compared with Zi Su Ye, it not only expels wind and cold, but also disperses dampness in the superficial regions of the body to treat heaviness and stiffness of body. It is selected especially in the summer to treat the common cold, influenza and acute gastritis. Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) and Cong Bai (allii fistulosi bulbus) Sheng Jiang and Cong Bai are often used in the initial stage of wind-cold syndrome in either excess or deficiency conditions. In China, a briefly cooked decoction of Sheng Jiang and Cong Bai is a com- monly used folk remedy to treat the common cold. Sheng Jiang is pungent and slightly warm, and enters the Lung, Spleen and Stomach meridians. It can disperse cold and wind, dissolve phlegm in the Lung and stop cough. It also enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians, can warm the Middle-Jiao, soothe the Stomach-Qi, and alleviate nausea and vomiting. This herb is a good choice if a patient suffers from a mild wind-cold syndrome compli- cated by ascending of the Stomach-Qi, such as in acute gastritis. Cong Bai is pungent and warm, and enters the Lung and Stomach meridians. The sharp smell and taste can directly stimulate the Qi, expel wind and open up the obstructions. It can be used to treat the sensation of discomfort in the body, sneezing and a blocked and runny nose in a mild exterior wind-cold syndrome. Qiang Huo (Notopterygii rhizoma), Cang Zhu (atractylodis rhizoma) and Qin Jiao (Gentianae macrophyllae radix) These three herbs are able to expel wind, cold and dampness from the skin, subcutaneous region and muscles. They can be selected as chief in a formula to treat a severe excess condition of wind-cold syndrome. Qiang Huo is commonly used to expel wind, dampness and cold from the body. It has a pungent, bitter taste and is warm in nature. It enters the Bladder meridian primarily and the Liver and Kidney meridians secondly. The pungent and warm nature gives Qiang Huo a strong dispersing and ascending ability, thus it is very effective in quickly expelling wind, dampness and cold from the skin, subcutane- ous region and muscles, especially in the upper half of the body. As a result, it can relieve general pain, headache and stiffness of the back. Cang Zhu can be selected as chief in the formula to treat a reasonably severe excess condition of wind-cold syndrome that includes the symptom of heaviness of the body. Because Cang Zhu is pungent and warm, and enters the Stomach and Spleen meridians, it can strongly dry dampness and disperse wind and cold. Qin Jiao is neutral, bitter and pungent. Its func- tion of expelling wind, dampness and cold is gentler than that of the other two herbs. It is more suitable for treating a deficiency condition of wind-cold syndrome. It is also used for conditions where there is coexisting heat. Ma Huang (ephedrae herba)* Ma Huang is used as chief in a formula to treat a severe excess condition of wind-cold syndrome. This herb is considered as the strongest one to induce sweating. Ma Huang is very pungent and warm, its moving speed is high and its action is strong. Ma Huang enters the Lung meridian and can disperse Lung-Qi. It enters the Bladder meridian and can activate the Defensive-Qi; thus it opens the pores, induces sweating and expels wind and cold. Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) Gui Zhi is pungent, warm and sweet, and is used as chief in a formula to treat a deficiency condition of 42


wind-cold syndrome. Its therapeutic effect is achieved through the approach of warming the blood, promoting blood circulation, opening up the meridians and activating the Yang-Qi so that it can expel wind and cold. Compared with Ma Huang, Gui Zhi is not as warm and pungent, but it is sweet. It enters the Heart meridian primarily and the Lung and Bladder meridians secondly. The warm nature of this herb can reduce the cold in the blood. The warm and pungent characters may also activate the blood circulation and open up the meridians. The sweetness moderates the warm and pungent effects so that the medicinal action may be sustained evenly. Since it enters the Lung and Bladder merid- ians, Gui Zhi can activate Yang-Qi to eliminate wind and cold in the exterior region. Deputy: Regulate the Qi and blood, enhance the strength of the chief herbs to expel wind-cold; treat the secondary syndrome and coexisting syndromes Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) Gui Zhi is pungent, warm and sweet. Besides expel- ling wind and cold to treat exterior syndrome, Gui Zhi is able to warm the blood, promote blood cir- culation and reduce the general pain, stiffness and cold. It is particularly chosen as deputy to enhance the strength of chief herbs to expel wind-cold in treating a severe excess condition of wind-cold syn- drome when the general pain of the body is severe. Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma) Chuan Xiong is pungent and warm, and enters the Liver, Gall Bladder and Pericardium meridians. Chuan Xiong is a very effective herb to invigorate the blood and to promote the blood circulation. It is characterized by high moving speed and strength, and is regarded as the herb that moves the Qi in the blood. In treating an exterior wind-cold syndrome, it can be selected as deputy to enhance the herbs that expel wind-cold, as well as to relieve pain of the body and headache. Bai Zhi (angelicae dahuricae radix) Bai Zhi is warm and pungent with a rich aromatic smell; it possesses strong ascending properties. As it can expel wind-cold, transform phlegm and pus and dry dampness, it can therefore reduce swelling and open the obstruction of the nose. Because it enters not only the Lung meridian, but also the Stomach meridian, it is often applied to treat pain in the forehead where the Yang Ming meridian passes through. Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) Chai Hu is pungent and neutral, and enters the Liver and Gall Bladder meridians. It is particularly effective in spreading Qi in the Shao Yang meridi- ans, and in treating headache (especially on the lateral sides of the head) and a sensation of fullness in the hypochondriac region. When there is stagna- tion of Liver-Qi due to stress, which weakens the Defensive-Qi and leads to an exterior syndrome, Chai Hu can be selected. Xi Xin (asari herba)* Xi Xin is a very pungent and hot herb with an aro- matic smell. It does not enter the Bladder meridian, but does enter the Kidney meridian. It can be selected as deputy in the formula to enhance the action of the chief herbs in treating an excess condi- tion of wind-cold syndrome and can release pain. Xi Xin is very effective in eliminating cold and wind in very deep regions of the body, such as the bones and tendons. Because of its strong aromatic smell, pungent taste and hot nature, it can easily penetrate into the deep layers of the body and is often used in exterior wind-cold syndromes if there is Kidney-Yang deficiency, such as in elderly people, patients who suffer from chronic diseases with internal cold, and patients who suffer from Bi syn- drome due to wind-cold invasion. Among these individuals, wind and cold may invade the body more deeply than in common cases. Alternatively, the development can be very acute, the patient feels severe pain in the whole body and the pulse is deep and tight instead of superficial and tight. As Xi Xin enters the Lung meridian and has an aromatic smell, it is often used for transforming cold and thin phlegm from the Lung, opening the nasal orifices and improving the sense of smell. A side effect of Xi Xin occurs when it is applied incorrectly. Because it is very hot and pungent, it can easily injure the Yin, blood, body fluid and Qi. It should not be used, or must be used with caution, in patients who suffer from exterior wind-cold syndrome where internal heat also coexists and the Yin, blood and body fluids are deficient. The dosage of Xi Xin should also be controlled carefully in the range of 1–3 g per day for crude herbs. If the powdered herbal extract is used, the dosage should be reduced to 0.1–0.5 g per day. Overdose may cause numbness in the throat and tongue, a stifling 43 Exterior syndrome and formula compositionChapter sensation in the chest and even death due to paraly- sis of the diaphragm. Modern research indicates that this herb should be used with caution in patients who suffer from renal disease as it has nephrotoxic effects. Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) Bai Shao Yao is often selected in the deficiency condition of an exterior wind-cold syndrome when the Yin, body fluids and blood are weakened through sweating. Bai Shao Yao is sour, bitter and slightly cold. Sour and cold may generate the blood, and therefore sup- plements the shortage of the Yin. It is often used with Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus), which is pungent, sweet and warm, expels wind-cold, and warms and stimulates the blood and Qi. When they are used together, they can harmonize the Defen- sive-Qi and Nutritive-Yin in the superficial region so as to stabilize the exterior. Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix) Dang Shen is sweet and neutral. It primarily enters the Spleen meridian. It can be used as deputy in an exterior syndrome when the Qi is too weak to eliminate the exterior pathogenic factors. It can tonify the Spleen-Qi so as to strengthen the Lung-Qi and Defensive-Qi, and accelerate the speed of elim- inating the exterior pathogenic factors. Assistant: Regulate the Lung-Qi, stop cough; strengthen the Middle-Jiao in order to assist the chief herbs in expelling wind-cold Jie Geng (platycodi radix) and Xing Ren (armeniacae semen) Jie Geng and Xing Ren are often used together in the formula because they can effectively disperse and descend the Lung-Qi, eliminate phlegm and relieve cough, which is a secondary pathogenic change in a wind-cold syndrome. Jie Geng is pungent, bitter and neutral. It is able to transform phlegm and stop cough. Pungent and bitter tastes provide Jie Geng with dispersing and dissipating capacities. It is light in weight and in nature, thus its function is characterized by ascend- ing the Lung-Qi gently but sufficiently. It is suitable to treat cough with phlegm, a stifling sensation in the chest and nasal obstruction due to obstruction of the Lung-Qi. Xing Ren is bitter, warm and slightly poisonous. The bitter taste gives Xing Ren its descending prop- erty. Warmth can disperse the accumulation of phlegm and the stagnation of Qi. It contains oil, which gives this herb a moist nature. The function of Xing Ren is characterized by descending the Lung-Qi and transforming phlegm to stop cough. It is particularly useful in treating cough with a large amount of phlegm, fullness in the chest, shortness of breath and nasal obstruction when the exterior pathogenic factors invade the Lung and the Lung-Qi fails to descend. When Jie Geng and Xing Ren are used together, one moves upwards and the other moves down- wards; one disperses the Lung-Qi and the other descends the Lung-Qi. They perfectly match each other in regulating the Lung-Qi, eliminating phlegm and relieving cough, hence the reason that they are often used together. Zi Su Zi (perillae fructus) Zi Su Zi is warm and pungent, and enters the Lung meridian. It can descend the Lung-Qi and transform phlegm. It is a seed and can both moisten the intes- tines and promote bowel movement. It can be selected to treat an exterior syndrome if the Lung-Qi is blocked, and there is cough, wheezing and fullness in the chest. If there is constipation, the Qi of the Large Intestine is obstructed, affecting the ability of the Lung-Qi to descend; this herb is a perfect choice in the formula. Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) and Zhi Ke (aurantii fructus) Chen Pi is pungent, bitter and slightly warm. It enters the Stomach and Spleen meridians and is effective in regulating the Qi of these organs. Its aromatic smell can stimulate the Spleen, transform dampness and soothe the Stomach-Qi. It is often used in an ext- erior condition if there are symptoms such as disten- sion and pain in the abdomen, reduced appetite, fullness in the stomach, nausea and vomiting. Zhi Ke is bitter and slightly cold, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. It can regulate the Spleen-Qi and Stomach-Qi in a gentle and slow way. It moves horizontally in the Upper- and Middle- Jiao, opens the chest and reduces distension. In an exterior syndrome it is used to treat Qi stagnation in the chest, stomach and hypochondria, which causes distension in the upper abdomen, a stifling sensation in the chest, reduced appetite, irritability and depression. 44


Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens), Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) and Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Sheng Jiang is pungent and slightly warm, and enters the Lung, Spleen and Stomach meridians. It can effectively soothe the Stomach-Qi, warm the Mid- dle-Jiao and promote digestion so as to promote the generation of Defensive-Qi. Da Zao is sweet and warm, and enters the Spleen meridian. It can nourish the blood and tonify the Qi. Sheng Jiang and Da Zao are often used together to strengthen the Middle-Jiao and are used in defi- ciency conditions. Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and slightly warm, and enters the 12 regular meridians, especially the Spleen meridian. It can tonify the Spleen-Qi. It is often used in deficiency conditions. Envoy: Harmonize and integrate the functions of herbs in the formula Generally speaking, it is not necessary to add an envoy in a formula to expel wind-cold because the chief herb often serves as the guide and enters the superficial region of the body. Herbs with a harmo- nizing function, such as Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata), may slow down the dispersing function and reduce the therapeutic effect of the formula. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to use an envoy such as Zhi Gan Cao in a formula. It can moderate the harsh properties of herbs and integrate the functions of herbs that work on different aspects of the syndrome in a formula. Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Headache: use Qiang Huo (Notopterygii rhizoma), Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma) and Bai Zhi (Angelicae dahuricae radix) to expel wind and cold, and to regulate the Bladder, Gall Bladder and Stomach meridians to stop headache. • Itch of the throat: use Chan Tui (Cicadae periostracum) or Jing Jie (Schizonepetae herba) to expel the wind in the throat. • Weakness of Defensive-Qi and easily sweating: use Huang Qi (Astragali radix) to tonify the Qi and close the pores, use Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) to nourish the Yin and body fluids and use Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix) to expel the wind. • Poor appetite: use Zi Su Ye (Perillae folium), Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) and Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) to soothe the Stomach-Qi and improve the appetite. • Stress: use Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix), Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) and Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) to regulate the Qi in the San Jiao meridians, and use Xiang Fu (Cyperi rhizoma) to regulate the Liver-Qi. • Stiffness of the neck: add Ge Gen (Puerariae radix) to ascend the fluid and relax the tendons. • Beginning of internal heat: add Shi Gao (Gypsum) to clear the heat. • Dampness in the meridians: add Qin Jiao (Gentianae macrophyllae radix) to assist Qiang Huo (Notopterygii rhizoma) to eliminate wind-damp-cold. Examples of classical formulas Ma Huang Tang (Ephedra Decoction) Source: Shang Han Lun Ma Huang (Ephedrae herba)* 6 g Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) 4 g Xing Ren (Armeniacae semen) 9 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 3 g Analysis of the formula This very famous classical formula from Dr Zhang Zhong Jing was devised 2000 years ago. It can strongly induce sweating and expel wind-cold, regu- late the Lung-Qi and relieve wheezing. It treats the excess condition of a severe wind-cold syndrome when there are fever, severe chills without sweating, 45 Exterior syndrome and formula compositionChapter headache, generalized pain and shortness of breath. The patient may have a white tongue coating and a tight, superficial pulse. In this formula: • Ma Huang, which is pungent and hot, is used as chief; it directly stimulates the Yang and Qi in the Bladder and Lung meridians, induces sweating and expels the wind and cold. It can disperse and descend the Lung-Qi, release the obstruction of the Lung-Qi and treat shortness of breath. • Gui Zhi serves as deputy; it can promote blood circulation so as to enhance the action of the chief to induce sweating and relieve general pain of the body. • Xing Ren is pungent and warm; as a helping assistant it can assist the action of the chief and deputy to disperse the Lung-Qi. Xing Ren is bitter and can also descend the Lung-Qi. This descending action may also serve as a corrective assistant to control the intensive dispersing action of the chief, the very pungent and warm Ma Huang. • Zhi Gan Cao serves as envoy; it harmonizes and integrates the functions of herbs that work in different directions and at different levels in the formula. Commentary on strategies In this formula, several strategies of combination are demonstrated. • Ma Huang is chosen to induce sweating and it focuses on the main pathological change. As it is a harsh and poisonous herb, it cannot be used in a large dosage. • In order to achieve a sufficient effect of expelling wind-cold, Gui Zhi is used to enhance the ability of Ma Huang to induce sweating at the blood level, and Xing Ren assists Ma Huang to regulate the Lung-Qi. They make the action of Ma Huang strong, lasting and even. • The descending tendency of Xing Ren and the moderate nature of Zhi Gan Cao can directly control the intensity of Ma Huang. These combinations make this formula effective and safe for short-term use in a severe excess condi- tion of a wind-cold syndrome. Analysis of the formula This formula, also devised by Dr Zhang Zhong Jing, treats a deficiency condition of a wind-cold syn- drome. This formula expels wind-cold and releases the exterior by regulating the Nutritive-Yin (Ying- Yin) and Defensive-Qi (Wei-Qi). The manifest- ations are fever with irregular sweating and aversion to wind, blocked nose and headache. Patients do not feel thirsty. They have a white tongue coating and a superficial, weak or slow pulse. In this formula, Gui Zhi and Bai Shao Yao are considered as the chief herbs in the formula: • Gui Zhi is warm and sweet, promotes the blood circulation, strengthens the Yang and stimulates the Qi at the superficial level of the body. • Bai Shao Yao is sour and cold, and can nourish the Yin and body fluids. When they are used together, they can restore the physiological balance between the Defensive-Qi and the Nutritive-Yin. These two herbs match each other perfectly and can restore the condition of deficiency and imbalance between the Defensive-Qi and Nutritive-Yin. The remaining herbs are assistants in the formula: • Sheng Jiang is pungent and slightly warm, and enters the Lung meridian. It assists Gui Zhi to expel wind and cold. It also enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians and can soothe the Stomach-Qi, warm the Middle-Jiao, aid digestion and promote the generation of Defensive-Qi. • Da Zao is sweet and warm, and enters the Spleen meridian.

enhance the ability of Bai Shao Yao. Together with Zhi Gan Cao, it can tonify the Spleen-Qi and strengthen the Defensive-Qi and Nutritive-Yin. Commentary on strategies This formula has several characteristics. • Gui Zhi and Bai Shao Yao are chosen to harmonize and tonify the Defensive-Qi and Nutritive-Yin and they focus on the main pathological changes in the superficial region. This combination is often used for harmonizing Ying and Wei. • The combination of Sheng Jiang and Da Zao is also commonly used for strengthening the Middle-Jiao. • In this formula, there are two very balanced groups: Gui Zhi and Sheng Jiang belong to the Yang tonifying group; Bai Shao Yao and Da Zao belong to the Yin tonifying group. Because of the balanced functions, it is a safe formula and can be used for treating many types of disorder that are linked with Ying and Wei imbalance. • Most of the ingredients in this formula are used in a Chinese kitchen. As they are safe and with tastes acceptable to most people, this formula is widely used. Jiu Wei Qiang Huo Tang (Nine-herb Decoction with Notopterygium) Source: Si Shi Nan Zhi quoted from the formula of Zhang Yuan Su Analysis of the formula This formula is able to induce sweating to expel wind-dampness and clear internal heat. It is used for treating the exterior wind-cold-damp syndrome, which manifests as chills, fever, no sweating and headache with tight and heavy sensations, stiffness of the neck and generalized pain with a heavy sensa- tion. At the same time, heat is generated by the tightly closed pores in the superficial region and is manifested as a bitter taste in the mouth and thirst. Patients have a white or yellowish, sticky tongue coating and a superficial pulse. In this formula: • Qiang Huo is used as chief; it directly expels the wind, cold and dampness in the superficial region of the body. • Fang Feng and Cang Zhu serve as deputies; they assist the function of Qiang Huo. • Xi Xin, Chuan Xiong and Bai Zhi are helping assistants; they work in the same direction as the chief and deputy herbs. In addition, they can promote Qi and blood circulation and relieve headache and general pain. • The other two assistants are Huang Qin and Sheng Di Huang. As cold herbs, they are particularly used for treating internal heat. At the same time they also serve as corrective assistants to reduce the warming and drying nature of the other herbs in the formula. • Zhi Gan Cao serves as envoy, again for moderating the actions of the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies There are several characteristics in this formula. • The herbs that are used not only expel wind and cold, but also expel dampness in the superficial region. • It treats warm and cold coexistence in one syndrome, a more complicated and commonly seen syndrome. Warm and cold herbs are used in one formula. The cold herbs not only treat the internal heat, but also reduce the side effects of the pungent and drying herbs.

It is used in a common case of an excess condition of a wind-cold syndrome, or at the initial stage of a febrile disease. Patients suffer from chills, fever, headache with a heavy sensation, no sweating and have a blocked nose. A white tongue coating and a superficial, rapid pulse are seen in this syndrome. In this formula: • The pungent and warm Qiang Huo and Du Huo are used as chief to expel wind, cold and dampness from the entire body. • There are several deputies: – Chuan Xiong can promote blood circulation and therefore reduce headache and generalized pain. – Chai Hu, Jing Jie and Fang Feng can expel wind and help the chief herbs to release the exterior. • The assistants can remove phlegm and stop cough and they also focus on regulating the Lung-Qi to assist the chief and deputy herbs: – Zhi Ke broadens the chest. – Jie Geng ascends the Lung-Qi and Qian Hu descends the Lung-Qi.

Analysis of the syndrome This syndrome is caused by exterior pathogenic wind and heat, which via the nose and throat directly invade the Lung, injure the fluid and disturb the dispersing and descending function of the Lung. As the Lung is related to the skin, the superficial region is also involved. • When the Defensive-Qi is fighting against the pathogenic factor, heat is produced and fever arises. Heat is also a Yang pathogenic factor; it can directly produce heat and cause fever. Jing Fang Bai Du San (Schizonepeta and Ledebouriella Powder to Overcome Pathogenic Influences) Source: She Sheng Zhong Miao Fang – Fu Ling reduces the dampness. • Zhi Gan Cao is used as envoy to moderate the speed and drying nature of the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies This formula is effective in inducing sweating and expelling wind-cold-dampness. It is a commonly used formula for treating an excess condition. Because there are many pungent and drying herbs in the formula, it should be used with caution or modified for treating patients with Yin deficiency.

## 2 Wind-heat syndrome

Main symptoms High fever, slight chills, irregular sweating, sore throat and thirst. Secondary symptoms Cough, blocked nose, red, swollen eyes, headache. Tongue Red tip with a white or slightly yellow coating. Pulse Superficial, rapid. 48


• The pores cannot open and close appropriately as the Lung is attacked, thus patients have a sensation of aversion to wind and have irregular sweats. • Heat may injure the body fluids and cause thirst. • The heat can become so strong that it produces heat-toxin and leads to sore throat. • The Lung is a very light and delicate organ, which cannot bear excess heat. When the heat invades the Lung, the Lung-Qi cannot disperse and descend appropriately. Thus a blocked nose and a cough appear quite quickly. • When heat-toxin accumulates in the Upper-Jiao, red, painful and swollen eyes may result. • If Qi and blood move incorrectly, headache and general pain of the body may appear. • A tongue with a red tip and a thin yellow coating, and a superficial and rapid pulse indicate clearly the nature and location of the pathogenic factors. (See Figure 1.3 on page 54.) Treatment principle: Expel wind, clear heat, regulate the Lung so as to release the exterior Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Clear heat and expel wind Sang Ye (Mori folium) and Ju Hua (Chrysanthemi flos) Sang Ye and Ju Hua are bitter, sweet and cold, and enter the Lung and Liver meridians. They are often selected as chief herbs in the formula to treat a mild wind-heat syndrome when the wind-heat mainly affects the Lung. Sang Ye particularly enters the collaterals of the Lung, and can gently but effectively search and expel the wind and heat there. It can also relieve cough. Ju Hua, especially the yellow Ju Hua, can also clear wind-heat from the Lung. It effectively clears heat from the Lung meridian as well as from the related Gall Bladder meridian. It is particularly selected when the heat is in the head and patients suffer from headache and painful, swollen and red eyes. Since wind-heat frequently invades the Lung, affecting the nose, skin, head and throat, Sang Ye and Ju Hua are often used together as chief in the formula. Jin Yin Hua (Lonicerae flos) and Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus) These two herbs are often selected as chief herbs in a formula to treat a common case of wind-heat syndrome.


Since wind-heat is an exterior pathogenic factor, no matter how much disturbance it has made, treatment should focus on dispersing the exterior pathogenic factor in order to give it a way to leave the body and, at the same time, to clear the heat in the Upper-Jiao (especially from the Lung) and restore the function of the Lung. Since the Lung is a very delicate organ, pathogenic factors and harsh herbs may injure the Lung and disturb its function. Suitable herbs should be selected with appropriate dosages according to the specific pathological change of the syndrome so as to restore the function of the Lung without delay. 49 Exterior syndrome and formula compositionChapter Jin Yin Hua is sweet and cold. It was originally used for clearing heat-toxin from the Heart, Liver and Stomach. As this flower has a light fragrant smell which has dispersing and ascending actions, it is also used for treating exterior wind-heat syn- drome. It can slightly disperse the Qi, expel wind, clear heat and remove heat-toxin in the Upper-Jiao. In addition, its sweet and cold properties can gener- ate body fluids and prevent Yin consumption in wind-heat syndrome. Lian Qiao is bitter, cold and aromatic, and enters the Heart and Small Intestine meridians. Although it does not enter the Lung meridian, it is still often used in formulas to treat wind-heat syndrome as a chief herb. This is because its aromatic smell can disperse the Qi in the Upper-Jiao and gently release the exterior, and it leaches out heat from the Heart through the Small Intestine. It is especially effective in dispersing and clearing heat in the Heart and relieving restlessness and a warm sensation in the chest. As Jin Yin Hua and Lian Qiao have similar prop- erties and actions, they are often used together in the formula as chief in order to accentuate their functions. As their dispersing capacity is much weaker than their clearing capacity, it is necessary to add other herbs to increase their dispersing action to release the exterior. Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) and Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) These two herbs are used in combination as chief herbs in the formula to disperse the constrained heat and Qi in the Upper-Jiao so as to expel wind-heat. Chai Hu is pungent and neutral, and enters the Liver and Gall Bladder meridians. It can effectively disperse and ascend the constrained Qi of the Liver and Gall Bladder and facilitate the Qi movement in the San Jiao passage. Through this approach, it can stimulate the Lung-Qi to eliminate the wind-heat and is therefore often used in a formula to release the exterior. Huang Qin is bitter and cold, and enters the Lung and Large Intestine meridians. It particularly clears heat in the Lung and Upper-Jiao and damp-heat in the intestines. It also enters the Gall Bladder merid- ian and can reduce fire generated by stress. When these two herbs are used together, the blockage of Qi can be spread and the heat can be eliminated. Ma Huang (ephedrae herba)* and Shi Gao (Gypsum) Ma Huang and Shi Gao can be used in combination as chief substances in a formula to treat a severe case of wind-heat syndrome. They can strongly disperse and clear the intense heat in the Lung. Ma Huang is very warm and pungent, can effec- tively stimulate the Lung-Qi, disperse the restrained heat, open the pores and thus eliminate the exterior pathogenic factors. Shi Gao is pungent, sweet and very cold, can quickly descend the Lung-Qi, powerfully clear heat in the Lung and relieve wheezing. Shi Gao can disperse the Lung-Qi because of its pungent taste, but this function is weaker than its descending function. The combination of the dispersing action of Ma Huang and descending action of Shi Gao can per- fectly regulate the Lung-Qi. The expelling action of Ma Huang and the clearing action of Shi Gao can efficiently eliminate pathogenic wind-heat. When the dosage of Shi Gao is much larger than that of Ma Huang, the function of this combination is to first clear the heat; the moving tendency is mainly downwards. Deputy: Clear heat and heat-toxin in the Upper-Jiao; regulate, stimulate and strengthen the Lung-Qi so as to expel the wind and heat Bo He (Menthae herba) Bo He is very pungent, aromatic and cold, and enters the Lung and Liver meridians. As deputy, it is often used to enhance the ability of the chief to expel wind-heat as it possesses a very strong dispersing ability. Since its dispersing action is stronger and quicker than that of its clearing action, Bo He is not an appropriate choice for clearing intense heat. Large dosages of Bo He may increase the chance of overdispersing the Qi in the Upper-Jiao; this may injure the fluids of the Lung and further increase the heat. Niu Bang Zi (arctii fructus) Niu Bang Zi is bitter, pungent and cold, and enters the Lung and Stomach meridians. It is able to either expel the wind-heat or clear heat; however, the clearing function is stronger than that of the dispers- ing function. It can be used as a deputy to strengthen the function of clearing heat. It is particularly 50


suitable for treating a sore throat in the wind-heat syndrome. As it is a seed and can moisten the intes- tines, it is more suitable for use in a condition where constipation coexists. Jie Geng (platycodi radix), Xing Ren (armeniacae semen) and Qian Hu (peucedani radix) These three herbs are often used as deputies for enhancing the chief herbs to regulate the Lung-Qi. Jie Geng and Xing Ren are pungent in nature and enter the Lung meridian. Jie Geng moves upwards and Xing Ren moves downwards; one disperses the Lung-Qi and the other descends the Lung-Qi. In this way they can relieve cough, which often exists in a wind-heat syndrome. However, as both are warm and toxic, they should be used in small dosages. Moreover, since they do not have a cold tempera- ture, they should be used with cold herbs in the formula. Qian Hu is bitter, pungent and slightly cold, and enters the Lung meridian. It can either disperse the Lung-Qi or descend the Lung-Qi, but the main tendency is descending. It can also eliminate phlegm and stop cough. Since its features fit the pathological changes in the Lung in many syndromes, Qian Hu is a commonly used herb for regulating the Lung and stopping cough. Jing Jie (Schizonepetae herba) and Dan Dou Chi (Sojae semen praeparatum) These herbs are pungent and warm, and enter the Lung meridian. They can be used as deputies to gently stimulate the Qi in the superficial region and open the pores, thus eliminating wind. They help the chief to expel pathogenic wind-heat in an indi- rect way. Moreover, they are also used as corrective assistants to prevent cold herbs blocking the move- ment of Yang and Qi in the process of expelling the pathogenic factors. These two herbs should be used with small dosages in the formula as they should not change the principal temperature of the formula. Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix) Dang Shen is sweet and neutral. It primarily enters the Spleen meridian. It can be used as a deputy in an exterior syndrome when the Qi is too weak to eliminate the exterior pathogenic factors. It can tonify the Spleen-Qi so as to strengthen the Lung-Qi and Defensive-Qi, and accelerate the speed of elim- inating the exterior pathogenic factors. Assistant: Reduce heat from the Upper-Jiao, nourish Yin and body fluids, and treat the coexisting symptoms Zhu Ye (Bambusae folium) Zhu Ye is sweet and cold, and enters the Heart and Lung meridians. It can expel wind-heat in the Upper-Jiao, increase urination and therefore leach out heat from the Heart. It is often used in a wind- heat syndrome when the heat disturbs not only the Lung but also the Heart, which is manifested as restlessness and irritability. Qiang Huo (Notopterygii rhizoma) and Bai Zhi (angelicae dahuricae radix) These two herbs are warm in temperature and very effective in treating headache and pain of the eyes and orbitae, which often exist in a wind-heat syn- drome, especially in fever. The dosages of these two herbs in a formula should be small to avoid changing the principal temperature of the formula. Lu Gen (phragmitis rhizoma) and Bei Sha Shen (Glehniae radix) Lu Gen is sweet and cold, and enters the Lung, Stomach and Kidney meridians. It is often used as assistant in a formula to treat a wind-heat syndrome because it not only clears heat but also generates body fluids, which have been injured by heat in a wind-heat syndrome. In addition, it is also used to treat nausea and belching when the heat from the Lung affects the Stomach. Bei Sha Shen is sweet and cold, and enters the Lung meridian. It can be used for the same purpose as Lu Gen. However, as it is sweeter and less cold than Lu Gen, it is only used at the recovery stage of a wind-heat syndrome where the exterior wind- heat barely exists but the Lung-Yin is still severely injured. Envoy: Harmonize the herbs in the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao is used as envoy in a formula to harmo- nize the functions of herbs and moderate their prop- erties. When it is used with cold herbs, the Yin and body fluids can be generated and stabilized more easily. 51 Exterior syndrome and formula compositionChapter Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Generalized pain, headache with heavy sensation, thirst and bitter taste in mouth due to excess heat in Yang-Ming meridian: use Bai Zhi (Angelicae dahuricae radix) and Qiang Huo (Notopterygii rhizoma) to expel the wind-cold in the Upper-Jiao; use Shi Gao (Gypsum) and Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) to clear the heat in the Yang Ming meridian. • Headache: use Bo He (Menthae herba), Man Jing Zi (Viticis fructus), Shi Gao (Gypsum) or green tea to reduce wind-heat in the head. • Sore throat: add Ma Bo (Lasiosphaera), She Gan (Belamcandae rhizoma) and Ban Lan Gen (Isatidis/Baphicacanthis radix) to dissipate the swelling and reduce heat-toxin. • Blocked nose and loss of sense of smell: add Xin Yi (Magnoliae flos), Bo He (Menthae herba) and Bai Zhi (Angelicae dahuricae radix) to open the nasal orifices. • Hoarseness and irritation in the throat: use Chan Tui (Cicadae periostracum) and Ma Bo (Lasiosphaera) to expel wind-heat in the throat. • Cough: use Gua Lou Pi (Trichosanthis pericarpium), Tian Zhu Huang (Bambusae concretio silicea), Zhe Bei Mu (Fritillariae thunbergii bulbus) and Sang Bai Pi (Mori cortex) to clear heat, remove phlegm-heat and stop cough. • Poor appetite, nausea and vomiting: use Pi Pa Ye (Eriobotryae folium) and Zhu Ru (Bambusae caulis in taeniam) to soothe the Stomach-Qi, transform phlegm-heat from the Stomach and improve appetite. • Thirst: add Ge Gen (Puerariae radix), Lu Gen (Phragmitis rhizoma) and Tian Hua Fen (Trichosanthis radix) to generate body fluids. • Dark and scanty urine: add Dan Zhu Ye (Lophatheri herba) or Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) to reduce heat and promote urination. • Constipation: add Da Huang (Rhei rhizoma), Zhi Shi (Aurantii fructus immaturus) and Zhi Mu (Anemarrhenae rhizoma) to promote bowel movement. • Sores and carbuncles due to excess heat-toxin: add Da Qing Ye (Isatidis folium), Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix), Sheng Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix), Pu Gong Ying (Taraxaci herba) and Zi Hua Di Ding (Violae herba) to reduce the heat-toxin. Analysis of the formula This formula is able to expel wind and clear heat, disperse Lung-Qi and relieve cough. It is used at the initial stage of a wind-heat syndrome when the Lung is attacked by wind-heat and the Lung-Qi fails to disperse and descend. The symptoms are cough, mild fever and a slight aversion to wind and cold. Patients may feel slightly thirsty, and have a thin, white or slightly yellowish tongue coating and a superficial and slightly rapid pulse. In this formula: • Sang Ye and Ju Hua are used as chief; they directly and gently disperse the wind from the Lung and clear the heat there. • Bo He, as one of the deputies, has a strong dispersing ability that enhances the dispersing action of the chief. Lian Qiao is another deputy. It can clear heat and disperse heat in the Upper- Jiao, thus enhancing the action of the chief to clear heat. • Jie Geng and Xing Ren, another two deputies, can disperse and descend the Lung-Qi respectively, thus enhancing the ability of the chief. They can also stop cough and transform phlegm. • Lu Gen serves as assistant; it nourishes the fluids of the Lung and relieves thirst. Gan Cao is another assistant; it can reduce heat-toxin and swelling of the throat. When it is used with Jie Geng, the function of reducing pain and swelling becomes stronger.

Commentary on strategies This formula is very gentle, which means gentle in weight, in dosage and in action. • The herbs gently disperse the Qi of the Lung, gently expel wind and slightly clear heat, and work subtly to restore the function of the Lung and stop cough. It represents the treatment principle of Dr Wu Ju Tong who devised this formula: ‘To treat the disorder of the Lung in the Upper-Jiao is just like holding a piece of feather in the air and only a light blow can keep it steady in the air.’ This formula is only used at a mild or initial stage of a wind- heat syndrome when the pathogenic wind-heat affects the Lung rather than the superficial region. • Another characteristic of this formula is clearing heat in the Liver. Because wind and Liver are closely related, dispersing the Liver-Qi can assist in dispersing the wind-heat in the Lung. Ju Hua and Bo He are used in the formula for this purpose. • Most of the herbs in the formula can disperse and descend the Lung-Qi, thus restoring the proper function of the Lung. • In this formula, the dispersing action is stronger than the descending action; the principal function of this formula is obviously to disperse the wind-heat. Yin Qiao San (Honeysuckle and Forsythia Powder) Source: Wen Bing Tiao Bian Analysis of the formula This formula is devised for expelling wind-heat and clearing heat-toxin. It is used for treating wind-heat syndrome where the pathogenic wind and heat are located in both the Lung and the superficial region of the body. The manifestations are fever, irregular sweating, a slight aversion to wind and cold, head- ache, thirst, cough and sore throat. A red tip of the tongue, a thin and white, or thin and yellow tongue coating, and a superficial and rapid pulse indicate the nature and location of the pathogenic factors. In this formula: • Jin Yin Hua and Lian Qiao are used as chief. They are aromatic and cold in nature. They can directly expel wind and clear heat. Their clearing action is stronger than their dispersing action. • There are three groups of deputy herbs: – Bo He, with its strong dispersing ability, is used to increase the action of the chief in dispersing wind-heat. – Niu Bang Zi can assist the chief to reduce heat-toxin and swelling and to benefit the throat. – Jing Jie and Dan Dou Chi are warm in temperature, can open the pores and stimulate the Qi in the superficial region in order to eliminate the wind and release the exterior. They also serve as corrective assistants to prevent the cold herbs blocking the Yang and Qi movement in the process of expelling the pathogenic factors. They are used in small dosages to avoid changing the principal temperature of the formula. • There are two groups of assistants: – Jie Geng and Gan Cao can reduce swelling caused by heat-toxin to treat a sore throat. – Zhu Ye and Lu Gen are able to clear heat and relieve thirst. Lu Gen can generate the fluids that have been injured by the heat. It also serves as corrective assistant to prevent heat continuously injuring the body fluids. Commentary on strategies This is a very effective and commonly used formula. Its function of reducing heat and heat-toxin is stronger than that of Sang Ju Yin (Mulberry Leaf and Chrysanthemum Decoction), yet it is weaker in regulating the Lung-Qi. This formula, devised by Dr Wu Ju Tong, treats a common case of wind-heat syndrome. Jin Yin Hua (Lonicerae flos) 9 g Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus) 9 g Jie Geng (Platycodi radix) 6 g Bo He (Menthae herba) 6 g Zhu Ye (Bambusae folium) 4 g Niu Bang Zi (Arctii fructus) 9 g Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) 5 g Jing Jie (Schizonepetae herba) 5 g Dan Dou Chi (Sojae semen praeparatum) 5 g All herbs are cooked with Lu Gen (Phragmitis rhizoma). 53 Exterior syndrome and formula compositionChapter Analysis of the formula This formula is able to disperse and clear heat in the Lung, regulate the Lung-Qi and relieve wheezing. It is used when exterior wind-cold invades the super- ficial region, the Lung-Qi is obstructed and intense heat is generated. The heat strongly disturbs the dispersing and descending function of the Lung. The main manifestations are high fever, an aversion to wind, chills, thirst, a stifling sensation in the chest, shortness of breath and cough. Patients have a thin white or yellow tongue coating and a slippery and rapid pulse. In this formula: • Ma Huang and Shi Gao are used in combination as the chief substances: – Ma Huang is very warm and very pungent, and enters the Lung meridian. It can quickly and efficiently disperse the Lung-Qi and the restrained heat in the Lung. It enters the Bladder meridian and can eliminate the exterior pathogenic wind-cold as well. – Shi Gao is pungent, sweet and cold, and enters the Lung meridian. It can powerfully clear heat in the Lung, descend the Lung-Qi and relieve wheezing. These two substances can effectively regulate the Lung-Qi. The ratio of Ma Huang to Shi Gao is about 1 : 4, thus the principal temperature of the formula is cold and it treats a wind-heat syndrome. • Xing Ren is used as assistant. It is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Lung meridian. It can disperse and descend the Lung-Qi and help the chief. As it enhances the function of Ma Huang, Ma Huang can be used in a lower dosage as it is, after all, a strong herb. • Zhi Gan Cao also serves as assistant. On the one hand, it can protect the Stomach against the side effects of Shi Gao, which is heavy and very cold; on the other hand, it can also be used with Shi Gao to effectively generate the Yin and fluid of the Lung. Commentary on strategies There are several strategies shown in the formula. • The combination of Ma Huang and Shi Gao gives a good example of using warm and cold substances together. Here a pungent herb and a heavy mineral are used together to regulate the Lung-Qi and clear heat. It also suggests that, no matter how high the fever is, if there is chill without sweating, the exterior syndrome is still in existence and herbs that open the pores and disperse the wind and cold should be used as well. • The arrangement of dosages of Ma Huang and Shi Gao shows another characteristic of the formula. The ratio of Ma Huang to Shi Gao is about 1 : 4. Yet the dosages can be changed according to the symptoms. If the fever is high, which suggests that heat is predominant, the ratio can be 1 : 5, and a larger dosage of Shi Gao can clear heat effectively. If there is no sweating, which suggests that the pores are closed tightly, the ratio can be changed to 1 : 3; a larger dosage of Ma Huang can effectively open the pores. • The combination of the bitter Xing Ren and pungent Ma Huang can effectively and safely regulate the Lung-Qi, and the combination of sweet Gan Cao and cold Shi Gao can nourish the Yin. Ma Huang (Ephedrae herba)* 5 g Shi Gao (Gypsum) 18 g Xing Ren (Armeniacae semen) 9 g Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) 6 g • The method used in this formula is to apply a small amount of warm herbs in a large number of cold herbs to stimulate the Qi, open the pores, expel wind and, in this way, release the exterior. • In the preparation of this formula, note that the herbs should not be cooked for a long time. As soon as the aromatic smell emerges, the formula is ready to use. To treat a disorder of the Upper-Jiao, the aromatically dispersing action is essential.

CHAPTER OUTLINE This chapter introduces the principles, methods and strategies for the composition of formulas that stimulate the intestines, promote bowel movement in order to purge accumulation, eliminate toxic substances, drain fire and cold of the body and drive out congested water . They are used to treat excess conditions and interior syndromes . These methods and strategies relieve the symptoms rather than treat the cause . However, they can stop further pathological changes caused by the accumulations . Although accumulations can result from several pathogenic factors, such as food, phlegm, water and blood, in this chapter only accumulation of the intestines and accumulation of water are discussed . Accumulations of food, phlegm and blood are discussed in other chapters .

## Accumulation syndrome and


Constipation is a sign of accumulation of feces in the Large Intestine. It is often caused by insufficient fluid in the Large Intestine or obstruction of the Qi. It also occurs when the Qi, blood and Yang are deficient, and the Qi in the intestines is too weak to move the feces. Constipation can be divided into different degrees. Severe cases can occur in a febrile disease, obstruction of the intestines or after wind- stroke. The pathological consequences can be severe. Mild cases often occur in habitual constipation or are caused by improper dietary habits, change of diet or by using certain medicines. It also occurs when Yin, Yang, Qi and blood in the body are weak. This often happens in elderly people, people with chronic diseases and after surgery, as well as in women after delivering a baby. Obstruction of the intestines, intestinal adhesions and intussusception are acute abdominal syndromes and they have severe pathological consequences. They cause accumulation of feces, Qi, blood, heat and fire-toxin in the intestines. As well as regular western medical treatment, certain intestinal ad- hesions, intussusception and the primary stage of simple or partial intestinal obstruction can be treated with Chinese herbal medicine. Fire-toxin, as a pathological product as well as a pathogenic factor, can accumulate in the intestines. Fire-toxin should be eliminated as soon as possible, especially before long-term accumulation and when the blood is not strongly disturbed, in order to prevent further development of disease, such as in chronic mild infections of the intestines, or at the primary stage of acute appendicitis, acute pancrea- titis, acute cholecystitis, hepatitis and ulcer perfora- tion and inflammation. The action of downward-draining herbs can move the bowels, thus eliminating toxins from the body when Liver and Kidney functions are impaired and they fail to remove toxic substances, such as in cirrhosis of the Liver and renal failure. If a toxic substance has been ingested, the action of downward-draining herbs can assist the body in eliminating it. When water metabolism is disturbed, water can accumulate in certain places, such as the hydrotho- rax and ascites, which can obstruct the Qi. In acute and excess conditions, they should be drained down- wards by herbs with a cathartic effect in order to relieve symptoms.


CAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS 1. protect the Stomach and body fluids: to treat severe accumulation, the purgative herbs in the formula are strong and their speed is fast, thus they easily injure Stomach-Qi and body fluids. Compared with other moist laxatives, these herbs should only be used for a short period and their dosage should be controlled carefully. Long-term usage of purgatives for constipation may lead to consumption of the body fluids in the intestines and make constipation worse. as soon as the purgative action takes effect and the symptoms are less severe, the formula should be discontinued. 2. Use only in excess conditions: Since the actions of the strong purgative formula are harsh, they are only used for excess syndromes and for people with a strong constitution. For patients who suffer from deficiency syndromes but who also need these herbs in the treatment of acute or severe accumulation, such as in weak, elderly people and people with a chronic disease, tonifying herbs must be used as well. 3. avoid usage in menstruation, bleeding conditions and in pregnancy: Formulas that strongly drain downward can also drain Qi as well as blood downward, so they are not suitable for use during heavy menstruation or in bleeding conditions. they should not be used in pregnancy. 4. Unsuitable in exterior syndrome: Formulas that drain downwards are, in principle, not suitable for patients who have an exterior syndrome. It is better to treat the exterior syndrome first and not to drain downwards, otherwise it can lead to the exogenous factors entering into a deeper region of the body. 5. Caution in special cases: When downward-draining formulas are used to treat acute abdominal syndromes, such as acute intestinal obstruction, appendicitis, cholecystitis and pancreatitis, it is also important to remember that these herbs are only suitable for certain periods in the whole pathological process of the disease, or certain types of disorder. these formulas should only be prescribed by doctors after modern medical examination. If herbal treatment does not result in relief 57 Accumulation syndrome and formula compositionChapter of symptoms, western medical treatment is usually indicated. 6. appropriate diet: During treatment, patients should take care of their diet. Soft, warm, light and easily digested food is recommended. pain in the abdomen. The conditions of the heat and body fluids are shown in the degree of constipation. In severe cases: • the heat is so strong that the patient may have profuse sweating, thirst and fever • if heat disturbs the mind, patients may be irritable and speech may be delirious • the tongue coating is very dry and the color of the coating changes from yellow to brown, indicating increasing heat. A deep-red tongue with red spots also indicates heat. A thick tongue coating and a forceful and slippery pulse are signs of the accumulation. In a moderate case of constipation: • the feces are dry or are difficult to defecate, and bowel movement occurs only once every 2 or days. The primary cause is dryness in the intestines with heat and Qi stagnation. This is usually caused by reluctance to go to the toilet, and this develops habitual constipation, such as is seen in primary school pupils and adults with a busy life. It can be seen in people with a Yang type of constitution, or people who eat lots of fried or spicy food that produces heat. People who take too little physical exercise may have Qi stagnation that leads to constipation. Furthermore, deficiency of Qi, blood, Yin and Yang may lead to Qi stagnation and dryness in the intestines. In this case, although feces are not very dry, bowel movement is very slow and difficult. (See Figure 2.1 on page 69.) Treatment principle: Drain the heat in the Large Intestine and move the stool; promote Qi movement and nourish the body fluids Main symptoms in a severe case Severe constipation, dry stool (sometimes a foul-smelling fluid is excreted instead of stool), flatulence, bowel movement once in several days, severe focal abdominal pain increased on pressure, a tense and firm abdomen. There may be tidal fever, delirious speech and profuse sweating. Tongue Red or deep-red with a yellow or brown, dry, thick coating. Pulse Rapid, deep, forceful. Main symptoms in a moderate case Constipation or habitual constipation, dry stool, irregular bowel movement, distending pain of the abdomen. Tongue Slightly red or deep-red with a sticky, white or yellow coating. Pulse Wiry, slippery. Secondary symptoms Fullness in the chest and epigastria, thirst, reduced appetite and irritability.

## to excess heat in the intestine

Associated disorders in western medicine Constipation, habitual constipation, uremia, acute intestinal obstruction, acute abdominal conditions. Analysis of the syndrome This syndrome is caused by accumulation in the intestines. The accumulation generates heat and this further injures the fluid of the intestines and makes the accumulation worse. The Qi is obstructed by the accumulation, which causes fullness, distension and


In a severe condition, promoting bowel movement is a quick and effective way to purge accumulation, drain the heat, protect the fluid in the intestines and relieve pain and distension due to Qi stagnation. In a moderate case of constipation or in a case of chronic habitual constipation, moistening the intestines, increasing the fluid and activating the Qi are more important than clearing heat and purging the stagnation. 58


mulations in the intestines than baked Da Huang. Raw Da Huang should not be cooked for too long, otherwise the purgative action becomes weaker. Mang Xiao (Natrii sulfas) Mang Xiao is another commonly used purgative substance. It is salty and cold, can moisten the intes- tines, soften the feces and therefore promote bowel movement. It is particularly suitable for constipation when the feces are very dry. The main constituent of Mang Xiao is sodium sulfate. As the intestines cannot absorb sulfate, it stays in the intestines and increases osmotic pressure to accumulate water in the intestines, stimulate them and soften the feces. Several products of Mang Xiao can be selected. The commonly used version is called Mang Xiao. Another version, called Pu Xiao, contains salt, calcium sulfate and magnesium sulfate as well as sodium sulfate. Its ability to promote bowel move- ment is stronger. Da Huang and Mang Xiao are often used together to treat constipation and excess heat in the intes- tines. Because Da Huang can purge the bowels and Mang Xiao can soften the feces, their therapeutic actions are accentuated. Lu Hui (aloe folii extractus) Lu Hui is very bitter and cold, and enters the Liver, Heart, Stomach and Large Intestine meridians. It is a very strong herb to purge the bowels and reduce excess heat. It directly drains Liver-fire and Heart- fire. It is selected when the heat of Heart and Liver affects the Stomach and Large Intestine. Fan Xie Ye (Sennae folium) Fan Xie Ye is sweet, bitter and cold, and enters the Large Intestine meridian. It has a moistening nature and is able to moisten dryness in the intestines, clear heat and promote bowel movement. Its function of moving the bowels is stronger than that of Da Huang. If a small dosage of Fan Xie Ye is applied, it can also promote digestion and is used for consti- pation caused by improper diet. Huo Ma Ren (Cannabis semen) and Yu Li Ren (pruni semen) These two types of seed contain oils and can moisten the intestines. In addition, they have a descending Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Stimulate the intestines and purge the stool in a severe case; moisten the intestines and promote bowel movement in a moderate case Da Huang (rhei rhizoma) Da Huang is a very bitter and cold herb. As it purges the intestines intensively, it can strongly drain heat and move the stool. It is the most important herb to treat excess heat accumulation in the intestines. Da Huang can be prescribed as chief in a formula in a severe case. Da Huang is a very good purgative agent com- pared with such agents in western medicine. It stimulates the intestines and purges the bowels without severe cramp. The purgative effect appears 6–8 hours after oral consumption of this herb; as an enema, it has a much quicker onset of action. Da Huang can be used raw or processed. Raw Da Huang has a stronger function of purging the accu- 59 Accumulation syndrome and formula compositionChapter ability and can promote Qi movement. Thus they are often selected in formulas to treat mild or chronic constipation. They are often used for habit- ual constipation. Huo Ma Ren is a sweet and neutral herb, and it can either promote bowel movement or tonify the Qi and blood. It is particularly suitable for treat- ing constipation after surgical operations or deliv- ery of a baby, and in patients who suffer from chronic diseases or have a weak constitution. It can also be used to treat hemorrhoids and habitual constipation. Yu Li Ren is pungent, bitter, sweet and neutral, and enters the Spleen, Small Intestine and Large Intestine meridians. It is moist in nature and has a descending tendency of action. It is able to descend the Qi, promote bowel movement and urination and is usually used in excess syndromes. These two herbs are often used together to treat chronic constipation as this accentuates their thera- peutic actions. Deputy: Nourish the Yin and moisten the Stomach and Large Intestine Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix), Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix) and Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix) These herbs are cold in temperature and all three can nourish the Yin and clear heat in the intestines. As such, they are often used as deputies in a formula to treat constipation due to dryness and heat in the intestines. They can be used together or separately according to the degree of dryness and heat in the Large Intestine. Zhi Shi (aurantii fructus immaturus) and Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex) These two herbs are often used as assistants to promote Qi movement and descend the Qi in the Large Intestine so as to assist the chief herb to move the stool. Zhi Shi is bitter and cold, and can strongly direct the Qi downwards in the Large Intestine. It is an important herb to break up the stasis of Qi, phlegm and food. Hou Po is bitter and warm, and can effectively descend the Qi in the Lung, Stomach and intestines to reduce fullness, dry dampness and eliminate phlegm. These two herbs are often used together to treat severe cases and chronic moderate cases of consti- pation as this can accentuate their therapeutic actions. Bing Lang (arecae semen), Mu Xiang (aucklandiae radix)**, Lai Fu Zi (raphani semen) and Gua Lou Ren (trichosanthis semen) These four herbs all enter the Large Intestine merid- ian. In formulas for promoting bowel movement, they can effectively promote Qi movement so as to assist the purgative function of the chief herbs. They can be selected separately or in groups. Bing Lang is pungent, bitter and warm, and is good at promoting Qi movement and reducing the accumulation of food. It is only used in severe dis- tension of the abdomen due to accumulation of food and dampness. Mu Xiang is aromatic, pungent, bitter and warm, and has a drying nature. It can effectively move the Qi and reduce pain due to Qi stagnation. As it also enters the Liver meridian, it is particularly suitable for use in conditions where the Liver-Qi attacks the Spleen, Stomach and Large Intestine. Lai Fu Zi is pungent, sweet and neutral, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. Its func- tion in the formula is to promote digestion and reduce fullness. Gua Lou Ren is sweet and cold, and enters the Lung, Stomach and Large Intestine meridians. As a seed, it can directly moisten the intestines and move the stool. Since it enters the Lung meridian, it can eliminate phlegm and descend the Qi, which can accelerate the downward movement of the Qi in the intestines and promote bowel movement. It is usually used in cases of chronic constipation. Xing Ren is a seed and has the function of mois- tening the Large Intestine and promoting bowel movement. It enters the Lung meridian, which is externally/internally related to the Large Intestine meridian, and is used especially to treat disturbance of the dispersing and descending function of the Lung-Qi that influences the intestines and causes constipation. It can also be used as a strategic assist- ant to disperse the Lung-Qi so as to activate the Qi in the intestines. Jie Geng is a strategic assistant in the formula. As it enters the Lung meridian and has an ascending property, it ascends the Qi in the Lung in order to accelerate the Qi descending in the Large Intestine. 60


In this way, it assists herbs that purge and drain downwards and herbs that descend Qi in the intestines. For applying this strategy, Jie Geng should be used in small dosage. Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus) and Shi Gao (Gypsum) In the condition of constipation due to excess heat in the intestines, it is important to reduce the heat without delay because heat consumes fluid in the intestines and leads to constipation. Lian Qiao is aromatic, bitter and cold, and has a dispersing and opening-up ability. It can dis- perse and clear heat from accumulation in the intestines. Shi Gao is pungent, sweet and cold. It can effectively clear heat from Yang Ming meridians. As it is sweet and cold, and can generate the body fluids, it is particularly suitable for conditions where the body fluids are being constantly injured by heat. Huang Jing (polygonati rhizoma), Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix) and Rou Cong Rong (Cistanchis herba)** These herbs can tonify the Qi, blood and Yang respectively. They are all moist in nature. They can be applied in chronic constipation that is caused by deficiency of Qi, blood and Yang respectively. Assistant and envoy: Protect the Stomach and Spleen, and moderate the function of the purging herbs Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) and Feng Mi (Mel) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and enters the Spleen merid- ian. In formulas that drain downwards, it is often used as corrective assistant and envoy to protect the Stomach from harsh herbs such as Da Huang and Lu Hui. It can also moderate the function of the herbs in the formulas and make the purgative action lasting and stable. Feng Mi has a similar function to Zhi Gan Cao in protecting the Spleen and Stomach and in moderating the speed of harsh herbs. Furthermore, it is moistening in nature, can tonify the Spleen, moisten the intestines and promote bowel movement. Examples of classical formulas Da Cheng Qi Tang (Major Order the Qi Decoction) Source: Shang Han Lun Da Huang (Rhei rhizoma) 12 g Mang Xiao (Natrii sulfas) 9 g Zhi Shi (Aurantii fructus immaturus) 12 g Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex) 15 g Analysis of the formula This formula is able to vigorously purge heat accu- mulation and promote bowel movement. It is used in a condition of severe obstruction of feces, Qi, blood and fire-toxin in the abdomen. The manifest- ations are severe constipation, distension, pain and fullness of the abdomen, which are increased by pressure. It also treats a condition of severe consti- pation where dry feces have accumulated in the intestines and a foul-smelling fluid is excreted instead of stool. The patient has a red tongue with a dry, thick, yellow coating and a wiry or tight, and rapid pulse. In this formula: • The chief herb is Da Huang. It is bitter and cold, can vigorously stimulate the intestines, purge the heat accumulation and move the stool. With the salty and cold Mang Xiao as deputy, which can increase the fluid of the intestines and soften the stool, the function of purging the stool is increased. • Zhi Shi and Hou Po serve as assistants. They can activate the Qi movement in the intestines and the Lung so as to accelerate the purgative function of the chief and deputy herbs. They can also directly reduce the fullness of the abdomen. When the four herbs are used together, the heat accumulation is removed and the Stomach-Qi can descend properly. This function is described in the name of the formula, a formula that vigorously orders the (Large Intestine) Qi. 61 Accumulation syndrome and formula compositionChapter Commentary on strategies There are several strategies shown in the formula. • Da Huang is used as chief in a reasonably large dosage. It is added at the last moment when the decoction is prepared, and therefore its purgative action is intensive and strong. • One side effect of the purgative action of Da Huang is cramp of the abdomen. Herbs that soften the stool and activate the Qi movement in the intestines can reduce this unpleasant sensation. In this way, the dosage of Da Huang can also be reduced. • The four herbs in the formula all work on promoting bowel movement; however, they work via different approaches and enhance each others’ effects. Although it is a small formula, its action is very strong and effective. The following strategies are employed when using this formula: • If a bowel movement occurs, this formula should not be used again. • If the purgative effect has not appeared after 6–8 hours, the same formula should be given again. If there is still no reaction, another dose should be given in a shorter time interval. • If the patient has a bowel movement, but the accumulation is not completely eliminated, Xiao Cheng Qi Tang (Minor Order the Qi Decoction) – a formula with a milder function of purging the accumulation – should be applied instead of this strong formula. Xiao Cheng Qi Tang (Minor Order the Qi Decoction) Source: Shang Han Lun lated heat and move the bowel. It is used for treat- ing a moderate obstruction of heat and Qi in the Large Intestine, or in a condition after using Da Cheng Qi Tang (Major Order the Qi Decoction) if the accumulation has not been eliminated com- pletely. The symptoms and signs are moderate com- pared to those of Da Cheng Qi Tang. Patients may suffer from tidal fever, constipation and abdominal fullness and pain, which are not increased by pres- sure. The tongue is red with a yellow, dry coating and the pulse is slippery and rapid. Comparing this formula with Da Cheng Qi Tang, Mang Xiao is not used as the dryness in the Large Intestine is not as severe. The dosages of Zhi Shi and Hou Po are also reduced as the Qi obstruction is less severe than that in the former case. As the three herbs are cooked together, the purgative action is more gentle than that of the former formula. The change of combination, the change of dosage and the preparation method show that the strategies take account of the condition of the individual at that moment as well as the pathological change of the disorder.

In addition, the constipa- tion is not as severe as in the syndrome of Da Cheng Qi Tang, and the fullness due to the stagnation of Qi is less. Patients suffer from constipation, fullness of the abdomen and poor appetite. At the same time, they may have thirst, fever and irritation. The tongue coating is sticky and yellow and the pulse is slippery and rapid. 62


Comparing this formula with Da Cheng Qi Tang, Da Huang and Mang Xiao are used in large dosages, but Da Huang is cooked together with the other herbs. Zhi Gan Cao is used as an assistant instead of Zhi Shi and Hou Po because, in this case, the obstruction of the Qi in the Upper- and Middle-Jiao is less severe but the function of the Stomach is weak. Zhi Gan Cao can tonify the Qi in the Middle- Jiao and protect the Stomach from the harsh purga- tives. At the same time, it can also moderate the harsh action of Da Huang and make the function of Da Huang work more smoothly and for longer. It is particularly suitable for use in accumulation in the intestines in a condition of a weakened Stomach. It is also suitable for treating constipation with weak- ened Stomach-Qi after several doses of vigorous purgatives. Huang Long Tang (Yellow Dragon Decoction) Source: Shang Han Liu Shu Decoction). However, they are in smaller dosages and Da Huang is cooked together with the other herbs, thereby reducing its harsh purgative action. • Ren Shen and Gan Cao are used to tonify the Qi, and Dang Gui and Da Zao to tonify the blood. They are used as deputies in the formula. • Gan Cao, Sheng Jiang and Da Zao are also used as assistants to protect the Stomach and Spleen from the purgative herbs. • Jie Geng is used as strategic assistant with a low dosage. It can ascend the Lung-Qi in order to accelerate the Qi descending in the Stomach and Large Intestine. Commentary on strategies This formula demonstrates a principle for treating a complicated case. • When Qi and blood are too weak to activate Qi movement in the intestines in order to move the stool, it is better to use some tonifying herbs to assist the purgative herbs. Otherwise, not only may the accumulation of heat and stool increase rapidly in the intestines, but these pathogenic products may also further injure the Qi and blood. • The second interesting strategy in this formula is the use of Jie Geng to open up the Lung-Qi in order to accelerate the Qi descending in the Large Intestine as the Lung and the Large Intestine are related. The combination of these strategies results in an effective therapeutic outcome in the treatment of this severe and complicated condition.

Analysis of the formula This formula is able to drain heat, promote bowel movement and tonify Qi and blood. It is used to treat deficiency of Qi and blood with severe consti- pation due to excess heat in the Large Intestine. The weakness shows in the weak pulse, fatigue and shortness of breath. In this formula: • The first four herbs are the same as in Da Cheng Qi Tang (Major Order the Qi Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix) 30 g Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) 25 g Sheng Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix) 25 g Da Huang (Rhei rhizoma) 9 g Mang Xiao (Natrii sulfas) 5 g 63 Accumulation syndrome and formula compositionChapter Analysis of the formula This formula is able to nourish the Yin, increase the fluid in the Large Intestine, clear the heat there and promote bowel movement. It is used to treat constipation where the fluid in the intestines is extensively consumed by excess heat. It is particu- larly useful for chronic conditions or after febrile diseases. Commentary on strategies In this formula, two groups of herbs are selected to treat two aspects of the syndrome – Yin deficiency and constipation. Furthermore, the side effects of the purgative herbs have to be considered as the Yin and fluid in the intestines may be further injured and constipation can get worse. • In the first group, a large dosage of salty and cold Xuan Shen is used to nourish the Yin, increase the fluid, clear heat in the Large Intestine and soften the feces. The large dosages of Mai Men Dong and Sheng Di Huang directly nourish the Yin, clear the heat and enhance the ability of Xuan Shen. • In the second group, Da Huang and Mang Xiao are used to purge the intestines and soften the stool, respectively. They directly treat constipation. When these two groups are used together, the purgative effect is achieved without injuring the fluid in the intestines. Ma Zi Ren Wan (Hemp Seed Pill) Source: Shang Han Lun Analysis of the formula This formula is able to moisten the intestines, drain the heat, promote the Qi movement and move the bowels. It is used for treating constipation due to dryness in the intestines. Patients may suffer from chronic habitual constipation with hard feces that are difficult to defecate, frequent urination, a dry, yellow tongue coating and a deep and rapid pulse. In this formula: • Huo Ma Ren serves as chief to moisten the intestines and promote bowel movement. • The deputies, Xing Ren, Bai Shao Yao and Da Huang, descend the Qi, nourish the Yin and purge the intestines respectively. They help the chief to promote bowel movement using different approaches. • Zhi Shi and Hou Po can activate the Qi movement in the Large Intestine and are used as assistants to promote bowel movement. • Feng Mi (honey) is used as assistant. On the one hand, it can directly moisten the Large Intestine and promote bowel movement; on the other hand, it moderates the function of the other herbs and makes the action of stimulating the Large Intestine smoother and last longer. Moreover, it can tonify the Qi of the Middle- Jiao and protect the Spleen and Stomach from injury by purgative herbs. Lastly, it is sweet and viscous, can moderate the tastes of the herbal ingredients and is used as a medium to make pills. Commentary on strategies • The strategy of the formula composition is to use seeds, honey and Yin-nourishing herbs to moderate the function of the purgative and Qi-activating herbs. • Pill is a form of administration to slow down the speed of the action of the herbs and patients will therefore not develop any unpleasant sensations in the abdomen. This form of administration is well suited to treating conditions of chronic constipation.

Associated disorders in western medicine Food poisoning, constipation, gastric and duodenal ulcer, uremia and acute intestinal obstruction. Analysis of the syndrome This syndrome is caused by accumulation of internal cold together with undigested food. It occurs after indulgence in cold food and drinks, which obstruct the Qi of the Stomach and Spleen. It may exist when the Spleen-Yang is deficient; internal cold is thus generated and disturbs the function of the intestines. • Cold is a Yin pathogenic factor. It has a contracting nature and can easily injure the Yang. When internal cold accumulates in the intestines, the Yang fails to spread warmth and Qi and is unable to transform and transport food, resulting in Qi stagnation. All of these cause constipation, abdominal pain, distension and fullness, reduced appetite, cold limbs and tiredness. • The symptoms described above can be reduced by warmth and this indicates the presence of cold. • A white, sticky tongue coating and a deep, wiry, tight pulse also indicate the existence of cold accumulation. Main symptoms Constipation, abdominal pain and fullness that can be reduced by warmth. Secondary symptoms Cold hands and feet, fullness in the hypochondria and epigastrium, reduced appetite and tiredness. Tongue White, sticky coating. Pulse Deep, wiry and tight. Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Warm the interior and expel the cold Fu Zi (aconiti radix lateralis preparata)* and Xi Xin (asari herba)* Fu Zi and Xi Xin are very hot and pungent. They can stimulate the Yang, intensively warm the inter- ior, disperse cold, accelerate Qi movement in the intestines and alleviate pain. They are often used as chief in the formula to treat internal cold syndrome. Since they are poisonous, they should be used with caution. Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma) Gan Jiang is warm and pungent, and particularly enters the Spleen meridian. It is often used to warm Spleen-Yang to expel the cold in the Middle-Jiao directly, thus accelerating Qi movement in the intestines and alleviating pain. It is particularly used as chief in the formula to treat cold in the Middle-Jiao.

Treatment principle: Warm the Yang and expel cold; promote bowel movement and alleviate pain 65 Accumulation syndrome and formula compositionChapter Deputy: Stimulate the Large Intestine and purge the stool Da Huang (rhei rhizoma) Da Huang is very bitter and cold. It stimulates the intestines intensively and can therefore purge stool. In the formula to treat accumulation in the intestines caused by internal cold, this herb can be used with hot herbs, thus reducing and minimizing the cold nature of Da Huang while still utilizing its function. Ba Dou (Crotonis fructus)* Ba Dou is very hot and poisonous, and enters the Stomach and Large Intestine meridians. It can inten- sively purge the cold accumulation in the intestines and treat constipation. Because of its toxicity and strong purgative action, it is rarely used in clinical practice as a raw herb. The processed products of Ba Dou are occasionally used in formulas to warm the Middle-Jiao, promote digestion and purge the accumulation in the intestines as its purgative and toxic effects are reduced by processing. Assistant: Tonify the weakness and protect the Stomach Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) Ren Shen is slightly warm and sweet. It can inten- sively tonify the Qi in general and improve the body condition. It is used in a syndrome of cold accumu- lation when the Qi is too weak to stimulate the intestines or the Qi is weakened by frequent use of purgative herbs. Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and primarily enters the Spleen meridian. It is able to tonify Spleen-Qi. The more important function of this herb, used as assist- ant in the formula, is to protect the Stomach from the harsh herbs as well as to smooth and moderate their function. Ban Xia (pinelliae rhizoma) and Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) Ban Xia and Sheng Jiang are both pungent and warm, and enter the Stomach meridian. They can soothe the Stomach-Qi and eliminate the accumula- tion of water and phlegm in the Stomach. They relieve nausea and vomiting and improve appetite. All these symptoms are often seen in the syndrome of internal cold in the Middle-Jiao. Analysis of the formula This formula is able to warm the Yang and disperse the cold, promote bowel movement and reduce the accumulation. It is used for treating cold accumula- tion with undigested food in the intestines. Patients suffer from constipation, abdominal pain and hypo- chondriac pain, have cold extremities, a white, sticky tongue coating and a wiry, tight pulse. In this formula: • The bitter and cold Da Huang and the pungent and hot Fu Zi are used together as chief. Da Huang is used for stimulating the intestines, moving the stool and eliminating the accumulation; Fu Zi is used for warming the Lower- and Middle-Jiao to disperse the cold. • Xi Xin is used as assistant. It can warm the interior, open up the obstruction of cold and alleviate pain. It enhances the function of Fu Zi. • In this formula the combined dosages of Fu Zi and Xi Xin are larger than that of Da Huang. They can thus reduce the cold nature of Da Huang but retain its purgative function. Commentary on strategies There are only three herbs in the formula, but it has a clear structure and strong function. • The hot and cold herbs used together can effectively warm the Yang and promote bowel movement. • The pungent, bitter, warm and cold natures of the herbs used together can disperse and descend the Qi in the intestines. Da Huang (Rhei rhizoma) 9 g Fu Zi (Aconiti radix lateralis preparata)* 9 g Xi Xin (Asari herba)* 3 g Examples of classical formulas Da Huang Fu Zi Tang (Rhubarb and Prepared Aconite Decoction) Source: Jin Kui Yao Lue 66


Analysis of the formula This formula is able to warm and strengthen the Spleen-Yang and purge the cold accumulation. It is used for treating cold and dampness accumulation, which injures the blood. Patients suffer from con- stipation, dysenteric disorders with blood and mucus, and abdominal pain. Cold extremities and a deep and wiry pulse indicate the existence of cold. In this formula: • Da Huang and Fu Zi are used as chief for removing the accumulation and warming the interior. • Gan Jiang serves as deputy; it enhances the function of Fu Zi to warm the Middle-Jiao, the Spleen and the Stomach directly. • Another deputy is Ren Shen; it can tonify the Qi and strengthen the Spleen. • Gan Cao is used as assistant to tonify the Middle-Jiao and to protect the Stomach from the harsh herbs. It is also used as envoy to harmonize the herbs in this formula. Commentary on strategies Some strategies shown in this formula are compared to Da Huang Fu Zi Tang (Rhubarb and Prepared Aconite Decoction). • In this formula, the dosage of Da Huang is increased and that of Fu Zi decreased. The tonifying and warming herbs Gan Jiang, Ren Shen and Gan Cao are used instead of the pungent and hot Xi Xin. • This combination indicates that the purging action is based on a warming and tonifying action. The alterations of herbs in this formula are particularly necessary in chronic and recurrent disorders of cold accumulation in the Middle-Jiao with Spleen-Yang deficiency.

## accumulation

Da Huang (Rhei rhizoma) 12 g Fu Zi (Aconiti radix lateralis preparata)* 9 g Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma) 6 g Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 9 g Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) 3 g Main symptoms Difficult urination and defecation. Secondary symptoms Stifling sensation in the chest, shortness of breath and distension in the abdomen. Tongue White, moist coating. Pulse Tight, wiry and deep. Associated disorders in western medicine Generalized edema, hydrothorax and ascites. Analysis of the syndrome This syndrome is caused by accumulation of water in the chest and abdomen. As the accumulation obstructs the Qi in the San Jiao water passage, patients suffer from edema and difficult urination. • If water accumulates in the chest, patients may feel tightness in the chest and shortness of breath. • If water accumulates in the abdomen, patients may feel distension in the abdomen. • The white moist tongue coating indicates the accumulation of water, and the tight and wiry pulse suggests an excess and acute condition. A white tongue coating and a deep pulse also suggest interior cold and deficiency. • The combined dosages of Fu Zi and Xi Xin are larger than that of Da Huang. Thus the nature of the formula is warm and Da Huang is used mainly as a purgative agent. Wen Pi Tang (Warm the Spleen Decoction) Source: Bei Ji Qian Jin Yao Fang 67 Accumulation syndrome and formula compositionChapter Shang Lu (phytolaccae radix)* and Qian Niu Zi (pharbitidis semen)* Shang Lu is bitter, cold and poisonous, and enters the Lung, Spleen and Kidney meridians. It has a similar but more gentle function than Da J 1 ∨ (Knoxiae radix)*, Yuan Hua (Genkwa flos)* and Gan Sui (Euphorbiae kansui radix)*. It is particularly used in the condition of water accumulation in the body. Qian Niu Zi is bitter, cold and poisonous, and enters the Lung, Kidney and Large Intestine merid- ians. It can purge accumulation from the intestines and treat constipation, as well as drive out water accumulation and treat edema. It can eliminate phlegm and open up the San Jiao meridian. Although less poisonous than Da J1∨, Yuan Hua and Gan Sui, it is still a very harsh herb. Deputy: Regulate the Qi Mu Xiang (aucklandiae radix)** and Bing Lang (arecae semen) Mu Xiang is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Lung, Liver, Spleen, Stomach and Large Intes- tine meridians. It is aromatic and drying in nature. It moves both upwards and downwards. It regulates the Qi of the San Jiao, especially the Qi of the Spleen and Stomach. It is an excellent herb for relieving pain caused by Qi stagnation. Bing Lang is bitter, pungent and warm, and enters the Stomach and Large Intestine meridians. Its pungent and warm nature can stimulate the Qi movement, reduce the accumulation, drain the water and reduce the fullness. Zhi Shi (aurantii fructus immaturus) and Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex) These two herbs can be selected together or sepa- rately to stimulate the Qi movement and enhance the abilities of the chief herbs. Zhi Shi is bitter and slightly cold, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. It is quite a strong herb for breaking up the blockage of Qi, food and phlegm, and can reduce the fullness in the abdomen. Hou Po is bitter, pungent and warm, and enters the Stomach, Spleen, Large Intestine and Lung meridians. Its pungent and warm nature can stimu- late the Qi movement, and the bitter and warm nature can dry dampness. It is able to activate the Qi movement in the Upper-, Middle- and Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Purge and drive out the congested water Da J 1 ∨ (Knoxiae radix)*, Yuan Hua (Genkwa flos)* and Gan Sui (euphorbiae kansui radix)* These three herbs are cold in temperature and are poisonous, violently cathartic and diuretic. They can drain water and drive out congested fluid by causing diarrhea and urination. They are used in severe generalized edema or accumulation of fluid in the thoracic or abdominal cavity. According to early studies and experiences, these three herbs are con- sidered incompatible with Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix). Although these three herbs are often used together, each has its own characteristics: • Gan Sui has the strongest cathartic effect and Yuan Hua the weakest. • Yuan Hua is the most poisonous herb and Gan Sui the least poisonous. • Gan Sui drives out the fluid from the meridians, Da J 1 ∨ from the internal organs and Yuan Hua from the joints and cavities. Treatment principle: Purge and drive out congested fluid; protect and strengthen the function of the Spleen 68


Lower-Jiao, reduce the accumulation of phlegm, food and water, and thus very effectively reduce the sensation of fullness. Assistant: Protect the Stomach and tonify the weakness Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) Da Zao is sweet and warm, and enters the Spleen meridian. It can tonify Qi as well as blood, thus strengthening the foundation of life. In a formula for driving out water, Da Zao is used to tonify the Spleen and protect the Stomach from violent, cathartic and diuretic toxic herbs. These three herbs are used together to drive out all of the water accumulation in the body. • Da Zhao is used as assistant to moderate the violent action of the first three herbs. Commentary on strategies The strategies are shown in dosage and administra- tion management. They suggest how to deal with poisonous, harsh but useful and necessary herbs. • The three harsh herbs are added to a decoction of Da Zao, which can tonify the Spleen and protect the Stomach from these violent and poisonous herbs. • All three herbs are used in a small dosage. Patients with a weak condition must only use half of the dosage. • The herbs are used only once in the morning. If the condition does not improve, an extra half dosage is used the next day. If diarrhea occurs or the patient is excreting large amounts of urine, the use of the formula should be stopped. • After using this formula, patients should take easily digested food to strengthen the Stomach and recover its function.

Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) is incompatible with Da J 1 ∨ (Knoxiae radix)*, Yuan hua (Genkwa flos)* and Gan Sui (Euphorbiae kansui radix)*. It is forbidden to use these herbs together despite Gan Cao being the most commonly used herb to moderate harsh herbs and protect the Spleen.

In this formula: • Gan Sui, Da J 1 ∨ and Yuan Hua are all used as chief herbs. Gan Sui drives out the fluid from the meridians, Da J 1 ∨ from the internal organs and Yuan Hua from the joints and cavities. Da J1∨ (Knoxiae radix)* 30 g Gan Sui (Euphorbiae kansui radix)* 30 g Yuan Hua (Genkwa flos)* 30 g Da Huang (Rhei rhizoma) 60 g Qian Niu Zi (Pharbitidis semen)* 120 g Qing Pi (Citri reticulatae viride pericarpium) 15 g Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) 15 g Bing Lang (Arecae semen) 15 g Mu Xiang (Aucklandiae radix)** 15 g Qing Fen (Calomel)* 3 g Analysis of the formula This formula is able to activate Qi movement and promote bowel movement and urination in order to 69 Accumulation syndrome and formula compositionChapter eliminate water accumulation. It treats water accu- mulation, which will eventually generate heat. • The chief herbs are Da J 1 ∨, Gan Sui and Yuan Hua. They strongly drive out the congested water. • Since the chief herbs are very poisonous and the dosages should be kept to a minimum, a large amount of Qian Niu Zi is added as deputy, along with Da Huang. They enhance the abilities of the chief herbs and ensure the therapeutic result in a safe dosage range. • Qing Pi, Chen Pi, Bing Lang and Mu Xiang are assistants in the formula. They help the chief and deputy herbs to activate the Qi movement in order to accelerate the water movement in the body. • Qing Fen is used as assistant and envoy; it drains the water directly. Improper dietary habits Elderly people, chronic diseases Change of diet Using certain medicines • Insufficient fluid in the intestines • Obstruction of the Qi • Qi, blood and Yang are deficient The heat is strong: – profuse sweating – thirst – fever The Qi in the intestine is too weak to move: – not very dry feces – bowel movement is very slow and difficult Dry-heat in the intestines and Qi stagnation: – dry feces, difficult to defecate – bowel movement once in two or more days Heat increasing: – yellow tongue coating becomes darker Accumulation increasing: – more rapid and slippery pulse Heat disturbs the mind: – irritability – delirious speech • When all the strong substances are used together, the water can be driven out from the body by bowel movement and urination, just like being carried by a vessel and vehicle, hence the name of this formula. Commentary on strategies • Since the chief herbs are very poisonous and the dosages should be kept to a minimum, a large amount of Qian Niu Zi is added as deputy, along with Da Huang. They enhance the abilities of the chief herbs and ensure the therapeutic result in a safe dosage range. • Since a number of poisonous and harsh substances are used in this formula, it is only prescribed in acute and very necessary conditions for a very short period of time by experienced medical practitioners.

They are used to treat various internal heat syndromes . 73 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter Internal heat syndrome refers collectively to syn- dromes where the heat is inside the body. Apart from heat in the superficial region of the body, the remaining heat syndromes all come under the name of internal heat syndrome. Although there are a large number of heat syndromes, they can all be arranged in specific categories according to the causes, the involved organs and the regions (levels). Causes of internal heat can be divided into exter- nal and internal causes: • Internal heat due to external causes includes exterior wind-cold or exterior wind-heat, which can pass through the exterior region (also referred to as the Wei (Defensive) level in Wei- Qi-Ying-Xue differentiation) and enter the interior regions of the body when the Defensive-Qi is weak or weakened by improper treatment. The heat is increased in pathological development at the Qi, Ying and Xue levels. However, some exogenous pathogenic heat or heat-toxin may rapidly develop into an internal heat syndrome without an obvious onset at the Wei (Defensive) level; this is called latent warm-febrile disease. • Internal heat due to internal causes includes disturbance of the functions of internal organs, most often caused by emotional upset, chronic diseases, improper diet and medication.

## Syndromes in warm-febrile

<!-- chunk -->

## diseases

Warm-febrile disease is a collective name for infec- tious diseases that are caused by exogenous patho- genic heat in different seasons. The pathogenic changes are characterized by a relatively acute onset, heat predominating at all stages, and damage of body fluids and Yin. In clinical practice, it refers to acute infections caused by bacteria, viruses or other pathogenic microorganisms, such as influenza, pneumonia, bronchitis, gastroenteritis and dysentery. Pestilence is a type of virulent infectious disease caused by heat-toxins, such as epidemic cerebro- spinal meningitis, poliomyelitis and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The warm-febrile diseases develop in the body at four levels, referred to as Wei, Qi, Ying and Xue. In pestilence cases, there is rarely an initial stage, or a very short initial stage, and the heat or heat-toxin can enter the Qi or Ying level and cause internal heat syndromes directly. The warm-febrile diseases are analyzed and identified by the method of Wei-Qi-Ying-Xue differentiation.

## 1 Syndrome of heat at the Wei

<!-- chunk -->

## level (the Defensive level)

Heat in the Defensive level is equal to exterior wind-heat syndrome discussed in Chapter 1. Although it does not belong in the internal heat syndrome category, it is mentioned here as a reference to offer a complete overview of febrile diseases. Main symptoms Fever, slight aversion to wind and cold, sore throat, slight thirst and sweating. Secondary symptoms Headache, general aching of the body, cough. Tongue Red border and tip with a yellow and thin coating. Pulse Rapid and superficial. Analysis of the syndrome This syndrome is the initial stage of a warm-febrile disease and is equal to exterior wind-heat syndrome in Eight Principle Differentiation. The pathogenic factors are wind and heat. Their pathway of invasion is the nose and throat to the Lung. The wind-heat disturbs the function of the Lung and its related regions, the superficial parts of the body. In the dif- ferentiation of warm-febrile diseases, the term Wei syndrome indicates that the pathogenic factor is at the Wei level. • When the Defensive-Qi pits its efforts against the pathogenic factor, there is a fever. • The opening and closing of pores becomes irregular due to dysfunction of the Lung. The 74


patient may therefore have an aversion to wind and cold, and episodes of slight, irregular sweating may occur. • Since the throat is the gateway of the Lung, and heat easily injures the fluid, sore throat and thirst may be present. • When the Lung-Qi fails to disperse and descend, cough starts. • A red tip and border of the tongue and a superficial and rapid pulse indicate that the wind-heat is in the exterior region. (See Figure 3.1 on page 114.) Treatment principle: Expel wind, clear heat, regulate the Lung and release the exterior Associated disorders in western medicine Acute infections caused by bacteria, viruses or other pathogenic microorganisms. Analysis of the syndrome This is the metaphase of warm-febrile diseases. The heat increases inside the body and starts to injure the body fluids. At this level, the heat is very strong and has formed a center in the Lung and Stomach, from where it spreads throughout the entire body. The Qi of the involved organs and regions pits its efforts against the pathogenic heat. The body’s resistance and pathogenic factor are both strong. • High fever without chill, together with a red face and a rapid and forceful pulse indicate that the heat has already passed the Wei level and entered the Qi level. • When heat forces the fluid to move out of the body, sweat appears. • As the intense heat can directly injure the body fluids, patients have intense thirst and a dry feeling in the mouth. • If the Lung-Qi is unable to disperse and descend properly, there is shortness of breath. The symptoms and signs at the Qi level are often designated as the Four Extremes, namely extremely high fever, intense thirst, heavy sweating and extremely rapid pulse. (See Figure 3.2 on page 114.) Structure of the formula and selection of herbs See wind-heat syndrome in Chapter 1. Main symptoms High fever without chills, perspiration, dry mouth and thirst. Secondary symptoms Red face, shortness of breath, scanty urine. Tongue Red with a yellow coating. Pulse Rapid and forceful.

## Qi level

75 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter Treatment principle: Intensively clear heat, protect the body fluids and vent the pathogenic heat 2. protect Yin, Yang and Qi: Bitter herbs possess a drying property that may injure the Yin of the body, which has already been injured by excess heat. Bitter- cold herbs may injure Stomach-Qi and Yang, and disturb digestion, especially when patients have a weak Spleen or Stomach. although these herbs should not be used either long term or in large dosages, they can be used together with herbs that protect the Spleen and Stomach.


1. prevent the development of a smoldering syndrome (hidden-fire syndrome): the bitter and cold herbs that clear heat should be used with caution. although they can quickly and strongly clear heat and reduce fire, these herbs cannot be used for a long period of time. With high dosage or long-term usage, patients may develop a smoldering syndrome caused by the side effects of bitter-cold herbs. Because pathogenic heat has a tendency to ascend and cold herbs have a tendency to descend, a severe conflict between cold and heat develops. Cold herbs are able to suppress pathogenic heat when their dosages are very large and the heat has to move downwards. however, as heat does not agree with the cold nature of the herbs, it tries to withdraw but becomes constrained and hides itself in the body. as soon as the patient stops using the cold herbs, the constrained heat is freed from suppression and spreads again. In clinical practice, some chronic infections (e.g. sinusitis, bronchitis, gastroenteritis and urinary tract infection) are the result of using high dosages of cold herbs or antibiotics. therefore, a small amount of herbs that follow the nature of fire and disperse constrained fire should be used with the bitter and cold herbs in order to clear the heat completely. Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Clear heat from the Qi level directly Shi Gao (Gypsum) Shi Gao is pungent, sweet and very cold, and enters the Lung and Stomach meridians. It can powerfully clear heat and reduce fire in the Lung and Stomach, and its pungent nature can disperse the intensive constrained heat. In addition, it can generate body fluids and protect the Yin of the body. It is a perfect ingredient to treat pathological change where the heat is intense at the Qi level. In a warm-febrile disease, although heat can spread to many organs, Shi Gao, as chief in a formula, clears the heat from the Stomach, the center of Yang and heat of the body, and therefore can effectively reduce heat in the entire body. Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) and Ku Zhu Ye (Bambusae amarae folium) Zhi Zi is bitter and cold, and enters the San Jiao and Liver meridians. It can be used as chief in the formula if the heat particularly disturbs the Heart and the region of the diaphragm, manifested as irritability, restlessness, insomnia and poor appetite. Zhi Zi can clear the heat and eliminate heat by promoting urination. Ku Zhu Ye is bitter and cold, and enters the Heart meridian. It can clear the heat in the Heart and increase urination, hence reducing the heat in the Upper-Jiao. It is used if there are symptoms such as irritability, restlessness, a bitter taste in the mouth and scanty urine. 76


Deputy: Clear the heat, nourish the body fluids and enhance the ability of the chief ingredients Zhi Mu (anemarrhenae rhizoma) Zhi Mu is bitter and cold but moist in nature. It enters the Lung, Stomach and Kidney meridians. It can nourish the Yin and the body fluids, and clear the heat there. It is often used together with Shi Gao (Gypsum) and serves as deputy in a formula to enhance the ability of Shi Gao. Assistant: Nourish the body fluids, clear and disperse the heat, regulate the Qi and reduce the side effect of cold herbs Sang Ye (Mori folium) and Pi Pa Ye (eriobotryae folium) Sang Ye and Pi Pa Ye are cold in temperature and both enter the Lung meridian. They can clear the heat and descend the Lung-Qi. They are used when there are symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath due to heat in the Lung. Both are moist in nature. Although they cannot effectively generate the fluid of the Lung, they do not injure this fluid when they regulate the Qi. Lu Gen (phragmitis rhizoma) Lu Gen is sweet and cold, and enters the Lung and Stomach meridians. It is often used as assistant in the formula to nourish the body fluids, clear heat and relieve thirst. It can soothe the Stomach-Qi and treat nausea and vomiting when heat disturbs the Stomach-Qi and Lung-Qi. Da Huang (rhei rhizoma), Mang Xiao (Natrii sulfas) and Zhi Shi (aurantii fructus immaturus) These herbs are cold in temperature and all enter the Large Intestine meridian. They can powerfully clear the heat there and purge the accumulation. They can be used for constipation due to excess heat in the intestines and the heat consumes the fluid there. In addition, they can reduce heat from the Lung via the approach of clearing and descending the heat in the related Fu organ, the Large Intestine. This method is often referred to as removing the fuel under a cooking pan. Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix) and Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) Dang Sheng and Ren Shen tonify the Qi and strengthen the body’s resistance. Ren Shen has a stronger function than Dang Shen. They can be used separately as assistants to tonify the Qi in the formula. The condition where excess heat consumes the Qi is manifested as tiredness, shortness of breath, constant sweating with constant high fever and a forceful pulse that is empty in the deep position. Dan Dou Chi (Sojae semen praeparatum) Dan Dou Chi is pungent and slightly warm, and enters the Lung and Stomach meridians. It can dis- perse and spread the constrained Qi and heat in the Upper-Jiao. In the formula, it is often used as assist- ant with bitter and cold herbs that can descend and clear the heat. The combination of pungent and warm with bitter and cold can eliminate the heat completely. Jin Yin Hua (Lonicerae flos), Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus) and Bo He (Menthae herba) These three herbs are cold in nature. They can strongly clear the heat at the Qi level and remove the heat-toxin. As they also have a dispersing ten- dency in action and can disperse the constrained heat and Qi, they can clear heat effectively. Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) and Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) Chai Hu is pungent and neutral and Huang Qin is bitter and cold. They are particularly effective in dispersing and reducing the constrained Qi and heat in the Upper-Jiao and the Gall Bladder meridian. They can treat symptoms such as fever, a bitter taste in the mouth, hypochondriac distension, poor appe- tite and irritability. Jing Mi (non-glutinous rice) and Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) Jing Mi and Gan Cao enter the Spleen meridian and can protect the Stomach and Spleen from the cold herbs that clear heat at the Qi level. They can also tonify the Spleen-Qi and thereby strengthen body resistance. Porridge made from Jing Mi is light and easily digested. It is recommended as a food in the recovery period of a febrile disease. 77 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter Analysis of the formula This formula is able to remove excess heat from the Qi level, especially from the Lung and Stomach. The manifestations are high fever without chill, perspir- ation, dry mouth and thirst, a red face, irritability, shortness of breath, a red tongue with a yellow coating and a rapid and forceful pulse. In this formula: • Shi Gao, the chief, is pungent, sweet and very cold. It enters the Lung and Stomach meridians. Shi Gao can powerfully clear the heat and reduce the fire in the Lung and Stomach. It has a pungent nature that can disperse the intensive constrained heat. At the same time, it can generate body fluids and protect the Yin of the body. It is a perfect ingredient to treat pathological change where the heat is intense at the Qi level. In a warm-febrile disease, although heat can spread to many organs, Shi Gao, as chief, clears the heat from the Stomach, the center of Yang and heat of the body, and therefore can effectively reduce heat in the entire body. • Zhi Mu, the deputy, is bitter and cold but moist in nature. Zhi Mu enters the Lung, Stomach and Kidney meridians. It can nourish the Yin and the body fluids, clear the heat there and is used to enhance the ability of Shi Gao. • Jing Mi and Gan Cao, the assistants, protect the Stomach and Spleen from the cold herbs. They can also tonify the Spleen-Qi to strengthen body resistance in the fight against pathogenic heat at the Qi level. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, Shi Gao clears heat in a direct and indirect way, demonstrating the various strategies to clear heat. • Herbs that nourish the Yin and body fluids also play a very important role in the formula because the heat will, sooner or later, always consume the body fluids so that the heat increases quickly. • Moreover, the formula reminds us that although body resistance is still strong at this time, one should not forget to tonify and protect the Spleen because it is the foundation of the body’s resistance.

Analysis of the formula This formula is able to clear heat in the Upper-Jiao, the Heart, the Lung and the diaphragm. It is used in the syndrome in which heat-toxin affects these organs and regions. The symptoms are fever, rest- lessness, dry mouth and throat, thirst, swollen and sore throat, ulcers in the mouth or on the tongue, red face and red eyes, scanty urine and constipation, a red border on the tongue, which is particularly dry in the middle and has a yellow coating, and a rapid and forceful pulse. In this formula: • The chief is Lian Qiao. It is bitter and cold but has an aromatic smell. It therefore not only clears heat but also disperses heat. Since it enters the Heart meridian, it specifically clears the excess Examples of classical formulas Bai Hu Tang (White Tiger Decoction) Source: Shang Han Lun 78


heat in the Upper-Jiao. Lian Qiao is used in a large dosage as befits the chief in the formula. • Four herbs form the deputy group. Huang Qin and Zhi Zi clear the heat from the Upper-Jiao. Zhi Zi and Bo He disperse the heat from the Upper-Jiao and treat restlessness, dry mouth and ulcers on the tongue. In addition, Zhi Zi and Dan Zhu Ye can clear the heat from the Heart by increasing urination. • The assistants are Da Huang and Mang Xiao. They are used to clear heat in the intestines by purging the feces. They assist the herbs that reduce heat in the Lung via the approach of clearing and descending the heat in the related Fu organ, the Large Intestine. This method is often referred as removing the fuel under a cooking pan. In this way, they protect the body fluids from being constantly consumed. • Zhi Gan Cao and honey serve as assistants and envoys; they can reduce the harsh action of Da Huang and Mang Xiao, and protect the Stomach. When these herbs are used together, the heat is separated and eliminated, thus cooling down the region above the diaphragm. Commentary on strategies This formula demonstrates the strategies of clearing the heat. It not only reduces the heat by cooling and descending, but also by purging the bowel, increas- ing urination and dispersing the Qi and heat in order to separate and remove the heat. In this way the heat can be eliminated completely.

## 3 Syndrome of heat at the

<!-- chunk -->

## Ying level (the Nutritive level)

Associated disorders in western medicine Severe infectious diseases. Analysis of the syndrome If the pathogenic heat is not eliminated at the Wei or Qi levels, it further invades the deeper level of the body, the Ying level, where the Nutritive sub- stances of the body, such as the Yin, the blood and the essence are involved. In some severe cases, the pathogenic heat invades the Ying level directly, bypassing the first two levels. This is the later and critical stage of a warm- febrile disease. At this stage, the pathogenic heat is strong but the body’s resistance becomes weak. The body fluids have been severely injured, and the Yin and blood are being consumed. At the same time, the heat has entered the blood and starts to disturb the blood circulation. • Fever, which is higher in the night, is a specific sign of heat at the Ying level. Because the Yang enters the Ying level in the night, it enhances the strength of the body’s resistance so that it can pit more effort against the pathogenic heat, causing the fever to be higher in the night. • Dryness in the mouth but with no desire to drink is another sign of heat at the Ying level as the body starts to consume the Yin instead of trying to obtain fluid by drinking. • When the Heart-Yin and Heart-blood are injured, the Heart-shen is disturbed. Severe irritability and restlessness (even delirium) are the main symptoms of disturbance of Heart-shen. • When heat consumes the blood and makes the blood thicker, the blood has a tendency to stagnate, manifesting as indistinct erythema and purpura. • A deep red tongue without coating and a thready and rapid pulse are typical signs of Yin deficiency with heat. (See Figure 3.3 on page 115.) Main symptoms Fever that worsens at night, severe irritability, restlessness, dryness in the mouth but no desire to drink. Secondary symptoms Delirium, vague erythema and purpura. Tongue Deep red without coating. Pulse Rapid and thready. 79 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter Da Qing Ye is bitter, salty and very cold, and enters the Heart and Stomach meridians. Salt enters the blood and bitter and cold can clear heat. This herb can strongly clear the heat, remove heat-toxin and cool the blood. Sheng Ma can be used with Da Qing Ye in a ratio of 1 : 10 to disperse the heat and protect the Stomach-Qi and Spleen-Qi, which become constrained by the downward-moving herbs. Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix) Sheng Di Huang is sweet and cold. It primarily enters the Heart, Stomach and Kidney meridians. It can effectively clear heat, cool the blood and nourish the Yin. It matches the syndrome perfectly and is often used as chief in formulas that clear the heat at the Ying level. Ling Yang Jiao (antelopis cornu)** and Gou Teng (Uncariae ramulus cum uncis) Ling Yang Jiao is salty and cold, and enters the Liver, Heart and Lung meridians. It can effectively reduce the fire from the Heart and Liver, calm the mind and relax the tendons. It is often used as the chief substance in formulas that reduce the heat from the Heart and Liver when the heat disturbs the mind. Since Ling Yang Jiao is banned, it can be replaced by Shi Jue Ming (Haliotidis concha) and Qing Dai (Indigo naturalis) with a small amount of Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix). Gou Teng is sweet and slightly cold, and enters the Liver and Pericardium meridians. It can cool the Liver, reduce the fire and relax the tendons. It is used in the condition where the Liver-heat stirs the wind so that patients suffer from dizziness, head- ache and irritability, and even have convulsions. As its function is not very strong, it is often used in combination with other herbs. Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix) Dan Shen is cold and pungent, and enters the Heart meridian directly. It can cool the blood and reduce the heat in the blood. Its pungent nature disperses and dissolves the congealed blood and promotes blood circulation. It can also disperse constrained Qi in the chest. It is commonly used in combina- tion with other chief herbs to reduce the heat at the Ying level and is a very effective herb to calm the mind and treat restlessness, irritability and a warm sensation in the chest caused by heat in the blood.


1. protect the Yin, Yang and Qi: the bitter and cold herbs can intensively reduce heat but the bitterness possesses a drying property that may injure the Yin of the body. Bitter-cold herbs may easily injure the Stomach-Qi and Yang, as well as disturb the digestion, especially when patients have a weakness of the Spleen and Stomach. 2. Disperse and clear the constrained fire: herbs that are aromatic, bitter and cold, and can disperse and clear the heat should be used because they can disperse the constrained heat and may help to clear heat effectively and completely. Treatment principle: Clear heat, cool the blood, nourish the Yin and vent heat to the Qi level Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Reduce fire, clear heat from the Heart, cool the blood and increase the body fluids and Yin Da Qing Ye (Isatidis folium) with Sheng Ma (Cimicifugae rhizoma) This combination is often used as a substitute for Xi Jiao (Rhinoceri cornu)**, which is an important substance to reduce and disperse the heat in the blood in classical formulas. Although Shui Niu Jiao (Bubali cornu) can substitute for Xi Jiao, it is very expensive and its smell is not pleasant. 80


Zi Xue Dan (Purple Snow Special Pill) This patent formula is often used to intensively reduce the excess heat and open the orifices. It is a patent formula for treating closed-up syndrome where high fever, convulsions and mental confusion exist. Deputy: Increase the body fluids and Yin; disperse the blood stagnation Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) and Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix) Mai Men Dong is sweet and cold and Xuan Shen is salty and cold. These two herbs can nourish the Yin and clear the heat. They enhance the ability of the chief ingredients to clear the heat at the Ying level. Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex) Mu Dan Pi is bitter, pungent and slightly cold, and enters the Heart and Liver meridians. It can clear heat and cool the blood. The strong point of this herb is that it can disperse and dissolve congealed blood which is formed when the heat consumes the blood and makes it thick, and when the blood cir- culation is disturbed by heat. Assistant: Clear heat; disperse and vent heat to the Qi level Jin Yin Hua (Lonicerae flos) and Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus) These two herbs are cold in nature and can strongly clear the heat at the Qi level. In addition, they can disperse the constrained heat and Qi, thus clearing the heat effectively. In the formula to treat heat at the Ying level they are often used as assist- ants to vent heat from the Ying level to the Qi level, as their aromatic smell can disperse the heat and vent the heat, eventually eliminating it from the body. Zhu Ru (Bambusae caulis in taeniam), Chuan Bei Mu (Fritillariae cirrhosae bulbus) and Zhi Shi (aurantii fructus immaturus) When the pathogenic heat disturbs the Qi move- ment and consumes the Yin, phlegm might be formed. These three herbs are able to remove phlegm and clear heat. They can be added to the formula as assistants if phlegm-heat is present. Analysis of the formula This formula is devised to clear heat at the Ying level, nourish the Yin and cool the blood. The manifestations are fever that is higher in the night, irritability, restlessness and thirst with no desire to drink. In severe cases, delirium, vague erythema and purpura may appear. Patients may have a red tongue without coating or with a dry, thin coating and a rapid, forceful or thready pulse. In this formula: • Xi Jiao and Sheng Di Huang are used as the chief substances. They directly reduce the heat and cool the blood, as well as nourish the Yin. • Mai Men Dong and Xuan Shen serve as deputies; they nourish the Yin and enhance the abilities of the chief ingredients. • Five herbs serve as assistants. Dan Shen cools the blood and disperses the blood stagnation, which are the common accompanying pathological changes when there is heat at the Yin level. Dan Zhu Ye and Huang Lian can clear heat and calm the mind. Jin Yin Hua and Lian Qiao can vent the heat to the Qi level as they are aromatic herbs. They clear heat that has been vented from the Ying level in order to eliminate the heat from the body.

Each group of herbs has specific functions: • Herbs that clear heat and disperse heat are used together. • Herbs that cool the blood and disperse the stagnation are used together. • Herbs that clear heat in the Ying level and herbs that vent heat to the Qi level are used together. Qing Gong Tang (Clearing the Palace Decoction) Source: Wen Bing Tiao Bian Analysis of the formula This formula can cool the Liver and calm the wind, nourish the Yin and relax the tendons. It is used when heat affects the Liver and generates wind. The manifestations are high fever, restlessness and irri- tability, convulsions, impairment of consciousness, a deep red tongue with a dry brown coating, and a wiry and rapid pulse. When heat is at the Ying level, the main organs involved are the Heart and the Liver. In this formula, treatment is concentrated on cooling the Liver and calming the wind. • Ling Yang Jiao and Gou Teng are used as chief substances to directly and intensively reduce the heat and therefore extinguish wind. • Sang Ye and Ju Hua serve as deputies to disperse the wind and heat, and cool the Liver. • The remaining herbs serve as assistants. The combination of Bai Shao Yao, Gan Cao and Sheng Di Huang can nourish the Yin, clear heat, and ease and relax the tendons. Chuan Bei Mu and Zhu Ru eliminate the phlegm-heat that is produced by the disturbed Qi and water movement, and they may block the meridians. Fu Shen calms the mind and relaxes the tendons.

It is used when the mind is disturbed by heat, and high fever, loss of consciousness and delirium are present. • Xin means heart in Chinese. In traditional Chinese medicine, the sprout, the kernel, as the heart of a plant, is considered to enter the Heart of the human body. In this formula, this idea presents clearly. • The first five herbs are all cold in temperature and only the sprouts of the herbs are selected as these are the coldest part of the herbs. They are used to clear heat and reduce the toxin from the Heart and nourish the Yin, hence the name of this formula – Clearing the (Emperor’s) Palace Decoction.

## 4 Syndrome of heat at the Xue

<!-- chunk -->

## level (the blood level)

(See Figure 3.4 on page 116.) Treatment principle: Clear heat- toxin, cool the blood, stop bleeding and disperse the congealed blood Main symptoms Heat leads to bleeding: fever, which is higher in the night, red eyes, purpura, hematemesis, epistaxis and hemafecia. Heat generates wind: dizziness, headache and convulsions. Heat disturbs the mind: occasional coma, restlessness and delirium. Tongue Red tongue with a thin coating. Pulse Rapid and thready. Associated disorders in western medicine Severe infectious disease, primary thrombocyto- penic purpura. Analysis of the syndrome This is the most critical stage of the warm-febrile diseases. At this stage, the Qi and Yin are seriously injured, and the heat-toxin has already entered the blood and consumed the blood. At the same time, the heat severely disturbs the blood circulation and causes bleeding. • As soon as the blood leaves its pathway, it accumulates in one place causing blood stagnation. • In severe cases, when the tendons lose the nourishment of the blood and Yin, the heat may generate Liver-wind, which manifests as convulsion and dizziness. • The heat may severely disturb the Heart-shen and cause restlessness, palpitations, coma and delirium. • The tongue and pulse signs indicate the existence of heat and a deficiency of Yin.


1. Cool the blood and avoid blood stagnation: to treat the syndrome of heat in the blood, an important principle is to cool the blood yet avoid blood stasis. the blood, in a normal condition, should circulate smoothly and quietly. heat may force it to move faster and become unstable; at the same time, heat may consume the blood and cause blood stagnation and bleeding. the cold herbs may make the blood circulation slower but may also cause blood stagnation. to treat heat in the blood, herbs that enter the blood and have cold, pungent and sweet properties are more suitable for use. their function of not only cooling the blood, but also promoting blood circulation, may prevent blood stagnation. 2. Make a clear differentiation: herbs that are bitter and cold in nature and enter the Qi level should not be used because the pathological change is at the blood level, not at the Qi level. Very cold herbs may cause blood stasis and bitterness may dry the blood. 83 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Reduce heat-toxin, cool the blood, open the Heart orifice and nourish the Yin Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix), Xi Jiao (rhinoceri cornu)**, Ling Yang Jiao (antelopis cornu)** and Gou Teng (Uncariae ramulus cum uncis) These substances have already been discussed in Section 3, Syndrome of heat at the Ying level. They are also used when the heat is at the Xue level under the same principle. As the condition is more severe, the dosages of these ingredients should be larger and they should be applied promptly without hesitation. As Xi Jiao is banned, it can be replaced by Da Qing Ye (Isatidis folium) with a small amount of Sheng Ma (Cimicifugae rhizoma). The banned Ling Yang Jiao can be replaced by a large amount of Shi Jue Ming (Haliotidis concha) and Qing Dai (Indigo naturalis) with a small amount of Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix). Gou Teng is sweet and slightly cold, and enters the Liver and Pericardium meridians. It can cool the Liver, reduce the fire and relax the tendons. It is used in the condition where the Liver-heat stirs the wind so that patients suffer from dizziness, head- ache and irritability, and even have convulsions. As its function is not very strong, it should be used in large dosage. It is often used in combination with other herbs. Zi Xue Dan (Purple Snow Special Pill) This is a patent formula to intensively and quickly reduce heat-toxin and open the orifices. It is used when the heat is at the Xue level and when the mind is disturbed. Since the heat at the Xue level is dan- gerous and ordinary herbs are not sufficient to remove the heat-toxin quickly, this patent formula can be used promptly in acute conditions. Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) Bai Shao Yao is sour and cold, and primarily enters the Liver meridian. It can nourish the Yin and clear heat, and is used particularly to soften the Liver, nourish the tendons and relieve cramp and convulsions. Bie Jia (trionycis carapax)** Bie Jia is salty and cold, and enters the Kidney meridian. It reduces deficient heat and tonifies the Kidney-Yin. It is particularly suitable for conditions where the warm pathogenic factor has invaded the Lower-Jiao and the Qi and Yin of the body are severely impaired. These features manifest as evening fever, low-grade fever, warm palms and bone steaming. Deputy: Cool the blood and stop bleeding; nourish the Yin, calm the mind and settle the wind Bai Mao Gen (Imperatae rhizoma), Ce Bai Ye (platycladi cacumen), Zhi Mu (anemarrhenae rhizoma), Qian Cao Gen (rubiae radix), Bai Tou Weng (pulsatilla radix), Huai Hua (Sophorae flos), Di Yu (Sanguisorbae radix) and Xiao Ji (Cirsii herba) These herbs are all cold in temperature and can cool the blood and stop bleeding. Bai Mao Gen and Ce Bai Ye can stop nose bleeds; Zhi Mu, Qian Cao Gen and Bai Mao Gen can treat vomiting of blood; Bai Tou Weng, Huai Hua and Di Yu are particularly effective in stopping bleeding from the intestines; Xiao Ji and Bai Mao Gen can stop bleeding from the urinary tract. Tian Men Dong (asparagi radix), Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix), Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix), Hei Zhi Ma (Sesami semen nigricum) and E Jiao (asini corii colla) These herbs are able to nourish the Yin and reduce heat. Tian Meng Dong and Xuan Shen enter the Kidney meridian, particularly nourish the Kidney- Yin and reduce heat. Mai Men Dong and Xuan Shen can nourish the Heart-Yin and reduce the heat there. Hei Zhi Ma and E Jiao are moistening in nature; they nourish not only the Yin but also the essence and the blood. Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix), Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) and Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) Dan Shen is cold and pungent, and primarily enters the Heart meridian. It can cool the blood and reduce heat in the blood. It is commonly used to reduce heat at the blood level and it particularly treats restlessness, irritability and a warm sensation in the chest. Dan Shen is also able to invigorate the blood and remove congealed blood. It is suitable for use 84


when heat consumes the Yin and blood that leads to blood stagnation. Huang Lian and Zhi Zi are bitter and cold. They enter the Heart and Liver meridians. They can reduce the heat from the Heart and calm the mind so that they can treat restlessness and irritability. Since bitterness has a drying nature, these herbs should be used with herbs that tonify the Yin. Sang Ye (Mori folium) and Ju Hua (Chrysanthemi flos) These two herbs are light in weight and dispersing in nature. They can spread the Liver-Qi, disperse the heat and assist herbs that calm the Liver-wind. They can treat dizziness, headache and vertigo. They are used together with herbs that calm convulsions. Assistant: Cool the blood and promote blood circulation Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex) and Chi Shao Yao (paeoniae radix rubra) Mu Dan Pi is bitter, pungent and slightly cold; Chi Shao Yao is bitter and cold. They can clear heat and cool the blood. The strong points of these herbs are that they can also dissolve congealed blood and promote blood circulation. Blood stasis often occurs when heat consumes the blood and makes blood thick. In addition, heat makes blood move erratically (‘like a river in a storm’) and also leads to blood stagnation. The cold herbs, which are used in the formula to cool the blood and stop bleeding, may also cause blood stagnation directly. Mu Dan Pi and Chi Shao Yao are particularly selected to treat these conditions. Examples of classical formulas Xi Jiao Di Huang Tang (Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction) Source: Bei Ji Qian Jin Yao Fang Analysis of the formula This formula is able to clear the heat from the Xue level. It removes fire-toxin, cools the blood, nour- ishes the Yin, dispels blood stasis and stops bleeding. It is used for fever, various types of bleeding, ery- thema and purpura with a deep purple color, thirst and delirium. Patients may have a deep-red tongue with a very dry coating and a rapid and thready pulse. • Xi Jiao and Sheng Di Huang are used as chief ingredients to clear the heat in the blood directly. Xi Jiao, as well as its substitutes, is able to cool the Heart blood and reduce the fire-toxin. • Sheng Di Huang is used in a large dosage, and is able to cool the blood and nourish the Yin. • Mu Dan Pi and Chi Shao Yao are pungent and cold. They are able to cool the blood, reduce the heat and dissolve congealed blood. They are used as assistants in the formula. Commentary on strategies Although there are only four ingredients in this formula, it has a clear structure and shows the strat- egies of treating heat at the blood level. The four ingredients carry out the treatment procedure com- pletely – cool the blood, stop bleeding and prevent stagnation of blood at the same time.

Commentary on strategies Although this formula is large in size, it is clear in structure and strong in function. • In the original formula, Shi Gao, Huang Lian, Xi Jiao and Sheng Di Huang are given in large, medium and small dosages. In a critical condition, the large dosages should be given without hesitation. Once the condition has improved, medium or small dosages should be considered since large dosages of cold substances may injure the Qi and Yang of the body. • In the original formula, dosages were recorded for these four substances only. The rest can be arranged according to treatment need.

## warm-febrile diseases

Analysis of the formula This formula is able to clear heat at the Qi, Ying and Xue levels together. It can relieve toxicity, cool the blood and drain fire. It is used in pestilence, a kind of virulent infectious disease that is caused by heat- toxins, such as epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, poliomyelitis and SARS. The syndrome manifests as high fever, intense thirst, severe stabbing headache with nausea, extreme irritability and insomnia. In severe cases, there may be delirious speech, convul- sions, erythema and purpura with a deep purple color, vomiting of blood and nose bleeds. The patient may have a deep-red tongue with a dry yellow coating, and a rapid and deep, or rapid, deep and thready pulse. In this formula: • Shi Gao, Zhi Mu and Zhi Gan Cao, the main part of Bai Hu Tang (White Tiger Decoction), are used to clear the heat at the Qi level. • Xi Jiao, Sheng Di Huang, Mu Dan Pi and Chi Shao Yao, the ingredients of Xi Jiao Di Huang Tang (Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction), are used to cool the blood and remove heat-toxin from the blood. Together they are considered to be the chief part of the formula. • Huang Lian, Huang Qin and Zhi Zi are selected from the formula Huang Lian Jie Du Tang (Coptis Decoction to Relieve Toxicity), which can directly drain fire and fire-toxin. Together they are considered to be the deputy part of the formula. • Xuan Shen can nourish the Yin, drain the fire, cool the blood and reduce heat-toxin. It also serves as a deputy, in particular to enhance the ability of Sheng Di Huang. • Dan Zhu Ye and Lian Qiao are assistants. They can clear the heat from the Qi level, and therefore can vent the heat from the Ying level to the Qi level. • Jie Geng is used as envoy. It has an ascending ability, and can disperse the Lung-Qi and convey Main symptoms Fever that starts in the night and recedes in the morning without sweating, or lingering low-grade fever, bone steaming, tiredness. Secondary symptoms Poor appetite, shortness of breath, emaciation, lethargy, red cheeks and lips, difficulty falling asleep. Tongue Red with a thin coating. Pulse Weak, thready, rapid. Associated disorders in western medicine Aftermath of acute infectious diseases caused by bacteria and viruses, such as bronchitis, pneumonia, influenza, fever in pulmonary tuberculosis and chronic fatigue syndrome. 86


Analysis of the syndrome The aftermath is a collective term in warm-febrile diseases. It mostly means the aftermath of heat at the Qi, Ying and Xue levels. At this stage, neither the pathogenic heat nor the body’s resistance is strong, the Yin and body fluids are severely injured, but the pathogenic heat still smolders in the Yin region. In the aftermath of heat at the Qi level, although the body fluids and the Qi are injured, neither the damage nor the symptoms are serious. The recovery period is fairly short. Manifestations include tired- ness, poor appetite and difficulty falling asleep, a red tongue with a dry coating and a rapid pulse. In the aftermath of heat at the Ying or Xue level, the pathogenic heat is no longer strong but it can smolder for quite a long time in the Yin region. The Qi and Yin are severely injured, which also produces heat. It will take a considerable period of time to eliminate the pathogenic heat. • In the night, the Yang enters into the region of Yin. There it enhances the strength of the body’s resistance so that it can pit more effort against the pathogenic heat, causing the fever to be higher in the night. In the morning, when the Yang returns to the Yang region, the body’s resistance in the Yin region is too weak to fight, and the fever recedes. • When the Qi and Yin are weak, they are not able to induce sweating, and the Qi pushes the Yin to move out. • A lingering low-grade fever indicates Qi and Yin deficiency. The Qi is too weak to pit its efforts against the pathogenic heat, causing the heat to smolder in the body. • Poor appetite and tiredness indicate Qi and Yin deficiency. • When heat continuously consumes the Yin, the flesh contracts, leading to emaciation. • The bones are related to the Kidney. If heat injures the Yin, there may be a burning sensation from deep within the bones that radiates to the surface of the body; however, warmth is not palpable. • When deficient heat ascends, one may have red lips and cheeks. • When the Heart-Qi and Lung-Qi are deficient, shortness of breath occurs. • If the deficient heat disturbs the Heart, one may suffer from insomnia. • A red tongue with a thin coating or without coating, and a weak, thready and rapid pulse indicate heat at the Yin level, and the Yin and Qi are both deficient. NOTe heat due to Yin deficiency in the internal disorders is termed empty-heat; external pathogenic heat at the Yin level is termed deficient heat. Treatment principle: Nourish the Yin and body fluids, reduce deficient heat and eliminate exterior pathogenic heat Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Reduce deficient heat Qing Hao (artemisiae annuae herba), Yin Chai Hu (Stellariae radix) and Bai Wei (Cynanchi atrati radix) Although all three herbs can reduce deficient heat in the aftermath of a warm-febrile disease, each herb has specific functions. Qing Hao is bitter and cold, has a fragrant smell and is light in nature. The fragrant smell and the light nature may disperse constrained Qi and heat; bitterness and cold may reduce heat from the Qi level. It enters the blood, so is able to clear heat in 87 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter the blood. Although this herb cannot nourish the body fluids and Yin, its functions of dispersing and reducing heat as well as cooling the blood may protect the Yin and body fluids. It is often used in the metaphase and initial phase of febrile disease when the heat is not high but is constrained and there is also stagnation of Qi. Yin Chai Hu is bitter and cool, and enters the Liver and Stomach meridians. Its functions are similar to those of Qing Hao but it is stronger in descending deficient heat and cooling the blood. It is more suitable for patients who complain of dryness of the throat and mouth, thirst and afternoon fever. Bai Wei is bitter, salty and cold, and enters the Lung, Stomach and Kidney meridians. It can reduce deficient heat and cool the blood. The strong point of this herb is that it can be used not only for acute febrile diseases, but also for chronic disorders, such as postpartum fever, lingering fever, night sweats and a warm feeling in the palms and soles in febrile diseases. Di Gu Pi (Lycii cortex) and Bie Jia (trionycis carapax)** Di Gu Pi is sweet and cold, and enters the Lung, Liver and Kidney meridians. It can reduce deficient heat, especially when heat has consumed the Liver- Yin and Kidney-Yin. These patients have fever in the night, bone steaming, night sweats and irritability. It is often used for treating chronic low-grade fever. Bie Jia is salty and cold, and enters the Kidney meridian. It is a strong substance to reduce deficient heat and has the function of tonifying Kidney-Yin. It is particularly suitable for conditions where the warm pathogenic factor has invaded the Lower-Jiao and the Qi and Yin of the body are severely impaired. These features manifest as evening fever, low-grade fever, warm palms and bone steaming. Combination of Qing Hao (artemisiae annuae herba) and Bie Jia (trionycis carapax)** Qing Hao and Bei Jia are used as a pair of substances to reduce the heat in the Yin region. Fever that presents in the night but disappears in the morning indicates that the pathogenic heat is in the Yin region and that the Yin is deficient. Qing Hao is cold and aromatic. It has a dispers- ing, ascending and penetrating ability. It can vent the heat and expel it from the body. As a Yang herb, it is not able to enter the Yin region to reach the heat there. Qing Hao enters the Yin level under the guidance of Bie Jia. Bie Jia is salty and cold. It can nourish the Yin of the Kidney and is effective in reducing deficient heat. As a Yin substance in nature, it is not able to vent the heat to the Yang regions and expel it from the body. Bie Jia enters the Yin level and clears heat there; it moves out to the Qi level under the guid- ance of Qing Hao. This combination is used particularly to eliminate heat at the Yin level in febrile disease by entering the Yin level first and returning to the Qi level afterwards. Deputy: Nourish the Yin and the body fluids; tonify the Qi Bei Sha Shen (Glehniae radix), Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix), Bai Bian Dou (Dolichoris lablab semen) and Yu Zhu (polygonati odorati rhizoma) These herbs are able to recover the function of internal organs that are impaired by the pathogenic heat. Bei Sha Shen can nourish the Lung-Yin and Mai Men Dong can nourish the Heart-Yin. Both can also slightly tonify the Qi. Since they are sweet in taste and their sticky tendency may bring some burden to a weak Stomach, dosages should be appropriate if the patient has Stomach-Qi deficiency. Bai Bian Dou can slightly tonify the Spleen-Qi. As an astringent herb, it can also stabilize the Yin. It is suitable for use in the recovery process of the Spleen. Yu Zhu is another gentle herb that particu- larly tonifies the Yin of the Stomach. It is very gentle and does not put an extra burden on the Stomach. However, it needs to be used for a reasonably long period of time before tonification of the Stomach- Yin is complete. Gui Ban (testudinis carapax)** and Mu Li (Ostrea concha) Gui Ban is salty, sweet and cold, and enters the Kidney and Heart meridians. It nourishes the Yin and strengthens the Kidney, tonifies the blood and calms the mind. It is used when the Yin, essence and blood in the Lower-Jiao are severely injured. It can also reduce the heat and treat bone steaming due to Yin deficiency in warm-febrile disease. Its function of tonifying the Yin is stronger than its function of reducing deficient heat. Mu Li is salty and slightly cold, and enters the Kidney, Liver and Gall Bladder meridians. It has a gentle function to nourish the Kidney-Yin and 88


reduce deficient heat. The function of this ingredi- ent is to sedate the mind and anchor the Yang. It is used for treating restlessness, palpitations and insomnia. Ren Shen (Ginseng radix), Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix) and Xi Yang Shen (panacis quinquefolii radix) Ren Shen, Dang Sheng and Xi Yang Shen all tonify the Qi. They can be used in the condition of Qi deficiency caused by consumption of excess heat. Ren Shen is the strongest one and is used in a severe case; Dang Shen is a gentle herb that can be used in a mild case. Xi Yang Shen is cold, can tonify the Qi and nourish the Yin. It is more suitable for use when the heat is still obviously strong and the Qi and Yin are severely damaged. Assistant: Promote digestion and soothe the Stomach-Qi Hu Huang Lian (picrorhizae rhizoma), Mai Ya (hordei fructus germinatus), Shen Qu (Massa medicata fermentata) and Shan Zha (Crataegi fructus) Hu Huang Lian is bitter and cold. It can reduce the deficient heat and improve digestion as it enters the Stomach and Large Intestine meridians. This herb is especially effective in treating nutritional impair- ment in children. The disorder shows poor digestion with abdominal distension and afternoon fever. Mai Ya, Shen Qu and Shan Zha are able to aid the digestion of wheat and rice, cereals, meat and fat, respectively. They are often used together when the pathogenic heat has injured the Qi of the Spleen and the patients have poor appetite and distension in the abdomen after meals. Jing Mi (non-glutinous rice) and Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) Jing Mi and Gan Cao can protect the Stomach and Spleen from the cold herbs that clear heat at the Qi level. They can also tonify the Spleen-Qi to strengthen the body’s resistance. Fo Shou (Citri sarcodactylis fructus) and Xiang Yuan (Citri fructus) These herbs can regulate the Qi in the Middle-Jiao and promote digestion. They are sour and warm, and enter the Liver and Spleen meridians. They are particularly suitable for use when the Liver-Qi attacks the Stomach. This condition often exists at the late stage of a warm-febrile disease when the Yin of the Liver is injured. The manifestations are hypochondriac distension, fullness in the stomach and poor appetite. Envoy: Harmonize the functions and properties of herbs in the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao can harmonize the function and mod- erate the temperature of the substances in the formula and is often used as envoy. Examples of classical formulas Zhu Ye Shi Gao Tang Source: Sheng Han Lun Dan Zhu Ye (Lophatheri herba) 15 g Shi Gao (Gypsum) 30 g Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 5 g Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) 15 g Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) 9 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 3 g Jing Mi (non-glutinous rice) 15 g Analysis of the formula This formula is able to clear heat and generate body fluids, strengthen the Qi and harmonize the Stomach. It is used in the aftermath of a warm- febrile disease at the Qi level. When the greater part of the heat from the Qi level is eliminated, the Qi and body fluids are injured. Heat disturbs the Qi movement and the function of the Stomach, as well as disturbing the mind. The main symptoms are lingering fever, irritability, thirst, dry mouth, lips and throat, poor appetite, occasional vomiting, a red tongue with little coating and a weak, rapid pulse. In this formula: • Dan Zhu Ye and Shi Gao are used as chief substances to reduce the heat from the Heart and the Stomach. Shi Gao is also able to generate the body fluid and soothe the Stomach. 89 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter • Ren Shen and Mai Men Dong tonify the Qi and body fluids respectively, and serve as deputies. • Ban Xia soothes the Stomach-Qi, improves appetite and stops vomiting. As it has a pungent taste and a moving ability, it can reduce the heaviness of the tonifying herbs. Zhi Gan Cao and Jing Mi are able to tonify the Spleen and accelerate the recovery process. These three herbs all serve as assistants. • Zhi Gan Cao can harmonize the functions and nature of the herbs in the formula and is also used as envoy. Commentary on strategies This formula shows us how to protect the Stomach in the process of clearing heat. It emphasizes the importance of recovering the function of the Spleen and Stomach in the aftermath of a warm-febrile disease at the Qi level. • In the aftermath of a warm-febrile disease, heat injures the Qi and Yin. The Stomach, as the generator of Qi and Yin, is very weak and sensitive. • In this formula, herbs such as Zhi Gan Cao, Jing Mi and Ban Xia protect the Stomach. • Ren Shen and Mai Men Dong can strengthen the Middle-Jiao and are not harmful to the weakened Stomach. • Shi Gao and Dan Zhu Ye are not bitter and cold, but sweet and cold. They clear heat without injuring the Qi and Yin. Qing Hao Bie Jia Tang (Artemisia Annua and Soft-shelled Turtle Shell Decoction) Source: Wen Bing Tiao Bian Analysis of the formula This formula is able to nourish the Yin, and reduce and vent the deficient heat. It is used when the heat smolders in the Yin region at the later stage of a warm-febrile disease. The manifestations are fever that starts in the night and recedes in the morning without sweating, emaciation without loss of appe- tite, a red tongue with little coating, and a thready and rapid pulse. In this formula: • The combination of Qing Hao and Bie Jia is used to reduce the deficient heat in the Yin regions and bring it out of the Yin level too. • Sheng Di Huang and Zhi Mu enter the Lower- Jiao, can nourish the Kidney-Yin and reduce the deficient heat. They can enhance the ability of Bie Jia and serve as deputies. • Mu Dan Pi is also used as deputy because it can particularly reduce the deficient heat in the blood, cool the blood and promote the blood circulation. • Qing Hao and Bie Jia in combination serve as envoy. Bie Jia brings Qing Hao to the Yin region, then Qing Hao vents the heat to the Yang region and expels the heat. Commentary on strategies • The strategy of venting heat from the Yin level is represented by the combination of Bie Jia and Qing Hao which have clearing and dispersing abilities. • The strategy of tonifying with reducing is demonstrated by using herbs without a cloying nature to nourish the Yin. Since the heat still smolders in the Yin region and many tonifying herbs are too sweet and may retain the pathogenic heat, the combinations of salty, sweet, bitter and pungent tastes with cold temperature may result in an effective strategy to nourish the Yin, reduce the heat and vent the heat. Qing Hao (Artemisiae annuae herba) 6 g Bie Jia (Trionycis carapax)** 15 g Sheng Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix) 12 g Zhi Mu (Anemarrhenae rhizoma) 6 g Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex) 9 g 90


Analysis of the formula This formula is able to nourish the Yin and generate the pulse, anchor the Yang and extinguish the Liver- wind. It is used to treat a condition in a warm-febrile disease where the pathogenic heat is no longer strong, but the Yin of the Kidney and Liver is severely injured. The pathogenic heat is continuing to consume the Yin and the Heart, and the tendons have lost nourishment. The manifestations are pal- pitations (including chest pain), impaired conscious- ness, cramp and trembling limbs, dry skin and lips, red cheeks, emaciation, lethargy, a thin and dry tongue, and a rapid and thready pulse. In this formula: • Some specific substances are used as chief. They are Mu Li, Bie Jia and Gui Ban, termed the three shells. They can effectively nourish the Yin and blood, reduce the deficient heat, anchor the Yang and extinguish the wind. In this way they directly treat cramp and trembling of limbs. Analysis of the formula This formula is able to reduce deficient heat and is used at the late stage of warm-febrile diseases when there is chronic low-grade fever, bone steaming, irritability and lethargy due to Yin deficiency of the Kidney and Liver with deficient heat. In this formula: • Yin Chai Hu, as chief, is bitter and cool, and can effectively reduce the deficient fire from the Yin region without the tendency of excessive drainage. • Zhi Mu, Di Gu Pi and Zhi Bie Jia serve as deputies; they are able to nourish the Yin and reduce the deficient heat. Since they all enter the Kidney meridian, they can also effectively reduce the bone steaming. Qing Hao and Qin Jiao also serve as deputies; they are effective at dispersing the Qi and venting the heat. • Hu Huang Lian is used as assistant and can reduce the deficient heat and promote digestion. • Gan Cao serves as envoy; it can protect the Middle-Jiao and harmonize the substances in the formula. • Zhi Bie Jia also serves as envoy; it can guide all the substances entering the Yin region. Qing Hao, as another envoy, can vent the heat to the Yang region and expel the heat.

San Jia Jian Fu Mai Tang (Modified Restore the Pulse Powder) Source: Wen Re Jing Wei 91 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter • Bai Shao Yao and E Jiao are used to tonify the blood; Sheng Di Huang and Mai Men Dong are used to nourish the Yin and body fluids. These two groups of herbs are able to strengthen the function of the three shells and are used as deputies. • A large amount of Zhi Gan Cao is used as assistant to tonify the Qi. This stabilizes the Yin and can directly calm the mind and treat palpitations. When all of these substances are used together, they can nourish the Yin and blood, leading to anchoring the Yang and extinguishing the wind. Commentary on strategies This formula demonstrates three strategies: • The first strategy is using animal products to nourish the Yin and blood in a severe condition of Yin and blood deficiency. Because animals have blood and flesh and are closer to humans than plants, they can tonify the human body directly and strongly. • The second strategy is to use a mineral substance. As it is heavy and has a descending tendency, it can better anchor the Yang and calm the mind than plants. • Sheng means raw in Chinese. In this formula, several substances are used without processing to increase the effect of nourishing the Yin and reducing heat.

## Heat in different organs

Note heat can stay in different internal organs and cause different symptoms, but the treatment principles and principles of herb selection are the same. thus these are introduced first. Treatment principle: Clear heat in the involved organs and meridians; nourish the Yin and body fluids there


1. prevent constrained fire: Most of the herbs that clear heat are bitter and cold. Because bitterness has the tendency of moving downwards, and cold, of course, can clear heat, they can quickly and strongly clear heat and reduce fire in the right situation. however, these herbs cannot be used for a long period of time. With high dosage or long-term use, the bitter-cold herbs may cause a smoldering syndrome, a common side effect of these herbs. therefore, a small amount of herbs that can disperse the constrained fire can be added to reduce this side effect. 2. protect Yin, Yang and Qi: Bitter herbs have a drying nature, which may injure the Yin of the body. Bitter and cold may injure Stomach-Qi and Yang, and disturb digestion. although these herbs should not be used either long term or in large dosages, they can be used together with herbs that protect the Spleen and Stomach. 92


• If Heart-fire influences its external related organ, the Small Intestine, patients may have dark urine with a foul smell which may be accompanied by urgent and painful sensations. • The Heart opens into the tongue, thus ulcers on the tongue indicate heat in the Heart. • Heart-fire may generate fire-toxin and cause sores, boils and carbuncles, which are characterized by warmth, swelling, redness and pain. Treatment principle: Clear heat from the Heart and Small Intestine Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Clear heat, reduce fire-toxin and nourish the Heart-Yin and body fluids Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix) and Da Qing Ye (Isatidis folium) Sheng Di Huang is sweet, bitter and cold, and enters the Heart, Liver and Kidney meridians. Its bitter- ness can reduce fire, cold can clear heat, and cold and sweet together can generate body fluids and Yin, thus effectively controlling fire. Moreover, it also enters the blood, can cool the blood and stop bleeding. Since it matches the three aspects of pathological change of fire of the body, it is the most commonly used herb to reduce fire of the Heart. Da Qing Ye is salty and very cold, and enters the Heart and Stomach meridians. It can strongly reduce Heart-fire and relieve fire-toxin; it can also cool the blood. It is used to treat severe cases of Heart-fire syndrome. It is also used to treat fire- toxin syndromes, such as infections. Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) Huang Lian is bitter and cold, and primarily enters the Heart and Stomach meridians. It can strongly clear heat and reduce the intense fire from the Heart directly. At the same time, it can also relieve fire- toxin and dry damp-heat. It is suitable for use in cases of sores, boils and carbuncles. As Huang Lian is very bitter and cold, it is not suitable for long-term use, especially in an excess heat syndrome without dampness. As soon as the intense heat is reduced, some gentle, sweet and cold herbs should be used instead of Huang Lian. Associated disorders in western medicine Insomnia, infectious diseases, infections of the skin such as sores, boils and carbuncles, urinary tract infection. Analysis of the syndrome Excess Heart-fire is mostly generated by Liver-fire, its mother organ. The most common cause is emo- tional disturbance, such as stress and frustration. It may also be caused by the imbalance between Kidney and Heart, such as in shock where the Heart-fire loses control of the Kidney-water. More- over, some diseases or some drugs can directly injure the Yin of the Heart and cause Heart-fire to ascend, such as in a warm-febrile disease. • When Heart-fire injures the Yin and body fluids, patients may have thirst and a preference for cold drinks, and a bitter taste in the mouth. • If heat disturbs the Heart-shen, there might be restlessness, insomnia and a warm sensation in the chest. In a severe case there may even be loss of consciousness and delirium. • The Heart governs the blood and promotes blood circulation. Heat can easily enter the blood and cause bleeding. Main symptoms Warm sensation in the chest, restless, thirst and a preference for cold drinks, red face, a bitter taste in the mouth and insomnia. In severe cases, loss of consciousness, delirium and bleeding. Secondary symptoms Dark urine with a foul smell or accompanied by urgent and painful sensations, ulcers on the tongue, and sores, boils and carbuncles, which are characterized by warmth, swelling, redness and pain. Tongue Red with a thin yellow coating. Pulse Rapid and forceful.

## Heart and Small Intestine

93 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter Deputy: Nourish the body fluids, clear heat in the related organ and cool the blood Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) Mai Men Dong is sweet, slightly cold and bitter, and enters the Heart, Lung and Stomach meridians. It can nourish the Yin, reduce the fire and is commonly used for thirst, dry mouth, warmth in the chest and restlessness. Mu Tong (Mutong caulis)*, Dan Zhu Ye (Lophatheri herba) and Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) These three herbs are bitter and cold, and all enter the Heart meridian. They can clear the heat from the Heart and treat restlessness, warmth in the chest and bitterness in the mouth. Moreover, they can lead the heat from the Heart downward and eliminate the heat by increasing urination. Further- more, these herbs can clear heat in the Small Intes- tine directly, and treat dark and scanty urine and painful and urgent urination due to damp-heat. Mu Tong is the strongest of these herbs at clear- ing heat, but it is very cold, bitter and poisonous. It can only be used for a short period of time to reduce the intensive fire. Dan Zhu Ye is the weakest herb but a safe one. It can be used in a mild or medium case of Heart-fire. Zhi Zi is the most commonly used herb. It has a stronger function than Dan Zhu Ye and is not a poisonous herb like Mu Tong. As it enters the San Jiao meridian, it can clear the heat from the San Jiao and regulate the water passage, reduce Heart-fire and increase urination to leach out heat. Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix) Dan Shen is bitter and slightly cold, and enters the Heart and Liver meridians. It can effectively clear heat and cool the blood, and is used as deputy when the Heart-fire disturbs the blood and causes blood stagnation. It treats warmth in the chest and rest- lessness due to the heat in the blood and blood stagnation. Assistant: Disperse constrained heat, treat the symptoms associated with Heart-fire and protect the Stomach Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus) Lian Qiao is bitter and cold, and enters the Heart meridian. It can clear fire and relieve fire-toxin. Lian Qiao has a fragrant smell and thus has an ascending and dispersing tendency in action. As this moving tendency may reduce the chance of a constrained- heat condition forming, it is also used in the formula as a corrective assistant. Zhu Li (Bambusae succus) and Lian Zi Xin (Nelumbinis plumula) Zhu Li and Lian Zi Xin are very cold and enter the Heart meridian. They can be used if the Heart-shen is disturbed by heat or heat-toxin. They can clear the heat, open up the orifices and revive the spirit. Zhu Li can eliminate phlegm-heat, open the Heart meridian, and treat loss of consciousness, delirium and restlessness. Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix) Dan Shen can be used as assistant in the formula of clearing heat from the Heart. When heat injures the Yin and consumes the blood of the Heart, it makes the blood thicker than normal. At the same time, heat can force the blood to move erratically (‘like a river in a storm’). Both of these conditions may cause blood stagnation. Dan Shen can cool the blood, promote the blood circulation and remove the congealed blood, enabling recovery of the normal condition of blood and its circulation. Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) and Sheng Gan Cao Shao (tips of Glycyrrhizae radix) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and primarily enters the Spleen meridian. It can tonify the Spleen-Qi and moisten dryness; it is used when the heat consumes the Yin and Qi and causes dryness. In addition, it can protect the Stomach from cold herbs, which often conflict with the intense fire and also often suppress the Stomach-Qi. Sheng Gan Cao, the raw Gan Cao that has not been processed with honey, has a quite different function from Zhi Gan Cao in that it can reduce heat-toxin. Sheng Gan Cao Shao is very thin in shape and is believed to enter the urinary tract; in particular, it can reduce painful, burning and dis- tending sensations in the urinary tract. Envoy: Harmonize herbs in the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and primarily enters the Spleen meridian. In a formula for reducing heat, it is used to protect the Stomach from heat and from 94


Analysis of the formula This formula is able to drain the heat from the Heart and Small Intestine. It treats excess heat in these organs that is manifested as irritability with a sensa- tion of heat in the chest, thirst and a preference for cold drinks, a red face, a bitter taste in the mouth, constipation and scanty and dark urine. Patients may have a red tongue with a thin, dry and yellow coating, and a rapid pulse. In this formula: • Sheng Di Huang, the chief, is sweet, bitter and cold, can directly nourish the Yin and reduce the heat. • Mu Tong and Dan Zhu Ye, the deputies, enter the Heart and Small Intestine meridians and can drain the heat by promoting urination. • Sheng Gan Cao Shao, the assistant, can reduce heat-toxin and stop the pain and irritation in the urinary tract. When the four herbs are used together, the excess heat from the Heart can be reduced and leached out. Commentary on strategies In this small formula, the strategies are shown by clearing Heart-fire in direct and indirect ways – clear heat from the Heart and from the Small Intestine. • This formula demonstrates the principle of offering the pathological factor a way to leave the body by using Mu Tong and Dan Zhu Ye to promote urination and leach out heat. • This formula is also characterized by using the combinations of herbs that clear heat and nourish the Yin, promote urination but avoid the likelihood of injuring the Yin.

It is used to treat excess heat in the Heart, which causes high fever, irritability, restless- ness, flushed face, red eyes and dark urine; in a severe case, there may be delirious speech. It can also treat damp-heat in the stomach and intestines, which manifests as stomach distension, diarrhea and dysenteric disorders. In this formula: • Da Huang is used as chief; it drains the heat and eliminates the heat by purging the intestines and promoting bowel movement. • Huang Lian and Huang Qin serve as deputies. They are bitter and cold, enter the Heart and Large Intestine respectively, can reduce the heat from the Heart and dry the damp-heat from the Large Intestine. When these three herbs are used together they may effectively and strongly drain fire-toxin and eliminate dampness. cold herbs. It is also used to harmonize the functions of herbs in a formula. Examples of classical formulas Dao Chi San (Guide out the Red Powder) Source: Xiao Er Yao Zheng Zhi Jue 95 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter Analysis of the formula This formula is able to drain fire and relieve toxicity from San Jiao regions. It is used to treat all kinds of excess heat syndrome, such as high fever, irritability, furuncles and carbuncles, which are considered to be caused directly by the blazing of Heart-fire. Patients have a red tongue with a yellow coating and a rapid and forceful pulse. In this formula: • The bitter and cold Huang Lian is used as chief to clear the heat from the Heart directly. It can also clear the heat from the Stomach. • Huang Qin and Huang Bai, which are also bitter and cold, are used as deputies; they clear the heat from the Upper-Jiao and the Lower- Jiao, respectively. • Zhi Zi is also used as deputy. Since it enters the San Jiao meridian, it can drain the heat from these three regions and eliminate the heat by promoting urination. Commentary on strategies In this formula, all four herbs focus on clearing heat from the Heart, the organ of the blazing fire. They can also clear the heat in different regions, as well as enhancing each others’ functions. Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) 3–9 g Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) 6 g Huang Bai (Phellodendri cortex) 6 g Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) 9 g Main symptoms Irritability, short temper, bitter or sour taste in the mouth, hypochondriac pain and distension, insomnia, dream-disturbed sleep, headache, dizziness and tinnitus. Secondary symptoms Dry, red, painful eyes and blurred vision, irregular menstruation, shortened menstrual cycle, heavy menstruation with fresh red color, swelling of the external genitals or itch in the vagina, turbid and foul smelling leukorrhea and urine, tightness in the chest, sticky sensation in the mouth, distension in the hypochondriac region, eczema and jaundice. Tongue Red or red on the border with a yellow coating. Pulse Wiry, rapid. Associated disorders in western medicine Tympanitis, conjunctivitis, vaginitis, tinea cruris, herpes zoster, eczema, hepatitis and cholecystitis. Analysis of the syndrome The Liver is a Yang organ. Anger is the emotion mainly associated with the Liver, which often shows in the pathological conditions. • Liver-heat or Liver-fire may directly disturb the free flow of Qi, and patients may have a short temper and irritability. • The Liver opens into the eyes and its taste is remarked as sour; thus Liver-fire can directly cause red and dry eyes, and bitter and sour tastes in the mouth. • Since the Liver meridian passes the hypochondriac and genital regions, hypochondriac pain and distension may exist when the Qi is obstructed. • When heat disturbs the Liver, the Liver is unable to house the Hun (soul), and dream- disturbed sleep and insomnia may appear. • As the Liver and Gall Bladder are externally and internally related, heat in the Liver may directly cause heat in the Gall Bladder. If the heat Commentary on strategies In this formula, a strategy is used to drain heat-toxin and eliminate the intense heat in the Heart by purging the intestines and promoting bowel movement.

## 7 Syndrome of heat in the Liver


moves upwards along its meridian, patients may suffer from headache, dizziness and tinnitus. • When the heat disturbs not only the Qi but also the blood, women may have heavy menstrual flow and a short menstrual cycle. • If damp-heat accumulates in the Liver meridian, it may bring about symptoms such as swelling of the external genital region or itch in the vagina, eczema, and turbid and foul-smelling leukorrhea and urine. • If damp-heat accumulates in the Liver and Gall Bladder meridians and obstructs the movement of the Qi and water, patients may feel tightness in the chest, a sticky feeling in the mouth and distension in the hypochondriac region. • If damp-heat disturbs secretion of bile, jaundice may appear. • The signs of the tongue and pulse indicate excess heat and damp-heat in the Liver. Treatment principle: Drain fire from the Liver and Gall Bladder and eliminate damp-heat in the Lower-Jiao Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Reduce Liver-fire intensively and eliminate fire-toxin Long Dan Cao (Gentianae radix) and Chuan Lian Zi (toosendan fructus) Long Dan Cao and Chuan Lian Zi are two very bitter and cold herbs, both of which enter the Liver meridian. They can strongly clear heat and reduce fire directly. Besides intensively draining the fire of the Liver, Long Dan Cao can also dry damp-heat. It is particu- larly used in conditions where there is excess heat in the Liver that flares upwards and causes disorders in the head and sensory orifices, as well as in condi- tions where there is damp-heat in the Liver that moves downwards and causes disorders in the Lower-Jiao and the genital area. In a formula to treat acute excess conditions of both Liver fire and damp- heat, Long Dan Cao is often used as chief. In addition to intensively draining the fire of the Liver, Chuan Lian Zi is able to stimulate the Qi, open the obstruction and therefore effectively relieve pain and distension. However, as it is a poi- sonous herb, the dosage should be controlled and it should not be used long term. Deputy: Nourish the Yin and blood, clear heat in the related organ and cool the blood Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) and Nu Zhen Zi (Ligustri lucidi fructus) Bai Shao Yao is sour, bitter and cold. It primarily enters the Liver meridian. It is able to nourish the Yin and blood of the Liver, and can stabilize the fluid and clear heat. It is a perfect herb to help the chief herb soften the Liver and reduce the fire. Nu Zhen Zi is sweet, bitter and cold. It enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. It is also able to nourish the Yin and reduce the heat. The strong point of this herb is that it tonifies the Yin without cloying side effects and therefore is particularly suitable for use when damp-heat accumulates in the Liver and its meridian. Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) and Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) Huang Lian and Zhi Zi are both bitter and cold. They can effectively reduce excess heat from the Liver. Huang Lian primarily enters the Heart meridian. According to the Five-Element theory, the Liver is the Mother organ of the Heart. One of the strategies to reduce heat is to reduce the Son organ to help the Mother. Huang Lian is thus an appropriate choice for this purpose. In addition, if the heat is active in both organs, Huang Lian is also a good choice as it also enters the Liver meridian. Zhi Zi enters the San Jiao meridian and is often used to reduce the fire as it can leach the heat out of the body by increasing urination. Due to the same function, it is also very useful for eliminating damp- heat in the Lower-Jiao. Thus Zhi Zi is often chosen to reduce fire as well as eliminate dampness. Gou Teng (Uncariae ramulus cum uncis) Gou Teng is sweet and slightly cold, and enters the Liver and Pericardium meridians. It can clear the heat there and is particularly effective for calming convulsions. When Liver-fire disturbs the Heart, and dizziness, tingling of limbs or convulsions start, it is essential to include Gou Teng in the formula. Qing Dai (Indigo naturalis) Qing Dai is salty and cold, and enters the Liver meridian. As it is able to clear heat and cool the 97 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter blood, it can be used when Liver-heat disturbs the blood circulation. Assistant: Disperse constrained heat; treat symptoms associated with heat; protect the Stomach and blood Xiang Fu (Cyperi rhizoma) and Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) Xiang Fu and Chai Hu are the most important herbs for promoting Liver-Qi movement. When heat dis- turbs the Liver-Qi, they can be used in the formula. The difference between them is that Xiang Fu cir- culates the Qi and Chai Hu disperses and ascends the Qi. They can both be used as assistants to prevent the constraint of Qi and fire caused by large dosages of cold and descending herbs. Xia Ku Cao (prunellae spica) Xia Ku Cao is pungent, bitter and cold, and enters the Liver meridian. It can clear heat, tonify the blood and disperse the obstruction. It is effective for treating dizziness, headache and painful eyes. It can also dis- sipate nodules and is often used for treating distend- ing pain in the breasts due to Liver-fire and phlegm. Suan Zao Ren (Ziziphi spinosae semen) Suan Zao Ren is sweet and sour, and primarily enters the Liver meridian. It can tonify the Liver-blood and improve sleep, and is used to treat restless sleep and dream-disturbed sleep when the heat disturbs the soul. Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix) and Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) These two herbs are able to tonify the Liver-blood. Dang Gui is bitter, sweet, pungent and warm, can tonify the blood and promote blood circulation. Bai Shao Yao is sour, bitter and cold, can nourish the Yin and soften the Liver. When the heat injures the Yin and blood, and the function of the Liver is impaired, Dan Gui and Bai Shao Yao are often used in combination. Chi Shao Yao (paeoniae radix rubra) and Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex) These two herbs are cold in nature and enter the Liver meridian. They also enter the blood level. Both can cool the blood and dissolve the congealed blood, thus preventing the heat from consuming the blood and forming congealed blood. The difference between these two herbs is that Chi Shao Yao reduces the excess heat in the blood and Mu Dan Pi reduces the deficient heat in the blood. They can be selected according to syndrome. Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) and Sheng Gan Cao (raw Glycyrrhizae radix) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and primarily enters the Spleen meridian. It can tonify the Spleen-Qi and moisten the dryness; it is used when the heat con- sumes the Yin and Qi and causes dryness. In addi- tion, it can protect the Stomach from cold herbs, which often conflict with the intense fire and also often suppress the Stomach-Qi. Sheng Gan Cao, the raw Gan Cao, has a quite different function from Zhi Gan Cao. It can reduce heat-toxin and is often used in a fire-toxin syndrome. Envoy: Harmonize herbs in the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and primarily enters the Spleen meridian. In a formula to reduce heat, it is used to protect the Stomach from heat and from cold herbs. It is also used to harmonize the functions of herbs in a formula.

Analysis of the formula This formula can drain excess fire from the Liver and Gall Bladder, and eliminate damp-heat from the Lower-Jiao. It is used to treat up-flaring of Liver-fire, which manifests as headache, red and sore eyes, deafness and tinnitus, hypochondriac pain, a bitter taste in the mouth, irritability, short temper, a red tongue with a yellow coating, and a wiry, rapid and forceful pulse. This formula is also able to eliminate damp-heat in the Liver and Gall Bladder meridians, which manifests as swelling, itchy, wet external genitalia, foul-smelling leukorrhea, difficult and painful urination, a red tongue with a yellow, sticky coating, and a wiry and rapid pulse. In this formula: • The very bitter and cold Long Dan Cao is used as chief because it can either drain the fire from the Liver or eliminate the damp-heat from the Lower-Jiao. • Huang Qin and Zhi Zi, as deputies, enhance the ability of Long Dan Cao to reduce the heat in the Liver and Gall Bladder. • Ze Xie, Mu Tong and Che Qian Zi are used as assistants to strengthen the function of Long Dan Cao to increase urination and eliminate dampness. • Sheng Di Huang and Dang Gui are used as corrective assistants to nourish the Yin and blood to treat the injury of Yin and blood caused by excess heat. • Chai Hu is used as corrective assistant as well as envoy. It can disperse and spread the constraint of Liver-Qi, which is suppressed by the powerful draining herbs. On the other hand, it slightly disperses the heat, thus preventing the development of constrained heat which is often formed in the process of clearing heat. As envoy it harmonizes the herbs entering the Liver and Gall Bladder meridians. • Sheng Gan Cao is able to reduce heat-toxin and can also harmonize the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies • This formula reminds us that, in the process of clearing heat, one should not forget to disperse heat, thus preventing the development of constrained heat which is often formed in the process of clearing heat. In this way, heat can be drained out completely and quickly. • Meanwhile, in the process of clearing heat from the Liver and eliminating dampness, it is also important to strengthen the Yin and promote blood circulation, spread the Liver-Qi and protect the Stomach, as all of them can be disturbed by intense heat and by those very cold herbs.

It treats heat in the Liver and Gall Bladder meridi- ans, which manifests as severe headache, flushed cheeks, foul breath, tinnitus, reduced hearing ability, irritability, insomnia, cough with sticky, thick sputum, dark urine, a red tongue and a wiry, rapid pulse. In this formula: • Chai Hu and Zhi Zi are used as chief herbs to spread the Liver-Qi and reduce the accumulation of heat in the San Jiao and Gall Bladder meridians, thereby relieving headache, irritability and tinnitus. • Huang Qin and Lian Qiao reduce the heat in the Upper-Jiao, enhance the ability of the chief herbs and serve as deputies. • The assistants are divided into three groups according to their function: 99 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter – The first group is Niu Bang Zi, Gan Cao and Fang Feng; these herbs can disperse and reduce fire-toxin, and treat pain. – The second group is Dang Gui, Chi Shao Yao and Chuan Xiong; they can promote the blood circulation and reduce pain. – The third group is Tian Hua Fen and Sheng Di Huang; these herbs nourish the body fluids, reduce the heat and treat dark urine and foul breath. Commentary on strategies This formula shows several procedures to treat the excess heat in the Gall Bladder meridian: • Disperse the constrained heat and the constrained Qi; reduce the clump of heat-toxin. • Circulate the blood and stop the pain. • Nourish the Yin. Since all of the procedures presented in the formula precisely match the pathogenic changes, it can effectively drain the heat-toxin of the Liver and Gall Bladder meridians.

## 8 Syndrome of heat in the

<!-- chunk -->

## Stomach and Large Intestine

Analysis of the syndrome The Stomach and Large Intestine are Yang Ming organs. They are active in receiving and transporting food and drink. All these activities can easily consume the fluids and produce heat. Meanwhile, the pathogenic heat easily and directly disturbs these organs as a result of eating ‘dirty’ food (i.e. food that has not been washed, has been prepared unhygienically, is contaminated, polluted or rotten) or certain dietary habits. • When there is excess heat in the Stomach and Large Intestine, it can directly consume the body fluids and cause high fever, sweat, severe thirst, dry mouth and constipation. • Heat can easily and quickly burn out the food, so that patients may complain of feeling hungry all the time. • Spleen and Stomach associate with flesh. When heat exists in these organs, swollen gums, painful mouth ulcers and foul breath may appear. • When heat injures the blood vessels, patients may vomit blood and may have hemorrhoids. • When heat attacks the head along the Stomach and Large Intestine meridians, headache and toothache often occur. • The disturbance of Qi movement in the abdomen can directly cause distending pain in the abdomen. Treatment principle: Clear heat in the Yang Ming organs Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Clear heat, nourish the body fluids and reduce fire-toxin Shi Gao (Gypsum) and Zhi Mu (anemarrhenae rhizoma) Shi Gao and Zhi Mu are the most commonly used combination to clear excessive, intensive heat. Shi Gao is pungent, sweet and cold, and enters the Lung and Stomach meridians. It can strongly clear the heat, reduce the fire and generate the body fluids. At the same time, it can disperse heat as it has a pungent property. Since Shi Gao can perfectly match the pathological changes of heat in the body, it is the first choice for treating Stomach-heat. Main symptoms High fever, sweat, severe thirst, dry mouth, a preference for cold drinks, often feeling hungry, constipation, hemorrhoids. Secondary symptoms Headache, toothache, bleeding and swollen gums, very painful and swollen mouth ulcers, foul breath, vomiting of blood, distending pain in the abdomen. Tongue Red tongue with a yellow coating. Pulse Slippery and rapid. Associated disorders in western medicine Aphthae, recurrent aphthous stomatitis, periodonti- tis, gastritis, constipation. 100


Zhi Mu is bitter and cold, and enters the Stomach, Lung and Kidney meridians. It can directly clear the heat and reduce the fire. Although it is bitter and cold, it is moistening in nature and can also nourish the body fluids. Since it enters the Kidney meridian, it can nourish the Yin and clear heat in an intense and constant way. Shi Gao and Zhi Mu are often used together and enhance each others’ therapeutic effects. Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) Huang Lian is bitter and cold. Although it primarily enters the Heart meridian, it also enters the Stomach and Liver meridians. It can reduce the heat from the Stomach and treat the sensation of hunger, bitter taste in the mouth and foul breath. It is also suitable for use in heartburn due to Liver-heat attacking the Stomach. Da Huang (rhei rhizoma) and Mang Xiao (Natrii sulfas) If the heat accumulates in the Large Intestine and consumes the fluid, constipation may occur. Da Huang and Mang Xiao can be used in the acute condition. Da Huang is bitter and cold, and can intensively stimulate the intestines to promote bowel move- ment. From this purgative effect, it eliminates the heat in the intestines. Mang Xiao is salty and cold, can increase the fluid in the intestines and soften the stool. These two substances can enhance each others’ effects. They can effectively clear the heat in the intestines and treat constipation. However, as they are both purgatives they may injure the fluid in the intestines and therefore should not be used for a long period of time. Deputy: Nourish the body fluids, clear heat in the related organ and cool the blood Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix), Tian Hua Fen (trichosanthis radix) and Yu Zhu (polygonati odorati rhizoma) Mai Men Dong, Tian Hua Fen and Yu Zhu are all sweet and cold, and can nourish the fluid in the Stomach. They can be used together or separately. Mai Men Dong is the strongest of the three to nourish the Yin but is slightly stickier than the other two herbs. Tian Hua Fen is sweet, slightly sour, bitter and cold. It is not sticky and is suitable for treating Stomach-heat syndrome, either in febrile disease or in disturbance of the function of the Stomach. It can effectively relieve thirst and dry mouth. Yu Zhu is very gentle in function and is only suitable for use in a chronic and mild syndrome of Stomach-heat with Yin deficiency. Zhi Mu (anemarrhenae rhizoma) and Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix) Zhi Mu is bitter and cold, and Xuan Shen is salty and cold. Both can nourish the fluid in the Large Intestine and are often used to treat constipation as they can clear the heat there and soften the feces. Da Qing Ye (Isatidis folium), Bai Mao Gen (Imperatae rhizoma), Di Yu (Sanguisorbae radix) and Huai Hua (Sophorae flos) All four herbs can cool the blood and stop bleeding, and are used in bleeding conditions when the heat forces the blood to leave its normal pathway. Da Qing Ye and Bai Mao Gen can particularly clear Stomach-heat and stop the bleeding there. Di Yu and Huai Hua enter the Large Intestine and treat bleeding in the intestines; they can also be used to treat hemorrhoids. Assistant: Disperse constrained heat; treat related symptoms caused by heat Sheng Ma (Cimicifugae rhizoma) and Mai Ya (hordei fructus germinatus) Sheng Ma and Mai Ya enter the Stomach meridian and are often chosen for ascending the Stomach-Qi as they can reduce the side effects of herbs that intensively reduce Stomach-fire and lead to forma- tion of constrained fire. Sheng Ma has the function of clearing heat and removing heat-toxin, and is more suitable for use in the condition of heat in the head and face, such as toothache and mouth ulcers. Mai Ya is able to promote digestion and is useful when patients suffer from poor appetite as a result of injury to the Qi and Yin of the Stomach. Zhu Ru (Bambusae caulis in taeniam) and Pi Pa Ye (eriobotryae folium) These two herbs can clear Stomach-heat, remove phlegm from the Stomach and soothe the Stomach- Qi. They can be used when the heat disturbs the Qi movement of the Stomach and its digestive func- tion. They can effectively treat nausea, vomiting and poor appetite. 101 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix), Shan Yao (Dioscoreae rhizoma), Jing Mi (non-glutinous rice) and Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) These four substances are often used in the recovery period of a febrile disease when the heat has injured the Stomach-Qi. The patient may feel tired and the appetite is poor. Dang Shen is used in conditions where the Qi is too weak to pit its efforts against the pathogenic heat, the Stomach-heat syndrome lingers and recov- ery takes a long period of time. Shan Yao has a similar function to Dang Shen but is gentle. Since it has an astringent taste, it is also able to stabilize the Stomach-Yin and can treat thirst. Jing Mi is often used to make porridge as it is light to digest and can tonify the Stomach-Qi. Prep- aration is simple: after cooking the rice with water for 1 hour, the porridge is ready to eat. Jing Mi por- ridge is the most commonly recommended food during and after a febrile disease. Zhi Gan Cao is used to tonify the Spleen-Qi and moisten the Stomach. It is also often used to protect the Stomach from the cold herbs that treat heat in the Stomach but which can easily injure the Stom- ach-Qi and Yang. Lu Gen (phragmitis rhizoma) and Tian Hua Fen (trichosanthis radix) These two herbs are able to nourish the Yin of the Stomach and are used in Stomach-heat syndrome when heat injures the Yin and fluid. Lu Gen is also able to soothe the Stomach-Qi and treats nausea and vomiting when the Stomach-Qi is disturbed by heat and fails to descend. Zhi Shi (aurantii fructus immaturus) and Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex) These two herbs are able to regulate the Qi and descend the Qi in the intestines. They reduce the distension of the abdomen and treat constipation, the symptoms that often accompany the condition of Qi and Yin deficiency of the Large Intestine due to heat consumption. Envoy: Harmonize herbs in the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and primarily enters the Spleen meridian. It is used for harmonizing and moderating the functions of herbs in formulas that clear heat of the Stomach and Large Intestine. Examples of classical formulas Qing Wei San (Clear the Stomach Powder) Source: Lan Shi Mi Cang Sheng Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix) 12 g Dang Gui (Angelicae sinensis radix) 6 g Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex) 9 g Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) 3–5 g Sheng Ma (Cimicifugae rhizoma) 6 g Analysis of the formula This formula is used to clear Stomach-fire and cool the blood. It treats toothache due to excess Stom- ach-fire. This symptom is often accompanied by flushed cheeks, bleeding or swollen gums, foul breath, thirst and a dry mouth. Patients may have a red tongue with a thin yellow coating and a slippery, rapid and forceful pulse. In this formula: • The very bitter and cold Huang Lian is used as chief to reduce the heat in the Stomach and dry the dampness in order to relieve pain and reduce the swelling. Since it enters the Heart and Liver meridians, which are the important organs to generate fire in pathological conditions, Huang Lian can strongly and effectively drain the fire. • Sheng Di Huang, as deputy, can nourish the Yin and cool the blood, enhancing the ability of the chief. Mu Dan Pi is also used as deputy; it can cool the blood and promote blood circulation so that it can relieve the burning pain. • Mu Dan Pi and Dang Gui are used as assistants in the formula. They promote blood circulation and prevent the stagnation that is caused by the heat-consuming and contracting nature of cold herbs. Sheng Ma also serves as assistant. It enters the Spleen meridian, has an ascending property, can disperse the heat and relieve toxicity in order to assist Huang Lian to drain the heat more effectively. 102


• Sheng Ma also serves as envoy to harmonize the herbs in the formula that enter the Stomach meridian. Commentary on strategies In this formula, the selected herbs precisely match the physiological and pathological characteristics of the Stomach. • The herbs that drain the heat and the herbs that disperse the heat are used together. • The herbs that cool the blood and the herbs that promote blood circulation are used together. Although there are only five herbs, the formula clearly shows the treatment principles and strategies and it is both a good formula to study and an effec- tive formula to use in clinical practice.

## 9 Syndrome of damp-heat in

<!-- chunk -->

## the Spleen and Large Intestine

Associated disorders in western medicine Gastroenteritis, dysentery, eczema, stomatitis. Analysis of the syndrome The Spleen is regarded as a Yin organ and it is easily injured by exterior damp-heat or cold. If the Spleen fails to transport water and food that has acc- umulated in the Middle-Jiao, this will eventually generate heat in a Yang constitution. Persistent accumulation of damp-heat in the Middle-Jiao may develop damp-heat in the Large Intestine. Both syndromes have a lingering process of pathological development. • If damp-heat accumulates in the Middle-Jiao, the transformation and transportation functions of the Spleen are impaired. Patients may suffer from loss of appetite and have a sticky sensation in the mouth. • When dampness blocks the movement of Qi, patients may suffer from distension in the stomach and abdomen. • As the Spleen governs the muscles and subcutaneous region of the body, damp-heat in the Middle-Jiao may cause heaviness of the limbs and body, and itchy and weeping skin disorders. • The Spleen is associated with the ability to study and think. If the Spleen is covered by dampness, individuals may suffer from poor concentration, an inability to study and have impaired memory. When the clear Qi of the Spleen is unable to ascend to support the Heart, one may have difficulty in observation and reactions. • When damp-heat accumulates in the Large Intestine and obstructs the Qi movement, irregular bowel movement, diarrhea, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, tenesmus and bearing-down sensations may occur. • If damp-heat injures the blood and the flesh, blood and mucus appear in the stool. Main symptoms Damp-heat in the Middle-Jiao: distension in the epigastric region and abdomen, reduced appetite, sticky sensation in the mouth, heavy limbs. Damp-heat in the Lower-Jiao: loose stools or diarrhea, irregular bowel movement, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, tenesmus and a bearing-down sensation in the abdomen, blood and mucus in the stools. Secondary symptoms Eczema or other itchy and weeping skin disorders, Bi syndrome of wind-damp-heat type, poor concentration, slow reactions, inability to study and impaired memory. Tongue Red with a yellow, sticky tongue coating. Pulse Soft. 103 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter to clear heat as they may easily injure the Spleen-Yang and cause further dampness accumulation. 3. avoid sweet herbs and food: Sweet herbs and food can easily retain dampness and they should not be used in the treatment. Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Promote Qi movement in the San Jiao; separate and eliminate damp-heat Ban Xia (pinelliae rhizoma) and Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) The combination of Ban Xia and Huang Qin is com- monly used to promote Qi movement in the Upper- and Middle-Jiao. Ban Xia is pungent and warm, and enters the Lung and Stomach meridians. As it can disperse the Qi, it can therefore eliminate dampness at the same time. It soothes the Stomach-Qi and can reduce the distending sensation in the stomach due to stagna- tion of the Qi and accumulation of dampness. Huang Qin is bitter and cold, and enters the Lung and Large Intestine meridians. It can clear heat and dry dampness of these organs. When these two herbs are used together, the Qi movement becomes active and the dampness and heat can be separated and eliminated more easily. Furthermore, both herbs can dry dampness directly. Xing Ren (armeniacae semen), Bai Dou Kou (amomi fructus rotundus) and Yi Yi Ren (Coicis semen) These three herbs are used together to disperse, transform and leach out dampness respectively in the San Jiao passage where the Qi and water pass. They treat the condition where damp-heat spreads itself in the Upper-, Middle- and Lower-Jiao. Xing Ren is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Lung and Large Intestine meridians. Its pungent and warm nature can disperse the Lung-Qi and the bitterness can descend the Qi. It can disperse the dampness in the Upper-Jiao and open up the Upper-Jiao. Bai Dou Kou is also pungent and warm but it enters the Spleen meridian. It can dry the dampness


1. Be aware of a long treatment course: When treating a damp-heat syndrome, patients should be made aware that the treatment course is long. In this syndrome, the Yang pathogenic factor (the heat) is mixed with the Yin pathogenic factor (the dampness) and the lingering dampness holds the heat. they form a complicated condition for treatment. Furthermore, they impair the Spleen and slow down digestive processes. all of these result in a fairly long treatment period. 2. avoid herbs with a strong action: to remove damp-heat, herbs with strong actions should be avoided. For instance, if the strong warm and pungent herbs are used, they expel the wind rather than disperse and transform dampness, which is a lingering pathogenic factor. Moreover, the warm and pungent herbs can consume the Yin of the body and make the syndrome more complicated in the long run. Strong bitter and cold herbs should not be used Treatment principle: Promote Qi movement in the San Jiao; separate and eliminate damp and heat 104


in the Middle-Jiao, regulate the Qi movement and reduce distension. Yi Yi Ren is bland and slightly cold, and enters the Spleen and Lung meridians. It can eliminate the dampness from the Middle- and Lower-Jiao and clear the heat there by increasing urination. When these three herbs are used together, they can separate and eliminate dampness, thus allowing the Qi to move freely in the San Jiao passage. Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex) Hou Po is pungent and warm, and enters the Lung, Spleen and Large Intestine meridians. It is an excellent herb to regulate the Qi in the San Jiao passage, and can effectively dissolve phlegm and dampness. Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix), Huang Bai (phellodendri cortex) and Bai Tou Weng (pulsatilla radix) These three herbs are bitter and cold. They enter the Large Intestine meridian and can dry and elimi- nate the dampness and clear the heat there. Huang Qin also enters the Lung and can treat the heat in both meridians and organs. Huang Bai enters the Kidney meridian and can also treat damp-heat in the Lower-Jiao and in the Bladder when there is urgent, painful and frequent urination. Bai Tou Weng particularly treats damp-heat in the Large Intestine. It can clear the heat-toxin and treat bleed- ing due to injury of the blood and flesh by damp- heat in the intestines. Since these herbs are very bitter and cold, they may injure the Spleen-Yang and cause further damp- ness accumulation. They should not be used for too long and they should be used with herbs that protect the Spleen. Deputy: Regulate the Qi in the San Jiao, eliminate dampness and clear heat Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) and Zhi Ke (aurantii fructus) These herbs are pungent in nature and enter the Lung and Stomach meridians. They can promote the Qi movement and remove the dampness and phlegm. The difference between them is that Chen Pi is warm and Zhi Ke is cold in temperature; thus they can be selected separately depending on treat- ment need. Huo Xiang (agastachis herba) and Pei Lan (eupatorii herba) These two herbs are aromatic and enter the Spleen and Stomach meridians. They are able to penetrate through the dampness and revive the function of the Spleen. They particularly treat dampness in the Middle-Jiao. Huo Xiang is warm and can disperse and dissolve dampness in the Middle-Jiao. It also enters the Lung meridian and can treat exterior dampness as well. It is used in the syndrome where nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramp are accompanied by fever, chills and a heavy sensation in the body. Pei Lan is also able to disperse dampness, but it is neutral and gentle. It transforms the dampness and is particularly effective for treating a sticky sensation in the mouth. Shi Chang Pu (acori graminei rhizoma), Yuan Zhi (polygalae radix), Zhu Ru (Bambusae caulis in taeniam) and Yu Jin (Curcumae radix) When the Spleen fails to transform food and water, dampness or damp-heat may accumulate. This may obstruct the connection between the Heart and the Spleen and lead to mental disorders, poor memory, inability to concentrate and slow reactions. These four herbs can eliminate the dampness and they treat dampness or damp-heat that covers the Heart orifice. Shi Chang Pu and Yuan Zhi are warm in temperature; Zhu Ru and Yu Jin are cold. They can be selected in the formula to treat dampness or damp-heat. Da Fu Pi (arecae pericarpium) and Bai Dou Kou (amomi fructus rotundus) These two herbs are able to promote Qi movement and dry dampness from the Spleen and Large Intest- ine. They are used for abdominal distension and irregular and difficult bowel movement even though the stools are not dry. Zhi Shi (aurantii fructus immaturus) and Bing Lang (arecae semen) These two herbs are able to regulate the Qi and descend the Qi in the intestines. They can be used for Qi obstruction by dampness in the intestines. The main symptoms are distension of the abdomen, and irregular and difficult bowel movement. As their actions are quite strong, they are only used in acute and excess conditions. In chronic conditions, espe- 105 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter cially in conditions of Spleen-Qi deficiency, they should be used with tonifying herbs. Yi Yi Ren (Coicis semen), Tong Cao (tetrapanacis medulla) and Hua Shi (talcum) These substances are cold and bland. They can eliminate damp-heat by promoting urination. They can be used in the formula to enhance the ability of separating dampness from heat in the body by increasing urination. Ma Chi Xian (portulacae herba) and Yu Xing Cao (houttuyniae herba cum radice) These herbs have the function of clearing heat and eliminating dampness in the intestines. They are often used to treat diarrhea and abdominal pain due to damp-heat accumulation in the intestines after ingesting polluted food and drink. Di Yu (Sanguisorbae radix), Huai Jiao (Sophorae fructus) and Huai Hua (Sophorae flos) Di Yu is bitter, sour and cold. It treats damp-heat in the intestines when heat predominates, which is manifested as bleeding. This herb cools the blood and stops bleeding, and stabilizes and holds the blood. As it can reduce swelling and stop pain, it is suitable for treating external hemorrhoids. Huai Jiao is cold, and its function is to clear heat and reduce fire in the intestines. Since it moves downwards, it is very effective for treating hemorrhoids and is often added to creams for topical use. Huai Hua is slightly cold. Its ability to clear heat and cool blood is not as strong as the other two herbs, but its functions of stopping bleeding and dispersing heat are stronger than those of Huai Jiao. It is an important herb for treating dysentery and hemorrhoids. Assistant: Eliminate dampness; tonify Spleen; promote digestion and regulate the Qi Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix), Qin Jiao (Gentianae macrophyllae radix) and Cang Zhu (atractylodis rhizoma) These three herbs are pungent and all have dis- persing functions, particularly that of eliminating dampness. They are mainly used for dampness accu- mulation in the muscles, which is associated with dysfunction of the Spleen when dampness obstructs the meridians. Fang Feng is pungent and slightly warm, and enters the Spleen meridian. It can disperse wind- dampness, ascend the clear Qi of the Spleen and eliminate the dampness from the muscles and sub- cutaneous region. It treats heaviness and uneasy sensation in the muscles. Fang Feng can also promote digestion in the sense of reducing distension from the intestines. Qin Jiao is pungent, bitter and neutral, and enters the Stomach and Large Intestine meridians. As it is able to slightly induce sweating, it can disperse dampness in the superficial region of the body. It treats stiffness, heaviness and pain of the muscles. Cang Zhu is very pungent and warm. It can directly dry the dampness in the Middle-Jiao. As it can also slightly induce sweating, it can disperse wind and dampness from the superficial region of the body. Han Fang Ji (Stephaniae tetrandrae radix) and Yi Yi Ren (Coicis semen) These two herbs are able to eliminate damp-heat, increase urination and relax the tendons and muscles. They can be used to treat Bi syndrome due to damp- heat in the Middle-Jiao when burning, heavy and painful sensations of muscles are present. Bai Bian Dou (Dolichoris lablab semen), Fu Ling (poria) and Bai Zhu (atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) These herbs are able to tonify the Spleen-Qi as well as eliminate dampness from the Middle-Jiao. Bai Bian Dou not only has a very gentle function of tonifying the Spleen-Qi but is also able to trans- form dampness. Because it is an astringent herb it can stabilize the fluid in the intestines. This herb is particularly useful for treating chronic diarrhea due to Spleen-Qi deficiency and dampness accumulation in the Middle-Jiao. Fu Ling is bland and neutral, and enters the Spleen and Bladder meridians. It is able to tonify the Spleen and leach out dampness from the Middle- and Lower-Jiao by promoting urination. Bai Zhu can directly dry dampness in the Middle- Jiao as it is pungent and warm, and enters the Spleen meridian directly. It has a relatively strong function in tonifying the Spleen-Qi compared with the other two herbs. It is often used in the syndrome where dampness accumulates in the Middle-Jiao when the Spleen-Qi is too weak to transform and transport it. 106


Fo Shou (Citri sarcodactylis fructus), He Ye (Nelumbinis folium), Sha Ren (amomi xanthioidis fructus), Mai Ya (hordei fructus germinatus) and Shen Qu (Massa medicata fermentata) These herbs are able to promote digestion, regulate the Qi in the Middle-Jiao and revive the function of the Spleen and Stomach. They are often used in the recovery period of syndromes of damp-heat in the Spleen and Large Intestine. Fo Shou is also able to spread the Liver-Qi and is more suitable for treating distension in the stomach and hypochondriac regions, and patients with a depressive mood. He Ye has a light fragrant smell and can revive the Spleen so as to eliminate dampness and improve appetite. Sha Ren is pungent and warm, and enters the Spleen, Large Intestine and Kidney meridians. In particular, it can relieve distension in the abdomen and treat Qi stagnation with dampness in the Large Intestine. Mai Ya and Shen Qu are often selected to treat poor appetite because they aid the digestion of wheat, rice and cereal products, respectively. Ku Shen (Sophorae flavescentis radix), Di Fu Zi (Kochiae fructus) and Bai Xian Pi (Dictamni cortex) These herbs are bitter and cold, are able to clear heat and transform dampness from the Middle- and Lower-Jiao, increase urination and eliminate damp- ness. They are mainly used for treating skin disor- ders, where red, itchy and weeping skin lesions are often present. Ku Shen enters the Heart meridian and can treat heat in the Heart; the heat is also transported to the Small Intestine. It has the strongest function of clearing damp-heat among these three herbs and it can effectively treat infectious skin diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, scabies and fungi. Di Fu Zi is pungent in nature and enters the Kidney and Bladder meridians. It is able to expel wind and can effectively stop itch, particularly in the genital area. It is also effective for treating painful urinary dysfunction. Bai Xian Pi enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. It can effectively reduce damp-heat in the Middle-Jiao and reduce jaundice. Envoy: Slow down the action of pungent herbs Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) In formulas that treat damp-heat, as the chief, deputy and assistant herbs are not harsh in action or extreme in temperature, an envoy is not usually necessary. Zhi Gan Cao, the most commonly used envoy, is not suitable for use in this case as sweet- ness may hold onto and generate dampness. However, Zhi Gan Cao is sometimes used to slow down the action of pungent herbs and leads to a steady and lasting result of eliminating dampness. Examples of classical formulas Xie Huang San (Drain the Yellow Powder) Source: Xiao Er Yao Zheng Zhi Jue Honey and alcohol processed Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix) 120 g Shi Gao (Gypsum) 15 g Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) 6 g Huo Xiang (Agastachis herba) 21 g Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) 90 g Analysis of the formula This formula can drain and treat smoldering fire in the Spleen which is caused by dampness accumula- tion. The disorder results in mouth ulcers with foul breath, frequent thirst and hunger, and a dry mouth and lips. Patients may have a red tongue with a yellow and sticky coating and a rapid pulse. In this syndrome, the Yang pathogenic factor (the fire) is caused by the Yin pathogenic factor (the dampness) and they bring a dilemma to the treat- ment. In order to reduce heat, cold herbs should be used, but they may injure the Spleen-Yang and further generate dampness in the Middle-Jiao that blocks the Qi movement, and, finally, increases the smoldering fire. For treating dampness, pungent and warm herbs should be used, but they may increase heat in the Middle-Jiao. This formula shows us how to deal with this complicated condition. 107 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter In this formula: • Fang Feng, which is pungent, slightly warm and enters the Spleen meridian, is used in a large dosage as chief herb. It is able to expel the wind and eliminate the dampness from the Spleen, and thus reduce the smoldering fire and constrained Qi in the Middle-Jiao. • Shi Gao and Zhi Zi serve as deputies. They clear the heat since both of them are cold in temperature. Moreover, as Shi Gao is pungent and Zhi Zi is dispersing in nature, both can disperse the smoldering fire. • Huo Xiang is used as assistant. Its aromatic smell can revive the Spleen and stimulate the function of the Spleen, thereby eliminating the dampness. The aromatic nature of Huo Xiang can also assist the chief, Fang Feng, to disperse and ascend the Qi and the smoldering fire. • The processing procedure of using honey and dry-frying the herbs can moderate the strong functions of the aromatic and pungent herbs because it needs time to reduce heat and eliminate dampness from the Spleen. Alcohol is also used in the processing and enhances the dispersing function of the herbs to eliminate the dampness and constrained Qi. They play the roles of assistants. • Gan Cao is used primarily as assistant. It is able to tonify the Spleen and protect the Middle-Jiao in the process of reducing heat and dispersing dampness. In a formula to remove dampness, it, together with honey, slows down the speed of pungent herbs and leads to a steady and lasting effect of eliminating dampness. • Gan Cao is also used as envoy to harmonize the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies To treat a complicated condition where the patho- genic factors are opposite in nature, this formula outlines a strategy to separate them and eliminate them without causing side effects on the body. • First of all, Fang Feng, in most cases, is used to expel wind and release exterior syndrome. In this formula, it is used to disperse and ascend the constrained Qi and therefore disperse the smoldering heat in the Spleen. • Secondly, the combination of herbs that have a descending and an ascending nature can activate Analysis of the formula This formula is able to clear heat, eliminate heat- toxin, cool the blood and stop diarrhea. It is used to treat heat-toxin and dampness accumulation in the intestines; however, it obstructs Qi and injures the blood. The manifestations are abdominal pain, ten- esmus, a burning sensation around the anus, diarrhea containing more blood than pus, and thirst. Patients often have a red tongue with a yellow coating, and a wiry and rapid pulse. In this syndrome, heat predo- minates and is manifested in the amount of blood in the stool and the burning sensation around the anus. In this formula: • Bai Tou Weng is chosen as chief to directly reduce the heat and cool the blood. As it enters the Large Intestine meridian, it can effectively clear heat-toxin there. • Huang Lian and Huang Bai are deputies. They are bitter and cold, and enter the Middle- and Lower-Jiao, respectively. They can effectively clear the heat and dry the dampness in the intestines. • Qin Pi serves as assistant; it is bitter, cold and astringent, can clear heat and eliminate dampness, as well as bind up the intestines to stop diarrhea. It is an essential herb in the treatment of chronic conditions where diarrhea lasts for a long time and the Spleen-Qi has been injured. Bai Tou Weng (Pulsatilla radix) 15 g Huang Bai (Phellodendri cortex) 12 g Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) 4–6 g Qin Pi (Fraxini cortex) 12 g the Qi, thus effectively reducing heat and dampness. • Finally, the special processing procedure carries out the same treatment principle and leads to a steady and effective therapeutic result.

Commentary on strategies This formula is only described in order to demon- strate the treatment for a typical syndrome of damp-heat in the intestines. In clinical practice, this formula should be used with variation. In acute and excess conditions, Qin Pi should not be used. Some herbs should be added, such as: • Di Yu (Sanguisorbae radix) and Huai Hua (Sophorae flos), which can enhance the ability of Bai Tou Weng to cool the blood • Zhi Ke (Aurantii fructus) and Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix), which can moderate the Liver-Qi and reduce the urgent, frequent bowel movements and tenesmus • Jing Jie (Schizonepetae herba) and Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus), which can open the obstruction of Qi and blood. Shao Yao Tang (Peony Decoction) Source: Bao Ming Ji amount of blood and mucus in stools. The heat-toxin shows in the burning sensation around the anus. In this formula: • Bai Shao Yao is used in a large dosage as the chief to tonify the blood and soften the Liver. • The functions of the chief are enhanced by several groups of deputy herbs: – Dang Gui, which tonifies the blood and promotes the blood circulation. – Gan Cao, which can moderate and ease the muscles, thus relieving abdominal pain. – Huang Qin and Huang Lian, which can directly clear heat and dry the dampness in the intestines. – Mu Xiang and Bing Lang, which can promote the Qi movement in the intestines and relieve abdominal pain and tenesmus. • Da Huang, a bitter and cold purgative herb, serves as assistant. It assists Huang Qin and Huang Lian to purge the heat in the process of clearing the heat, and assists Mu Xiang and Bing Lang to purge the damp-heat-toxin accumulation in the intestines. • Rou Gui, which is sweet and warm, is used as a corrective assistant to prevent the bitter and cold herbs injuring the Yang, which often occurs when the Qi and blood have been weak for a long time. It can also assist Dang Gui to reinforce the action of promoting blood circulation. Commentary on strategies This formula shows a clear structure in composition and function from selecting different groups of herbs. • It treats dysfunction of Qi and blood at the same time, and treats heat and cold, excess and deficiency at the same time. This is demonstrated in the use of warm herbs and cold herbs together, with emphasis on using cold herbs for a heat syndrome. This formula suggests the following strategies for treating damp-heat in the intestines: • Regulate the blood in order to stop the bleeding; this strategy is represented by using Bai Shao Yao, Dang Gui and Rou Gui. • Regulate the Qi in order to relieve tenesmus; this strategy is represented by using Mu Xiang, Bing Lang and Da Huang. Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) 15–20 g Dang Gui (Angelicae sinensis radix) 9 g Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) 5 g Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) 5–9 g Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) 9 g Mu Xiang (Aucklandiae radix)** 5 g Bing Lang (Arecae semen) 5 g Da Huang (Rhei rhizoma) 9 g Rou Gui (Cinnamomi cassiae cortex) 2–5 g Analysis of the formula This formula can regulate Qi and blood, clear heat- toxin and eliminate dampness in the intestines. It treats the damp-heat-toxin accumulation in the intestines. The Qi and blood are injured and obstructed. The manifestations are abdominal pain, tenesmus, difficult defecation, diarrhea containing mucus and blood in equal amounts, and a burning sensation around the anus. Patients have a red tongue with a yellow, sticky coating and a rapid pulse. In this syndrome, the heat and dampness are equal in strength and are manifested in the equal 109 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter Associated disorders in western medicine Bronchitis, pneumonia, common cold, influenza and constipation. Analysis of the syndrome In traditional Chinese medicine, the Lung is consid- ered to be a light, thin and fragile organ. Heat and cold may easily injure this organ. • When heat invades the Lung and disturbs its dispersing and descending functions, patients may have cough, chest pain, shortness of breath and wheezing. • The symptom of dryness appears quickly if the fluid of the Lung is injured. Patients may feel thirsty, and have dry nasal passages and dry lips. • Since skin is related to the Lung, skin rashes may appear when wind-heat invades the Lung. • The throat is the gateway of the Lung and the excess heat in the Lung may also bring such symptoms as sore throat and hoarseness. When heat injures the blood vessels, nose bleeds may occur. • When the Lung-Qi is unable to disperse and descend, the Qi movement in the Large Intestine can be blocked too. The main disorders are irregular and difficult bowel movements and pain in the abdomen. Treatment principle: Clear the heat in the Lung Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Clear heat and reduce fire and fire-toxin of the Lung Shi Gao (Gypsum) Shi Gao is pungent, sweet and very cold. It enters the Lung and Stomach meridians. This mineral sub- stance is often selected as chief because it can intensively reduce the heat and at the same time generate the body fluid in the Lung. It matches the pathological change of heat in the Lung perfectly and is often used in the acute period when the heat invading the Lung has already injured the fluid of the Lung, or has a tendency to injure the fluid there. Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) and Sang Bai Pi (Mori cortex) Huang Qin and Sang Bai Pi are bitter and cold, and enter the Lung meridian. They can clear heat and descend the fire from the Lung, and treat cough, thirst and shortness of breath. Huang Qin can clear damp-heat by blocking the San Jiao passage so that the Lung-Qi is not able to descend. In this situation, there may be a sense of fullness in the chest, restless, irritability and reduced appetite. Huang Qin is often used together with Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) and Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) to regulate the Qi. Sang Bai Pi is able to clear heat, direct the Lung-Qi downwards and remove phlegm. It can drain the water from the Lung and promote urina- tion. It is selected in the formula if there is shortness of breath and cough due to Lung-Qi obstruction or fluid accumulation in the Lung. Main symptoms Fever, sweat, cough with green sputum, chest pain, shortness of breath, wheezing, thirst and a preference for cold drinks, dry nasal passages and dry lips. Secondary symptoms Sore throat, hoarseness, nose bleeds, skin rashes, irregular and difficult bowel movement and distending pain in the abdomen. Tongue Red in the front part of the tongue, yellow coating. Pulse Superficial and forceful in the Lung position, or rapid and slippery. This formula also demonstrates some other strat- egies, such as using Bai Shao Yao and Gan Cao to moderate the tension in the abdomen, and using Dang Gui and Rou Gui to protect the blood and prevent blood stagnation from the cold herbs.

## the Lung


Deputy: Nourish the body fluids, clear the heat in the related organ and cool the blood Tian Hua Fen (trichosanthis radix) and Lu Gen (phragmitis rhizoma) Tian Hua Fen and Lu Gen are sweet and cold, and enter the Lung and Stomach meridians. They are often used in the syndrome of excess heat in the Lung when the heat has injured the fluid and causes dryness in the Lung. Both herbs can clear heat, generate the body fluids and relieve thirst, dry cough, chest pain and dryness in the mouth. Gua Lou Ren (trichosanthis semen) and Zhi Shi (aurantii fructus immaturus) Gua Lou Ren and Zhi Shi are cold in temperature. Both can clear heat in the Lung and Large Intestine, remove phlegm in the Lung and at the same time promote bowel movement. They are principally selected in the formula to treat cough with green sputum and fullness in the chest and abdomen. They can descend the Qi in the intestines, as well as treat- ing constipation. Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix) and Bai Mao Gen (Imperatae rhizoma) Sheng Di Huang and Bai Mao Gen are sweet and cold. They can clear heat and cool the blood, and can be used for bleeding conditions when the heat has injured the blood in the Lung, such as nose bleeds and expectoration of bloody sputum. Moreo- ver, both herbs are able to nourish the Yin and increase body fluids. They are used in the syndrome where the heat has already injured the blood and consumed the Yin and fluid of the Lung. Assistant: Disperse the constrained heat and treat related symptoms caused by the heat; protect the Lung and Stomach Jie Geng (platycodi radix) Jie Geng has an ascending nature and enters the Lung meridian. It is often used to disperse the Lung-Qi and reduce the smoldering heat in the Lung, which is the result of obstruction of the Lung-Qi by excess heat and by using strong herbs to clear heat and descend the Qi. Pi Pa Ye (eriobotryae folium), Gua Lou (trichosanthis fructus) and Chuan Bei Mu (Fritillariae cirrhosae bulbus) These three herbs are cold in temperature, can clear heat, direct the Qi downwards and remove phlegm from the Lung. They are used for treating cough, shortness of breath and expectoration of green sputum. Bai He (Lilii bulbus) Bai He is sweet, bland and slightly cold, and enters the Lung and Heart meridians. It can nourish the Yin and slightly tonify the Qi of the Lung and Heart. It is selected in the formula to reduce excess and deficiency of heat in the Lung when the pathogenic heat has injured the Yin and Qi in a febrile disease. Patients’ main complaints are of a warm, blocked sensation in the chest, restlessness and depression, a dry cough, insomnia and dream-disturbed sleep. Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao can tonify the Qi, together with cold herbs to generate the Yin and body fluids. It can protect the Lung and Stomach from the cold herbs as its sweet taste can smooth and moderate the function and speed of the cold herbs. Envoy: Harmonize herbs in the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and can harmonize the func- tion of herbs in a formula. However, it should not be used if there is excessive phlegm in the Lung because sweetness may easily keep hold of the phlegm. Examples of classical formulas Xie Bai San (Drain the White Powder) Source: Xiao Er Yao Zheng Zhi Jue Sang Bai Pi (Mori cortex) 30 g Di Gu Pi (Lycii cortex) 30 g Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) 3 g Jing Mi (non-glutinous rice) 15–30 g 111 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter Analysis of the formula This formula can drain the heat from the Lung and relieve wheezing. It is used to treat heat in the Lung and the body fluid if the Lung is injured. The man- ifestations are cough, wheezing, feverish sensation that worsens in the afternoon, a dry mouth, a red tongue with a yellow coating and a thready and rapid pulse. In this formula: • Sang Bai Pi is used as chief; it is sweet and cold, enters the Lung meridian, and can strongly, effectively and safely drain the heat of the Lung and protect the fluid there. • Di Gu Pi serves as deputy; it can enter the Lung and Kidney meridians and can directly enter the Yin level. It can therefore effectively reduce smoldering heat of the Lung and empty-heat from the Kidney. • Jing Mi and Gan Cao tonify the Stomach and Spleen, and strengthen the Middle-Jiao so as to generate the Yin and Qi of the Lung. This strategy is referred to as cultivating the Earth and generating the Metal. Commentary on strategies • This formula is characterized by reducing the mild smoldering heat in the Lung rather than clearing the excess heat or nourishing the Yin of the Lung. • It is used for the late stage and the recovery stage of warm-febrile diseases, and a mild syndrome of cough and wheezing due to mild smoldering heat in the Lung, such as in the recovery period of bronchitis in children. Wei Jing Tang (Reed Decoction) Source: Bei Ji Qian Jin Yao Fang Analysis of the formula This formula clears heat from the Lung, eliminates phlegm and discharges pus. It is used to treat lung abscess, which is caused by heat-toxin in the Lung and the heat injures the organ and flesh that form the abscess. The symptoms are cough and expector- ation of foul-smelling sputum that may be streaked with blood, slight fever, mild chest pain, a red tongue with a yellow and sticky coating, and a slip- pery and rapid pulse. In this formula: • Lu Gen, which is sweet and cold, and enters the Lung and Stomach meridian, is used as chief to transform the phlegm and discharge pus. The strong point of this herb is that it can nourish the fluid of the Lung as well as remove the phlegm and pus from the Lung at the same time. It is particularly useful in the situation where heat has injured the fluid and damaged the flesh. • Yi Yi Ren is sweet and cold, and enters the Lung and Spleen meridians. It is used as deputy to dissolve the damp-heat from the Upper- and Middle-Jiao. • Dong Gua Zi, as assistant, is used in large dosage to eliminate phlegm and pus. It enhances the abilities of Lu Gen and Yi Yin Ren. • Tao Ren is used as assistant to promote blood circulation and break up congealed blood. When the blood circulates properly, the healing process starts. Tao Ren is pungent and warm, and can disperse heat, thus reducing the constrained heat formed by abscess. Commentary on strategies In particular, this formula suggests the herb combi- nations for eliminating pus from the Lung. • It outlines the role of the blood circulation in the healing process of abscesses. • It treats constrained heat by using Tao Ren to promote blood circulation and break up congealed blood.

Treatment principle: Reduce heat and nourish the Yin of the Kidney Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Clear heat and nourish the Yin of the Kidney Zhi Mu (anemarrhenae rhizoma) and Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix) Zhi Mu and Xuan Shen are bitter and cold. Both enter the Kidney meridian. They can reduce the heat and nourish the Yin of the Kidney. They can be used as chief herbs in a formula to reduce the empty-heat of the Kidney. Moreover, since Zhi Mu enters the Lung meridian and Xuan Shen can ascend the Kidney-water to reduce the fire of the Heart, Zhi Mu can be used in conditions where thirst and fever exist, and Xuan Shen can be used in cases of restlessness and insomnia. Huang Bai (phellodendri cortex) Huang Bai is bitter and cold, and enters the Kidney meridian. It is able to reduce the empty-fire of the Kidney and is used to treat spermatorrhea, hot flushes and night sweats. It can also clear the damp- heat in the Lower-Jiao and can treat turbid and scanty urine, and difficult and painful urination. Deputy: Nourish the body fluids, clear heat in the related organ and cool the blood Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix), Tian Men Dong (asparagi radix) and Nu Zhen Zi (Ligustri lucidi fructus) These three herbs are bitter, cold and sweet, and all enter the Kidney meridian. They serve as deputies to nourish the Yin and clear the heat of the Kidney. They can be used separately or together, depending on the degree of Yin deficiency. Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix), Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex) and Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix) These three herbs are cold in temperature and they enter the blood. They can cool the blood and stop bleeding, and can be used in bleeding conditions such as heavy menstruation and blood in the urine. Associated disorders in western medicine Urinary tract infection, menopause syndrome, hyperthyroidism and chronic periodontitis. Analysis of the syndrome The Kidney is an organ that stores the essence and is believed never to have had a real excess syndrome during pathogenic processes. However, sometimes the empty-heat in the Kidney can be very strong and may further consume the essence and Yin of the Kidney. • Yin deficiency with excess fire and empty- fire may cause night sweats, bone steaming, low-grade fever, restlessness, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, bleeding gums and spermatorrhea. • Although the Bladder stores the urine, the Kidney controls the opening and closing of the Bladder. If heat invades the Lower-Jiao, consumes the Yin and fluid, and obstructs the Qi, turbid and scanty urine, and difficult and painful urination may appear. Main symptoms Night sweats, bone steaming, low-grade fever. Secondary symptoms Restlessness, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, chronic bleeding gums without pain, loss of teeth, spermatorrhea, turbid, scanty and dark urine, difficult and painful urination. Tongue Red with a yellow coating or without coating. Pulse Rapid.

113 Internal heat syndrome and formula compositionChapter Assistant: Regulate the Qi and recover the function of the involved organs Ku Shen (Sophorae flavescentis radix) and Ze Xie (alismatis rhizoma) These two herbs are cold in temperature and enter the Kidney meridian. They can reduce the damp- heat from the Lower-Jiao and treat turbid, scanty and dark urine, and difficult and painful urination. As they have a downward-moving tendency, they can descend fire and the Qi. Moreover, Ku Shen is able to dry damp-heat and can be used orally or topically to treat foul vaginal discharge and itch in the genital region, such as in vaginitis. Ze Xie can reduce dampness by promoting urination and can also be used for edema in the legs. Envoy: Harmonize herbs in the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao, as in the other conditions of internal heat syndrome, can be used in the formula to har- monize and moderate the functions of herbs and to protect the Stomach. However, in a damp-heat syndrome of the Lower-Jiao, Zhi Gan Cao – which has a tendency to retain dampness because of its sweet nature – should be used with caution. Examples of classical formulas Dang Gui Liu Huang Tang (Tangkuei and Six Yellow Decoction) Source: Lan Shi Mi Cang Analysis of the formula This formula nourishes the Yin and reduces heat of the Kidney, and is used particularly to stop sweating caused by Yin deficiency with severe empty-heat. The severe empty-heat manifests as night sweats, a red face, dry lips, irritability, constipation, dark and scanty urine, a red tongue with a yellow coating and a rapid pulse. In this formula: • Dang Gui, Sheng Di Huang and Shu Di Huang are used as chief herbs to tonify blood and Yin in order to treat the cause of the empty-heat. • Huang Bai, Huang Lian and Huang Qin serve as deputies. They are used to clear the heat in the Lower-, Middle- and Upper-Jiao respectively, so as to powerfully control the heat and prevent further Yin consumption. • Huang Qi, as assistant, tonifies the Qi, which is injured by the heat. It strengthens the exterior and therefore stops sweating. Commentary on strategies • The composition is characterized by using two groups of herbs that nourish the Yin and reduce fire. These groups support each other in stopping the pathological change. • Moreover, herbs that usually reduce excess fire, such as Huang Lian and Huang Qin, can be used to reduce the severe empty-heat when the heat is intense. However, they must be used in combination with Yin-tonifying herbs such as Sheng Di Huang and Shu Di Huang. These herbs should not be used long term in the process of reducing the intensive empty-heat. • As soon as the heat is less strong, herbs that reduce the empty-heat and nourish the Yin should be used, such as Zhi Mu (Anemarrhenae rhizoma), and Han Lian Cao (Ecliptae herba).

## The internal cold syndrome• Cold has a contracting nature, can directly

obstruct Qi movement and cause the typical symptom of cramping pain, which can be relieved by warmth. • Cold obstructs the warm spreading of Yang, the movement of the Qi and the circulation of the blood. Patients therefore suffer from cold sensation, severe pain and cramp of the muscles, and stiffness of limbs, such as in a Bi syndrome caused by wind, cold and dampness. Through inappropriate consumption of cold food and drink, the exogenous pathogenic cold can directly enter the Stomach and accumulate in the Middle-Jiao. • When cold obstructs the Yang and Qi, patients may have acute cramping pain in the stomach or abdomen, and may have diarrhea. The internal cold syndrome can be caused by Yang deficiency in different organs. • Kidney-Yang deficiency is often seen in elderly people, people with a poor constitution and patients with chronic diseases. When the Kidney-Yang fails to accelerate water metabolism, edema or frequent urination may occur. When the Kidney-Yang and Qi are unable to warm the Lower-Jiao and maintain its function, impotence, infertility, dysmenorrhea and aqueous-grainy diarrhea may occur. • Spleen-Yang deficiency often occurs in people with chronic disorders of digestion. When the Spleen-Yang is too weak to warm the internal organs, meridians and muscles, it causes a cold sensation and cramping pain of the abdomen and diarrhea. When the Qi in the Middle-Jiao is too weak, distension of the abdomen and poor appetite appear. • Heart-Yang deficiency exists in people who have been under stress and emotional distress for a long period of time, or in patients who suffer from severe heart and lung diseases. When the Yang in the chest is too weak to promote the Qi movement and blood circulation, palpitations, shortness of breath and chest pain start. (See Figure 4.1 on page 128.) Syndrome of Yang collapse The syndrome of Yang collapse is caused by serious disturbance of the balance among Yin, Yang, Qi and blood under the influence of pathogenic factors. Main symptoms 1. Cold and severe pain of the limbs, cramp of the muscles, stiffness of the body. 2. Cramping pain of the abdomen, a preference for warm drinks, diarrhea or soft stool without a strong smell, distension of the abdomen and poor appetite. 3. Edema or frequent urination. 4. Impotence, infertility, aqueous-grainy diarrhea. 5. Yang collapse syndrome: Palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain and a stifling sensation in the chest, shallow breathing and profuse sweating, pallid complexion, indifferent expression and slow reactions. 6. Floating-Yang syndrome: Flushed face, a floating red color that appears only on the cheeks, heavy sweating, weak and cold limbs, a pale or light purple tongue with a moist coating, and a weak and rootless pulse. Secondary symptoms Dysmenorrhea with cramping pain in the lateral sides of the lower abdomen, depression. Tongue Pale, purple or bluish color with a white coating. Pulse Deep, slow and weak. Associated disorders in western medicine Arthritis, chronic colitis, peptic ulcer, gastritis, enteritis, influenza, liver diseases, hypothyroidism, chronic nephritis, myocardial infarction, myocardi- tis, severe blood loss, trauma, severe dehydration and allergies. Analysis of the syndrome An internal cold syndrome develops under several conditions. The exogenous pathogenic cold can directly cause internal cold syndrome. After exposure to cold, rain or snow, the exogenous pathogenic cold can invade the body through skin and subcutaneous tissue, and thereafter enter the meridians and inter- nal organs. 119 The internal cold syndrome and formula compositionChapter When blood and Yin are suddenly weakened, or Qi and blood are suddenly obstructed, they fail to support the Yang and the Yang collapses. • Since Heart-Yang and Kidney-Yang are the principal Yang of the body, Yang collapse means Heart-Yang collapse and Kidney-Yang collapse. In these severe and acute conditions, patients suffer from extremely cold extremities, a severe cold sensation that cannot be alleviated by warmth, chest pain with a stifling sensation and shallow breath. • When the Qi is too weak to hold the Yang, heavy sweating may start. • When the Heart-Qi is unable to support the Heart-shen, pallid complexion, indifferent expression and slow reactions are shown. (See Figure 4.2 on page 128.) Floating-Yang syndrome Like the collapse of Yang, floating-Yang syndrome is a dangerous situation. It appears when the Kidney- Yang is extremely weak and the internal cold in the Lower-Jiao is at its maximum. • When the cold forces the Yang to move upwards, the manifestations are flushed face, a floating red color that appears only on the cheeks and heavy sweating. • The cold manifests as very weak and cold limbs, a pale or light purple tongue with a moist coating, and a weak and rootless pulse. (See Figure 4.3 on page 128.) Treatment principle: Warm the Yang of the Heart, Spleen and Kidney; expel cold; harmonize the Qi and blood can tonify Qi of the internal organs and thereby gently promote the function of the Yang are selected. • A small amount of sour and cold herbs should be selected to nourish the Yin and blood and generate the body fluids, as well as reduce the side effects of pungent and hot herbs. • Herbs that regulate Qi and blood, can dry cold- dampness and eliminate it can be used. • In the syndrome of Yang collapse, if the Yang is extremely weak and the internal cold exceeds its maximum, and the conflict between the cold pathogenic factor and the hot herbs is very severe, a small amount of cold herb, which follows the nature of the pathogenic cold, can be added. This herb serves as strategic assistant in the large amount of hot herbs used to reduce the conflict and is helpful in fulfilling the therapeutic effect.


1. Make a clear differentiation: In many conditions, when the Qi is obstructed, cold sensation can also appear. When the Yin is too weak to nourish the tendons and muscles, cramp of limbs may also appear. Many patients with blood deficiency also have Yin deficiency with heat in the blood; they are often afraid of cold since the Qi is not strong. a clear and correct differentiation of the syndrome is therefore required at the outset. 2. protect the Yin: Many of the herbs in the formula that warm the interior are very pungent and hot, and can consume the Yin and body fluids if they are used for too long or in a large dosage. they may bring about side effects, such as dry mouth, throat and nasal passages, thirst, sore throat, constipation, itchy and dry skin, a burning sensation in the stomach and palpitations. thus they should not be used long term or in large dosage, especially in patients with Yin and blood deficiency. 3. Caution in bleeding conditions and pregnancy: In formulas that warm the interior, very pungent and hot herbs, which are able to stimulate the blood circulation, should not be used in bleeding conditions or in pregnancy. 120


Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Directly stimulate the Yang or tonify the Yang, warm the internal organs and meridians and expel cold These herbs are pungent and hot, and can directly scatter internal cold. They are used for treating excess internal cold syndrome. They can also stimu- late the Yang of the internal organs and accelerate their functions so as to disperse the internal cold in both excess and deficiency conditions. Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) and Xi Xin (asari herba)* Gui Zhi and Xi Xin are able to warm meridians, promote Qi movement and blood circulation, and expel cold. They are selected in formulas to warm the meridians and treat Bi syndrome. Gui Zhi is sweet and warm, and primarily enters the Heart meridian. It has an aromatic smell that gives this herb a thin pungent property, which makes it move quickly and lightly. It can particularly warm the blood, stimulate the Heart and promote the blood circulation; thus it can treat cold hands and feet, cramp of the muscles and pain due to cold obstruction of the blood circulation. In addition, Gui Zhi also enters the Lung and Bladder meridians, is able to expel wind and cold in the superficial region and can therefore treat exterior wind-cold syndrome. Xi Xin is a very pungent and hot herb with an aromatic smell. It enters the Kidney meridian. Because of its strong aromatic smell, pungent taste and hot nature, it can easily penetrate into the deep regions of the body. It is very effective in eliminat- ing cold and wind in these regions, such as the bones and tendons, as its ability to enter the Kidney merid- ian makes it easy to reach these structures. Xi Xin has the characteristic of seeking and eliminating wind, cold and dampness no matter if they are in the corners or chinks of the deep regions of the body. It is often used to stop pain when wind, cold and dampness stay in the deep regions of the body and the Kidney-Yang is weak. In such cases, patients not only have pain and a cold sensation in the affected joints, they also feel pain in the bones. They have difficulty with walking or cannot stand for long, have very stiff and painful tendons, especially in the lower body, feel cold in the extremities and are also afraid of cold. In winter or humid weather all the symptoms get worse. The side effects of Xi Xin are the likelihood of injuring the Yin, blood and body fluids and it can weaken the Qi. As Xi Xin is a poisonous herb, the dosage should be controlled carefully. Gao Liang Jiang (alpiniae officinari rhizoma), Wu Zhu Yu (evodiae fructus) and Ding Xiang (Caryophylli flos) All of these herbs are pungent and warm, and enter the Stomach meridian. They can warm the Stomach, expel cold and relieve cramping pain of the Stomach. Gao Liang Jiang is hot and pungent, and its action is strong in warming the Stomach and alleviating pain. It can be used as chief in the formula to treat cramping pain in the upper abdomen, vomiting of clear fluid and a preference for warm drinks, such as in chronic gastritis and gastroduodenal ulcer. Wu Zhu Yu is very pungent, bitter and hot, and enters the Liver, Spleen and Kidney meridians. It can warm the meridian, descend the Liver-Qi and treat ascending of the Liver-Qi due to excess cold in the Liver meridian. The indication is headache, particularly on the top of the head. In addition, Wu Zhu Yu can spread the Liver-Qi and can be used when the Liver-Qi attacks the Stomach, which man- ifests as cramping pain with a cold sensation in the Stomach and in the lateral sides of the lower abdomen, vomiting of clear fluid, and a wiry and slow pulse. This pattern can be found in disorders such as migraine, hypertension, peptic ulcer, chronic gastritis and dysmenorrhea. Ding Xiang is warm and pungent, and enters the Stomach, Spleen, Lung and Kidney meridians. It can descend the Stomach-Qi, expel cold and reduce the cramping pain. It treats belching and hiccup caused by coldness in the Stomach. Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma), Xiao Hui Xiang (Foeniculi fructus), Cao Dou Kou (alpiniae katsumadai semen) and Hua Jiao (Zanthoxyli fructus) All of these herbs are pungent and warm, and enter the Spleen meridian. They can expel cold and warm the Spleen-Yang. They can be used as chief herbs separately in formulas that treat coldness in the Middle-Jiao. Gan Jiang is very pungent and hot, and enters the Spleen, Stomach, Heart and Lung meridians. It moves reasonable quickly and its action tendency remains in the Middle-Jiao. As it is particularly 121 The internal cold syndrome and formula compositionChapter effective in warming the Spleen and Stomach, expelling cold and drying dampness, it can treat cramping and cold in the abdomen, vomiting and diarrhea due to internal cold in the Middle-Jiao. Xiao Hui Xiang, Cao Dou Kou and Hua Jiao can all warm the Middle-Jiao and expel damp-cold. These three herbs are pungent and warm, and enter the Spleen and Stomach meridians. They are used to treat abdominal pain, distension, poor appetite, vomiting and diarrhea. Xiao Hui Xiang is an aromatic herb. As it can disperse cold and promote Qi movement, it is able to alleviate pain and improve appetite. Cao Dou Kou is also an aromatic herb. Unlike Xiao Hui Xiang, which promotes Qi movement, its strong point is to dry dampness and warm the Spleen. As a result, it can treat nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and poor appetite. Hua Jiao has similar functions to Cao Dou Kou, but is much warmer, so its ability to dry dampness and disperse cold is stronger. Since this is a poison- ous herb and it moves quickly in the Middle-Jiao, it is only used for acute excessive damp-cold syn- drome for a short period of time, such as for severe cramping pain in the abdomen, frequent and urgent bowel movement and watery stools. Fu Zi (aconiti radix lateralis preparata)*, Rou Gui (Cinnamomi cassiae cortex), Xiao Hui Xiang (Foeniculi fructus), Hua Jiao (Zanthoxyli fructus), Ding Xiang (Caryophylli flos) and Ai Ye (artemisiae argyi folium) All of these herbs enter the Kidney meridian and are often used to treat internal cold syndrome by stim- ulating the Kidney-Yang. Fu Zi and Rou Gui are the most commonly used herbs to warm the Lower-Jiao, the Kidney, and they can be used separately or together as chief herbs in formulas that warm the interior. However, there are a number of differences between these two herbs. Fu Zi is a very pungent and hot herb. It enters the 12 regular meridians and moves quickly without any staying tendency. It can very quickly spread the Yang in the body. With these features, it treats internal cold syndrome. Since Fu Zi can spread the warmth quickly to the whole body through the meridians, it can scatter cold and dampness in the body like the sun with the fog. This is the reason why Fu Zi is a very commonly used herb to treat Bi syndrome caused by cold, dampness and wind, as well as Yang deficiency of the body. Although Fu Zi enters the 12 meridians, it especially enters the Kidney meridian. It is vigorous in warming and stimulating the Kidney-Yang and promoting the functions of the internal organs so that it can rescue the Yang from collapse. Fu Zi is considered as the most important herb for treating Yang collapse. Although Fu Zi is an effective herb to stimulate the Yang, warm the interior and expel the cold, it is a very poisonous herb. The dosage and duration of the treatment should be carefully controlled. Rou Gui is less pungent and hot than Fu Zi, but it has sweet taste and enters only the Kidney merid- ian. This makes Rou Gui especially effective to warm the Lower-Jiao, warm the Kidney and scatter the cold there. As it is sweet, it does not move very quickly. The strong point of this herb is that it spreads warmth in a steady and strong way and treats the coldness that it is impossible to scatter in a very short time, such as in disorders of impotence, infertility, amenorrhea and frequent urination. Rou Gui is also used for treating floating-Yang syndrome, is able to warm and tonify the fire of the vital gate and lead the floating fire back to its source. Moreo- ver, Rou Gui warms the Kidney and the blood, scatters cold and stimulates blood circulation to alleviate pain, especially when the pain is in the abdomen, back and knees. Xiao Hui Xiang can warm the Lower-Jiao because it enters the Kidney and Liver meridians. It can promote the Qi movement in the Lower-Jiao and treats abdominal pain, distension and cramp in the lateral sides of the lower abdomen. Hua Jiao and Ding Xiang also enter the Lower- Jiao, are able to warm the Kidney-Yang and treat coldness in the lower back and abdomen, cold extremities, diarrhea and impotence. Ai Ye is pungent and warm, and enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. Ai Ye is gentle in taste and temperature. It can warm the Liver, Kidney and Spleen meridians, and is especially suitable for regu- lating menstruation and can stop bleeding caused by cold in the Lower-Jiao. It can be used as chief herb in a formula to treat profuse menstrual bleed- ing and bleeding in pregnancy, as well as dysmenor- rhea due to cold in the Lower-Jiao. It is considered an important herb for gynecological and obstetric disorders. Ba Ji Tian (Morindae radix) and Yin Yang Huo (epimedii herba) Ba Ji Tian and Yin Yang Huo are warm, sweet and pungent, and enter the Kidney meridian. They can 122


warm the Lower-Jiao and tonify rather than stimu- late the Kidney-Yang. Therefore they can be used in chronic conditions for a longer period of time. They are used as chief herbs in formulas to treat cold sensation and weakness of the back and knees, infertility, frequent urination, loose stools, edema, impotence and tinnitus due to Kidney-Yang deficiency. Deputy: Tonify the Qi in order to strengthen the Yang; tonify the Yang so as to enhance the ability of the chief herbs Ren Shen (Ginseng radix), Huang Qi (astragali radix) and Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Since Qi is a part of Yang, long-term deficiency of Qi may lead to deficiency of Yang. Herbs that tonify Qi are often used in formulas that strengthen the Yang and expel internal cold. Ren Shen is sweet and slightly warm, and enters the Kidney, Spleen and Lung meridians. It is par- ticularly able to tonify Yuan-Qi (Source-Qi) and rescue the Yang from collapse. It is used as chief or deputy together with herbs that stimulate the Yang to treat critical conditions where the Qi is severely injured and the Yang has collapsed. Since Ren Shen can strongly tonify the Yuan-Qi, the principal Qi in the body, it can tonify the Qi of all the internal organs. It can enhance the ability of herbs that warm the interior. It can also treat the symptoms caused by Qi deficiency in the syndrome of Yang deficiency. For instance, it tonifies the Heart-Qi and calms the mind, thereby treating palpitations and restlessness. It tonifies the Spleen-Qi and promotes the diges- tion. Moreover, it promotes the generation of the blood, and treats fatigue and cold and weak limbs. Huang Qi is sweet. It is warmer than Ren Shen in nature. Since it enters only the Lung and Spleen meridians, it has no function in tonifying the Yuan-Qi and is not used in critical conditions or in general Qi deficiency of all the internal organs. As its function focuses on the Spleen and Lung, it can strongly tonify and ascend the Spleen-Qi and promote diges- tion, thus enhancing the ability of the chief in a formula that warms the interior. In addition, since it can strongly tonify the Qi and ascend the Qi of the Spleen, warm the muscles and increase the strength of the muscles, it can treat the accompany- ing symptoms of a Yang deficiency condition, such as tiredness and a heavy sensation of the body and limbs. Huang Qi can tonify the Lung-Qi and stabi- lize the exterior, which are also often seen in a Yang deficiency condition. Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and slightly warm, and enters all meridians. According to the concept that the combination of sweetness, warmth and pun- gency of herbs develops the ability to tonify the Yang, as deputy herb in formulas that warm the interior Zhi Gan Cao is often used in combination with pungent and warm herbs in order to tonify the Yang of the body. As sweetness may slow speed, reduce tension and alleviate the two or more con- flicted aspects in a pathological development, this herb, as a deputy in the formula, can be used in critical conditions of Yang collapse. Moreover, the moderate nature of Zhi Gan Cao is also used effec- tively to treat cramp of muscles caused by the Liver- Qi overcontrolling the Spleen. A large dosage of Zhi Gan Cao is excellent to tonify Qi and harmonize the Qi movement. It can treat Heart-Qi deficiency where the Qi fails to promote blood circulation that brings about restlessness, palpitations, tightness in the chest and arrhythmia. Du Zhong (eucomniae cortex), Gou Ji (Cibotii rhizoma)**, Yi Zhi Ren (alpiniae oxyphyllae fructus) and Tu Si Zi (Cuscutae semen) These herbs are sweet and warm, and enter the Kidney meridian. They can tonify the Kidney-Yang and promote the functions of the Kidney. In formu- las that warm the Lower-Jiao, these herbs can be used as deputies, particularly treating coldness due to deficiency of Yang in chronic conditions. They improve the condition of patients slowly but steadily. Du Zhong and Gou Ji strengthen the back and benefit the joints. They can be used in chronic Bi syndrome due to wind, cold and dampness with Kidney-Yang deficiency, especially in elderly people. Yi Zhi Ren and Tu Si Zi can tonify the Kidney- Yang as well as the Kidney-essence, and can be used for frequent urination, infertility and impotence due to Kidney-Yang deficiency. Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix) and Pao Sheng Jiang (quick-fried Zingiberis rhizoma recens) Dang Gui is pungent, sweet and warm, and enters the Heart, Liver and Spleen meridians. It can tonify 123 The internal cold syndrome and formula compositionChapter the blood, warm the blood and promote blood cir- culation. As its function is effective and gentle, it can be used as deputy in formulas that warm the interior, especially when the cold is in the blood and slows up the circulation, such as in dysmenorrhea, chest pain, cold extremities and Bi syndrome due to cold in the blood. Pao Sheng Jiang is bitter and warm, and enters the Middle-Jiao and the Spleen meridian. It par- ticularly warms the Middle-Jiao and stops bleeding caused by Spleen-Yang deficiency, such as in peptic ulcer, chronic colitis and dysentery. It can also be selected as deputy in formulas that warm the Middle-Jiao. Assistant: Promote the movement of Qi, eliminate cold-dampness; serve as strategic assistant in treating the syndrome of Yang collapse; moderate the harsh herbs and protect the Yin Wu Yao (Linderae radix), Mu Xiang (aucklandiae radix)**, Qing Pi (Citri reticulatae viride pericarpium) and Xiao Hui Xiang (Foeniculi fructus) When the internal cold accumulates in the body, whatever the cause is, cold may contract the meridians, collaterals and muscles. The Qi gets obstructed and pain appears in the affected area. Herbs that promote the Qi movement and are warm in nature are used in these conditions to assist the herbs that warm the interior, expel cold, open up the meridians and therefore alleviate pain. Since they enter different meridians and regions, they may be selected to treat Qi obstruction in the related area. Wu Yao enters the Kidney and Bladder merid- ians, and is used mainly to release cramping pain in the lower and lower-lateral sides of the abdomen. Mu Xiang enters the Liver, Spleen, Stomach and Large Intestine meridians, and can effectively release pain in the hypochondriac region and in the whole abdomen, especially when distension and irregular bowel movement exist. Qing Pi is used mainly to treat pain due to Liver- Qi stagnation as it enters the Liver meridian. Xiao Hui Xiang can gently and effectively warm the Middle- and Lower-Jiao and treat abdominal pain and distension. Cang Zhu (atractylodis rhizoma), Bai Zhu (atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma), Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) and Cao Dou Kou (alpiniae katsumadai semen) Damp-cold accumulation often coexists in Yang deficiency syndrome. Because cold obstructs the meridians, this leads to obstruction of Qi movement and water circulation, and cold-dampness is thus formed. Moreover, when the Yang is too weak to steam the fluid into Qi and Yin, the water metabo- lism becomes very slow and the water may accumu- late in certain places in the body. In this condition, herbs that are warm in nature and have the function of transforming dampness should be used as assist- ants in formulas. Cang Zhu is very pungent, bitter and warm. It enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. It is drying in nature, and can expel wind, damp and cold, and treat painful and heavy joints and muscles. It can dry the damp-cold in the Middle-Jiao and treat reduced appetite and fullness in the abdomen. A white, sticky and thick tongue coating should be present when this herb is selected. Since it is drying in nature, it is only used in the excess condition of dampness accumulation and should be used for a short period of time only. Bai Zhu is less bitter and warm than Cang Zhu and has no pungent taste. The strong point of this herb is tonifying the Spleen-Qi and, at the same time, drying the dampness in the Middle-Jiao. It is particularly suitable for use in conditions where the Spleen is too weak to transform and transport the fluid. This herb can be used for a long period of time. Sheng Jiang is pungent and warm, and primarily enters the Stomach and Lung meridians. It regulates the Qi, disperses cold and dampness, and soothes the Stomach-Qi. It treats cold sensation in the stomach, nausea and vomiting, such as after indulgence in cold food and drink, or in the common cold or influenza. Cao Dou Kou is pungent and warm, and enters the Spleen and Large Intestine meridians. It can effectively warm the Middle-Jiao, dry dampness and promote the Qi movement. It is often selected to treat abdominal distension and pain with cold sensa- tion and poor digestion. Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) and Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) Wu Wei Zi is sour and warm, and enters the Heart and Kidney meridians. The sour taste gives Wu Wei 124


Zi a binding ability. It can stabilize the Yang and Qi in formulas that rescue the Yang when Yang almost collapses. In addition, the sour taste can moderate the actions of the harsh, pungent and hot herbs used for the same condition because the harsh herbs may stimulate the Yang too strongly and too quickly, which may scatter the Yang. These herbs may also injure the Yin, eventually leading to weaker control of the Yang and worsening the condition of Yang collapse. Bai Shao Yao is sour and cold, and primarily enters the Liver meridian. The sour and cold proper- ties can generate the Yin. It can be used in formulas that warm the Yang so as to protect the Yin from hot and pungent herbs. Moreover, its sour taste can stabilize the Yang and the Qi, as well as moderating the speed of the pungent and hot herbs. Zhu Dan Zhi (pulvis bovis) and Huang Bai (phellodendri cortex) These substances are used as strategic assistants in formulas that rescue the Yang from collapse. When Yang collapses, the internal cold is in excess inside the body, and is at variance with the efforts of pungent and hot herbs which try to get into the body. The conflict of these two completely different natures is manifested in symptoms such as vomiting out the herbal drink, irritability, irregular pulse and other uneasy sensations. One method to solve this problem is to add a small amount of cold herb, such as Zhu Dan Zhi or Huang Bai, to a large amount of hot herbs to moderate the conflict between the pathological cold and the hot herbs. Another method of moderating the conflict is to ask patients to take the herbal drink when it is cooled down. This strat- egy is called assisting in an opposite way. Envoy: Harmonize the herbs in the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata), Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) and Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet in nature and enters the Spleen meridian. It can harmonize the herbs that warm the interior in a formula. It can also reduce the side effect of harsh herbs and protect the Stomach. Sheng Jiang and Da Zao are used together to tonify the Middle-Jiao and promote digestion, as well as protect the Stomach from the pungent and hot herbs. Examples of classical formulas Li Zhong Wan (Regulate the Middle Pill) Source: Shang Han Lun Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 6 g Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma) 5 g Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 9 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 6 g Analysis of the formula This formula can warm the Middle-Jiao and strengthen the Spleen-Yang. It treats internal cold due to Spleen-Yang deficiency. • The chief herbs are Gan Jiang and Ren Shen. Gan Jiang can effectively and quickly warm the Middle-Jiao and Ren Shen can strongly tonify the Spleen-Qi. They strengthen each other’s function, spread the Yang and scatter the coldness in the body. • Bai Zhu, as deputy, tonifies the Spleen-Qi and enhances the ability of the Ren Shen. It can also dry the dampness that has developed from the Yang deficiency in the Middle-Jiao and it enhances the function of Gan Jiang to spread the Yang. • Zhi Gan Cao serves as assistant as well as envoy. It is able to tonify the Spleen, and harmonize and moderate the actions of the herbs in this formula. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, each group of herbs has a specific function and represents one aspect of the treatment for the purpose of constructing the Yang of the Middle-Jiao. • It is in the form of a pill that is made with honey, which assists Yang generation in the Middle-Jiao in a steady and sufficient way. It is particularly useful in chronic conditions of Spleen-Yang deficiency. 125 The internal cold syndrome and formula compositionChapter Xiao Jian Zhong Tang (Minor Construct the Middle Decoction) Source: Shang Han Lun perfect for smoothing the muscles, it can relieve cramping pain. • When Yi Tang and pungent-sweet-hot Gui Zhi, one of the deputy herbs, are used together, they can tonify the Spleen-Yang and stimulate its function. As the pungent and hot nature of Gui Zhi is modified by the large amount of Yi Tang, this herb will not injure the Yin and blood. • When Yi Tang and sour-bitter-cold Bai Shao Yao, another deputy herb, are used together, they can generate the Yin of the body and in this way treat the blood and Yin deficiency. As the cold nature of Bai Shao Yao is minimized by the large amount of Yi Tang, Bai Shao Yao will not injure the Yang and Qi. • The pungent and hot Sheng Jiang stimulates the Yang and is used as assistant to enhance the ability of Gui Zhi to warm the Middle-Jiao. It also soothes the Stomach-Qi, disperses cold and water accumulation and improves digestion. • The sweet and warm Da Zao can tonify the blood and Spleen-Qi and serves as assistant to enhance the ability of Bai Shao Yao. • Zhi Gan Cao works as assistant as well as envoy. It can tonify the Spleen and ease the muscles, thus assisting the chief herb. As envoy, it moderates the action of the other herbs. Commentary on strategies There are several distinct characteristics to this formula. • First of all, sweet herbs are used to tonify the Spleen directly. • Second, the combination of sweet and warm herbs, and sweet and cold herbs is used to generate the Yang and Yin respectively. • Third, the combinations and ratios of dosages are arranged in a thoughtful way to avoid the side effect of injury to the other aspects in the process of tonifying one party. In this way, the Yin, Yang, Qi and blood are generated gradually, steadily and sufficiently. When the Yin and blood can nourish the internal organs, the Yang and Qi can accelerate their func- tions, and all symptoms disappear gradually. This formula is a very good example for treating chronic conditions. Yi Tang (Maltose) 30 g Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) 9 g Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) 9 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 6 g Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) 10 g Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) 4 pieces Analysis of the formula This formula primarily treats Spleen-Qi and Yang deficiency. In fact, it treats a chronic syndrome of deficiency of the Middle-Jiao, where not only Qi and Yang, but also Yin and blood are deficient, due to long-term Yang and Qi deficiency. • The Yang and Qi deficiency is manifested as intermittent, spasmodic abdominal pain that responds favorably to local application of warmth and pressure, reduced appetite, cold and sore extremities. • The Qi and blood deficiency is manifested as a lusterless complexion, palpitations, a pale tongue and a thready pulse. • The Yin deficiency shows in low-grade fever, dry mouth, dry throat and irritability. Since Qi, blood, Yin and Yang are deficient in the Middle- Jiao in different degrees, this leads to a treatment dilemma: if tonifying the Yang by using pungent and hot herbs, the Yin and blood can be injured; if nourishing the Yin and blood by using cold and sour herbs, the Yang and Qi will be injured. The formula Xiao Jian Zhong Tang demonstrates the use of important strategies so that all the aspects may be tonified in a balanced and sufficient way. • A large amount of Yi Tang is applied as the chief ingredient. Since it is sweet and neutral and enters the Spleen meridian, it can tonify the Spleen directly without harming the Yin or the Yang. Since its nourishing nature makes it 126


Gui enters the Kidney, warms the Kidney-Yang and enhances the function of Fu Zi. In addition, it can strengthen the vital-gate fire and bring the floating-Yang back to its source, which is particularly necessary at this moment. It is sweet in taste, can tonify the body and maintain a steady action of warming the Lower-Jiao, the Kidney. Gan Jiang enters the Spleen meridian. It directly warms the Spleen-Yang and eliminates the cold and dampness, thereby enhancing the function of the chief. • Ren Shen and Zhi Gan Cao are used as assistants to tonify the Qi in general in order to enhance the ability of the chief herb to stabilize the Yang in a critical condition. • There are several helping assistants in the formula: Bai Zhu and Fu Ling tonify the Spleen-Qi and eliminate the dampness; Ban Xia and Chen Pi regulate the Qi in the Middle-Jiao and remove dampness and phlegm that are generated by the weakened digestion and Yang deficiency; She Xiang can intensively and quickly open up all meridians and enhance the action of the spreading of Yang-Qi owing to its very strong aromatic nature. • Wu Wei Zi, another assistant, is warm and sour, and enters the Lung, Heart and Kidney meridians. Its sour property can stabilize the Yang in the condition of Yang collapse. Moreover, with sweet herbs, it can generate Yin and therefore control the Yang. When it is used with Ren Shen, the Kidney-Qi is strengthened and stabilized. This can help stabilize the Yang tremendously. When Wu Wei Zi is used with She Xiang, the Qi moves in the body in a smoother way. This is because She Xiang can disperse the Qi and Wu Wei Zi can stabilize the Qi. It serves as corrective assistant to reduce the harsh nature of the hot and pungent herbs in the formula. • Zhi Gan Cao is used as envoy. It can harmonize the function of the herbs in the formula. When the herbs are used together, the Yang, the Yin and the Qi are strengthened and their relationships become more stable. In this way Yang collapse can be prevented and treated. Commentary on strategies This formula shows the methods and cautions of rescuing the Yang in a critical condition by using processed Fu Zi instead of the raw version. Shu Fu Zi (processed Aconiti radix lateralis preparata)* 9 g Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma) 5 g Rou Gui (Cinnamomi cassiae cortex) 3 g Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 6 g Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 9 g Fu Ling (Poria) 9 g Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) 6 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 5 g Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) 3 g Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) 9 g Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) 3 pieces She Xiang (Moschus)** 0.1 g Dosages are added, as they were not recorded in the source book. Analysis of the formula This formula can rescue the Yang from collapse and tonify the Qi. It is used to treat severe Yang defi- ciency of the Kidney, Spleen and Heart, and accu- mulations of cold in the body. The symptoms are extremely cold extremities, an exhausted state with a constant desire to sleep, vomiting, diarrhea with undigested food particles, abdominal pain and cold, severe chills, purple color of nails and lips, a pale tongue with a white coating, and a weak and deep pulse. In this formula: • Fu Zi is used as chief herb to stimulate the Yang and expel cold. It is especially used in the critical condition of Yang collapse. The processed Fu Zi is gentler than the raw one, and is more suitable for a critical condition where both Yang and Yin are weak and the Yin can barely hold the Yang. Raw Fu Zi is very pungent and hot; it stimulates Yang too quickly and too strongly, which may break the fragile binding of the Yin and Yang of the body and worsen the condition of Yang collapse. Processed Fu Zhi is used to avoid this effect. • Rou Gui and Gan Jiang are used as deputies to ensure the strength of rescuing the Yang. Rou Hui Yang Jiu Ji Tang (Restore and Revive the Yang Decoction) Source: Shang Han Liu Shu 127 The internal cold syndrome and formula compositionChapter • The formula not only focuses on the condition of Yang, but also considers the relationship with Yin. • It focuses not only on treating the Kidney but also on tonifying the Spleen in light of the relationship between Kidney and Spleen. • It focuses on rescuing and stabilizing the Yang; however, herbs that strengthen the Qi are used which take account of the relationship of Yang and Qi. All the arrangements in this formula bring inspira- tion to the study of strategies for treating critical conditions by considering the relationships of all the involved aspects. Dang Gui Si Ni Tang (Tongue Decoction for Frigid Extremities) Source: Shang Han Lun • The pungent-warm Gui Zhi, which enters the Heart meridian, is used as deputy to enhance the ability of Dang Gui. It can effectively stimulate the Yang and warm the blood. Gui Zhi also enters the Lung meridian, so can expel the cold and spread the Yang and Qi in the entire body. • Another deputy is Xi Xin. It is pungent and hot, and enters the Kidney meridian. It can stimulate the Kidney-Yang and Qi, expel the cold, warm the meridian and effectively reduce the cold and pain of the joints. • Bai Shao Yao is also used as deputy alongside the pungent and warm herbs. It is sour and cold. Together with sweet herbs, such as Dang Gui, Gui Zhi and Da Zao, it can nourish the Yin and tonify the blood, paying attention to the material aspect of the blood, and therefore can indirectly strengthen the relationship between the Yin and Yang. • Gan Cao and Da Zao are assistants in the formula. They are sweet, can tonify the Spleen and accelerate the transforming function of the Spleen. In addition, they directly aid Dang Gui and Bai Shao to tonify blood, and aid Gui Zhi and Xi Xin to strengthen the Yang. • Tong Cao is used as envoy in the formula. It is cold in nature and enters the Heart meridian. It guides the other herbs entering the Heart meridian and enables them to carry out their functions. It is also used as corrective assistant to prevent the hot herbs injuring the blood. Its action has a descending quality, which can control the side effect of Xi Xin that may ascend and stimulate the weakened Kidney- Yang too quickly. Commentary on strategies • The combination of sweet and warm herbs creates the strong and steady action of this formula in warming the Yang and blood without harsh effect. • The combination of warm, sweet and sour herbs creates a balanced action of this formula in warming the Yang without the side effect of injuring the blood and Yin.

It is used to treat cold and painful joints and muscles due to Yang deficiency and blood defi- ciency with invasion of external cold. A pale tongue with a white coating and a very thready and deep pulse are the important signs of this syndrome. In this formula: • Dang Gui, as chief, is used in a large dosage. It is warm, sweet, bitter and pungent, and can directly tonify the blood and promote the blood circulation. 128

They are used to treat different kinds of deficiency syndromes. 131 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter The main substances of the body are the Qi and essence that further generate blood, body fluids, Yin and Yang. In pathological conditions, the deficiency often shows four aspects, namely deficiency of the Qi, deficiency of the blood, deficiency of the Yin and deficiency of the Yang. The deficiency can be found in specific organs, such as Kidney-Yin defi- ciency, Spleen-Qi deficiency or Heart-blood defi- ciency. A deficiency syndrome also exists in patients with a weak constitution or those in the recovery period of disease, in elderly people or in children. In those situations, it is difficult to determine which organ is weak and which part should be tonified, as the general condition of the patient is weak. The formulas that tonify are arranged following these four aspects for the convenience of syndrome differentiation and treatment. The compositions of formulas are followed by different syndromes in each category and are discussed in detail. In prac- tice, especially when treating chronic deficiency syn- dromes, an integrated treatment to tonify more substances and organs is required. A formula should be composed with thoughtfulness, yet following the principles and strategies demonstrated separately in this chapter. Compared with formulas in the other chapters, formulas that tonify contain many tonifying herbs. these herbs have a sweet and cloying nature and are not easily digested, especially in patients with deficiency of the Spleen and Stomach, in elderly people and in children. the herbs that stimulate Qi and the herbs that promote digestion are almost always recommended in composing these formulas. 3. plan an appropriate treatment course and diet: an appropriate treatment course with an appropriate diet should also be taken in consideration in practice. treatment of chronic deficiency syndromes should take place in stages. Generally speaking, it is better to start tonifying treatment in the winter rather than in the summer because winter is the time of storing and the digestive capability is stronger than in the summer. another time to start treatment is following the changes of the Yin and Yang in nature. In cases of Yin deficiency, treatment should cover the spring and summer; in cases of Yang deficiency, treatment should start in the autumn and end after winter. at the same time, diets that can tonify and protect the Spleen and Stomach are also recommended to patients.


1. Use in deficiency conditions only: Formulas that tonify are, in general, applied for treating deficiency syndrome. they should not be used in conditions where substantial excess pathological products are present, such as phlegm, food and water accumulation, and stagnation of Qi and blood. this is because many tonifying herbs in the formulas have a rich and cloying nature and may retain material pathological products in the body. For the same reason, they are not suitable for conditions where exogenous pathogenic factors exist. however, in many cases, the deficiency syndromes coexist with excess pathological factors, or the internal disorders coexist with external factors. Quite often the factor of deficiency plays a causative role in the whole pathological process, thus the formulas that tonify can be used with herbs that eliminate the excess and exogenous pathogenic factors. 2. protect the function of the Spleen and promote Qi movement in the Middle-Jiao:

## Syndrome of Qi deficiency

Qi is one of the most important substances in the body. In traditional Chinese Medicine, the body is composed of Qi, which consists of fine particles with moving ability. Qi is the motivating force of human physiological processes and mental activities. When considering the source of Qi, Qi in humans is an integration of the Qi inherited from parents, the Qi from nature from inhalation and contact, and the Qi transformed from food and drink. In etiology and pathology, all factors that weaken the sources of the Qi, overconsume the Qi or obstruct its gen- eration can cause Qi deficiency. (See Figure 5.1 on page 189.) When considering the function of the Qi, the five internal organs all contain Qi, which supports and carries out their functions. If the Qi is insufficient, certain syndromes of Qi deficiency may exist. Although the Qi of the five internal organs can be deficient, the Qi of the Spleen, Lung and Heart can 132


be weakened directly and the formulas that tonify the Spleen-Qi, Lung-Qi and Heart-Qi are discussed in detail in this chapter. Deficiency of Liver-Qi and Kidney-Qi is quite different from that of the above-mentioned three organs. Unlike Spleen-Qi, Lung-Qi and Heart-Qi, Liver-Qi depends on blood, which is generated by Spleen-Qi and Kidney-essence and is supported by Heart-Qi and blood. When the Liver-Qi is deficient, it should be tonified in an indirect and integrated way by considering all the factors involved. As ton- ifying the blood is the main approach to tonifying the Qi, creating formulas that tonify the Liver-Qi, and therefore tonify the blood, should be the prin- cipal consideration. The Kidney-Qi is developed from Kidney- essence, and is directly generated by the interaction of Kidney-Yin and Kidney-Yang. The approaches of tonifying Kidney-Qi are via tonifying Kidney-Yin, Kidney-essence and Kidney-Yang. One should consult the formulas in Sections 10 and 11, Syn- drome of Kidney-Yin deficiency and Syndrome of Kidney-Yang deficiency respectively, to create an appropriate formula.

## 1 Syndrome of Spleen-Qi


there are different names for Qi in traditional Chinese medicine, which can be quite confusing. In fact, they can be named from their origins or from their functions; for example: • Source-Qi or Real-Qi (Yuan-Qi or Zhen-Qi in Chinese), which refers to the inherited Qi that resides in the Kidney • Universal-Qi (Da-Qi in Chinese), which indicates the Qi of nature • Food-Qi (Gu-Qi in Chinese), which is from food and drink • Essence-Qi (Jing-Qi in Chinese), which could be named the Qi generated by the Kidney-essence or by the food-essence • Defensive-Qi (Wei-Qi in Chinese) and Nutritive-Qi (Ying-Qi in Chinese), which are related to their functions. Sometimes the position is used to name the Qi, such as chest-Qi, which is called Xiong Zhong Zhi-Qi in Chinese, and the Qi of the Middle-Jiao, which is called Zhong-Qi in Chinese. In many texts, names of Qi are used to describe the nature of the Qi, such as clear-Qi (Qing-Qi) or turbid-Qi (Zhuo-Qi); their exact meaning can be interpreted by following the sense of the text. (See Figure 5.2 on page 189.) Main symptoms Poor appetite, fullness in the stomach and distension of the abdomen after eating, soft stool, tiredness and weakness of the limbs These symptoms start and get worse under conditions of changing diet or after taking heavy food Secondary symptoms Heaviness of the limbs, sallow complexion, prolapse of the internal organs (e g uterus, stomach and rectum), large amount of leukorrhea, edema, heavy menstruation, poor concentration or inability to study and memorize things Tongue Pale tongue (may be flabby with teeth marks in a chronic severe case) with a thin white coating Pulse Weak or soft in general Associated disorders in western medicine Chronic diseases and disorders of digestion, metab- olism and immune function, such as chronic gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, food allergy and intolerance, hypotension, hypoglycemia, hypothyroidism, diabe- tes, chronic fatigue syndrome and prolapse of organs. Analysis of the syndrome Weakness of Spleen-Qi is often seen in people who have a poor constitution or suffer from chronic dis- eases, have the wrong diet or have been taking medication for too long. It is often seen in elderly people. • When Spleen-Qi is impaired, the function of transportation and transformation of the Spleen is disturbed. Patients may have poor appetite (even nausea and vomiting) when the Stomach-Qi is unable to descend. • Soft stool (even diarrhea) may appear when the Spleen-Qi sinks instead of rising. 133 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter • When the Qi in the Middle-Jiao is too weak to move, there is stagnation of food and a feeling of fullness or distending pain in the abdomen. • Since the wrong diet or heavy food places an extra burden on the Spleen and Stomach, these symptoms may start or get worse in these conditions. • Since the Spleen controls the muscles, Spleen-Qi deficiency may weaken the strength of the muscles and cause tiredness, heaviness of the limbs and prolapse of the internal organs. • When the Qi is too weak to push the water to circulate in the body, there may be edema, diarrhea or a feeling of heaviness in the body. • When Spleen-Qi is not able to control circulation of blood in the blood vessels, a large bleed that is light in color may occur. • When Spleen-Qi is not able to control transportation of the food essence, leakage may present, manifested as a large amount of leukorrhea, unstable plasma glucose and glucose, and protein or blood in the urine. • A pale tongue with tooth marks indicates Qi deficiency in the Middle-Jiao, and the tongue coating shows the degree of accumulation, damp-phlegm, damp-heat or phlegm-heat. A soft or weak pulse obviously indicates deficiency of the Spleen-Qi. If there is accumulation in the Middle-Jiao, a full or forceful pulse may show in the second position on the right side. Treatment principle: Tonify the Spleen-Qi and regulate the Middle-Jiao Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Tonify the Spleen-Qi directly Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) Ren Shen is sweet and slightly bitter, and enters the Spleen and Lung meridians. It can strongly tonify the Spleen-Qi and the Source-Qi. It is used as chief in the formula to treat severe conditions of Qi defi- ciency or critical conditions of Qi collapse. Except for Xi Yang Shen (Panacis quinquefolii radix), all of the Ren Shen products are warm in nature. It is so strong in tonifying Qi that it can produce warmth in the body, and therefore should be used with caution in patients who suffer from Yin and blood deficiency accompanied by Qi deficiency. In most cases of Spleen-Qi deficiency, especially in chronic condi- tions, a large dosage of Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix) is often used as an effective substitute for Ren Shen. Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix) Dang Shen is sweet and neutral, and enters the Spleen and Lung meridians. It is effective for tonify- ing the Spleen-Qi and the Lung-Qi. Its function is much gentler than that of Ren Shen. The strong point of this herb is that, as it is not heavy and sticky, and does not generate heat and dryness in the body, it is more suitable to be selected in a formula to treat chronic, mild cases of Spleen-Qi and Lung-Qi deficiency. As it can also generate the Yin and body fluids, it is also used for both Qi and Yin deficiency. Huang Qi (astragali radix) Huang Qi is sweet and warm, and enters the Spleen and Lung meridians. It can strengthen the Middle- Jiao, tonify the Spleen-Qi and thus treat Spleen-Qi deficiency. Compared with Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix), Huang Qi is sweeter and warmer, and its function of tonifying the Spleen-Qi is stronger. Its specific action is to tonify the Qi, raise the Yang-Qi of the Spleen and strengthen the muscles. It is selected as chief in the formula to treat sinking of Spleen-Qi, which manifests as chronic diarrhea, pro- lapsed internal organs, weakness and heaviness of the limbs and tiredness. It is also used as chief in formulas that promote wound healing after surgical operations or trauma. Since Huang Qi can control circulation in the blood vessels, it can be applied as chief in the 134


formula to stop chronic bleeding caused by Spleen- Qi deficiency, such as uterine bleeding, blood in the stool and purpura. As it is also able to tonify the Spleen-Qi and transport the dampness promptly, it can therefore treat edema. Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) and Yi Tang (Maltose) Gan Cao is sweet and neutral, and enters all merid- ians. Yi Tang is sweet and slightly warm, and enters the Spleen meridian. Although they are mild ingre- dients, they are used in specific conditions as chief in the formula to treat Spleen-Qi deficiency. The moderate tonifying action is the most important characteristic of these two substances. They can be used for mild deficiency of Spleen-Qi, or for chronic conditions of Spleen-Qi deficiency when the body is too weak to bear strong tonification. As sweetness may moderate tension and ease muscles, these sub- stances can be used in a reasonably large dosage to treat acute abdominal cramp and muscular pain due to weakness of the Spleen and attack by the Liver. Deputy: Tonify the Spleen-Qi; promote Qi movement and water metabolism in the Middle-Jiao Bai Zhu (atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) Bai Zhu is sweet and warm, and enters the Spleen meridian. It can tonify the Spleen-Qi directly and its bitter and warm property can dry dampness. It is often selected as deputy in the formula to enhance the ability of the chief as well as to dry dampness in the Middle-Jiao. It can effectively treat poor appetite, fullness in the stomach, distension in the abdomen, diarrhea and heaviness of the limbs. Shan Yao (Dioscoreae rhizoma) Shan Yao is neutral and sweet, and enters the Spleen meridian. It can either tonify the Spleen-Qi or sta- bilize the Yin. It is especially selected in the formula as deputy to enhance the ability of the chief to tonify the Qi and treat both Qi and Yin deficiency in the Middle-Jiao. Shan Yao also possesses a slightly astringent property, which is helpful in stopping diarrhea. Furthermore, this herb also enters the Lung and Kidney meridians, and is often applied to tonify and stabilize the Qi and Yin of these organs. The common symptoms are lack of appetite, fatigue, loose stool, shortness of breath, thirst and sweating. Assistant: Regulate the Middle-Jiao, treat the accompanying symptoms and reduce the side effects of the chief and deputy herbs Fu Ling (poria) Fu Ling is neutral and bland, and can gently tonify the Spleen-Qi or eliminate dampness in the Middle- Jiao. As the function of Fu Ling is gentle, it can be used for a long period of time in chronic and mild syndromes of Qi deficiency of the Spleen. Moreover, Fu Ling can promote urination and leach out dampness from the Lower-Jiao, and therefore treat leukorrhea or reduce the cloying side effect of the sweet tonifying herbs. As Fu Ling can also tonify the Heart-Qi, it is used for calming the mind. It is particularly useful for children with mild Heart-Qi and Spleen-Qi defi- ciency as it does not have a strong taste. Bai Bian Dou (Dolichoris lablab semen) Bai Bian Dao is sweet and slightly warm. It has a gentle function of tonifying the Spleen-Qi, and is neither dry nor moist. It is particularly suitable for use in formulas to treat chronic mild deficiency of the Spleen-Qi or for use in the recovery period after chronic diseases when the condition of the patient is too weak to accept strong tonification. As Bai Bian Dou has a gentle astringent property, it is often used for diarrhea or soft stools caused by Spleen-Qi deficiency. Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Besides directly tonifying the Spleen-Qi, the moder- ate nature of Zhi Gan Cao is often used in formulas to reduce the side effect of harsh herbs, such as herbs that stimulate the Qi or remove food or phlegm. It turns a quick action of herbs into a steady and constant action. It is also used to harmonize herbs that move in different directions and work on different levels. The dosage of Zhi Gan Cao should be low in cases of dampness accumulation as its sweet property has the tendency to retain dampness. Ban Xia (pinelliae rhizoma) and Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) Ban Xia is pungent and warm, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. It can soothe the Stomach- Qi and eliminate phlegm. Chen Pi is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Spleen and Lung meridi- ans. It can regulate the Qi and remove phlegm. 135 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter These two herbs are often used as assistants in for- mulas to regulate the Qi in the upper abdomen and reduce fullness and distending sensations that are caused by Spleen-Qi deficiency or by the heavy and cloying nature of tonifying herbs. They can therefore accelerate food and water transportation and trans- formation in the Middle-Jiao. Mu Xiang (aucklandiae radix)** and Sha Ren (amomi xanthioidis fructus) Mu Xiang and Sha Ren are pungent and warm, and enter the Spleen meridian. They are often used as assistants in formulas to regulate the Qi in the lower abdomen and reduce distension and abnormal bowel movement, which are caused by Spleen-Qi defi- ciency or by the heavy and cloying nature of tonify- ing herbs. In this way, they can accelerate food and water transportation and transformation in the Middle-Jiao. Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex) Ho Po is pungent, bitter and warm. It enters the Lung, Stomach, Spleen and Large Intestine meridi- ans. Since pungent and warm have an ascending tendency, and bitterness has a descending tendency, this herb can regulate the Qi in the Upper-, Middle- and Lower-Jiao, and remove dampness, food and phlegm accumulation. It can effectively treat full- ness and distension. Sheng Ma (Cimicifugae rhizoma) and Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) Sheng Ma is sweet, pungent and slightly cold, and enters the Spleen, Stomach, Lung and Large Intes- tine meridians. Chai Hu is bitter and neutral, and enters the Liver and Gall Bladder meridians. These two herbs have an ascending property. They are mainly used as assistants in formulas to ascend the Spleen-Qi in the treatment of prolapse of the inter- nal organs and chronic diarrhea caused by Spleen-Qi deficiency. However, they only bring about an effec- tive result in combination with tonifying herbs in the same formula, such as Huang Qi (Astragali radix). Envoy: Harmonize the herbs in the whole formula in the aspects of temperature, taste, working directions and levels, and characteristics Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Since all the chief herbs enter the Spleen meridian and focus on tonifying the Spleen-Qi, it is not neces- sary to use an envoy as guide. However, Zhi Gan Cao often serves as envoy to harmonize the whole formula. It harmonizes herbs that move in different directions and works on different levels. The dosage of Zhi Gan Cao should be low in cases of dampness accumulation as its sweet property has the tendency to retain dampness. Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Poor appetite and nausea: use Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) and Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) to soothe the Stomach-Qi and to promote digestion. • Distension of the abdomen: use Sha Ren (Amomi xanthioidis fructus) to reduce the stagnation of Qi and use Da Fu Pi (Arecae pericarpium) to reduce the Qi and dampness accumulation. • Diarrhea due to Qi deficiency: use Fu Ling (Poria), Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) and Bai Bian Dou (Dolichoris lablab semen) to tonify the Spleen-Qi and transform the dampness. For chronic diarrhea, use Lian Zi (Nelumbinis semen) to bind up the intestines and stop diarrhea. • Distending pain of the abdomen: use Mu Xiang (Aucklandiae radix)** to regulate the Qi and relieve the pain. • Cold sensation in the abdomen: use Xiao Hui Xiang (Foeniculi fructus) to regulate the Qi and warm the Middle-Jiao. • Accumulation of food: use Mai Ya (Hordei fructus germinatus), Shen Qu (Massa medicata fermentata) and Shan Zha (Crataegi fructus) to promote digestion. • Constipation: use Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) and Dang Gui (Angelicae sinensis radix) to moisten the intestines and promote bowel movement. • Edema: use Huang Qi (Astragali radix) and Fu Ling (Poria) to tonify the Qi and reduce edema. • Large amount of leukorrhea: use Shan Yao (Dioscoreae rhizoma) and Che Qian Zi (Plantaginis semen) to eliminate the dampness in the Middle-Jiao. • Heaviness of the limbs due to Qi deficiency and obstruction of water metabolism: use Huang Qi (Astragali radix) to tonify the Qi and promote 136


water metabolism; use Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix) and Qin Jiao (Gentianae macrophyllae radix) to eliminate the dampness from muscles. • Weakness of the limbs: use Huang Qi (Astragali radix), Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) and Sheng Ma (Cimicifugae rhizoma) together to tonify and ascend the Spleen-Qi so as to strengthen the muscles. • Excessive pensiveness and worry: use Fu Shen (Poriae cocos pararadicis), Bai Zi Ren (Platycladi semen), Bai He (Lilii bulbus), Long Yan Rou (Longanae arillus) and Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) to calm the mind and tonify the Spleen. • Depression where Spleen fails to support the Heart and Lung: use Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix), Bai He (Lilii bulbus), Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) and Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) to tonify and stabilize the Heart and Lung. • Spontaneous sweating: use Huang Qi (Astragali radix), Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) and Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) to tonify and stabilize the Spleen-Qi and stop sweating. Examples of classical formulas Si Jun Zi Tang (Four-Gentlemen Decoction) Source: Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang formula, it shows the basic principle and strategies to tonify the Qi. Many of the other formulas that tonify the Qi are developed from this formula. • Ren Shen, the chief, can strongly and directly tonify the Spleen-Qi. (In a chronic case, Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix) is frequently used instead of Ren Shen.) • Bai Zhu serves as deputy. On the one hand, it can tonify the Spleen-Qi and reinforce the action of the chief to treat Qi deficiency; on the other hand, it can dry dampness in the Middle-Jiao, which often coexists when Qi is deficient. • Fu Ling serves as assistant, and again aids the action of tonifying the Qi of the Spleen. Moreover, it can drain dampness and assist the deputy to treat the coexisting disorder. By eliminating dampness, this herb is able to reduce the cloying nature of the other three sweet herbs to ensure that they do not put an extra burden on the Spleen and their sweet taste does not generate dampness in this condition. Fu Ling moves downwards and thus can reduce the distension of the abdomen; this is the reason that there is no herb in this formula to promote the Qi movement in the Middle-Jiao. • Zhi Gan Cao is sweet, and can tonify the Spleen-Qi as well as harmonize and integrate the herbs in the formula. Thus it serves as both assistant and envoy. Commentary on strategies This formula is based on a very balanced structure. • Reinforcing and reducing procedures are used at the same time; stabilization (tonifying action) and movement (drying and drainage action) coexist in one formula. However, the main action of the formula is stabilization. • The four herbs in the formula are all moderate in nature, neither hot nor harsh, matching the cultural characteristics of Chinese gentlemen, hence the name of this formula – Four- Gentlemen Decoction. • Although there are only four herbs in this formula, they indicate the basic strategies for treating Spleen-Qi deficiency. It is therefore considered to be the principal formula to tonify the Spleen-Qi. Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 10 g Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 9 g Fu Ling (Poria) 9 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 6 g Analysis of the formula Si Jun Zi Tang is a principal formula to tonify the Spleen-Qi and treat the syndrome of Spleen-Qi deficiency. Although there are only four herbs in this 137 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter Shen Ling Bai Zhu San (Ginseng, Poria and Atractylodes Macrocephala Powder) Source: Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang leach out dampness. The astringent Lian Zi is used together with Shan Yao and Bai Bian Dou to stabilize the Spleen-Qi and to stop diarrhea. Sha Ren is used to promote the Qi movement and eliminate dampness. • Jie Geng serves as envoy as it enters the Lung meridian and has an ascending nature. It is able to lead the Spleen-Qi to ascend to the Lung and thereby tonify the Lung-Qi. Commentary on strategies This formula demonstrates the treatment of a com- plicated case resulting from Spleen-Qi deficiency. • It particularly presents the strategies of treating diarrhea, e.g. to dry the dampness by using warm and bitter herbs such as Bai Zhu; to leach out dampness by using bland and sweet herbs such as Fu Ling and Yi Yi Ren, which is called to stop diarrhea by promoting urination, and to directly stop diarrhea by using astringent Lian Zi, Bai Bian Dou and Shan Yao. • This formula also shows an example of tonifying the Lung-Qi by using Jie Geng with the herbs that tonify the Spleen. This method is called to cultivate the earth to generate the metal. It belongs to the indirect tonifying method. Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Tonify the Middle and Augment the Qi Decoction) Source: Pi Wei Lun Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 10 g Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 10 g Fu Ling (Poria) 10 g Shan Yao (Dioscoreae rhizoma) 10 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 10 g Bai Bian Dou (Dolichoris lablab semen) 7 5 g Yi Yi Ren (Coicis semen) 5 g Lian Zi (Nelumbinis semen) 5 g Sha Ren (Amomi xanthioidis fructus) 5 g Jie Geng (Platycodi radix) 5 g Analysis of the formula This formula tonifies the Spleen-Qi and transforms dampness from the Middle-Jiao. It treats the syn- drome of Spleen-Qi deficiency with obvious accu- mulation of dampness in the Middle-Jiao, and at the same time treats deficiency of Lung-Qi due to Spleen-Qi deficiency. The symptoms are chronic diarrhea, weakness of limbs, weight loss, a low and soft voice and shortness of breath. A pale tongue with a moist white coating and a soft and slow pulse indicate the presence of dampness with Qi deficiency. This formula can be considered as a variation of Si Jun Zi Tang (Four-Gentlemen Decoction). • Ren Shen is used as chief to strongly tonify the Spleen-Qi. • Among the deputy herbs, Bai Zhu is used to tonify the Spleen and dry the dampness; Shan Yao is used to strengthen the Spleen-Qi and stabilize the Spleen-essence which has been lost due to chronic diarrhea; Zhi Gan Cao is used in quite a large dosage to aid the strength of the herbs that tonify the Spleen-Qi, hence its use as deputy in this formula. • Among the assistants, Fu Ling is used to transform dampness and tonify the Spleen-Qi; Bai Bian Dou and Yi Yi Ren are selected to Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 9 g Huang Qi (Astragali radix) 12 g Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 9 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 3 g Dang Gui (Angelicae sinensis radix) 6 g Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) 6 g Sheng Ma (Cimicifugae rhizoma) 3 g Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) 3 g Analysis of the formula This formula has the function of tonifying the Spleen-Qi and raising the sunken Yang and Qi of the Spleen. It treats the syndrome where the Spleen-Qi 138


is so severely injured that it is unable to raise the Qi and Yang from the Middle-Jiao and cannot control blood. The manifestations are weak and heavy limbs, diarrhea, prolapse of the internal organs and bleed- ing. In addition, if Qi is too weak to stabilize the Yang, fever may start after exertion. A pale tongue with a thin white coating and a floating but rootless or weak pulse indicate the weakness of Yang and Qi of the Spleen. In this formula: • Huang Qi is able to raise the Qi and Yang of the Spleen. Together with Ren Shen, it can strongly tonify the Spleen-Qi. These two herbs serve as chief. • Bai Zhu, the deputy, strengthens the Spleen-Qi and dries dampness in the Middle-Jiao. • There are several assistants: Dang Gui is able to tonify the blood, which is weakened in conditions of severe Qi deficiency; Chen Pi can regulate the Stomach-Qi and promote digestion so as to assist the herbs that tonify the Spleen; it can also reduce the cloying properties of the tonifying herbs. Sheng Ma and Chai Hu can raise the Qi and Yang from the Middle-Jiao in the presence of Huang Qi. They can strongly enhance the effect of Huang Qi in raising the Qi and Yang. • Zhi Gan Cao serves as assistant as well as envoy. As assistant, it tonifies the Qi of the Middle-Jiao; as envoy, it harmonize the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies This is a well-organized formula. It is an integration of tonifying Qi and blood, regulating Qi and raising Qi; therefore it can treat a complicated condition due to Spleen-Qi deficiency. • It shows the method of raising Qi by using Huang Qi, Sheng Ma and Chai Hu together. • With regard to composition, this formula can be considered a variation of Si Jun Zi Tang, the principal formula for tonifying the Spleen-Qi. Compared with Si Jun Zi Tang, the downward- moving Fu Ling is substituted by Huang Qi. This suggests that this formula is much stronger in tonifying and ascending the Qi. • Moreover, this formula demonstrates the strategy of dealing with the relationship between Qi and blood in severe Qi deficiency by using Dang Gui.

## 2 Syndrome of Lung-Qi


Main symptoms Shortness of breath, worse on exertion, a low and weak voice, reluctance to talk, spontaneous sweating, propensity to catch colds or having a common cold of long duration Secondary symptoms Cough, phlegm, bright-white complexion, depression and lack of resolution and confidence Tongue Pale with a white coating Pulse Thready, superficial and rapid in the first position on the right side Associated disorders in western medicine Common cold, influenza, chronic bronchitis, asthma, pulmonary emphysema, chronic sinusitis, skin disor- ders and depression. Analysis of the syndrome The Lung is a light, fragile organ that is unable to tolerate extreme dryness, cold or heat, and prefers to be moistened. Lung-Qi is generated from three sources: • from the air, which is extracted by the Lung from inhalation • from Nutritive-Qi, which is generated by food and drink by the transformation function of the Spleen • from Defensive-Qi, which is generated by Source-Qi from the Kidney in the Lower-Jiao, strengthened by the Spleen-Qi in the Middle- Jiao and gathered in the Upper-Jiao. Lung-Qi is formed by integrating the three kinds of Qi. It spreads over the whole body via its dispersing and descending functions. It stimulates or maintains the functions of the internal organs and vital activi- ties of the whole body. 139 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter The weakness of Lung-Qi is often seen in expo- sure to seriously polluted air, extreme changes of climate, poor nutrition, chronic diseases and poor constitution. It often occurs in people with poor development of the Lung from lack of physical exercise. • When Lung-Qi is deficient, its dispersing and descending functions become weak. Patients may suffer from shortness of breath, which is worse on exertion, a low and weak voice and reluctance to talk. • When the Defensive-Qi is too weak to control the pores and protect the body, spontaneous sweating, a propensity to catch colds and a common cold of long duration are often present. • If the Lung-Qi fails to spread the fluid as mist in the Upper-Jiao, there may be cough with phlegm. • The Lung houses the Po at a mental level. When Lung-Qi is deficient, depression and lack of confidence may exist. • The pulse signs indicate the Qi deficiency, particularly in the Lung position, and there is a reaction of the weakened Lung-Qi to pathogenic factors. Treatment principle: Tonify the Lung-Qi Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Directly tonify the Lung-Qi, or tonify the Spleen-Qi so as to strengthen the Lung-Qi Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) and Sheng Huang Qi (astragali radix) Ren Shen and Sheng Huang Qi are two strong herbs for tonifying the Qi. They are characterized by their quick action. Both are sweet and slightly warm, and enter the Spleen and Lung meridians. Sweetness possesses tonifying and moistening qualities and the slight warmth may gently strengthen the Yang, which further generates the Qi. They strongly tonify the Spleen-Qi, strengthen the Middle-Jiao, and promote the function of the Spleen to generate blood, essence and body fluids. When the Spleen-Qi is strong enough, it can transport the Qi to the Lung so as to strengthen the Lung-Qi and the Defensive- Qi. Both herbs are very effective for treating Lung-Qi deficiency. Ren Shen is particularly able to tonify the Source- Qi, grasps the Qi that is sent downward by the Lung, and therefore improves quick and shallow respir- ation. It can also strengthen the Defensive-Qi, and is used to counter the propensity to catch the common cold in people who have a poor constitu- tion. It is often selected as chief in the formula to treat Qi deficiency in both Lung and Kidney. Unlike Ren Shen, Huang Qi has no function in tonifying the Source-Qi. On the other hand, Huang Qi – in particular the raw version, called Sheng Huang Qi – has a strong ability to ascend Qi and enter the Lung meridian directly. It can strongly tonify the Lung-Qi, as well as strengthen the Defensive-Qi, promote the Qi and blood circulation on the surface of the body, and control the pores so as to strengthen and stabilize the exterior. Thus, Huang Qi is very often selected as chief in formulas to tonify the Lung-Qi and Defensive-Qi. Bai He (Lilii bulbus) Bai He is sweet and slightly cold in nature and enters the Lung, Heart and Stomach meridians. It can be selected as chief in a formula to tonify the Lung-Qi. The strong point of this herb is that it moistens the Lung and smoothes the Qi, thus relieving depres- sion, grief and restless sleep. It can moisten the 140


Lung-Yin and clear heat. It has a lubricating property and is able to regulate the Qi movement in the Upper-Jiao. It treats dry cough, a tight sensation in the chest and difficulty in expectorating scanty and thick sputum. Deputy: Nourish Yin and blood; tonify the Kidney-Qi in order to stabilize the Lung-Qi Hu Tao Ren (Juglandis semen) and E Jiao (asini corii colla) Hu Tao Ren is sweet and warm, and enters the Kidney and Lung meridians. E Jiao is sweet and neutral, and enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. Both are moist in nature and are able to moisten the Lung and tonify the Kidney-essence and blood. They are mainly selected in formulas to treat chronic con- ditions of Lung-Qi deficiency where Kidney defi- ciency is obviously involved. The difference between these two substances is that Hu Tao Ren is more suitable for treating Kidney-Yin and Kidney-essence deficiency; E Jiao is better suited for use in cases of blood deficiency. Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) and Bei Sha Shen (Glehniae radix) Mai Men Dong and Bei Sha Shen are sweet and cold, and enter the Lung meridian. Both tonify the Yin of the Lung primarily, and tonify the Lung- Qi secondly. They can tonify the Qi slightly and are particularly suitable for use in conditions where the Qi and Yin are both injured by pathological heat. They treat shortness of breath, dry cough, thirst and tiredness. However, Mai Men Dong is bitter, and its function of reducing heat is stronger than that of Bei Sha Shen. Moreover, it enters the Heart meridian, and if the patient suffers from restlessness, irritability and insomnia, which indi- cate a deficiency of Heart-Yin and Heart-Qi, Mai Men Dong is more suitable than Bei Sha Shen. Shan Yao (Dioscoreae rhizoma) Shan Yao is sweet, neutral and astringent, and enters the Lung, Spleen and Kidney meridians. It can moisten the Lung and tonify the Qi of the three organs and is mainly used as deputy in formulas to treat chronic conditions of Lung-Qi deficiency with Spleen-Qi and Kidney-Qi deficiency. Assistant: Regulate and stabilize the Lung-Qi Zhi Ma Huang (honey-fried ephedrae herba)* When Ma Huang is fried with honey, it is called Zhi Ma Huang. After this treatment, the pungent and hot properties of the raw herb are moderated by the nature of honey, which is sweet and moistening. Although the dispersing action of honey-fried Ma Huang is no longer strong and quick, it is perfect to moisten the Lung, and disperse and descend the Lung-Qi. In the syndrome of Lung-Qi deficiency, it is often used as assistant for treating shortness of breath, wheezing, a stifling sensation in the chest and asthma. Jie Geng (platycodi radix) Jie Geng is bitter, pungent and neutral, and enters the Lung meridian. It is light in nature and is able to ascend and disperse the Lung-Qi. In addition, since it can eliminate phlegm and stop cough, it is often used as assistant in conditions of Lung-Qi defi- ciency. It treats shortness of breath and expectora- tion of phlegm. Jie Geng is particularly useful if there is a full sensation in the body or constipation accompanied by Lung-Qi deficiency because it can disperse the Lung-Qi, open the obstruction in the Upper-Jiao, and activate the Qi movement and water metabolism in the whole body. Together with herbs that move downwards, Jie Geng can be used to treat constipation as it ascends the Lung-Qi and activates the Qi movement in the Large Intestine, which is internally/externally related to the Lung. Jie Geng should be used in a small dosage in the normal dosage range. A large dosage may cause irri- tation in the throat, a stifling sensation in the chest, retention of phlegm and constipation. Pi Pa Ye (eriobotryae folium) Pi Pa Ye is bitter and cold, and enters the Lung and Stomach meridians. It is able to clear heat in the Lung, descend the Lung-Qi, stop cough and remove phlegm. When it is processed with honey, which is sweet and neutral, it develops a moist nature and can moisten the Lung, descend the Lung-Qi and stop cough. It is particularly suitable for treating both Qi and Yin deficiency in the Lung, and when the dispersing and descending function of the Lung is disturbed. The manifestations are cough without phlegm or with scanty sputum that is difficult to 141 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter expectorate, and dryness in the nasal cavities, mouth and throat. In some cases, chest pain and difficult breathing are present. Qian Hu (peucedani radix) Qian Hu is pungent and cold, and enters the Lung meridian. It is able to descend the Lung-Qi, clear the heat and is very effective for relieving cough. It is used for treating fullness in the chest, cough with green and thick sputum, wheezing and irritability due to obstruction of the Lung-Qi. Xing Ren (armeniacae semen) Xing Ren is bitter, warm and slightly poisonous. The bitter taste gives Xing Ren a descending quality. Warmth can disperse the accumulation of phlegm and the stagnation of Qi. Xing Ren contains oil, which gives this herb a moist nature. The function of Xing Ren is characterized by descending the Lung-Qi and transforming phlegm in order to stop cough. It is particularly selected in formulas to treat cough with a large amount of phlegm, fullness in the chest, shortness of breath and nasal obstruction, as it has no side effect of injuring the Lung-Yin. It can also eliminate phlegm in Lung-Qi deficiency. Zhi Ke (aurantii fructus) Zhi Ke is bitter and slightly cold, and enters the Stomach and Spleen meridians. It moves horizon- tally in the Upper- and Middle-Jiao. It is character- ized by opening the chest and reducing fullness, irritability and depression due to Qi stagnation. It has the function of dissolving phlegm and can treat cough due to heat in the Lung. Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) Wu Wei Zi is sour and warm, and enters the Lung, Heart and Kidney meridians. It is often used as assistant to stabilize the Lung-Qi when the Lung-Qi is dispersed widely by shallow and quick breathing, particularly in chronic conditions of Lung-Qi defi- ciency. It should not be used in a large dosage or in any condition where there is accumulation of a large amount of phlegm. Envoy: Harmonize the herbs in the whole formula Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) Gan Cao enters the 12 meridians, and its sweet taste gives this herb tonifying, modifying and har- monizing abilities. It is able to tonify and moisten the Lung, moderate the hot or harsh herbs in the formula, and integrate the actions of the herbs that work at different levels and in different directions. Jie Geng (platycodi radix) Jie Geng is pungent, bitter and neutral, and enters the Lung meridian. It is used mainly as envoy in the formula that tonifies the Spleen-Qi so as to generate the Lung-Qi. It serves as guide, and lifts the Spleen- Qi to the Lung so as to strengthen the Lung-Qi. Examples of classical formulas Bu Fei Tang (Tonify the Lung Decoction) Source: Yong Lei Qian Fang Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 9 g Huang Qi (Astragali radix) 24 g Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata) 24 g Zi Wan (Asteris radix) 9 g Sang Bai Pi (Mori cortex) 12 g Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) 6 g Analysis of the formula Bu Fei Tang is a formula that directly tonifies the Lung-Qi and treats the typical condition of Lung-Qi deficiency. The manifestations are shortness of breath, cough, spontaneous sweating, a pale com- plexion, a pale tongue and a weak pulse. In this formula: • The chief herbs are Ren Shen and Huang Qi. The former tonifies the Lung-Qi and Kidney-Qi; the latter tonifies the Spleen-Qi and Lung-Qi. Both are strong in tonifying action. • Shu Di Huang, as deputy, treats the coexisting syndromes. This herb is sweet and warm, and enters the Kidney meridian. It can tonify the blood and Kidney-essence, which are weakened in chronic conditions or in constitutional conditions of Lung-Qi deficiency. • Zi Wan and Sang Bai Pi serve as assistants; they regulate the function of the Lung. Zi Wan can tonify the Lung-Qi and transform the phlegm 142


so as to treat chronic cough with phlegm. Sang Bai Pi is able to descend the Lung-Qi to treat shortness of breath and a stifling sensation in the chest. • Wu Wei Zi is very sour in taste and is selected as another assistant in this formula to stabilize the Lung-Qi. It is used when the Lung-Qi is dispersed widely by shallow and quick breathing and by the stimulation of pungent and warm herbs. Commentary on strategies • As this formula tonifies the three main sources of Lung-Qi, it is considered a formula that comprehensively tonifies the Lung-Qi. • It is also very useful for patients with a weak constitution and with chronic deficiency conditions of the Lung, and for patients who get cold repeatedly and in whom the recovery process is very slow. Yu Ping Feng San (Jade Windscreen Powder) Source: Dan Xi Xin Fa • Bai Zhu serves as deputy. It is pungent, bitter and warm, and is used at twice the dosage of Huang Qi. It can particularly tonify the Spleen-Qi and dry dampness, thereby indirectly strengthening the Lung-Qi and Defensive-Qi. • Fang Feng is used as assistant. It is slightly warm and pungent, and enters not only the Bladder meridian, but also the Spleen meridian. It can expel the wind and cold at either the superficial or the subcutaneous level of the body. It spreads the Defensive-Qi in the superficial region and controls the opening and closing of the pores. Commentary on strategies • This formula is very effective for treating spontaneous sweating and thus is often placed in the category of formulas that stabilize and bind. In fact, it is a formula that treats the cause (e.g. the Qi deficiency) as well as the symptoms (e.g. spontaneous sweating). • The treatment strategies shown in this formula are combinations of: direct and indirect tonifying methods; using the tonifying and stabilizing herbs together; and using the stabilizing herb with the dispersing herb. Sheng Mai San (Generate the Pulse Powder) Source: Nei Wai Shang Bian Huo Lun Huang Qi (Astragali radix) 30 g Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 60 g Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix) 30 g Analysis of the formula This formula can directly tonify the Spleen-Qi and Lung-Qi, and strengthen the Defensive-Qi so as to stabilize the exterior and prevent the invasion of external pathogenic factors. It is often used in those with a propensity for catching colds or having a common cold of long duration. The main manifesta- tions and signs are a pale complexion, a weak voice, spontaneous sweating, a pale tongue and a soft or weak pulse. In this formula: • Huang Qi is used as chief. Since it can strongly and directly strengthen the Lung-Qi, Spleen-Qi and Defensive-Qi, it can stabilize the exterior. Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 10 g Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) 15 g Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) 6 g Analysis of the formula Sheng Mai San is a small but very effective formula for treating many different disorders and conditions. In treating a disorder of the Lung, it is able to tonify the Lung-Qi, nourish the Lung-Yin and treat a syn- drome of both Yin and Qi deficiency. This syndrome often arises during a hot summer or after a febrile disease when the excess heat or pathological heat consumes the Yin and Qi of the Lung. This syn- 143 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter drome is also seen in chronic diseases where the Lung-Yin and Lung-Qi are injured by long-term imbalance of the internal organs. The main symp- toms are shortness of breath, tiredness, sweating, dry throat and thirst, and cough with scanty sputum. This formula can also be used to treat emotional disorders that are caused by Lung-Qi and Lung-Yin deficiency, such as depression, sadness, hyperventil- ation, a stifling sensation in the chest and lack of resolution and confidence to do things. Deficiency of Yin and Qi shows as a red tongue with a very thin and dry coating, and a weak, rapid and thready pulse. In this formula: • Ren Shen, as chief, can directly tonify the Lung- Qi. It can be replaced by a large dosage of Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix), which tonifies the Spleen-Qi in order to tonify the Lung-Qi. • Mai Men Dong, as deputy, is sweet and cold. Together with Ren Shen or Dang Shen, Mai Men Dong can generate the Qi and nourish the Yin of the Lung, and treats the deficiency. • Wu Wei Zi serves as assistant. Its sour taste strengthens and stabilizes the function of Mai Men Dong to generate the Lung-Yin; it strengthens and stabilizes the function of sweet Ren Shen to tonify the Lung-Qi. Commentary on strategies The treatment strategy in this formula is presented by using combinations of herbs that are sweet, cold and sour in nature and the combination of tonifying and stabilizing the Qi and Yin together. These perfect combinations result in a strong and effective therapeutic outcome, despite there being only three herbs in the formula. Shen Ling Bai Zhu San (Ginseng, Poria and Atractylodes Macrocephala Powder) Source: Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang Shan Yao (Dioscoreae rhizoma) 1000 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 1000 g Bai Bian Dou (Dolichoris lablab semen) 750 g Yi Yi Ren (Coicis semen) 500 g Lian Zi (Nelumbinis semen) 500 g Sha Ren (Amomi xanthioidis fructus) 500 g Jie Geng (Platycodi radix) 500 g Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 1000 g Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 1000 g Fu Ling (Poria) 1000 g Analysis of the formula and commentary on strategies This formula is discussed in Section 1, Syndrome of Spleen-Qi deficiency. It can also treat Lung-Qi defi- ciency. As the Lung and Spleen have a relationship as child and mother according to the Five-Element theory, tonifying the Spleen can strengthen the Lung too. This method is called cultivate the earth to generate the metal. In this formula, a strategy is used to show a method of indirectly tonifying the Lung-Qi by using a large number of herbs that tonify the Spleen-Qi, with Jie Geng as a guide to bring the Spleen-Qi to the Lung.

## 3 Syndrome of Heart-Qi


Main symptoms Palpitations, restlessness, shortness of breath on exertion, mental tiredness Secondary symptoms Insomnia, sweating easily, anxiety, depression Tongue Pale or dull-pale with a white coating Pulse Restless and weak in general; particularly weak in the Heart position In some cases, the pulse in the Heart position is slightly forceful at the superficial level but weak at the second and third levels Associated disorders in western medicine Different types of heart disease, such as rheumatic heart disease, arrhythmia; diseases of the circulatory 144


and nervous systems, conditions where low blood pressure, anxiety and depression are present. Analysis of the syndrome The Heart-Qi has a close relationship with the Spleen-Qi as the Spleen-Qi is the source of the Qi in the different organs after one is born. The condi- tion of the Heart-Qi is also directly influenced by the Heart-blood. Since an important function of the Heart is to govern the blood circulation, the rela- tionship between Qi and blood in the Heart is very close from the start. It can be described as the Qi guides the blood and the blood carries the Qi. Thus the function of the Heart-Qi depends on sufficient blood. The Qi and the blood are generated by each other and they gain support from each other. Since the Heart houses the shen, a normal mental state and activities depend on sufficient Heart-Qi and Heart-blood. Heart-Qi deficiency is often seen in conditions of Spleen-Qi deficiency and acute or chronic blood deficiency. • If the Qi is too weak to promote blood circulation, palpitations start. • If the Heart-Qi is not able to support the Lung-Qi in the Upper-Jiao, patients will have shortness of breath on exertion and will sweat easily. • If the Heart-Qi is too weak to support the Heart-shen, patients may suffer from anxiety, restlessness, restless sleep and waking up frequently during the night, and may have a weak and restless pulse. • When the Heart-Qi is too weak to stimulate the blood circulation, the color of the tongue turns to purple and the pulse does not flow freely. (See Figure 5.3 on page 189.) Treatment principle: Tonify the Heart-Qi, nourish the Heart-blood, regulate the blood circulation and calm the mind meridians, and have a function of tonifying the Heart-Qi are selected • Second, herbs that are sweet and slightly warm, enter the Heart, Spleen and Liver meridians, are able to nourish the blood, calm the mind and improve sleep are often selected • Third, herbs that promote the Qi movement and blood circulation so as to maintain the proper function of the Heart are often used Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Tonify the Heart-Qi directly Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) or Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix) Both Ren Shen and Dang Shen are sweet in nature and enter the Spleen and Lung meridians. They can directly tonify the Spleen-Qi and can therefore gen- erate the Heart-Qi. They can tonify the Lung-Qi as well, which stimulates the blood circulation and influences the function of the Heart. They are often selected in the formula as chief to tonify the Heart- Qi. Compared with Dang Shen, Ren Shen is warm; as it also tonifies the Source-Qi, its function of ton- ifying the Heart-Qi is stronger than that of Dang Shen. However, some patients cannot bear its strong tonification and the symptoms of restlessness and insomnia can get worse. Dang Shen is sweet and neutral. It can gently tonify the Heart-Qi, does not have the side effects of Ren Shen, and is suitable for chronic conditions. Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and slightly warm, which are the principal properties of herbs that can tonify the Qi. It enters all the ordinary meridians, can tonify the Qi, moderate the speed of Qi and blood, and harmonize the functions of the internal organs. It is particularly selected in the formula with a large dosage as chief to calm the mind and relieve the palpitations and restlessness caused by Heart-Qi deficiency. Long Yan Rou (Longanae arillus) Lou Yan Rou is a sweet and neutral fruit. It enters the Heart and Spleen meridians and can gently tonify the Spleen-Qi, the Heart-Qi and the blood. At the same time, it can calm the mind and treat 145 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter restlessness, anxiety and insomnia. As this sweet fruit is neither cloying nor dry in property, it can be used in the diet for chronic conditions. Deputy: Tonify the blood and generate the Heart-Qi Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) Wu Wei Zi is sour and warm, and enters the Lung, Heart and Kidney meridians. It has no function to tonify the Qi, but it can stabilize the Heart-Qi, especially when it is used with tonifying herbs. This herb is especially effective to treat palpitations, shortness of breath after exertion and sweating due to weakness of the Heart-Qi. Fu Shen (poriae cocos pararadicis) Fu Shen is neutral and bland, and enters the Heart and Spleen meridians. It is able to tonify the Heart- Qi and Spleen-Qi and calm the mind, thereby treat- ing restlessness and insomnia. Since it is neutral and bland, and gentle in property and action, it is often used in the diet for chronic conditions of Heart-Qi deficiency. Suan Zao Ren (Ziziphi spinosae semen) Suan Zao Ren is sweet, sour and neutral, and enters the Heart and Liver meridians. It nourishes the blood of the Heart and Liver and improves sleep. It is very useful in formulas to treat restlessness and insomnia caused by blood deficiency. Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) Mai Men Dong is sweet and cold, and enters the Heart, Lung and Stomach meridians. Although it is often used to nourish the Yin and reduce heat, it has a gentle function of tonifying the Qi of the Heart and Lung. It is a perfect choice in a formula when both the Qi and Yin are deficient. Assistant: Calm the mind Long Chi (Mastodi fossilia dentis), Fu Shen (poriae cocos pararadicis) and Xiao Mai (tritici semen) These three substances are all able to calm the mind. Of the three, Long Chi is the strongest and is used in acute conditions; Fu Shen can be used over a longer period of time and it can also gently tonify the Spleen-Qi; Xiao Mai is cold in temperature and it is principally used to treat restlessness with irrita- bility when there is slight excess heat or empty-heat in the Heart. Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix) and Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix) The stable relationship between the Heart and Kidney is important in maintaining the normal mental state. It is described as the Heart-fire descends to the Lower-Jiao to warm the Kidney- water; and the Kidney-water ascends to the Upper- Jiao to calm the Heart-fire. Both herbs are cold in nature and enter the Heart and Kidney meridians. They are able to nourish the Heart-Yin and reduce the excess fire and empty-fire there. They are often chosen in formulas to treat restlessness and palpita- tion caused by Yin deficiency with heat in the Heart. Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma), Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) and alcohol When the Heart-Qi is too weak to stimulate the blood, blood stagnation may appear, thus directly causing palpitations and restlessness. Chuan Xiong is warm and pungent, and enters the Heart and Liver meridians. It is called a Qi moving herb in the blood. A small amount of Chuan Xiong can be used in formulas that tonify the Heart- Qi as it can stimulate the blood circulation and Qi movement. Gui Zhi and alcohol are pungent and warm. They enter the Heart meridian and can stimulate spread- ing of the Yang and Qi movement. A small amount of Gui Zhi or alcohol can be used as assistant in the formula to tonify the Heart-Qi in order to stimulate the blood circulation and Qi movement. Alcohol is pungent and warm. Since it has a quick moving ability, it is considered to enter all meridi- ans. It can stimulate the Yang and spread the Yang and Qi. Since these substances are pungent and can consume the Qi, they should be used with a large number of herbs that tonify the Qi and blood of the Heart and their dosages should be small. Yuan Zhi (polygalae radix) and Shi Chang Pu (acori graminei rhizoma) These two herbs are pungent, bitter and warm, and enter the Heart meridian. They are able to eliminate the invisible phlegm, open the chest and calm the mind. They can be applied in the formula if phlegm is generated by deficiency of the Spleen-Qi and Heart-Qi, and the phlegm covers the mind and leads to insomnia, palpitations and restlessness. 146


Envoy: Harmonize the herbs in the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) and Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) As the sweet Zhi Gan Cao can harmonize the herbs in a formula, and the sour Wu Wei Zi can stabilize the actions of the herbs in a formula, they are often used as envoys. Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Liver-Qi stagnation: add Xiang Fu (Cyperi rhizoma) and Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) to spread the Liver-Qi. • Liver-blood deficiency: add Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata) and Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) to nourish the blood. • Sadness or depression due to Lung-Qi deficiency: add He Huan Pi (Albiziae cortex) and Bai He (Lilii bulbus) to moisten the Lung and spread the Qi. • Reduced appetite with distension of the stomach: add Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) and Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) to soothe the Stomach-Qi. Examples of classical formulas Zhi Gan Cao Tang (Radix Glycyrrhizae Uralensis Decoction) Source: Shang Han Lun Analysis of the formula This is a formula to treat chronic palpitations and irregular pulse. The symptoms are directly caused by deficiency of the Heart-Qi. As the Qi is sup- ported by the blood and Yin, and stimulated by the Yang, in this syndrome there is also blood, Yin and Yang deficiency. In this formula: • The chief herbs are Zhi Gan Cao, Ren Shen and Da Zao. Since they directly tonify the Heart-Qi, they can stimulate the Qi movement. • Sheng Di Huang, Mai Men Dong, E Jiao and Hei Zhi Ma serve as deputies to tonify the blood and nourish the Yin so as to house and carry the Qi. • Sheng Jiang and Gui Zhi together with rice wine are assistants. They stimulate the Heart- Yang, and promote the Qi movement and blood circulation so as to treat the palpitations which are partially caused by the Qi and blood stagnation. Commentary on strategies This formula, devised by Dr Zhang Zhong Jing, has existed for more than 2000 years. Although the symptoms and signs are mentioned briefly, the defi- ciency of Qi and blood, Yin and Yang can be found in the analysis of this formula. • This formula demonstrates the treatment strategies of relieving palpitations in a chronic case by tonifying the weakness and stabilizing the relationships of the Qi and blood, Yin and Yang. It considers the function of the Qi as well as its substantial base, the Yin and blood. • It should be borne in mind that the herbs which stimulate the Yang should be used in small dosage as they can consume the Qi and Yin. In cases of obvious Yin deficiency, where patients have a red tongue without coating and a thready and rapid pulse, warm and pungent herbs should not be used.

They can harmonize the Middle-Jiao and promote digestion so as to strengthen the tonifying function of the chief herbs. Commentary on strategies This is a well-organized formula for a chronic condition. • It concerns the relationship in the physiological and pathological aspects between the Spleen, Heart and Kidney, as well as the Qi and blood of the Heart and Spleen. • It balances the composition and dosage to reach the optimal result of tonifying the Heart-Qi and blood in order to improve all the symptoms in this syndrome.

Analysis of the formula This is a formula to treat chronic Spleen-Qi defi- ciency, which is unable to generate the Qi and blood to support the Heart. The main manifestations are palpitations, anxiety, forgetfulness, insomnia, fever- ishness and night sweats, prolonged menstruation with pale blood, poor appetite, tiredness, a pale complexion, a pale tongue with a thin white coating and a weak pulse. In this formula: • The chief is a group of herbs, a variation of the principal formula Si Jun Zi Tang (Four- Gentlemen Decoction). They are Ren Shen, Huang Qi, Bai Zhu and Zhi Gan Cao. These herbs can directly tonify the Spleen-Qi, strengthen the foundation of life and accelerate the process of generating Qi and blood. • Fu Shen, Long Yan Rou and Suan Zao Ren are all deputies and they particularly tonify the Heart-Qi, calm the mind and improve sleep. • Dang Gui, Suan Zao Ren, Long Yan Rou and Da Zao form another group of deputy herbs that particularly tonify the blood of the Heart and therefore strengthen the Heart-Qi and calm the mind. • Mu Xiang and Yuan Zhi serve as assistants: the former can regulate the Qi movement in the Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 10 g Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) 15 g Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) 6 g Analysis of the formula Sheng Mai San is a small but very effective formula for treating many different disorders and conditions. When treating a disorder of the Heart, it is able to tonify the Heart-Qi, nourish the Heart-Yin and treat a syndrome where both Yin and Qi are deficient. This syndrome often arises during a hot summer or after a febrile disease when the excess heat or path- ological heat consumes the Yin and Qi of the Lung and Heart. This syndrome is also seen in chronic diseases where the Heart-Yin and Heart-Qi are injured by a long-term imbalance between the internal organs. The main symptoms and signs are 148


shortness of breath, tiredness, sweating, palpita- tions, anxiety, sadness and depression, a red tongue without coating, and a thready and restless pulse. • Ren Shen, as chief, can directly tonify the Heart-Qi. It can be replaced by a large dosage of Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix), which tonifies the Spleen-Qi so as to tonify the Heart-Qi. • Mai Men Dong, as deputy, is sweet and cold. It enters the Heart meridian directly and can generate the Qi and nourish the Yin of the Heart. It may enhance the ability of the chief in tonifying the Qi. • Wu Wei Zi, which is sour and warm, serves as assistant. It is able to stabilize the Heart-Qi and Yin. It enhances the actions of the sweet and cold herbs to tonify the Qi and the Yin. Commentary on strategies The treatment strategy in this formula is presented by using combinations of herbs that are sweet, cold and sour in nature. Although there are only three herbs in this formula, the result of tonifying the Yin and Qi is significant due to the perfect combination. Yang Xin Tang (Nourish the Heart Decoction) Source: Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng and blood. The manifestations are palpitations and restlessness, mental confusion, insomnia, dream- disturbed sleep, tiredness and depression, a pale tongue with a thin white coating and a restless, weak pulse. In this formula: • The chief herbs are Ren Shen, Huang Qi and Zhi Gan Cao. They strongly tonify the Spleen-Qi in order to generate the Qi and blood to support the Heart. • Dang Gui and Suan Zao Ren serve as deputies. As they can tonify the blood of the Heart directly, they can enhance the ability of the herbs that tonify the Heart-Qi. • Rou Gui and Chuan Xiong can promote the blood circulation; Chuan Xiong can also strengthen the Kidney-Yang so as to stabilize the Heart-Qi. They are used as assistants in the formula. • Suan Zao Ren, Bai Zi Ren, Fu Ling and Yuan Zhi also serve as assistants to calm the mind and improve sleep. • Wu Wei Zi is sour and warm, and enters the Heart meridian. It can stabilize the Heart-Qi and Heart-Yin so as to calm the Heart-Shen. It is used as an assistant in the formula. Commentary on strategies Yang Xin Tang is a thoughtful formula in composition: • It takes into consideration that the Qi and blood are the foundation materials of Heart- shen and therefore it tonifies the Qi and blood firstly. • It tonifies the Qi by taking into consideration the source (the Kidney and the Spleen), which is demonstrated by the use of Ren Shen and Huang Qi. • It tonifies the blood by taking into consideration the source (the Kidney and the Liver) and therefore it tonifies the Liver blood. • It considers the nature of blood which prefers warmth and movement. This is demonstrated by the use of Rou Gui, Chuan Xiong and Dang Gui. • Building on the foundation of Qi and blood, which has been strengthened and balanced, herbs that calm the mind are then used.

## Syndrome of

## blood deficiency

Blood is one of the principal substances of the body. It circulates smoothly and constantly in the body, nourishes and supports the internal organs, and maintains the functions and structures of the body. The Heart, Liver and Spleen directly influence the generation of blood. The Heart governs the blood and promotes the blood circulation; it also generates the Heart-Qi and directly supports the activities of the Heart-shen. The Liver stores the blood and regulates the volume of blood in the circulation; it directly supports the activities of the Hun (soul). The Spleen is able to transform food into Qi and blood, and is considered the main source of Heart- blood and Liver-blood. The Kidney stores the essence, which can also transform into Liver-blood, so is another source of blood. The causes of blood deficiency are linked directly with deficiency of these four organs. It is often seen in chronic diseases, improper diet or in conditions of starvation. It can also occur following heavy blood loss. Long-term stress and overwork can directly weaken the Heart, Spleen, Liver and Kidney, causing blood deficiency. When the blood cannot support the head, dizzi- ness and vertigo may present. If the blood is too weak to circulate, one will feel tingling of the limbs. When the blood fails to nourish skin, muscles and tendons, the skin becomes dry and itchy, muscles and tendons become stiff or numb, and patients may feel tired. Since normal menstruation is directly supported by blood, irregular menstruation and amenorrhea may occur in conditions of blood defi- ciency. If the blood is unable to nourish the Heart, the Heart-shen becomes rootless, and insomnia, pal- pitations, shortness of breath, restlessness and anxiety arise. If the Liver-blood is not able to support the Hun (soul), restless sleep and dream-disturbed sleep may present. Since the Liver opens into the eyes, when the Liver-blood is insufficient, dry eyes and blurred vision exist. In the syndrome of blood deficiency, the tongue is often pale or delicate red, and the tongue coating is white. The pulse is usually thready and choppy or thready and wiry. In this section, the strategies of composing the formulas that tonify the Heart-blood and Liver- blood are discussed because they are common syn- dromes. The related Spleen disorder is discussed in Section 1, Syndrome of Spleen-Qi deficiency, the related Lung disorders are discussed in Section 2, Syndrome of Lung-Qi deficiency and Section 6, Syn- drome of Lung-Yin deficiency, and the related Kidney disorder is introduced in Sections 10 and 11, Syn- drome of Kidney-Yin deficiency and Syndrome of Kidney-Yang deficiency, respectively.

## 4 Syndrome of Liver-blood


Main symptoms Dizziness, dry eyes, blurred vision, cramping and stiffness of muscles and joints, tingling or numbness of limbs, insomnia, dream-disturbed sleep and dull-pale complexion Secondary symptoms Thin and brittle nails, dry and itchy skin, dry nasal cavities, constipation, scanty menstruation, amenorrhea or irregular menstruation, infertility, anger and depression Tongue Pale with a thin white coating Pulse Thready, or thready and wiry, particularly on the left side Associated disorders in western medicine Various types of anemia, malnutrition, hypotension, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, infertility, thrombo- cytopenia, heavy blood loss after a surgical operation or delivery of a baby, mental disorders. 150


Analysis of the syndrome • The Liver stores blood and regulates the quantity of blood in the blood circulation. If the Liver-blood is too weak to nourish its orifice, dizziness, dry eyes and blurred vision may exist. • When the blood is too weak to circulate and nourish the tendons, numbness, tingling of the muscles, stiffness or cramp of the joints and thin and brittle nails may present. • When the blood is unable to nourish the skin, the mucus and the intestines, dry and itchy skin, dry nasal cavities and constipation may occur. • The Liver houses the Hun (soul), which is active in sleep. If the Liver-blood is deficient, restless sleep and dream-disturbed sleep often exist. • Menstruation is supported by sufficient blood. If the blood is deficient, scanty menstruation, amenorrhea or irregular menstruation may present. If the blood is too weak to nourish the fetus, infertility and miscarriage may occur. • If the blood cannot flow vigorously, there may be a thready pulse. When the blood is too weak to move, Qi stagnation is often present – the pulse is then not only thready, but also wiry. Patients may suffer from emotional disturbances such as depression, anger and irritability, or hypochondriac distension and pain. (See Figure 5.4 on page 189.) Treatment principle: Nourish the Liver-blood; promote the free flow of Liver-Qi and the smooth circulation of blood Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Tonify the Liver-blood directly Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix) and Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) Dang Gui is sweet, pungent and warm, and enters the Liver meridian. It is the commonly used herb to tonify the Liver-blood as it enters the Liver meridian primarily and tonifies the blood directly. Along with herbs that tonify the Kidney-essence, its function of tonifying the Liver-blood becomes stronger. The strong point of this herb is that it not only tonifies the blood, but also promotes the blood circulation as it has pungent and warm properties. It matches the nature of blood, which prefers warmth and must always be moving. Bai Shao Yao is bitter, sour and slightly cold. It enters the Liver and Spleen meridians. Its sour and cold property can nourish the Yin directly and gen- erate the substantial part of the blood. It is particu- larly effective for softening the Liver, thereby relieving cramp of the muscles and tendons. It can also effectively moisten the internal organs and the orifices, so it can treat the symptoms of dryness of skin and eyes caused by Liver-blood deficiency. Dang Gui and Bai Shao Yao are very often used together as a pair of herbs in the formula, as Dang Gui concerns the functional aspect of blood and Bai Shao Yao concerns the substantial aspect of blood. The former is called a Yang herb and the latter a Yin herb in this situation. They can effectively treat Liver-blood deficiency. Shu Di Huang (rehmanniae radix praeparata) Shu Di Huang is sweet and slightly warm, and enters the Kidney and Liver meridians. As it is able to tonify the Kidney-essence and the Liver-blood directly, the function of tonifying the blood is quite strong. It is often used as chief in the formula for serious conditions of blood and essence deficiency, such as in those with a poor constitution, retardation of children and degeneration in elderly people. In the formula, this herb should be used with some herbs that regulate the Qi in the Middle- and Lower- Jiao to reduce its rich and heavy nature. 151 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter Deputy: Nourish the Kidney-essence Gou Qi Zi (Lycii fructus) and He Shou Wu (polygoni multiflori radix) These two herbs enter the Kidney and Liver merid- ians. They are able to tonify the Kidney-essence and Liver-blood. Unlike Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata) they are not heavy and cloying in nature, thus they may not bring about the problem of digestion. For this reason, they are often used in formulas to enhance the ability of the chief herb to tonify the Liver-blood. Assistant: Treat the symptoms caused directly by blood deficiency Ji Xue Teng (Spatholobi caulis et radix) Ji Xue Teng is bitter, slightly sweet and warm, and enters the Kidney and Liver meridians. It is a special herb for tonifying the blood as it is also able to promote the blood circulation and relax the tendons. It is therefore selected in formulas to relieve stiff- ness, tingling, numbness, pain and an uneasy feeling in the body, such as in Bi syndrome and in restless leg disorder due to blood deficiency with Qi and blood stagnation. Mu Gua (Chaenomelis fructus) Mu Gua is sour and warm, and enters the Liver and Spleen meridians. It has no function to tonify the blood, but is able to nourish the tendons, expel dampness and open the meridians. It is selected in formulas to relieve spasm and stiffness of the limbs due to Yin and Liver-blood deficiency. Suan Zao Ren (Ziziphi spinosae semen) Suan Zao Ren is sweet, sour and neutral, and enters the Liver, Gall Bladder and Heart meridians. Since sweet and sour may generate the Yin and stabilize the body fluids, it is also able to nourish the Liver blood. It is a perfect herb to calm the mind and improve sleep. It is often selected in the formula to treat anxiety, sweating, restless sleep and dream- disturbed sleep due to Liver-blood deficiency. Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) and Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) The function and characteristics of Bai Shao Yao have been discussed in the chief herbs. Because it is a sour and cold herb, and is able to generate and stabilize the Yin and body fluids, it is often used as an assistant to relieve muscle cramp. If it is used with Zhi Gan Cao, the function of smoothing the muscles and treating cramping pain is increased. Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix) and Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma) The tonifying function of Dang Gui has been dis- cussed in the chief herbs. As Dang Gui also has the function of promoting the blood circulation, it is used as an assistant to regulate the blood circulation. It is mainly selected in formulas to treat dysmenor- rhea, amenorrhea, tingling and numbness of the limbs that are caused by deficiency of blood and slowing down of blood circulation. Chuan Xiong is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Liver, Gall Bladder and Pericardium meridians. It has no tonifying function, but is char- acterized by its ability to move the Qi in the blood. Since its moving speed and strength are high, it is able to reach to any part of the body and is effective in relieving pain caused by Qi and blood stagnation. A small amount of Chuan Xiong may be used as an assistant in the formula that tonifies the Liver-blood to reduce the stagnation of blood caused by defi- ciency. It is particularly effective for treating hypo- chondriac pain, stiffness, and tingling and numbness of the muscles due to Qi and blood stagnation. Xiang Fu (Cyperi rhizoma) Xiang Fu is a very commonly used herb to regulate the Liver-Qi. It is pungent, sweet, slightly bitter and warm, without a harsh and drying nature. It enters the Liver and San Jiao meridians and is effective and gentle when regulating Qi. It promotes Liver-Qi movement without injuring the Yin and blood of the Liver. As it is slightly bitter, it can reduce the slight Liver-heat that is generated by Liver-Qi stagnation or blood and Yin deficiency. The sweetness can soften the Liver and moderate the speed of the Qi movement. All these characteristics match the path- ological changes in the syndrome of blood deficiency with Liver-Qi stagnation. Because Xiang Fu enters the San Jiao meridian that is the passage of the Qi and water, it can effectively spread the Qi in the entire body. For all these reasons, Xiang Fu is very often used as assistant in formulas that tonify the blood. Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao is often used as an assistant in the formula. It moderates and harmonizes the tonifying herbs in the formula, moderates the Liver-Qi move- ment and reduces its speed. At the same time, it can 152


ease the cramping pain of both muscles and tendons. When it is used with Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora), this function becomes stronger. Envoy: Harmonize the herbs in the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao is the most commonly used envoy in formulas that tonify the Liver-blood. Its moderate temperament harmonizes the functions of the herbs in the formula, and moderates the Liver-Qi move- ment and blood circulation. Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Hypochondriac pain and distension: use Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix), Mei Gui Hua (Rosae flos) and Xiang Fu (Cyperi rhizoma) to spread the Liver-Qi. • Irritability, dry eyes and blurred vision: use Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex), Ju Hua (Chrysanthemi flos) and Xia Ku Cao (Prunellae spica) to reduce the Liver-heat and improve vision. • Dysmenorrhea with cold sensation in the lower back and abdomen: use Pao Jiang (quick-fried Zingiberis rhizoma preparatum), Ai Ye (Artemisiae argyi folium), Xiao Hui Xiang (Foeniculi fructus) or Rou Gui (Cinnamomi cassiae cortex) to warm the blood and warm the Lower-Jiao. • Chronic pain of the joints and muscles: use Tao Ren (Persicae semen), Hong Hua (Carthami flos) and Ji Xue Teng (Spatholobi caulis et radix) to regulate the blood circulation. • Dream-disturbed sleep and insomnia: use Long Gu (Mastodi fossilium ossis), Zhen Zhu Mu (Concha margaritifera usta) and Ci Shi (Magnetitum) to calm the mind directly in an acute condition; use Ye Jiao Teng (Polygoni multiflori caulis), He Huan Pi (Albiziae cortex) and Bai Zi Ren (Platycladi semen) to calm the mind in a chronic condition. Examples of classical formulas Si Wu Tang (Four-Substance Decoction) Source: Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang Dang Gui (Angelicae sinensis radix) 10 g Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma) 8 g Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) 12 g Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata) 12 g Analysis of the formula Si Wu Tang is a formula that directly tonifies the Liver-blood. Moreover, because it shows the basic principles and strategies to tonify blood, it is consid- ered the principal formula to tonify blood in formula study. The four herbs in the formula can be divided into two groups: • One group focuses on tonifying the blood and promoting blood circulation, and concerns the functioning aspect of the blood and the herbs that are active in nature. The herbs in this group are Dang Gui and Chuan Xiong. • The other group focuses on tonifying the substantial aspect of the blood, and the herbs have a nourishing and stabilizing nature. The herbs in this group are Bai Shao Yao and Shu Di Huang. This formula can also be analyzed from another point of view. Four of these herbs all enter the Liver meridian: • Dang Gui and Bai Shao Yao are the principal pair of herbs that tonify the Liver-blood directly. They are considered to be chief herbs. • Shu Di Huang enters the Kidney meridian. As it is able to tonify the Kidney-essence, it can therefore tonify the Liver-blood. It demonstrates a way to indirectly tonify and is considered to be a deputy herb. • Chuan Xiong is the only herb in the formula that has no function in tonifying the blood; instead it activates the blood circulation and 153 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter reduces blood stagnation due to deficiency. It acts as assistant to the tonifying herbs. Commentary on strategies • If the dosages and the temperature of the herbs in this formula are considered, it can be seen that the herbs which tonify the substantial aspect of the blood are in higher dosages than the herbs which tonify the functional aspect; the dosage of the herbs that tonify the blood is higher than that of the herbs which regulate the blood; there are more warm herbs than cold herbs. All of these features indicate that Si Wu Tang is a formula that mainly tonifies the substantial part of the blood, and initially tonifies the Liver-blood. • It includes direct and indirect tonifying strategies and also concerns the moving and warming natures of the blood. Because of these features, this formula is considered the principal formula for tonifying the blood. • In clinical practice, this formula can easily be varied by changing the dosages of herbs or herbal variations. In cases where the functional part of the blood is weak, the dosages of Dang Gui and Chuan Xiong can be increased and herbs such as Tao Ren (Persicae semen) and Hong Hua (Carthami flos) can be added. If there is severe shortage of a substantial part of the blood, Bai Shao Yao and Shu Di Huang can be used in higher dosages and herbs such as Gou Qi Zi (Lycii fructus), E Jiao (Asini corii colla) and Tu Si Zi (Cuscutae semen) can be added. As a result, this formula is considered a principal formula to tonify the blood. Xiao Ying Jian (Minor Ying Tonifying Decoction) Source: Jing Yue Quan Shu Analysis of the formula This is a formula to treat hypomenorrhea, prolonged menstrual cycle and amenorrhea due to Liver-blood deficiency. In this formula: • Dang Gui and Bai Shao Yao tonify the Liver- blood directly. • Shu Di Huang and Gou Qi Zi tonify the Liver- blood and Kidney-essence, thereby broadening the source of the blood. They are considered the chief herbs in the formula. • The neutral and astringent Shan Yao, which enters the Spleen and Kidney meridians, is an assistant in the formula. As it is able to tonify the Spleen-Qi and stabilize the Kidney-essence, it assists the herbs that tonify the blood from the Liver and Kidney aspects. • Zhi Gan Cao, as envoy, can tonify the Spleen-Qi and harmonize the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies This formula focuses on tonifying the material aspect of the blood, and suggests that the astringent herbs can be used to stabilize the blood and essence, and that herbs which tonify the Spleen-Qi can be added to strengthen the blood generation. If the blood is sufficient, the menstruation becomes normal and regular. This is a formula with a moder- ate and balanced tonifying function and it can be used for a long period of time.

Analysis of the formula This formula is devised to treat cramp of the muscles and tendons, tingling of the limbs, restless sleep, an uneasy feeling of the body and brittle nails. The cause of this disorder is Liver-blood that is too weak to nourish the tendons and muscles. In this formula: • The first four herbs form Si Wu Tang (Four- Substance Decoction), the principal formula for tonifying the blood. It is considered as chief in the formula to directly tonify the blood. • The sweet and cold Mai Men Dong serves as deputy; it can generate the Yin and body fluids so as to nourish the tendons. • Sour herbs such as Mu Gua and Suan Zao Ren are considered as assistants. They can enhance the ability of Bai Shao Yao to nourish and stabilize the Yin, soften the Liver and relax the tendons. At the same time, they enhance the ability of Mai Men Dong to nourish the Yin. • Furthermore, Suan Zao Ren and Bai Shao Yao can calm the mind and improve sleep, and are also effective in treating restless sleep and an uneasy feeling of the body during sleep due to Liver-blood deficiency. • The sweet Zhi Gan Cao also serves as assistant. It can ease the tendons and muscles, a function that is enhanced by the sour herbs. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, the herbs that tonify the blood and the Yin are used together. • The sour and sweet herbs are used to enhance the effect of tonifying the substantial aspect of the blood. As soon as the blood is sufficient and the blood circulation is improved, cramp of the tendons and muscles eases and they become more relaxed.

## 5 Syndrome of Heart-blood


Secondary symptoms Tingling of limbs and extremities, poor memory, inability to concentrate, tiredness, insomnia and poor appetite Tongue Cracked, pale or delicate pink, with a white coating Pulse Thready and weak Main symptoms Pale complexion, pale lips, dizziness, palpitations, anxiety and shortness of breath Associated disorders in western medicine Blood loss, weak constitution and chronic diseases, various anemias, malnutrition, hypotension, after a surgical operation or delivery of a baby. Analysis of the syndrome • The Heart governs the blood and promotes the blood circulation. If the blood is deficient, it is unable to support the body, and a pale complexion, pale lips and pale tongue may present. • When the blood is unable to house the Heart- shen, palpitations, anxiety, restless sleep, poor memory, inability to concentrate and insomnia may exist. • If the Heart-blood is unable to support the Qi in the head and chest, dizziness, headache and shortness of breath may occur. • When the blood is too weak to circulate, to nourish the body and to carry the Qi, tiredness, poor appetite and tingling of the limbs appear. • The signs of the tongue and the pulse clearly show the deficiency of the blood. Treatment principle: Tonify the blood and regulate blood circulation 155 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter support the Heart-Qi and generate the Heart- blood are selected, along with herbs that nourish the blood and calm the mind • Third, herbs that stimulate the Qi and blood, and remove phlegm obstruction in the Heart meridian are selected Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Tonify the Heart-blood Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix) and Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) Dang Gui is sweet, pungent and warm, and enters the Liver, Heart and Spleen meridians. It is a very commonly used herb to tonify the blood. The strong point of this herb is that it not only tonifies the blood, but also promotes the blood circulation as it has pungent and warm properties. It matches the nature of blood, which prefers warmth and must always be moving. Although it is the first choice for tonifying the Liver-blood, it can tonify the blood of the Spleen and Heart as well. This herb is used mainly in pathological conditions where the Liver- Qi and blood stagnate and disturb the transportation and transformation functions of the Spleen. When the Spleen fails to generate Qi and blood, both the Liver-blood and Heart-blood become weak, result- ing in the further stagnation of Qi and blood. Bai Shao Yao is bitter, sour and slightly cold, and enters the Liver and Spleen meridians. It particu- larly tonifies the substantial part of the blood and increases the Yin. It is often used in the syndrome of blood and Yin deficiency that manifests as palpi- tations, restlessness, stiffness and cramping pain of the limbs, dry eyes, blurred vision and scanty men- struation due to deficiency of the blood and Yin of the Heart and Liver. Long Yan Rou (Longanae arillus) and Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) These are two sweet fruits. Long Yan Rou is neutral and Da Zao is warm. Both enter the Heart and Spleen meridians. They can gently tonify the Spleen- Qi, nourish the Heart-blood and calm the mind. As they taste nice and have few side effects, they are often selected in formulas or added to the diet for long-term use in a mild case or a chronic condition of Heart-blood deficiency, such as after a surgical operation or in chronic diseases. They are also used in the formula or diet to prevent Heart-blood defi- ciency in people who are under persistent mental stress. Deputy: Tonify the Spleen-Qi and calm the Mind Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) and Long Yan Rou (Longanae arillus) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and slightly warm, and enters all the regular meridians. It is selected in the formula to tonify the Heart-blood because it can tonify the Spleen-Qi and therefore generate the blood. It can also tonify the Heart-Qi, moderate the speed of Qi movement and blood circulation, and harmonize the function of the Heart. The function of Zhi Gan Cao can enhance the ability of the herbs that tonify the Heart-blood. At the same time, this herb can effec- tively relieve anxiety, palpitations and restlessness. Long Yan Rou is sweet and neutral, and enters the Heart and Spleen meridians. It can gently tonify the Spleen-Qi, Heart-Qi and the blood. At the same time, it can calm the mind and treat restlessness, anxiety and insomnia. As this sweet fruit has neither cloying nor drying properties, it is often used in a formula for a chronic condition or in the diet for long-term use. Fu Shen (poriae cocos pararadicis) Fu Shen is neutral and bland, and enters the Heart and Spleen meridians. Since it is able to tonify the Heart-Qi and Spleen-Qi and calm the mind, it is often selected in the formula to enhance the ability of herbs that tonify the blood. At the same time, it can treat restlessness and insomnia. Since it is gentle in action and property, and has almost no taste, it is often used in formulas or in the diet for chronic conditions of deficiency of Heart-Qi and blood. Suan Zao Ren (Ziziphi spinosae semen) and Bai Zi Ren (platycladi semen) Suan Zao Ren and Bai Zi Ren are often used in the formula to tonify the blood because they are able to calm the mind and improve sleep. Suan Zao Ren is sweet and sour. It enters the Liver meridian primarily and the Heart meridian secondly. It can tonify the Liver and Heart blood, stabilize the blood and the Qi and is effective for treating restlessness and irritability, restless sleep, dream-disturbed sleep and nightmares. The strong point of this herb is that it can tonify the blood and 156


calm the mind; therefore it is often used in the formula for tonifying the blood. Bai Zi Ren enters the Heart meridian primarily and the Liver meridian secondly. It is sweet and has a moistening nature. It is an excellent herb to nourish the Heart-blood and calm the mind. It can also stop sweating and is suitable for treating difficulty in falling asleep, restlessness and palpitations, and becoming nervous easily. Since mental state and sleep are related with the Heart and Liver, Suan Zao Ren and Bai Zhi Ren are often used together in formulas to calm the mind and improve sleep. Assistant: Spread the Yang, stimulate the Qi movement in the chest, eliminate phlegm so as to open the Heart meridian and strengthen the Middle-Jiao Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) Gui Zhi is sweet, pungent and warm, and enters the Heart meridian. Since the twigs enter the meridians according to the concepts of traditional Chinese medicine, this herb is able to stimulate the Yang and the Qi of the Heart. Together with herbs that tonify the blood, it can accelerate the speed of the blood- generating process. It is mainly used as assistant in the formula to tonify the blood so as to warm the blood, promote blood circulation and open up the obstruction. It is particularly selected in the syn- drome where there is numbness and tingling of the limbs, cold and pain of the extremities. Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma) Chuan Xiong is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Liver, Gall Bladder and Pericardium meridians. As its moving speed and strength are high, it is called the herb that moves the Qi in the blood. As assistant in the formula that tonifies the Heart-blood, a small amount of Chuan Xiong may reduce the stagnation of blood due to deficiency. It can also effectively relieve chest pain, stiffness, and tingling and numbness of the limbs. Yuan Zhi (polygalae radix) and Shi Chang Pu (acori graminei rhizoma) These two herbs are pungent, bitter and warm. Yuan Zhi enters the Heart, Kidney and Lung meridians, and Shi Chang Pu enters the Heart and Stomach meridians. They are particularly selected in the formula as assistants because they are able to remove the phlegm from the Heart meridian and treat dizziness, tinnitus, palpitations, anxiety disori- entation, poor concentration and memory due to phlegm obstruction of the Heart orifice. This condi- tion may present when the Spleen-Qi is too weak to transport and transform dampness, food and phlegm. Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) and Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) Sheng Jiang and Da Zao are often used together as assistants in the formula because the pungent and warm Sheng Jiang can warm the Stomach and soothe Stomach-Qi, and the sweet and warm Da Zao can tonify the Qi and blood of the Spleen. They promote digestion and strengthen the Middle-Jiao. In this way they broaden the source of the Qi and blood in a general sense. Envoy: Harmonize the action of herbs in the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Since Zhi Gan Cao enters all the regular meridians and is able to tonify the Qi and moderate the speed and natures of different herbs, it is often used as envoy in the formula. Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Palpitations with a deep red tongue and a wiry and rapid pulse: add Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix) to cool the Heart blood and calm the mind. • Palpitations and anxiety with a red tongue with a dry coating: add Sheng Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix) and Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) to nourish the Yin. • Shortness of breath and tiredness: add Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix) and Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) to tonify and stabilize the Heart-Qi. 157 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter Analysis of the formula This is a formula to treat chronic Spleen-Qi defi- ciency, which is unable to generate the Qi and blood to support the Heart. It results in deficiency of the Heart-Qi and blood. The main manifestations are palpitations, anxiety, forgetfulness, insomnia, fever- ishness and night sweats, prolonged menstruation with pale blood, poor appetite and tiredness, a wan complexion, a pale tongue with a thin white coating and a weak pulse. In this formula: • The chief can be considered as a group of herbs, a variation of Si Jun Zi Tang (Four- Gentlemen Decoction), the principal formula for tonifying the Spleen-Qi. They are Ren Shen, Huang Qi, Bai Zhu and Zhi Gan Cao. These herbs can directly tonify the Spleen-Qi, strengthen the foundation of life and accelerate the process of generating the Qi and blood. • Fu Shen, Long Yan Rou and Suan Zao Ren serve as deputies. They are particularly used to calm the mind and improve sleep. Fu Shen and Long Yan Rou can tonify the Heart-Qi and Long Yan Rou and Suan Zao Ren can effectively nourish the Heart-blood. • Dang Gui, Suan Zao Ren, Long Yan Rou and Da Zao form another group of deputy herbs that particularly tonify the blood of the Heart and house the Heart-shen. • Mu Xiang and Yuan Zhi serve as assistants: the former can regulate the Qi movement in the Middle-Jiao to negate the sweet and cloying nature of the tonifying herbs that may obstruct the Qi movement and bring an extra burden to the Stomach; the latter can remove the invisible phlegm and connect the Heart with the Kidney, thereby calming the mind. • Sheng Jiang and Da Zao serve as both assistant and envoy. They can harmonize the Middle-Jiao and promote digestion so as to strengthen the tonifying function of the chief herbs. Commentary on strategies This is a well-organized formula for treating a chronic deficiency condition. It concerns the rela- tionship of the physiological and pathological aspects between the Spleen, Heart and Kidney, as well as the Qi and blood of the Heart and Spleen. It bal- ances the composition and dosage to achieve the optimal result of tonifying the Heart-Qi and blood in order to improve all the symptoms in this syndrome.

## Syndrome of Yin deficiency

Yin is one of the essential substances of the body. In a broad sense, all the substantial parts of the body belong to Yin. It supports yet controls the activity of the Yang. Body fluid is also considered as Yin in a broad sense; it can moisten the organs, structures and skin, fill in the joints and ease the movement of the joints. In a narrow sense, it is divided into spe- cific Yin parts for each internal organ, playing a fundamental role in supporting the functions of these organs. In pathological conditions, the Yin of different organs can be injured by excess heat, by their specific fragility in physiology and structure, and by their weakened source. Except for the Spleen, which prefers dry rather than wet, all of the other Zang organs have Yin deficiency syndrome. In the Middle-Jiao, instead of a Yin deficiency syn- drome of the Spleen, the Stomach-Yin is easily injured by heat and thus this syndrome is discussed too.

Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Nourish the Lung-Yin Bai He (Lilii bulbus) Bai He is sweet, bland and slightly cold, and enters the Lung and Heart meridians. It has a moistening and lubricating property and can directly moisten the Lung and nourish the Yin. It is suitable for treat- ing all kinds of dryness caused by Yin and body fluid deficiency of the Lung. It is particularly suitable for use in the condition where the Lung-Yin and Heart- Yin are both deficient as it can also nourish the Heart-Yin, which is often injured along with the Lung-Yin in febrile disease as the Lung and Heart are both located in the Upper-Jiao. It is also used for depression and sadness due directly to Lung- Yin and Lung-Qi deficiency. This herb can be used for a reasonably long period of time and can be added to the diet as it is a gentle herb with few side effects. Bei Sha Shen (Glehniae radix) Bei Sha Shen is sweet, bland and slightly cold. It enters the Lung and Stomach meridians.

## 6 Syndrome of Lung-Yin


Associated disorders in western medicine Pulmonary tuberculosis, chronic bronchitis, conva- lescence of acute pneumonia, chronic pharyngitis and bronchiectasis. Analysis of the syndrome The Lung is located in the Upper-Jiao. It is a light and delicate organ that is particularly unable to bear heat and dryness. • When the Yin is too weak to nourish the Lung and its gateway, dry cough, dry throat, dry nasal cavities and hoarseness present. • If the empty-heat is generated by the Yin deficiency, the heat may consume the Yin and injure the blood vessels, and scanty phlegm and coughing of blood may occur. • As the cheeks correspond to the Lung, pinkish cheeks often indicate Lung-Yin deficiency. In a severe or chronic case, the empty-heat of the Lung may cause afternoon fever and warm palms and soles. • If the Yin and essence are both weakened, emaciation may occur. • A red and dry tongue and a thready and rapid pulse both indicate Yin deficiency. Treatment principle: Tonify the Lung-Yin 159 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter the Yin of the Lung in direct and indirect ways as it can nourish both the Lung-Yin and the Stomach- Yin. It can slightly tonify the Lung-Qi and is better used for conditions in which heat injures both the Yin and Qi. Deputy: Nourish the Kidney-Yin and Stomach-Yin and tonify the Lung-Qi and Spleen-Qi Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix) Sheng Di Huang is sweet and cold, and enters the Kidney, Heart and Liver meridians. It can quite powerfully nourish the Yin of these organs and in this way can nourish the Lung-Yin indirectly. In addition, as it is quite a cold herb, and the fresh herb is bitter in taste, it can also reduce heat sufficiently. Sheng Di Huang is an excellent herb for use in con- ditions where the heat is injuring the Yin of the body. Another characteristic of this herb is that it can cool the blood and stop bleeding; because of this it is selected to treat the coughing of blood in condi- tions of Lung-Yin deficiency. Tian Men Dong (asparagi radix) Tian Men Dong is sweet, bitter and very cold, and enters the Lung and Kidney meridians. It can strongly nourish the Lung-Yin and the Kidney-Yin and reduce heat. It is particularly used in severe and chronic conditions of Yin deficiency of these organs. Moreover, since it is quite cold and bitter and it can lubricate the intestines and soft stool, it is suitable for use when there is constipation. However, it should be avoided in conditions of weakness of Spleen-Qi and loose stool. E Jiao (asini corii colla) E Jiao is sweet and neutral, and enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. It is an important substance to nourish the Yin and blood and moisten the dryness. In the formula to treat Lung-Yin deficiency, it is suitable for treating chronic cough, dry cough and coughing of blood. Xi Yang Shen (panacis quinquefolii radix) Xi Yang Shen is bitter, cold and slightly sweet, and enters the Heart, Lung and Kidney meridians. It is quite a strong herb for tonifying the Yin and Qi of these organs and is able to reduce heat. It is par- ticularly useful in severe and chronic conditions of Yin and Qi deficiency of the Lung. Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix) Dang Shen is sweet and neutral, and enters the Spleen and Lung meridians. It has no function in nourishing the Yin, but it can gently and sufficiently tonify the Lung-Qi. As it is neutral in temperature, it has no side effects of injuring the Yin when it tonifies the Lung-Qi. It is used in the condition where the Yin and Qi are both injured and when the Spleen and Stomach cannot bear very cold herbs in the process of tonifying the Yin. Assistant: Descend the Lung-Qi, eliminate the phlegm, moisten dryness and soothe the Stomach-Qi Pi Pa Ye (eriobotryae folium), Chuan Bei Mu (Fritillariae cirrhosae bulbus), Sang Ye (Mori folium) and Gua Lou Pi (trichosanthis pericarpium) These herbs are cold in temperature and enter the Lung meridian. They are able to descend the Lung-Qi and dissolve phlegm, so they can treat cough and shortness of breath. Of importance is the fact that all are moistening in nature and are particularly suit- able for treating Lung-Yin deficiency. They can effec- tively treat dry cough and scanty phlegm. Unlike most of the pungent and warm herbs, they remove phlegm but do not cause dryness of the Lung. Envoy: Harmonize the herbs in the formula Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) and Feng Mi (Mel) Both herbs are sweet in taste and have a moistening nature; they can moisten the Lung and tonify the Spleen-Qi. In this way, they can harmonize the herbs in the formula and protect the Stomach and Spleen from cold herbs. Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Severe cough with phlegm: add Sang Bai Pi (Mori cortex) and Gua Lou Ren (Trichosanthis semen) to remove the phlegm and descend the Lung-Qi. • Severe coughing of blood: add Bai Ji (Bletillae tuber)**, Bai Mao Gen (Imperatae rhizoma) and Xian He Cao (Agrimoniae herba) to cool the blood and stop bleeding. 160


Analysis of the formula This is a formula devised for treating Yin deficiency of the Lung and Kidney, which is manifested as cough, coughing of blood, dry throat, bone steaming, night sweats, warm palms and soles, a red tongue without coating and a thready and rapid pulse. The formula focuses on moistening the Lung, reducing the heat and transforming the phlegm from the Lung. • The chief herbs are Bai He, Sheng Di Huang and Shu Di Huang. They can directly nourish the Yin and reduce heat. They treat the main causes and symptoms of disorders of the Lung and Kidney. • Mai Men Dong and Xuan Shen serve as deputies. They can reduce heat from the Upper-Jiao and enhance the abilities of the chief herbs. • The remaining herbs are assistants in the formula: – Chuan Bei Mu and Jie Geng eliminate phlegm. – Jie Geng and Gan Cao reduce heat-toxin and benefit the throat. – Dang Gui and Bai Shao Yao tonify the blood so as to tonify the Yin. Commentary on strategies • Lung and Kidney have a mother–son relationship, and the Yin of these two organs is often influenced by each other, especially in chronic conditions. This formula is characterized by selecting herbs that tonify both the Lung-Yin and Kidney-Yin although the main symptoms are directly manifested in the Lung. • Mai Men Dong is used to nourish the Heart- Yin, and Bai Shao and Dang Gui are used to tonify the blood. They show the understanding of the relationship between Yin and blood, and the relationship between Yin of the Lung, Heart, Liver and Kidney.

Examples of classical formulas Bai He Gu Jin Tang (Lily Bulb Decoction to Preserve the Metal) Source: Yi Fang Ji Jie quoted from Dr Zhao Ji An 161 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter heat has been eliminated. The manifestations are thirst, dry mouth and cough with scanty phlegm. In this formula: • Bei Sha Shen and Mai Men Dong as chief herbs can directly nourish the Lung-Yin; Mai Men Dong can also nourish the Stomach-Yin. • Yu Zhu and Tian Hua Fen, as deputies, enhance the chief herbs in their functions of nourishing the Yin of the Lung and Stomach. • The remaining herbs are assistants in the formula: – Sang Ye clears the heat from the Lung, moistens the Lung and descends the Qi so as to relieve dry cough. – Bai Bian Dou can gently tonify the Spleen-Qi that is also injured by the pathogenic heat. – Gan Cao clears heat and benefits the throat. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, there are two aspects to the syndrome – the Yin deficiency and the heat that remains in the aftermath of a febrile disease. Many herbs that nourish the Yin of the Lung and Stomach, but do not have a cloying nature, are used, and only one herb (Sang Ye) is used to expel and clear heat. This clearly shows the emphasis of the formula. • Herbs without a cloying nature are thoughtfully selected to nourish the Yin and disperse heat rather than to drain heat in the aftermath of a febrile disease when the heat is not strong. They follow the treatment principle at this stage. • When all of these herbs are used together, the Yin can be increased in both organs and the heat is reduced in an effective but gentle way.

## 7 Syndrome of Stomach-Yin


Associated disorders in western medicine Diabetes, chronic gastritis, gastric ulcer, hyperchlo- rhydria, aftermath of febrile diseases. Analysis of the syndrome The Stomach is located in the Middle-Jiao and is a Yang Ming organ, a place that is full of heat. As it connects the Yang meridians of the body, it is referred to as the sea of the Yang meridians. The Stomach receives food and drink and ripens them, a process that also produces heat. As a result, the Stomach-Yin is easily injured. • When the Yin is insufficient in the Stomach, dry mouth and thirst may present. • Since the Large Intestine belongs to the Yang Ming organs, the Yin can also be weakened. When the Stomach-Yin is deficient, constipation may occur. • If the Spleen-Qi is weakened by being constantly consumed by the Stomach-fire for a long period of time, poor appetite or reduced appetite occurs. • Hunger is the sign of food being consumed by fire. Although the empty-fire in the Stomach can bring the sign of fire that leads to a feeling of hunger, actually the Qi and Yin are too weak to digest food and therefore one will be averse to eating despite feeling hungry. • The remaining symptoms and signs indicate the condition of general Yin deficiency, which may vary according to the degree of the Stomach- Yin deficiency. Main symptoms Poor appetite or reduced appetite, a tendency to get hungry easily yet with an aversion to food, heartburn, thirst, dry mouth and constipation Secondary symptoms Low-grade fever, warm palms and soles, loss of weight Tongue Red and dry without coating Pulse Thready and rapid 162


Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Nourish the Stomach-Yin Shi Hu (Dendrobii caulis)** Shi Hu is sweet and slightly cold, and enters the Stomach and Kidney meridians. It is able to nourish the Stomach-Yin and Kidney-Yin, generate the body fluids, and reduce the empty-heat from these two organs. As the Kidney-Yin is the root of the Yin of all the organs, Shi Hu is considered an important herb because it can tonify the Yin from pro-heaven and post-heaven sources. This herb treats chronic and difficult cases of Yin deficiency of the Stomach. Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) Mai Men Dong is sweet and slightly cold, and enters the Lung, Heart and Stomach meridians. It can nourish the Stomach-Yin, moisten the intestines and treat thirst, dry mouth and constipation. It is very often used in the anaphase of febrile diseases where the Yin of the Stomach and intestines has been injured by heat. Yu Zhu (polygonati odorati rhizoma) Yu Zhu is sweet and neutral, and enters the Stomach and Lung meridians. It can gently and slowly nourish the Yin and moisten the Stomach. It is more suitable for chronic and mild conditions, or the condition where the patient is too weak to bear the cold and cloying herbs that tonify the Stomach-Yin. Deputy: Nourish the Kidney-Yin Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix) Sheng Di Huang is sweet and cold, and enters the Kidney, Heart and Liver meridians. As it can strongly tonify the Kidney-Yin, which is the root of the Stomach-Yin, it is often used in the condition of Stomach-Yin deficiency. In addition, as it can cool the blood and stop bleeding, it is often selected in bleeding conditions of the stomach and intestines. Zhi Mu (anemarrhenae rhizoma) Zhi Mu is bitter and cold, and enters the Lung, Stomach and Kidney meridians. Although it is bitter and cold, it is moist in nature and has no side effect of injuring the Stomach-Yin. It can directly reduce the excess fire or empty-fire from these organs, nourish the Yin and moisten the dryness. This herb is often used for severe thirst, constipation, night sweats and low-grade fever in conditions where the Stomach-Yin and Kidney-Yin are both deficient. Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix) Dang Shen is sweet and neutral, and enters the Spleen and Lung meridians. It has no function in nourishing the Yin, but it can gently and sufficiently tonify the Spleen-Qi. As it is neutral in temperature, it has no side effect of injuring the Yin when it tonifies the Qi. It is used in the condition where the Yin and Qi are both injured and the Spleen and Stomach cannot bear very cold herbs in the process of tonifying the Yin. Shan Yao (Dioscoreae rhizoma) Shan Yao is sweet and neutral, and enters the Lung, Spleen and Kidney meridians. It can either tonify the Qi or nourish the Yin. Its astringent property enhances its tonifying and stabilizing function. This herb is particularly useful in chronic conditions of Qi and Yin deficiency, such as in Thirst and West syndrome (diabetes) to moisten the internal organs and stabilize the body essence. Assistant: Descend the Stomach-Qi, moisten dryness and clear the heat Tian Hua Fen (trichosanthis radix) Tian Hua Fen is sweet, slightly bitter, sour and slightly cold. It enters the Lung and Stomach merid- Treatment principle: Tonify the Stomach-Yin 163 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter ians. Its sweet, sour and cold properties give it the function of generating the Stomach-Yin and the body fluid and of clearing heat. It is often used in the convalescence of febrile disease to relieve thirst. Pi Pa Ye (eriobotryae folium) Pi Pa Ye is bitter and cool, and enters the Lung and Stomach meridians. Pi Pa Ye can moisten dryness, soothe the Stomach-Qi and relieve nausea and vom- iting caused by the heat in the Stomach. Shi Gao (Gypsum) Shi Gao is sweet, pungent and very cold, and enters the Lung and Stomach meridians. It is an important substance to reduce excess heat in the Stomach and the Lung. Compared with herbs that reduce the heat of the Stomach, this substance is strong, effec- tive and has no side effect of injuring the Yin of the Stomach as it is sweet and cold. In addition, it is often used in small dosage to reduce the excess heat that often coexists in the syndrome of Stomach-Yin deficiency. Envoy: Harmonize the herbs in the formula Yi Tang (Maltose) and Feng Mi (Mel) These substances are sweet and moist in nature, and can moisten the Stomach and tonify the Spleen-Qi. In this way, they can harmonize the herbs in the formula and protect the Stomach and Spleen from cold herbs. Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Food accumulation: add Mai Ya (Hordei fructus germinatus) and Gu Ya (Oryzae fructus germinatus) to aid the digestion. • Belching or nausea: add Shi Di (Kaki diospyri calyx) to descend the Stomach-Qi. • Bleeding gums and loose teeth: add Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata), Zhi Mu (Anemarrhenae rhizoma) and Huai Niu Xi (Achyranthis bidentatae radix) to tonify the Kidney-Yin and reduce the empty-fire of the Stomach.

They nourish the Kidney-Yin and Lung-Yin respectively, and therefore enhance the ability of the chief herb. • Yu Zhu, another deputy, can gently nourish the Stomach-Yin and moisten the dryness. • Bing Tang can harmonize the Middle-Jiao and tonify the Spleen-Qi, thereby serving as both assistant and envoy. Commentary on strategies This formula is nourishing in function but is not very cold. As it can moisten the dryness without any cloying side effect, it can be used in acute and chronic cases of Stomach-Yin deficiency.

Examples of classical formulas Yi Wei Tang (Benefit the Stomach Decoction) Source: Wen Bing Tiao Bian Main symptoms Palpitations, restlessness, chest pain and a stifling sensation in the chest, forgetfulness, insomnia, warm palms and soles, dry throat and tongue, night sweats 164


Associated disorders in western medicine Heart diseases, hypertension, mental disorders. Analysis of the syndrome The Heart is located in the Upper-Jiao. It is a fire organ in the Five-Element system and it houses the shen, governs the blood circulation and is considered as the chief of the other internal organs. • When the Yin is too weak to nourish the Heart, support the blood circulation and settle the mind, palpitations, restlessness, chest pain and a stifling sensation in the chest may present. • If the empty-heat is generated by Yin deficiency, the heat may disturb the Heart-shen and one may have difficulty in falling asleep. • In a severe or chronic case, the empty-heat of the Heart may cause irritability and forgetfulness due to anxiousness. • Yin deficiency can lead directly to night sweats, and warm palms and soles. • A red and dry tongue and a thready and rapid pulse indicate Yin deficiency. Treatment principle: Tonify the Heart-Yin Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Nourish the Heart-Yin Xi Yang Shen (panacis quinquefolii radix) Xi Yang Shen is bitter, cold and slightly sweet, and enters the Heart, Lung and Kidney meridians. It is quite a strong herb to tonify the Yin and Qi of these organs and is able to reduce heat. It is particularly useful in severe and chronic conditions of Heart-Yin and Heart-Qi deficiency. Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix) Sheng Di Huang is sweet and cold, and enters the Kidney, Heart and Liver meridians. It is a quite powerful herb to nourish the Yin of these organs and can sufficiently reduce heat. Sheng Di Huang is also a very important herb to relieve anxiousness, chest pain and palpitations because it can cool the blood. As a result, it is often selected as chief in the formula to nourish the Heart-Yin. Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) Mai Men Dong is sweet and slightly cold, and enters the Lung, Heart and Stomach meridians. It is often selected in the formula to nourish the Heart-Yin and relieve anxiousness. In addition, it is often used in the anaphase of febrile diseases where the Yin of the Heart and Lung has been injured by heat. Deputy: Nourish the Kidney-Yin and Lung-Yin and tonify the Spleen-Qi Bai He (Lilii bulbus) Bai He is sweet, bland and slightly cold, and enters the Lung and Heart meridians. It has a moistening and lubricating property. It can moisten the Lung and Heart directly and is particularly selected for treating anxiety and restlessness. It is also used in conditions where the Lung-Yin and Heart-Yin are both consumed by heat in febrile diseases. Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix) Dang Shen is sweet and neutral, and enters the Spleen and Lung meridians. It has no function in nourishing the Yin, but it can tonify the Qi in order to generate Yin. It is used in conditions where the Yin and Qi are both injured at the same time. It is also used when the Spleen and Stomach cannot Secondary symptoms Irritability and anxiousness Tongue Red and dry Pulse Thready and rapid 165 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter bear very cold herbs in the process of tonifying the Yin. Assistant: Clear the empty-heat and calm the mind Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix) Xuan Shen is bitter, salty and cold, and enters the Kidney meridian. It cannot tonify the Heart-Yin directly, but it can lift the Kidney water from the Lower-Jiao to reduce the Heart-fire in the Upper- Jiao. Thus, it is often selected in formulas to treat conditions where the Heart-Yin is deficient due to intense empty-fire in the Heart. Bai Zi Ren (platycladi semen) Bai Zi Ren is sweet and neutral. It enters the Heart meridian primarily and the Spleen, Kidney and Liver meridians secondly. It can tonify the Heart-Qi, nourish the blood and calm the mind. It is often used in the formula to treat chronic conditions of palpitations, restlessness and anxiousness. At the same time, it can stop night sweats and improve sleep. Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) Wu Wei Zi is sour and warm, and enters the Lung, Heart and Kidney meridians. It can be applied in the condition of Heart-Yin deficiency as it can stabilize the Heart-Yin, stop sweating and stabilize the Heart- Qi so as to relieve palpitations. Envoy: Harmonize the herbs in the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and moist in nature. It can moisten the Heart and tonify the Spleen-Qi so as to benefit generation of the Yin. In addition, the sweet nature of Zhi Gan Cao can harmonize the herbs in the formula and protect the Stomach and Spleen from cold herbs. Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Heart-Yin deficiency with blood deficiency: add Long Yan Rou (Longanae arillus) and Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) to nourish the blood. Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 10 g Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) 15 g Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) 6 g • Yin deficiency with excess heat: add Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) to clear the heat. • Heart-Yin and Lung-Yin are both deficient: use Bei Sha Shen (Glehniae radix), Bai He (Lilii bulbus) and Sheng Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix) to nourish the Yin. • Liver-Qi stagnation with Liver-heat: add Xia Ku Cao (Prunellae spica) and Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) to spread the Liver-Qi, reduce the Liver-heat and soften the Liver. Examples of classical formulas Sheng Mai San (Generate the Pulse Powder) Source: Nei Wai Shang Bian Huo Lun Analysis of the formula and commentary on strategies Sheng Mai San is a formula for treating both Qi and Yin deficiency of the Heart and Lung. It treats the syndrome of Heart-Yin deficiency caused by chronic disease, prolonged intense stress and emotional dis- turbance; it also relieves symptoms such as palpita- tions, restlessness, anxiousness, anxiety, tiredness and sweating. In this formula, all three herbs enter the Heart meridian: • The sweet Ren Shen with cold Mai Men Dong and sour Wu Wei Zi can generate and stabilize the Yin. • Ren Shen can strengthen the Heart-Qi. With the help of Wu Wei Zi, which stabilizes the Heart-Qi, the function of strengthening the Qi becomes very strong. • When these three herbs are used together, the pulse becomes strong and regular as the Yin and Qi are sufficient, just as described in the name of the formula. 166


Analysis of the formula This formula is devised for treating Heart-Yin and Kidney-Yin deficiency with empty-heat in these organs. The disorder is manifested as anxiousness, irritability, palpitations, difficulty in falling asleep, forgetfulness, nocturnal emissions and tiredness. The dryness due to Yin deficiency and fire consump- tion causes constipation, a dry mouth and ulcers on the tongue. The red tongue without coating and the rapid, restless and thready pulse indicate Yin defi- ciency with empty-heat. This formula focuses on tonifying the Heart-Yin and Kidney-Yin and calming the mind: • Sheng Di Huang, as chief, is used in the largest dosage in the formula. It is sweet and very cold, and enters the Heart and Kidney meridians. It can powerfully nourish the Yin of the Heart and Kidney, reduce the heat and cool the blood. • The deputies are Mai Men Dong and Tian Men Dong, which are also sweet and cold. They can strongly tonify the Heart-Yin and Kidney-Yin respectively, and therefore enhance the abilities of Sheng Di Huang. • The assistant herbs can be divided into three groups: – The bitter and cold Dan Shen and Xuan Shen are able to cool the blood and reduce the fire from the Heart and Kidney respectively. – Suan Zao Ren, Bai Zi Ren, Zhu Sha, Fu Ling and Yuan Zhi calm the mind, relieve anxiousness and improve sleep. – Ren Shen tonifies the Qi, Dang Gui tonifies the blood and Wu Wei Zi stabilizes the Heart-Qi. They consider the Qi and blood conditions in the pathological development of the syndrome of Yin deficiency. • Jie Geng, as envoy, guides the herbs entering the Upper-Jiao. Commentary on strategies • This formula is quite strong in tonifying the Yin of the Heart and Kidney. It also treats the other symptoms that are caused directly by Yin deficiency. • Moreover, the conditions of Qi and blood in the syndrome of Yin deficiency are also considered and treated. • The tonifying method and reducing method are combined in one formula and the dosages are well balanced. Thus this formula can be used in both acute and chronic conditions of Yin deficiency of the Heart and Kidney. • Zhu Sha (Cinnabaris) is prescribed in the source book for this formula. It was used to calm the mind and reduce heat in ancient times. As a poisonous heavy metal, its use is now forbidden in many countries. However, it can be used in a very small dosage as a coating for herbal pills, as in this formula.

Analysis of the syndrome The Liver is located in the Lower-Jiao. It belongs to wood in the Five-Element theory. It houses the soul and regulates the Qi movement and the blood circulation. The syndrome of Liver-Yin deficiency is often observed in chronic diseases, people over 50 years old or people with a constitution of Yin deficiency. • When the Liver-Yin is too weak to nourish its orifice and support the head, the Qi movement and the blood circulation, dizziness, headache, blurred vision and a dry and tired sensation of the eyes may present. • If the Liver-Yin is too weak to nourish the tendons, the joints become stiff and the knees are weak. • The Liver-Yin deficiency often follows Liver- blood deficiency. In conditions where Yin and blood are both deficient, they are unable to house the soul, to spread the Qi and to regulate the blood, dream-disturbed sleep, depression, irregular menstruation and tiredness may arise. Liver-Yin deficiency may bring about the following consequences: • First of all, Qi stagnation shows in pain and distension of the hypochondriac regions, chest and abdomen. It also shows in changes of mood and irritability. Secondary symptoms Hypochondriac pain, chest pain, epigastric and abdominal distension, a bitter taste in the mouth, heartburn, tiredness, and irregular or scanty menstruation Some symptoms may exist in stress and emotional situations, such as anger, severe headache, red face, dizziness, vertigo and tingling of the limbs Tongue Red and dry, often with a thin, yellow and dry coating Pulse Thready and wiry; in some cases also rapid • Second, Yin deficiency and Qi stagnation may produce heat, which is manifested as a bitter taste in the mouth, heartburn and a quick temper. • Third, Yin deficiency may trigger a tendency of Yang ascending that causes severe headache, a red face, dizziness, vertigo and tingling of the limbs. If the condition is not treated in time, it may develop into Liver-wind syndrome. • A red and dry tongue with a thin and yellow coating indicates Yin deficiency with heat. A thready, wiry and rapid pulse represents Yin deficiency with stagnation of Qi and heat. Treatment principle: Tonify the Liver-Yin Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Nourish the Liver-Yin E Jiao (asini corii colla) E Jiao is sweet and neutral, and enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. It is able to tonify the Liver-blood and the Kidney-essence. This substance is moisten- ing in nature and can nourish the Yin as well as moisten the dryness. It is particularly suitable for use where the Yin, blood and essence are all deficient, which manifests as dry skin, cracked nails, lusterless hair, scanty menstruation and constipation. Gou Qi Zi (Lycii fructus) Gou Qi Zi is sweet and neutral, and enters the Liver, Kidney and Lung meridians. It is able to tonify the 168


Yin, the essence and the blood. It is particularly selected in the formula to treat eye problems due to Yin and essence deficiency, such as dry and tired eyes, blurred vision and decreased vision. Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) Bai Shao Yao is bitter, sour and slightly cold, and enters the Liver and Spleen meridians. It is able to nourish the Yin and therefore soften the Liver. In addition, it can reduce the empty-heat from the Liver, which is often caused by Yin deficiency. Thus it is considered an effective herb to soften and pacify the Liver, and is used to treat cramping pain due to Yin deficiency that fails to nourish the tendons and muscles. It is also selected in emotional disturbances such as stress, anger, frustration, resentment and irritability. Nu Zhen Zi (Ligustri lucidi fructus) Nu Zhen Zi is sweet, cold and bitter, and enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. The characteristic of this herb is that it can nourish the Yin and reduce the empty-heat without any cloying side effect, which arises in many of the herbs that nourish the Yin. It is particularly suitable for use in the formula for patients who suffer from Yin deficiency when the Stomach is too weak to bear the heavy herbs. It is often used for heavy menstruation in the meno- pause due to empty-heat in the Liver and Kidney meridians and organs. It is also selected in formulas to treat dry eyes, blurred vision and tinnitus. Deputy: Nourish the Kidney-Yin in order to tonify the Liver-Yin Shu Di Huang (rehmanniae radix praeparata) Shu Di Huang is sweet and slightly warm, and enters the Kidney and Liver meridians. It is a strong herb for tonifying the essence and blood, and can there- fore nourish the Yin vigorously. It is often used in conditions of Liver-Yin deficiency where blood defi- ciency arises at the same time. As this herb is rich and cloying in nature and may bring an extra burden to the Stomach, herbs that promote Qi movement in the Middle-Jiao are required. He Shou Wu (polygoni multiflori radix) He Shou Wu works in a similar fashion to Shu Di Huang in enhancing the function of nourishing the Liver-Yin. The strong point of this herb is that it does not have a cloying nature like Shu Di Huang, and thus can be applied to patients who have a weak stomach. Shan Zhu Yu (Corni fructus) Shan Zhu Yu is sweet, sour and warm, and enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. The characteristic of this herb in the aspect of nourishing the Yin is that it is able to tonify as well as stabilize the Yin. It is par- ticularly selected in the formula to treat spontaneous sweating and night sweats, heavy menstruation, dry eyes and cramping pain due to Yin deficiency. Assistant: Open the meridians and collaterals, relax the tendons, reduce the Liver-heat, descend the Liver-Yang and spread the Liver-Qi Ji Xue Teng (Spatholobi caulis et radix) Ji Xue Teng is bitter, sweet and warm, and enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. It can tonify the blood, promote blood circulation and open the col- laterals. It is often selected in the formula to treat numbness of the limbs, and stiff and uneasy sensa- tions of the muscles and tendons. Sang Ji Sheng (taxilli herba) Sang Ji Sheng is bitter, sweet and neutral, and enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. It can nourish the blood, strengthen the tendons and expel the wind- dampness. It is particularly useful for recurrent or chronic muscular disorders, such as chronic stiffness and heaviness of muscles in a condition of Liver-Yin and blood deficiency. Gou Teng (Uncariae ramulus cum uncis) Gou Teng is sweet and slightly cold, and enters the Liver meridian. It can clear the Liver-heat, calm the Liver and is particularly suitable for use in conditions where excess heat injures the Liver-Yin. The main symptoms are fever, convulsions, irritability and restless sleep. Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex) Mu Dan Pi is bitter, pungent and slightly cold, and enters the Heart, Liver and Kidney meridians. It is particularly selected in the formula to cool the blood, reduce the empty-heat, dissolve the congealed blood and invigorate the blood. It is used when there are symptoms such as low-grade fever, warm palms and soles, heavy menstruation due to the heat in the blood, or amenorrhea due to Liver-Yin deficiency with stagnation of the blood. 169 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter Bie Jia (trionycis carapax)** Bie Jia is salty and cold, and enters the Liver merid- ians. It is able to nourish the Yin and reduce empty- heat, and is particularly selected in the formula to treat severe warm palms and soles, bone steaming and night sweats due to severe Yin deficiency with ascending of the Yang and heat of the Liver. As use of this substance is now forbidden, a substitute is recommended. Yu Jin (Curcumae radix) Yu Jin is pungent, bitter and cold, and enters the Liver, Heart and Lung meridians. It can promote the Qi movement and blood circulation. It is suitable for treating tenderness of the breasts, hypochondriac pain and distension, irritability and irregular men- struation in the condition of Liver-Yin deficiency with Liver-Qi and blood stagnation. Xia Ku Cao (prunellae spica) Xia Ku Cao is pungent, bitter and cold, and enters the Liver meridian. This herb is able to spread the Liver-Qi and reduce the heat. It is mainly used to treat disorders of the eyes caused by Liver-heat, such as distending pain of the eyes, red eyes and dizziness; thus it is often used in treating hyperten- sion and glaucoma. This herb is also able to dissipate clumps and nodules, and to treat painful breasts caused by obstruction of Liver-Qi by condensed phlegm, such as in chronic cystic mastopathy. Envoy: Harmonize the herbs in the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and moist in nature. It can moisten the Liver-Yin and soothe the Liver-Qi. In addition, its sweet nature can harmonize the herbs in the formula. Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Liver-Yin deficiency with blood stagnation: use Yu Jin (Curcumae radix) and Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex) to promote blood circulation. • Obvious headache and dizziness: add Ju Hua (Chrysanthemi flos) and Bo He (Menthae herba) to clear the heat in the head and regulate the Qi there. Analysis of the formula Generally speaking, blood, Yin and essence all belong to the Yin because of their substantial form. In a syndrome of Liver-Yin deficiency, Liver-blood deficiency is often the initial stage of Liver-Yin defi- ciency; liquid-Yin deficiency is the second stage, and essence deficiency of the Liver and Kidney is the last stage. Thus, to tonify the Liver-Yin, herbs that tonify the blood and nourish the liquid-Yin and the essence are all selected. In this formula: • Dan Gui, Bai Shao Yao, Chuan Xiong and Shu Di Huang are used as chief. These herbs comprise the principal formula of tonifying the blood, Si Wu Tang (Four-Substance Decoction). They enter the Liver and Kidney meridians, tonify the blood and Kidney-essence, and form the main part of the formula. • Suan Zao Ren is able to nourish the blood, calm the mind and thus improve sleep. Mai Men Dong can nourish the liquid-Yin. Mu Gua can stabilize the Yin and relax the tendons, and is Dang Gui (Angelicae sinensis radix) 9 g Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) 12 g Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma) 9 g Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata) 12 g Suan Zao Ren (Ziziphi spinosae semen) 9 g Mu Gua (Chaenomelis fructus) 9 g Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) 12 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 6 g Dosages are added, as they were not recorded in the source book. • Blurred vision and reduced vision: use Gou Qi Zi (Lycii fructus), Nu Zhen Zi (Ligustri lucidi fructus) and Mi Meng Hua (Buddlejae flos) to improve vision. Examples of classical formulas Bu Gan Tang (Tonify the Liver Decoction) Source: Yi Zong Jin Jian 170


often used to relieve cramp of the muscles. They are used as assistants. • Zhi Gan Cao, as envoy, harmonizes the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies In this formula, there are only a few herbs to nourish the liquid-Yin and the essence directly. • Sour herbs are used to stabilize the Yin, such as Bai Shao Yao, Mu Gua and Suan Zao Ren. • Cold Mai Men Dong and sweet Zhi Gan Cao can generate the Yin. • Herbs that tonify the blood form the main part of this formula, indicating the close relationship between the Yin and blood of the Liver. This also suggests that this formula is particularly suitable to be applied at the initial and second stages of Liver-Yin deficiency, which manifest as dizziness, blurred vision or decreased vision, numbness and tingling of the limbs, and cramp of the muscles. A red, dry tongue and a wiry, thready pulse are often observed in this condition. Zi Shui Qing Gan Yin (Nourishing the Water and Clearing the Liver Decoction) Source: Gao Gu Feng’s formula Analysis of the formula This is a formula devised for treating Liver-Yin defi- ciency with empty-heat and stagnation of the Liver- Qi. The symptoms are dizziness, tinnitus, hot flushes, irritability, palpitations and irregular men- struation. The tongue is red without coating and the pulse is thready, wiry and rapid. These symptoms indicate that the Yin of the Liver is seriously con- sumed, and is no longer able to hold the Yang. Moreover, the Kidney-Yin is also injured at the time of Liver-Yin deficiency. This formula can be considered a variation of the principal formula that tonifies the Yin, Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Six-Ingredient Pill with Rehmannia), which consists of three pairs of tonifying and reduc- ing herbs that nourish the Yin of the Kidney, Liver and Spleen respectively. In Liu Wei Di Huang Wan: • The first pair is Shu Di Huang and Ze Xie. Shu Di Huang tonifies the Kidney-Yin and Ze Xie reduces the turbid dampness from the Kidney to assist the function of Shu Di Huang. • The second pair is Shan Zhu Yu and Mu Dan Pi. Shan Zhu Yu nourishes and stabilizes the Liver-Yin, and Mu Dan Pi may reduce the empty-heat from the Liver, thus assisting the function of Shan Zhu Yu. • The third pair is Shan Yao and Fu Ling. Shan Yao nourishes and stabilizes the Spleen-Yin, and Fu Ling is able to drain out the dampness from the Spleen. The formula accentuates the tonifying functions, and large dosages are applied in the tonifying herbs. The smaller dosages of reducing herbs serve as assistants to reduce the side effects of the tonifying herbs and to treat the secondary symptoms in the syndr ome. This formula is therefore well known due to its thoughtful combinations and its balanced structure. In this formula, variation is made from the above formula: • Shu Di Huang, which is warm and mainly tonifies the essence, is replaced by Sheng Di Huang, which can reduce empty-heat, cool the blood and nourish the Kidney-Yin. Therefore the assistants Ze Xie and Mu Dan Pi are used in low dosage. • Moreover, Dang Gui, Da Zao and Bai Shao Yao are used in the formula to directly tonify the blood. Bai Shao Yao is used in large dosage to enhance the ability of Sheng Di Huang to Sheng Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix) 24 g Shan Zhu Yu (Corni fructus) 12 g Shan Yao (Dioscoreae rhizoma) 18 g Fu Ling (Poria) 12 g Ze Xie (Alismatis rhizoma) 6 g Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex) 9 g Dang Gui (Angelicae sinensis radix) 9 g Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) 30 g Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) 12 g Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) 9 g Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) 4 pieces 171 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter nourish the Yin and reduce the heat of the Liver. • Zhi Zi is used to reduce the excess heat from the Heart and Liver caused by stagnation of the Liver-Qi. • Chai Hu is used to spread the Liver-Qi directly. Commentary on strategies • This variation of Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Six- Ingredient Pill with Rehmannia) indicates that this formula focuses on nourishing the Liver-Yin and Kidney-Yin, reducing heat and spreading the Liver-Qi instead of only nourishing the Kidney-Yin. • When all the herbs are used together, the Kidney-Yin and Liver-Yin are sufficient and are able to control the heat. • In addition, when the Liver has sufficient blood and Yin, the Qi can also move smoothly.

## 10 Syndrome of Kidney-Yin


rhagia, polymenorrhea, infertility and habitual abortion. Analysis of the syndrome The Kidney-Yin is the principal Yin of the body. As it is derived from the pro-heaven-Qi, which deter- mines the constitution and vitality of each individ- ual, the Kidney-Yin determines the conditions, the functions and storage of the Yin of all the other Zang and Fu organs. The Kidney-Yin declines with age, but it may decline quicker than normal in some conditions such as poor constitution, chronic disease, prolonged stress, intensive study and hard work, overconsuming spicy food or taking certain medica- tions. An overactive sexual life and having many pregnancies and labors may also consume the Kidney-Yin. Unlike the Yin of the other organs, Kidney-Yin is divided into two parts: the thick part, the essence, which is called Jing in Chinese; the thin part, the fluid, which is called Yie. • When the Kidney-Yin is not able to support and nourish the brain, which is considered as the sea of the marrow generated by the Kidney- essence, one may suffer from dizziness, tinnitus, poor concentration and forgetfulness. • If the Kidney-Yin is not able to nourish the bones, one may feel weak and ache, particularly in the back, the heels and the knees. • Yin deficiency may directly cause dryness and blood deficiency, constipation may exist and menstruation may become irregular or with little menstrual flow. • Yin deficiency often causes empty-fire. In a severe condition, the fire may ascend and overstimulate the body fluids, essence and blood, resulting in bone steaming, hot flushes, warm palms and soles, insomnia, menorrhagia, polymenorrhea or spermatorrhea. The empty- heat may quickly consume the essence of the body and lead to loss of weight and emaciation. • Since the Kidney and the Liver are both located in the Lower-Jiao, and the Kidney-essence and Liver-blood can change into each other, Yin deficiency of the Kidney is often accompanied by Liver-Yin deficiency, and causes corresponding symptoms. • Kidney-Yin deficiency is often shown in a red tongue without coating and a thready and weak pulse in the third position. Main symptoms Dizziness, tinnitus, dry throat, premature gray hair, poor concentration, forgetfulness, weakness of the back and knees, irregular menstruation or hypomenorrhea Secondary symptoms Aching of knees and heels, warm palms and soles, bone steaming, emaciation, night sweats, constipation, insomnia, menorrhagia, polymenorrhea, spermatorrhea Tongue Red without coating Pulse Thready, or thready and wiry, or thready and rapid, but weak in the third position Associated disorders in western medicine Diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, arthritis, insomnia, hyperthyroidism, menopause syndrome, menor- 172


Kidney-essence and nourish the blood. They treat weakness and stiffness of the back and knees, blurred vision, poor memory, disorders of menstru- ation, infertility, menopause syndrome and sexual disorders caused by deficiency of Kidney-essence and blood. Shu Di Huang is the most important herb for tonifying the blood as well as tonifying the Kidney- essence. Its function is the strongest and quickest among the herbs that tonify the Kidney-essence. Compared with He Shou Wu, Shu Di Huang has a stronger function of tonifying the essence and blood, but as it is more cloying in nature than He Shou Wu, it easily causes distension of the abdomen and reduces appetite. It is often used with Sha Ren (Amomi xanthioidis fructus) to reduce this side effect. He Shou Wu and Gou Qi Zi are weaker in their tonifying actions than Shu Di Huang, but they are not as cloying. They can be used for a longer period of time without bringing any extra burden to the digestion. They are commonly selected in a formula to treat chronic and moderate cases of Yin deficiency. Nu Zhen Zi (Ligustri lucidi fructus), Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix) and Zhi Mu (anemarrhenae rhizoma) Nu Zhen Zi is sweet and cold, and enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. It can nourish the Yin, par- ticularly the fluid part, without any cloying effect. It is suitable for treating dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision, weakness of the back and knees, and prema- ture gray hair due to the Liver-Yin and Kidney-Yin deficiency. Since it is not cloying in nature, has a gentle and steady action, it can be used for a long period of time for chronic diseases. Moreover, it is also suitable in conditions where blood is deficient and there is slight heat in the blood. Sheng Di Huang is sweet and cold, and enters the Heart, Liver and Kidney meridians. It nourishes the Yin, particularly the fluid part of these organs. It can also reduce heat and cool the blood. It is particularly suitable for conditions where the heat has injured the fluid, and not only the Kidney-Yin, but also the Heart-Yin and Liver-Yin are weakened. This mani- fests as restlessness, palpitations, irritability and insomnia. Sheng Di Huang is also frequently used in bleeding conditions, such as in prolonged menstrual periods or heavy menstruation. Zhi Mu is bitter and cold, but is moist in nature. This herb principally enters the Kidney and Lung Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Nourishes the Kidney-Yin Shu Di Huang (rehmanniae radix praeparata), He Shou Wu (polygoni multiflori radix) and Gou Qi Zi (Lycii fructus) These three herbs all enter the Kidney meridian. The first two are sweet and slightly warm in nature and the third is neutral. They are able to tonify the Treatment principle: Nourish the Kidney-Yin and reduce the empty-fire 173 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter meridians and is often used to moisten dryness due to Yin consumption by heat. The symptoms are night sweats, hot flushes, constipation and dry throat and mouth. Deputy: Strengthen the Kidney-Yang in order to generate Yin, strengthen the back and benefit to the bones Tu Si Zi (Cuscutae semen) Tu Si Zi is pungent, sweet and neutral, and enters the Kidney, Liver and Spleen meridians. It is able to tonify the Kidney-Yang and essence, strengthen the back and improve the vision. As it is an effective yet gentle herb, it can be used for a reasonably long period of time. Suo Yang (Cynomorii caulis) Suo Yang is sweet and warm, and enters the Kidney and Liver meridians. It is able to tonify the Kidney- Yang, and nourish the essence and blood. It can moisten the intestines and treat constipation due to Yin and blood deficiency. It is suitable for treating constipation in elderly people or people with chronic diseases. Huai Niu Xi (achyranthis bidentatae radix) and Du Zhong (eucomniae cortex) These two herbs can strengthen the bones and tendons and are often used for weakness of the back and legs due to Kidney deficiency. In clinical prac- tice, they are often used for different types of arthri- tis, infertility, menstrual disorders and habitual miscarriage. Assistant: Reduce empty-heat, descend the Yang and regulate the Qi movement Huang Bai (phellodendri cortex) Huang Bai is bitter and cold, drying and descending in action and direction. It can effectively reduce the empty-fire of the Kidney and treat the related symp- toms. Since it is very bitter and cold, it cannot be used for a long period of time or in a large dosage. Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix) and Han Lian Cao (ecliptae herba) These two herbs, like Huang Bai (Phellodendri cortex), are able to reduce the heat from the Kidney, but unlike Huang Bai, they are moistening in nature and can generate the Yin fluid. Moreover, Xuan Shen and Han Lian Cao can cool the blood as well. They can be selected in the formula when the Kidney-Yin is deficient due to empty-heat, which causes hot flushes and heavy menstruation. Sha Ren (amomi xanthioidis fructus) Sha Ren is pungent and warm, and enters the Spleen and Kidney meridians. It specifically removes the turbid dampness in the Lower- and Middle-Jiao. At the same time, it can promote the Qi movement, reduce distension and improve appetite. It is often used for reducing the cloying nature of tonifying herbs, such as Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata). Fu Ling (poria) Fu Ling is bland and neutral. It cannot promote Qi movement but is able to leach out dampness from the Lower-Jiao. As its action has a down- ward tendency, this herb can be used for reducing the side effects of the cloying nature of tonifying herbs. Moreover, it can slightly tonify the Spleen- Qi and is suitable to treat distension in the abdomen. Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Liver-blood and Yin deficiency: add Dang Gui (Angelicae sinensis radix) and Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora). Since Yin deficiency is often accompanied by blood deficiency, Dang Gui and Bai Shao Yao can be used to tonify the blood in order to tonify the Yin of the Kidney. • Insomnia: add Suan Zao Ren (Ziziphi spinosae semen) and Bai Zi Ren (Platycladi semen) to nourish the Liver and Heart and calm the mind. • Hypochondriac pain and distension caused by Liver-Qi stagnation: add Xiang Fu (Cyperi rhizoma) to spread the Liver-Qi and Chuan Lian Zi (Toosendan fructus) to drain the Liver-Qi and Liver-heat. • Dizziness, tinnitus and insomnia due to Liver- Yang ascending: add Mu Li (Ostrea concha) to descend the Liver-Yang as long as it exists in the syndrome. 174


Analysis of the formula The famous physician Zhang Jing Yue designed this formula. It is used to treat Kidney-Yin deficiency. The formula can be divided into several groups: • Shu Di Huang, as chief, tonifies the essence and blood and directly treats the principal complaints. • Gui Ban and Gou Qi Zi tonify the Yin of the Kidney, play the role of deputy and directly help the chief for the same treatment purpose. • Tu Si Zi and Lu Jiao Jiao form another group of deputies. They can tonify the essence and Yang of the Kidney so as to stimulate the process of Yin growing. • Huai Niu Xi, as assistant, strengthens the bones and tendons, and regulates the blood. • Shan Zhu Yu stabilizes the Yin of the Liver and Shan Yao stabilizes the Yin of the Spleen. They act as assistants to help the chief and deputy herbs to make the formula more effective and more comprehensive in nourishing and stabilizing the Yin. Commentary on strategies The strategy in this formula is shown in the compo- sition to indirectly tonify the Yin. Tu Si Zi and Lu Jiao Jiao are used to tonify the essence and Yang of the Kidney in order to stimulate the process of Yin growing. Nu Zhen Zi (Ligustri lucidi fructus) 9 g Han Lian Cao (Ecliptae herba) 9 g Analysis of the formula This formula consists of only two herbs. It treats Liver-Yin and Kidney-Yin deficiency that manifest as dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision, dream- disturbed sleep, dry mouth and throat, weakness of the back and knees, and premature gray hair. • Nu Zhen Zi is sweet, bitter and cold, and particularly nourishes the Yin fluid of the Kidney and Liver. • Han Lian Cao is sweet, sour and cold, and is able to clear the heat, cool the blood, stop bleeding and nourish the Yin fluid. Commentary on strategies • This formula is particularly suitable in conditions where Yin is deficient with slight heat at the Yin or blood levels. • The strong point of this small formula is that it has no cloying side effect and has a gentle and Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata) 240 g Gui Ban (Testudinis carapax)** 120 g Gou Qi Zi (Lycii fructus) 120 g Tu Si Zi (Cuscutae semen) 120 g Lu Jiao Jiao (Cervi cornu gelatinum)** 120 g Huai Niu Xi (Achyranthis bidentatae radix) 90 g Shan Zhu Yu (Corni fructus) 120 g Shan Yao (Dioscoreae rhizoma) 120 g Examples of classical formulas Zuo Gui Wan (Restore the Left Kidney Pill) Source: Jing Yue Quan Shu In this formula, there is no herb to regulate the Qi and reduce the cloying nature of the tonifying herbs. This shows the philosophy of Zhang Jing Yue in using herbs – clear, intense and focused on the main syndrome. Zhang Jing Yue believed that if a clear diagnosis of Kidney-Yin deficiency is made and if the Yin deficiency is predominant in the whole pathological process, a practitioner should use pow- erfully and sufficiently tonifying herbs in the formula without any hesitation. He explained this as follows: ‘If there is no rain for three years and the land is very dry, one should not be afraid of a heavy rain, and should not dig a ditch to let the water flow away.’ On the other hand, in clinical practice, par- ticularly in conditions of the Spleen deficiency, herbs that regulate the Qi and eliminate dampness should be applied. Er Zhi Wan (Two-Ultimate Pill) Source: Yi Fang Ji Jie 175 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter • Honey is used for harmonizing the herbs in the formula and serves as envoy. • Patients are advised to take the herbal pill with lightly salted water because salt can lead the rest of the ingredients to enter to the Lower- Jiao; for this reason, it is also considered to serve as envoy. Commentary on strategies • Using strong tonifying and strong reducing herbs together are the characteristics of this formula. The effect is just like its name – great tonify Yin pill. • Rice wine, cooked pig marrow, honey and salt are mentioned in the preparation and administration of use. They suggest consideration of a balance in this formula. Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Six-Ingredient Pill with Rehmannia) Source: Xiao Er Yao Zheng Zhi Jue Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata) 180 g Gui Ban (Testudinis carapax)** 180 g Huang Bai (Phellodendri cortex) 120 g Zhi Mu (Anemarrhenae rhizoma) 120 g Rice wine, cooked pig marrow, honey and salt are mentioned in preparation and usage in the source book without dosages. Analysis of the formula This formula is used to treat a syndrome of Kidney- Yin deficiency with empty-fire. The patient suffers from bone steaming, afternoon fever, night sweats, spontaneous emissions, weakness of the back and knees, and irritability. A red tongue without coating and a rapid, forceful pulse in the Kidney positions are often found. In this formula: • Shu Di Huang, as chief, can directly tonify the essence, the Yin of the Kidney. • Gui Ban and pig marrow act as deputies. They are animal products and can tonify the Yin and essence strongly and quickly. They strengthen the function of the chief. • Zhi Mu and Huang Bai also act as deputies. They can directly clear the heat, reduce the empty-fire in the Lower-Jiao and directly relieve bone steaming, afternoon fever and night sweats. • Alcohol is considered as an assistant. It moves quickly, and is used to process Shu Di Huang and pig marrow in order to reduce their cloying nature. It is also used to process Zhi Mu so as to reduce its cold nature, which may injure the Kidney-Yang. Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata) 24 g Shan Zhu Yu (Corni fructus) 12 g Shan Yao (Dioscoreae rhizoma) 12 g Fu Ling (Poria) 9 g Ze Xie (Alismatis rhizoma) 9 g Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex) 9 g Analysis of the formula This formula was devised by Dr Qian Yi. Initially he used it to treat developmental retardation in chil- dren. Subsequently, this formula became widely used for disorders caused by Kidney-Yin deficiency in patients of different age groups. There are six herbs in the formula, which can be divided into two groups: a tonifying group and a reducing group. Alternatively, the six herbs can be divided into three pairs, each of which contains one chief and one assistant, and these three pairs tonify the Yin of the Kidney, Liver and Spleen respectively. steady action, thus it can be used for a long period of time for chronic diseases. • This formula is often added to other formulas in order to gently and effectively tonify the Kidney-Yin and Liver-Yin without side effects. Da Bu Yin Wan (Great Tonify Yin Pill) Source: Dan Xi Xin Fa 176


In the group that plays the role of chief in the formula, three tonifying herbs are used: • Shu Di Huang tonifies the Kidney-Yin. • Shan Zhu Yu tonifies and stabilizes the Liver-Yin. • Shan Yao tonifies and stabilizes the Nutritive essence of the Spleen. In the group that plays the role of assistant in the formula, three reducing herbs are used to correct the side effects of the chief herb: • Ze Xie eliminates the turbid water from the Kidney as Shu Di Huang has a cloying nature that may retain water in the process of tonifying the Yin. • Mu Dan Pi eliminates constrained heat from the Liver because the sour and warm Shan Zhu Yu may generate and keep restrained heat in the Liver in the process of tonifying the Yin. • Fu Ling may remove dampness from the Middle-Jiao as the astringent Shan Yao may retain dampness. Commentary on strategies • This formula nourishes the Yin of the body in a gentle and balanced way. Since the tonifying herbs bring strong and effective actions without side effects, this formula can be used for a long period of time. • The dosage arrangement clearly indicates that the tonifying function is stronger than the reducing function. As well as tonifying the Yin of the Kidney, Liver and Spleen, this formula emphasizes tonifying the Kidney-Yin. • Since this formula nourishes the Yin of the body in a gentle and balanced way, it is often used to improve and maintain health, and to slow down the degeneration process so as to prolong life span.

## Syndrome of Yang deficiency

Yang is the sign of life in the human body. It pos- sesses warmth and promotes all physiological func- tions of internal organs and systems. Although the five internal organs all have Yang, the Kidney-Yang, derived from the pro-heaven Qi, is the root of the Yang in the body; the Spleen-Yang is considered as the key control of digestion and water metabolism in the body; and the Heart-Yang is responsible for Main symptoms Low vitality, cold limbs and a cold sensation of the back, edema, poor concentration, forgetfulness, irregular menstruation and dysmenorrhea Secondary symptoms Infertility, impotence, spermatorrhea, retention of urine, urinary incontinence, low sexual drive, diarrhea Tongue Pale, dull in color with a white coating Pulse Deep, slow and weak Associated disorders in western medicine Heart or kidney failure, arthritis, dementia, chronic diseases of the digestive system, anemia, hypo- tension, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, chronic nephritis, infertility, menopause syndrome, impotence. Analysis of the syndrome The Kidney-Yang, derived from the pro-heaven Qi, is the root of the Yang in the body as it warms the body, stimulates the Qi movement and water metabolism, promotes the process of Qi and blood generation, promotes all the functions of the Zang and Fu organs and determines the vitality of each individual. Although the Kidney-Yang declines with age, it can be injured in conditions of chronic or severe disease, poor constitution and improper care. promoting blood circulation and spreading warmth in the body. In pathological conditions, the Yang of Kidney, Spleen and Heart can be injured more easily than that of the other organs. As they can be weak- ened by excess cold, by acute or chronic damage and by insufficient generation, the syndromes of Yang deficiency of these organs are commonly seen. These syndromes and the composition strategies of the formulas will be discussed in detail in the following sections.

## 11 Syndrome of Kidney-Yang


177 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter


In addition, since the Yin and Yang of the Kidney are derived from one root, severe deficiency of Kidney-Yin may cause Kidney-Yang deficiency as well. • When the Kidney-Yang is weak and is not able to support the other organs, patients may have low vitality, feel sleepy, reluctant to move and tired, and suffer from poor concentration and forgetfulness. Dementia and degeneration may occur earlier than at the average age. • If the Kidney-Yang is not able to spread the warmth in the body and support the bones, patients may have a cold feeling in the limbs, and even feel cold, weakness and aching of the body, particularly of the back. • The Kidney-Yang is an important organ for promoting water metabolism. If the Kidney- Yang is too weak to steam the water, to separate the turbid from the clean, edema and retention of urine may appear. • If the Kidney-Yang fails to warm the Spleen- Yang, diarrhea and cramping of the abdomen may occur. • Irregular menstruation and dysmenorrhea may appear if the Kidney-Yang is too weak to warm the Lower-Jiao, to stimulate the blood and to maintain the proper function of the Chong and Ren meridians. • The Kidney-Yang directly influences sexual activity and fertility. If the Yang is deficient, infertility, impotence, spermatorrhea and low sexual drive may present. • Kidney-Yang deficiency is often shown in a pale and dull color of the tongue with a white, moist coating and a slow, deep and weak pulse, particularly in the third position. (See Figure 5.5 on page 190.) Treatment principle: Tonify the Kidney-Yang and warm the interior 1. protect the Yin: herbs that are too hot and too pungent and can stimulate the Yang should not be used as they may injure the Yin, which is the root of the Yang, and they may scatter the Yang quickly and eventually weaken the process of Yang generation. 2. protect the Spleen: herbs that are too heavy and cloying should be used with caution as they can place an extra burden on the Spleen. Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Tonify the Kidney-Yang Rou Gui (Cinnamomi cassiae cortex) Rou Gui is sweet and hot, and enters the Kidney and Liver meridians. It is able to tonify the Kidney- Yang, strengthen the fire of the vital gate, warm the Lower-Jiao and scatter cold there. It is the first choice for treating Kidney-Yang deficiency with many symptoms such as low vitality, tiredness, depression, cold limbs, diarrhea, edema, a weak and cold back, infertility and sexual disorders. Although it is sweet, it is quite hot, and the tonifying function is weaker than the Yang stimulating function, all of which may lead to the side effects of injury to the Kidney-Yin and scattering of the Kidney-Yang. Thus the dosage of Rou Gui should be low in the normal range. are often used in a small dosage They can promote the function of herbs that tonify the Yang, spread the warmth in the body and accelerate the water metabolism • Herbs that tonify the Kidney-Yin are often selected as the Yin and Yang of the Kidney derive from one origin and they promote each other’s development • Herbs that enter the Kidney, strengthen the bones, expel wind, cold and dampness and benefit the back and legs are also often used • Herbs that regulate Qi and promote water metabolism are used to reduce the cloying nature of the tonifying herbs, to aid digestion and to make the whole formula more active and effective 178


Bu Gu Zhi (psoraleae fructus) Bu Gu Zhi is bitter, pungent and hot, and enters the Kidney and Spleen meridians. It can forcefully strengthen the Kidney-Yang. This herb is able not only to stimulate the Yang, but also to stabilize the Yang because it has an astringent taste. It is particu- larly suitable for use in the situation where a leakage of the essence exists due to Yang deficiency, such as in chronic diarrhea, spermatorrhea, frequent uri- nation and enuresis. Ba Ji Tian (Morindae radix) Ba Ji Tian is pungent, sweet and slightly warm, and enters the Kidney meridian. The strong point of this herb is that it can tonify either the Kidney-essence or the Kidney-Yang. As it is warm yet not dry in nature, it can tonify the Kidney-essence without any cloying side effect. It is suitable for use as a chief herb in the formula to treat infertility and meno- pause syndrome that are caused directly by both Kidney-essence and Kidney-Yang deficiency. In addition, as it can strengthen the bones and tendons and expel the wind and dampness, it is suitable for treating arthritis in elderly people and after the menopause. Deputy: Scatter cold and spread the warmth; tonify the essence in order to tonify the Yang Xiao Hui Xiang (Foeniculi fructus), Fu Zi (aconiti radix lateralis preparata)* and Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma) These three herbs are all pungent and warm. They have no function in tonifying the Kidney-Yang, but they can stimulate the Yang. They are selected in the formula for scattering cold in the Lower-Jiao in order to aid the growing of the Kidney-Yang. Xiao Hui Xiang particularly warms the Kidney, Gan Jiang is able to warm the Spleen and Fu Zi is able to spread the Yang in all the meridians as it is very pungent and hot and its action is very quick and powerful. These herbs can also be selected to relieve pain and cramp of muscles and tendons from cold obstruction and contraction, such as abdominal pain and dysmenorrhea. Shu Di Huang (rehmanniae radix praeparata) and Gou Qi Zi (Lycii fructus) These two herbs are able to tonify the Kidney- essence and blood. Normally they are used in the formula to tonify the Yin, the essence and blood. Since the essence is the material basis of the Kidney- Yang, in a formula that tonifies the Kidney-Yang a large amount of herbs that tonify the Kidney-essence should be used to provide a sufficient supply for Yang development. Assistant: Strengthen the bones, stabilize the Kidney-essence, expel wind, cold and dampness, stimulate and accelerate water metabolism and eliminate dampness, regulate the Qi Du Zhong (eucomniae cortex) and Gou Ji (Cibotii rhizoma)** These two herbs are warm in nature and enter the Kidney meridian directly. They are able to tonify the Kidney-Yang. They have a strong point of strengthening the bones, and are often selected to treat a cold and weak back and limbs. Du Zhong is also able to tonify the Kidney, calm the fetus and prevent habitual miscarriage. Tu Si Zi (Cuscutae semen) and Sha Yuan Zi (astragali complanati semen) These two herbs are able to tonify the Kidney-Yang. Their strong point is that they are quite gentle in temperature and can tonify either the Yang or the essence. As they do not have a cloying nature, they can be used for a long period of time. They are often used in the formula to treat infertility in men. Xian Mao (Curculinginis rhizoma) and Du Huo (angelicae pubescentis radix) These two herbs are warm and pungent, and enter the Kidney meridian. They do not tonify the Yang or stimulate the Yang of the Kidney, but they can expel wind, cold and dampness in the Kidney merid- ian. Therefore they can assist the Yang growing and spreading in the Lower-Jiao. They are particularly useful in formulas that treat chronic Bi syndrome and where the Kidney is weakened with time. In such cases, patients suffer from pain particularly in the lower part of the body, such as arthritis of the back and legs in elderly people and after the menopause. Wu Yao (Linderae radix) Wu Yao is pungent and warm, and enters the Lung, Spleen, Kidney and Bladder meridians. It is able to warm the Kidney, stimulate the Qi and scatter the cold there. It is an important herb for relieving pain 179 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter in the lower abdomen or the lateral sides of the lower abdomen due to Qi stagnation from cold and dampness obstruction. It can be used when the Kidney fails to steam fluid and to separate the clear from the turbid. The common symptoms are fre- quent urination and enuresis. Sha Ren (amomi xanthioidis fructus) and Fu Ling (poria) Since the herbs that tonify the Kidney, and particu- larly tonify the essence, are cloying in nature, herbs such as Sha Ren, which enters the Kidney meridian, should be used to promote the Qi movement in the Middle- and Lower-Jiao. Fu Ling is neutral and bland. On the one hand, it may reduce the Qi stagnation in the Middle-Jiao as it has a descending tendency; on the other hand, it can increase urination and leach out dampness, which is caused by slower water metabolism. Examples of classical formulas You Gui Wan (Restore the Right Kidney Pill) Source: Jing Yue Quan Shu Lu Jiao Jiao (Cervi cornu gelatinum)** 120 g Rou Gui (Cinnamomi cassiae cortex) 60–120 g Fu Zi (Aconiti radix lateralis preparata)* 60–180 g Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata) 240 g Shan Yao (Dioscoreae rhizoma) 120 g Shan Zhu Yu (Corni fructus) 90 g Gou Qi Zi (Lycii fructus) 120 g Tu Si Zi (Cuscutae semen) 120 g Du Zhong (Eucomniae cortex) 120 g Dang Gui (Angelicae sinensis radix) 90 g Analysis of the formula This formula was devised by the ancient physician Zhang Jing Yue. It treats Kidney-Yang deficiency. • Lu Jiao Jiao and Rou Gui are the chief herbs. They can directly tonify the essence and Yang of the Kidney.


Commentary on Zuo Gui Wan (Restore the Left Kidney Pill) and You Gui Wan (Restore the Right Kidney Pill) Zuo Gui Wan (restore the Left Kidney pill) and You Gui Wan (restore the right Kidney pill) represent the brilliant concept of the ancient physician Zhang Jin Yue in the philosophy of tonifying the Kidney-Yin and Yang. • First, no matter whether tonifying the Yin or tonifying the Yang, the most commonly used herbs in the formula are herbs that tonify the Kidney-essence. Because essence has the material form of Yin and has the warm and burning nature of Yang, it is the root of both Yin and Yang. • Second, in the procedure of tonifying Yin, large amounts of herbs to tonify the essence and small amounts of herbs to tonify the Yang are used, so as to promote the Yin growing. • In the procedure of tonifying the Yang, although quite a few herbs to stimulate the Yang are used, there is still a large amount of herbs to tonify the essence. these two formulas are good examples for studying the strategies of tonifying the Kidney-Yin and the Kidney-Yang. • Fu Zi, as one of the deputies, can stimulate the Yang and scatter cold in the Lower-Jiao, thereby stimulating the growth of the Yang. • Shu Di Huang, Shan Zhu Yu, Tu Si Zi, Gou Qi Zi, Dang Gui and Shan Yao also serve as deputies. They tonify the essence and the blood and provide the material basis for Yang development. • Du Zhong is another deputy. It particularly strengthens the back and benefits the bones. Commentary on strategies In this formula, as in the formula Zuo Gui Wan, there is no herb to regulate the Qi and reduce the cloying nature of the tonifying herbs. This is a spe- cific feature of formulas composed by Zhang Jing Yue – to focus on the main syndrome and treat it intensively. In clinical practice, it is better to include some of the herbs that regulate the Qi, particularly in conditions of Spleen deficiency. 180


Analysis of the formula This formula contains eight herbs. It generates the Kidney-Yang in a gentle and steady way. The formula can be divided into two groups. The first group contains all the herbs except Fu Zi and Gui Zhi. This group is used to tonify the Kidney-Yin in order to provide a base of Yang growing. It can be subdivided into two further groups: • In the group of chief herbs, Shu Di Huang tonifies the Kidney-Yin and essence, Shan Zhu Yu tonifies and stabilizes the Liver-Yin and Shan Yao tonifies and stabilizes the Nutritive-essence of the Spleen. • In the group of assistants, three reducing herbs are used to correct the side effects of the chief herbs. Ze Xie eliminates the turbid water from the Kidney as Shu Di Huang has a cloying nature that may retain water in the process of tonifying the Yin. Mu Dan Pi eliminates constrained heat from the Liver because the sour and warm Shan Zhu Yu may generate and keep constrained heat in the Liver in the process of tonifying the Yin. Fu Ling may remove dampness from the Middle-Jiao as the astringent Shan Yao may retain dampness. In the second group, on the base of the Yin- tonifying herbs, a small amount of Fu Zi and Gui Zhi are used to gently stimulate the Yang and promote the Yang and Qi growing in the body.

## 12 Syndrome of Spleen-Yang


Commentary on Shen Qi Wan (Kidney Qi Pill from the Golden Cabinet) and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Six-Ingredient Pill with Rehmannia) Six herbs in Shen Qi Wan and Liu Wei Di huang Wan are the same and are used for the same purpose of tonifying the Kidney-Yin. according to the time line, Shen Qi Wan was composed first. From the inspiration and understanding of the composition of Shen Qi Wan, Dr Qian Yi later removed two Yang- stimulating herbs from Shen Qi Wan and made a new formula, Liu Wei Di huang Wan to tonify the Kidney- Yin in treating developmental retardation in children. however, in the formula for tonifying the Yin, there are herbs to tonify the Yang as well, and this principle can be traced to applying Shu Di huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata) and Shan Zhu Yu (Corni fructus) which have a warm nature. Main symptoms Cramping pain in the epigastria or abdomen, which is often worse after taking cold food and drinks, poor appetite, abdominal distension Secondary symptoms Diarrhea, poor appetite and feeling full easily, cold limbs, heaviness of the body, tired and reluctant to move Shen Qi Wan (Kidney Qi Pill from the Golden Cabinet) Source: Jin Kui Yao Lue Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata) 240 g Shan Zhu Yu (Corni fructus) 120 g Shan Yao (Dioscoreae rhizoma) 120 g Fu Ling (Poria) 90 g Ze Xie (Alismatis rhizoma) 90 g Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex) 90 g Fu Zi (Aconiti radix lateralis preparata)* 30 g Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) 30 g Commentary on strategies • The relationship of Yin and Yang of the Kidney is again considered carefully in the composition. A small dosage of warm herbs is used to prevent the side effects of consuming the Yin and scattering the Yang, but herbs that tonify the Yin and stabilize the essence are used in large dosage. • Unlike You Gui Wan (Restore the Right Kidney Pill), which intensively tonifies the Yang without using any reducing or balancing herbs in the formula, three assistant herbs are used in Shen Qi Wan to reduce the side effects of the chief herbs, allowing this formula to be used for a reasonably long period of time. 181 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter Associated disorders in western medicine Chronic digestive diseases, anemia, edema, nephri- tis, hypotension, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, poor nutrition or consuming a low calorie diet. Analysis of the syndrome Spleen-Yang is very important in promoting diges- tion and water metabolism. It is considered as the key control in the body as the ascending of the Spleen-Qi and descending of the Stomach-Qi directly influence how the Qi, water and food essence move and change in the body. Spleen-Yang warms and stimulates the Qi movement and water metabolism, and promotes the process of Qi and blood generation in the body, which provides a foun- dation for life after birth of each individual. Spleen-Yang can be weakened by improper food, eating habits and medicines, or by chronic diseases. In addition, Kidney-Yang deficiency may directly cause Spleen-Yang deficiency. • When Spleen-Yang is too weak, it may generate internal cold and make the Qi and blood circulation slow down; thus cramping pain in the abdomen and cold limbs may present. • When the Spleen-Yang is weak and is not able to transform and transport food and drink, diarrhea may occur. • If the Yang is too weak to transform water into body fluids, water and dampness may accumulate in the Middle-Jiao and in muscles. Patients may feel tired, heavy of body and reluctant to move. • If the Yang fails to stimulate the Stomach-Qi, patients will lose appetite and develop distension in the stomach and abdomen. • Spleen-Yang deficiency is manifested as a pale and dull color of the tongue with a white, moist coating and a slow, deep and weak pulse, particularly in the second position on the right side.


1. protect the Stomach: herbs that cause irritation of the Stomach should be avoided. In conditions where the herbs are really necessary, they should be taken after meals. 2. protect the Spleen: Cloying and heavy herbs can place an extra burden on the Spleen and should be used with caution. they should be used with herbs that regulate the Qi in the Middle-Jiao or herbs that promote digestion. Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Tonify the Spleen-Yang Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) and Huang Qi (astragali radix) Ren Shen and Huang Qi are two strong herbs that tonify the Qi. Both are sweet and slightly warm, and enter the Spleen and Lung meridians. They may effectively tonify the Qi and gently strengthen the Yang and the Middle-Jiao. They are often selected as chief in formulas. Together with herbs that are pungent and warm, which stimulate the Yang of the Spleen and disperse the cold, they can generate the Tongue Pale, dull in color with a white and moist coating Pulse Deep, slow and weak, especially in the second position on the right side Treatment principle: Tonify the Spleen-Yang and warm the Middle-Jiao 182


Yang of the Spleen and treat the symptoms that are caused by cold and weakness of the Spleen. Moreover, Huang Qi, and especially raw Huang Qi, can ascend the Qi in the Middle-Jiao, strengthen the muscles and treat tiredness. As it enters the Lung meridian, it can strengthen the Lung-Qi so as to accelerate the water metabolism, and therefore can treat water accumulation in the body, such as edema. Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) and Yi Tang (Maltose) Zhi Gan Cao and Yi Tang are able to tonify the Spleen-Qi. Compared with tonifying herbs such as Huang Qi and Ren Shen, their tonifying strength is mild. However, they have special usage in tonifying the Spleen. Zhi Gan Cao and Yi Tang are sweet and neutral in nature, and enter the Spleen meridian. According to the concept that the combination of sweetness, warmth and pungency develops the ability to tonify the Yang, they are often used in combination with pungent-warm herbs in order to tonify the Yang in a gentle and steady way. Moreover, in cases of Spleen-Yang deficiency, they are suitable for selection in chronic disorders where the Yang and Yin, as well as the Qi and blood, are all deficient. With the combination of warm and cold herbs, they can tonify the Yang and Yin effec- tively in a balanced way. Furthermore, they can reduce the side effects of the hot or cold herbs that may injure the Yin, the blood, the Yang and the Qi in the process of tonifying the Spleen. The moderate tonifying action is an important characteristic of these two sweet substances. As sweetness may slow speed, release tension and alle- viate the two or more conflicted aspects in a patho- logical development, Gan Cao and Yi Tang can reduce the cramping pain in the stomach and abdomen and relieve diarrhea and vomiting. Xiao Hui Xiang (Foeniculi fructus) Xiao Hui Xiang is pungent and warm, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. It can warm the Middle-Jiao and expel cold and dampness. It is used to treat abdominal pain, distension, poor appetite, vomiting and diarrhea due to the internal cold. It is an aromatic herb and can disperse cold and promote Qi movement, thereby alleviating pain and improv- ing appetite. In conditions of Spleen-Yang deficiency, this herb is often used with herbs that are sweet and warm, or sweet and neutral, to tonify the Spleen-Qi and strengthen the function of the Yang. Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma) Gan Jiang, the dry ginger, is very pungent and pri- marily enters the Spleen meridian. It disperses cold, dries dampness and treats abdominal pain with a cold sensation and a cramping nature. It can also treat diarrhea and poor appetite due to Yang defi- ciency of the Spleen. Combined with herbs that tonify the Spleen-Qi, it can improve the function of the Spleen-Yang. Deputy: Tonify the Spleen-Qi and dry dampness Bai Zhu (atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) and Cang Zhu (atractylodis rhizoma) Bai Zhu is sweet and warm, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. It can tonify the Spleen-Qi. It is also bitter in taste and can dry dampness in the Middle-Jiao. It can treat poor appetite, fullness in the stomach, distension in the abdomen, diarrhea and heaviness of the limbs due to Qi deficiency with dampness accumulation in the Middle-Jiao. Cang Zhu is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. This herb has no function in tonifying the Spleen, but it can effec- tively dry dampness, thereby relieving diarrhea, heaviness and stiffness of the body. Assistant: Stimulate the water metabolism, eliminate the accumulated water and regulate the Qi in the Middle-Jiao Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) Gui Zhi enters the Heart meridian and is hot and pungent in nature. The young twigs have an aromatic smell that gives this herb a thin-pungent property, which makes it move quickly and lightly. In the condition of Spleen-Yang deficiency, Gui Zhi can be used to stimulate water metabolism and accelerate water transforming into Qi, thereby relieving edema and difficult urination due to Yang deficiency. In addition, it can particularly warm the blood, stimulate the Heart and promote blood circulation, and can treat cold hands and feet, cramp of the muscles and pain due to cold in the blood. 183 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) Sheng Jiang, the fresh ginger, is pungent and slightly warm. It enters the Stomach meridian, is able to disperse damp-cold there and to direct the Stom- ach-Qi downwards. It can be selected in the formula when cold invades the Stomach and disturbs the descending of the Qi. The manifestations are vomit- ing and stomach cramp. In addition, it can stimulate the Yang of the Spleen and Stomach, scatter the cold and water accumulation in the Stomach, and thus promote digestion and improve appetite. For this reason, Sheng Jiang can also be used in the condition of Spleen-Yang deficiency. Fu Ling (poria) Fu Ling is sweet, bland and neutral, and enters the Heart, Spleen, Stomach, Lung and Kidney meridi- ans. It is able to drain out dampness by promoting urination. It can also tonify the Spleen and calm the mind. Because it is sweet and bland, it drains out dampness without the side effect of injuring the Yin and Yang of the body. In the condition of Spleen- Yang deficiency, it is often used as an assistant for treating accumulation of water and dampness in the Middle-Jiao. The manifestations are heaviness of the body, distension of the abdomen and difficult urination. Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) Chen Pi is pungent, bitter and slightly warm. It enters the Stomach and Spleen meridians and is effective in regulating the Qi of these organs. Its aromatic smell can stimulate the Spleen, transform the dampness and soothe the Stomach-Qi. It is often used for distension and pain in the abdomen, reduced appetite, fullness of the stomach, nausea and vomiting. In the condition of Spleen-Yang deficiency, Chen Pi can be used as an assistant to regulate the Qi that is disturbed in the Middle-Jiao and improve the transportation and transformation of food and drinks in the body. Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Food accumulation: add Jiao Mai Ya (deep-fried Hordei fructus germinatus), Jiao Shen Qu (deep-fried Massa medicata fermentata) and Jiao Shan Zha (deep-fried Crataegi fructus) to promote food digestion. • Nausea and vomiting of clear water due to accumulation of cold and fluid in the Stomach: add Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) with Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) to disperse the cold and fluid accumulation. In a severe case, Wu Zhu Yu (Evodiae fructus) may be applied to warm the Stomach and reduce the cold in the Stomach. Examples of classical formulas Li Zhong Wan (Regulate the Middle Pill) Source: Shang Han Lun Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma) 5 g Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 6 g Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 9 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 6 g Analysis of the formula This formula is able to warm the Middle-Jiao, strengthen the Spleen-Yang and treat internal cold due to Spleen-Yang deficiency. • The chief herbs are Gan Jiang and Ren Shen. Gan Jiang can effectively and quickly warm the Middle-Jiao and Ren Shen can strongly tonify the Spleen-Qi. They strengthen each other’s function, spread the Yang and scatter the coldness in the body. • Bai Zhu, as deputy, can tonify the Spleen-Qi and enhance the ability of Ren Shen. In addition, it can dry the dampness that has developed from the Yang deficiency in the Middle-Jiao and enhance the ability of Gan Jiang to spread the Yang. • Zhi Gan Cao serves as assistant as well as envoy. It is able to tonify the Spleen, and harmonize and moderate the actions of the herbs in this formula. Commentary on strategies In this formula, each herb has a specific function and they cooperate in order to construct the Yang of the 184


Middle-Jiao. It is in pill form and is made with honey, which assists Yang generation in the Middle- Jiao in a steady and sufficient way. It is particularly useful in a chronic condition of Spleen-Yang deficiency. Xiao Jian Zhong Tang (Minor Construct the Middle Decoction) Source: Shang Han Lun for smoothing the muscles, and thus it can relieve cramping pain. • When Yi Tang and pungent-sweet-hot Gui Zhi are used together, they can tonify the Spleen- Yang and stimulate its function. As the pungent and hot nature of Gui Zhi is modified by the large amount of Yi Tang, this herb will not injure the Yin and blood. Gui Zhi is considered as one of the deputies. • When Yi Tang and the sour-bitter-cold Bai Shao Yao are used together, they can generate the Yin of the body and therefore treat blood and Yin deficiency. As the cold nature of Bai Shao Yao is minimized by the large amount of Yi Tang, the Yang and Qi will not be injured. Bai Shao Yao is considered as another deputy in the formula. • The pungent and hot Sheng Jiang stimulates the Yang and assists Gui Zhi to warm the Middle- Jiao. It also soothes the Stomach-Qi, disperses cold and water accumulation and improves digestion. • The sweet-warm Da Zao can tonify the blood and Spleen-Qi, and serves as assistant to Bai Shao Yao. It enhances the function of Bai Shao Yao to tonify the blood and Yin. • Zhi Gan Cao serves as assistant as well as envoy. On the one hand, as assistant to the chief, it can tonify the Spleen and ease the muscles; on the other hand, as envoy, it moderates the action of the other herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies This formula demonstrates important strategies so that all the aspects may be tonified in a balanced and sufficient way. These can be found from several distinct characteristics of this formula. • First, the sweet herbs are used to tonify the Spleen directly. • Second, the herbal combinations of sweet and warm, and sweet and cold are applied to generate the Yang and Yin respectively. • Third, the combinations of herbs and ratios of dosages are arranged in a thoughtful way to avoid a dilemma in treatment. This is seen particularly in the use of sweet herbs as the center of balance. In this way, the Yin, Yang, Qi and blood are generated gradually, steadily and sufficiently. Yi Tang (Maltose) 30 g Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) 9 g Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) 9 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 6 g Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) 10 g Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) 4 pieces Analysis of the formula This formula primarily treats Spleen-Qi and Yang deficiency. In fact, it treats a chronic syndrome of deficiency of the Middle-Jiao, where the Yin and blood are also deficient due to long-term Yang and Qi deficiency. The Yang and Qi deficiency are man- ifested as intermittent, spasmodic abdominal pain that responds favorably to local application of warmth and pressure, reduced appetite, and cold and sore extremities. The Qi and blood deficiency are manifested as a lusterless complexion, palpita- tions, a pale tongue and a thready pulse. The Yin deficiency shows in low-grade fever, dry mouth, dry throat and irritability. Since Qi, blood, Yin and Yang are all deficient in the Middle-Jiao in different degrees, they bring a dilemma in treatment: if tonifying the Yang by using pungent and hot herbs, the Yin and blood would be injured; if nourishing the Yin and blood by using cold and sour herbs, the Yang and Qi could be injured too. The formula Xiao Jian Zhong Tang demon- strates important strategies so that all the aspects may be tonified in a balanced and sufficient way. • A large amount of Yi Tang is applied as the chief ingredient. Since it is sweet and neutral and enters the Spleen meridian, it can directly tonify the Spleen without harming the Yin or the Yang. Its nourishing nature makes it perfect 185 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter • When the Yin and blood can nourish the internal organs, the Yang and Qi can accelerate their functions, and all symptoms disappear gradually. This formula is a very good example for treating chronic conditions.

## 13 Syndrome of Heart-Yang


Analysis of the syndrome The Heart is a fire organ. The Heart-Yang is very important in promoting the blood circulation and spreading the warmth in the body. The Heart-Yang can be injured directly by Yang and blood obstruc- tion, such as in chest Bi syndrome or in an accident where there is heavy bleeding. This syndrome also arises in chronic conditions, e.g. chronic Kidney- Yang deficiency and Spleen-Yang deficiency. • When the Heart-Yang is deficient, it fails to spread the warmth in the body, promote the Qi movement in the chest or circulate the blood, and therefore cold extremities, stuffiness in the chest and severe chest pain, cold limbs and a very deep and weak pulse present. Two common syndromes that are referred to as the cold water affects the Heart and the cold water attacks the Lung mainly cause the secondary symp- toms. These may occur if there is Heart-Yang and Kidney-Yang deficiency, or Heart-Yang and Spleen- Yang deficiency. • When the Heart-Yang is too weak in the Upper-Jiao, the cold water may move upward from the Lower- or Middle-Jiao and attack the Heart and the Lung; thus shortness of breath, dizziness, vomiting or coughing out of clear, thin, cold fluid, and edema appear. Treatment principle: Tonify the Heart-Yang, expel the coldness in the chest and promote blood circulation Main symptoms 1 Palpitations, shortness of breath, which is often worse in winter and on exertion, pale complexion, cold extremities, stuffiness in the chest 2 Chest Bi syndrome: Severe chest pain, breathlessness, cold sweats, extremely cold limbs and very deep and weak pulse 3 Heart-Yang collapse: Loss of consciousness, cold sweats, extremely cold limbs and a very deep and weak pulse Secondary symptoms Edema, shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, vomiting or coughing out clear, thin, cold fluid, small amount of urine Tongue Pale, dull color with teeth marks, and a white and moist coating Pulse Deep, weak and irregular, or deep, slow and wiry Associated disorders in western medicine

Deputy: Stimulate the Yang, regulate the Qi and blood in the chest Xie Bai (allii macrostemi bulbus) Xie Bai is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Lung, Stomach and Large Intestine meridians. Since pungent moves upwards and outwards, and bitter moves downwards, this herb has an intense strength of dispersing the cold accumulation in the chest, warming the Yang and stimulating the Yang and Qi. It is an important herb to treat chest Bi syndrome as it can open up the obstruction of cold and allow the Yang, Qi and blood to move freely. Tan Xiang (Santali albi lignum) Tan Xiang is pungent and warm, and enters the Spleen, Stomach and Lung meridians. It can disperse cold, warm the Upper- and Middle-Jiao and regulate the Qi movement. It is particularly effective in reliev- ing pain due to Qi and cold obstruction. It focuses on the diaphragm, relieves the cramp and eases the diaphragm. It can be used as deputy in formulas that treat Heart-Yang deficiency and Qi obstruction with symptoms of chest pain and breathlessness. Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma) Chuan Xiong is pungent and warm, and enters the Liver, Gall Bladder and Pericardium meridians. It has an intense dispersing action, can stimulate the blood and Qi, open up the obstruction and stop pain. It can be used as deputy to stimulate the Heart-Yang and relieve chest pain due to cold and blood obstruction. Assistant: Strengthen the Qi and blood, calm the mind and eliminate the accumulated water Huang Qi (astragali radix) and Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix) Huang Qi and Dang Gui are sweet and warm; the former particularly strengthens the Spleen-Qi and the latter is able to tonify the blood. They can tonify the Heart-Yang indirectly through strengthening the source of Qi and blood of the Heart and strengthen- ing the material base of the Heart-Yang. Long Yan Rou (Longanae arillus) Lou Yan Rou is a sweet fruit. It enters the Heart and Spleen meridians and can gently tonify the Spleen- Qi, the Heart-Qi and the blood. It can calm the mind and treat restlessness, anxiety and insomnia. It is suitable for use in a chronic condition of Heart-Yang deficiency with restlessness and palpitations. Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Tonify the Heart-Yang Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) and Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Gui Zhi is pungent, sweet and warm, and enters the Heart, Lung and Bladder meridians. It can warm and stimulate the Yang and Qi of the Heart, spreads the Yang and Qi, particularly in the chest, and treats chest pain due to Yang deficiency of the Heart. It can promote blood circulation and treat cold limbs and a weak pulse. In addition, as it is able to disperse the accumulation of cold fluid, which is the result of Spleen-Yang or Kidney-Yang deficiency, it is often used in the syndrome of cold water attacking the Heart or the Lung. Since its pungent property is stronger than its sweet taste, its function is more to spread the Yang than to tonify the Yang. Thus, it is often used with Zhi Gan Cao to enhance tonification. Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and neutral. It is consid- ered to enter every regular meridian, but particu- larly the Spleen meridian. According to the concept that the combinations of sweet, warm and pungent properties may tonify and strengthen the Yang, it is often used with pungent and warm herbs to tonify the Heart-Yang. Its sweet taste brings moderating and harmonizing functions. It can relieve chest pain, palpitations, restlessness and shortness of breath. It also relieves depression, anxiousness and anxiety due to deficiency of the Heart.


1. avoid large dosage: herbs that are pungent and hot, can stimulate the Yang and Qi but consume the Qi and scatter the Yang should not be used in large dosage. 2. protect the heart: harsh herbs that place an extra burden on a weak heart should not be used. 3. Caution in bleeding conditions: pungent and hot herbs should not be used alone in a bleeding condition or in a syndrome where Yin deficiency coexists with Yang deficiency. 187 Deficiency syndrome and formula compositionChapter Long Gu (Mastodi fossilium ossis) Long Gu is a mineral substance and is neutral. It can effectively sedate the Heart-spirit and calm the mind. In the condition of Heart-Yang deficiency, it can be used as an assistant in the formula to settle the mind and treat restlessness, palpitations and anxiety due to Yang deficiency. Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) and Fu Ling (poria) Sheng Jiang and Fu Ling can be used in the syn- drome of cold water attacking the Heart and Lung. If patients vomit clear and thin fluid, Sheng Jiang can be applied as it disperses the coldness and water accumulation in the Stomach and can soothe the Stomach-Qi as well. If patients feel dizzy and have a restless sensation in the area above the umbilicus, Fu Ling can be applied to eliminate the dampness from the Middle- and Lower-Jiao and promote urination to prevent cold water attacking the Heart. Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Stagnation of the blood: add Tao Ren (Persicae semen), Hong Hua (Carthami flos) and Su Mu (Sappan lignum) to promote blood circulation. • Heavy sweating: add Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) and Fu Xiao Mai (Tritici fructus germinatus) to stabilize the fluid and add Mu Li (Ostrea concha) to sedate the floating-Yang and reduce sweating. Examples of classical formulas Gui Zhi Gan Cao Long Gu Mu Li Tang (Cinnamon Twig, Licorice, Dragon Bone and Oyster Shell Decoction) Source: Shang Han Lun Analysis of the formula This formula was devised by Dr Zhang Zhong Jing. It treats Heart-Yang deficiency and cold in the Upper-Jiao. The manifestations are palpitations, restlessness, anxiety, shortness of breath, cold limbs, a pale complexion, a pale tongue and a weak, restless pulse. In the formula: • Gui Zhi and Gan Cao can directly tonify the Heart-Yang. Gui Zhi is also able to spread the Yang and promote the blood circulation. As they treat the cause of the disorder directly, both are considered as chief herbs in the formula. • Long Gu and Mu Li are mineral substances. They are heavy in nature and in their actions. They are able to descend the Qi and Yang, calm the mind, settle the Heart-shen and treat symptoms such as restlessness, anxiety, palpitations and shortness of breath directly. They are considered as assistants. Commentary on strategies This is a small formula but each of the substances has its specific function and has a strong action in the formula. They show the style of composition of formulas of Dr Zhang Zhong Jing as well as the experience of using herbs in his time.

Patients can gradually lose consciousness, have cold sweats, extremely cold limbs and a very deep and weak pulse. In this formula, two strong herbs are chosen. 188


• Ren Shen can powerfully tonify the Source-Qi and stabilize the condition of the patient following Yang collapse. • Fu Zi, a pungent and very hot herb, can strongly expel cold, stimulate and spread the Yang. These two herbs enhance each other’s actions and focus on intensively tonifying and reviving the Yang. In this way, they can rescue patients from Yang collapse. Commentary on strategies This small formula shows the basic rules of treating Yang collapse. • Although the sign of internal cold is obvious and to a severe degree, the warm and pungent herbs that stimulate the Yang should not be used in the first instance as they may scatter the Yang, which is already at a minimum. • Ren Shen should be used first as it can strongly tonify and stabilize the Qi so as to hold the Yang. • Since Fu Zi may scatter the Yang and may overstimulate the weak heart, the dosage of Ren Shen should be always larger than that of Fu Zi. This formula is more for study than for clinical use. It should be used with caution and is better used with modification in clinical practice. Ling Gui Zhu Gan Tang (Poria, Cinnamon Twig, Atractylodes Macrocephalae and Licorice Decoction) Source: Jin Kui Yao Lue Analysis of the formula This formula treats a syndrome that is referred to as cold water attacking the Heart and Lung. In this syndrome, the cold water is generated by Spleen- Yang deficiency, and the water is pushed upwards by the Stomach-Qi, which failed to move down- wards, and disturbs the proper movement of the Qi in the Upper-Jiao. Patients may suffer from fullness in the chest and hypochondria, palpitations, short- ness of breath, coughing up clear and watery phlegm, dizziness and vertigo. The tongue is flabby and pale with a white moist coating. The pulse is slippery and wiry. In the formula: • Fu Ling, as chief, can directly drain the water, dissolve dampness and fluid, and tonify the Spleen. • Gui Zhi, as deputy, can stimulate the Yang, warm the water and accelerate the process where the water evaporates into Qi, thus directly stimulating the process of dissolving the fluid and draining the water. • Bai Zhu is another deputy. It can tonify the Spleen and dry the dampness, thereby reducing the formation of fluid. • Zhi Gan Cao serves as assistant. It is used to protect the Yin as the herbs that drain the water may injure the Yin. It can also tonify the Spleen-Qi. Commentary on strategies Although this is a small formula, it shows different methods of eliminating the fluid in the condition of Spleen-Yang and Qi deficiency. • Fu Ling is used to drain the accumulated water by promoting urination. • Gui Zhi is used to warm and stimulate the Yang so as to accelerate water metabolism. • Bai Zhu is used to tonify the Spleen and dry the dampness. • The formula focuses on dissolving accumulated fluid, but the side effects of the warm and drying herbs are also considered; thus sweet Zhi Gan Cao is used to protect the Yin and tonify the Spleen-Qi.

## discharge

• When the Defensive-Qi is weak, patients sweat profusely. • When Heart-Qi is weak, patients may have palpitations, anxiety and restlessness. • When Kidney-Qi and Kidney-Yang are weak, premature ejaculation, spermatorrhea, incontinence, enuresis and diarrhea may be present. • The deficiency of Spleen-Qi may cause diarrhea, bleeding, a large amount of leukorrhea, and prolapse of uterus, rectum or other internal organs. • A pale tongue with a white coating and a rapid pulse indicate Qi deficiency. (See Figure 6.1 on page 200.) Treatment principle: Stabilize the essence, fluids, blood and Qi; tonify and regulate the Qi Main symptoms Excessive sweating, severe cough, shortness of breath, asthma, palpitations, uterine bleeding, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, large amount of leukorrhea, incontinence of urine, enuresis, diarrhea, prolapse of rectum and uterus Tongue Pale or dull-pale, with a white coating Pulse Rapid, restless or deep and weak Associated disorders in western medicine Asthma, pulmonary emphysema, chronic bronchitis, hyperventilation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, insomnia, colitis, chronic enteritis, dysentery, food allergy, premature ejaculation, spermatorrhea, urinary incontinence and enuresis. Analysis of the syndrome The essence, fluids, blood and Qi are the basic substances of the body. They support the physio- logical functions of the internal organs and should be protected from abnormal leakage and con- sumption. The direct cause of abnormal discharge of the essential substances is Qi deficiency. • When the Qi of the internal organs is very weak, and is not able to keep the essence and fluids in the body and the organs in their proper places, abnormal discharge or so-called leakage occurs. Elderly people and people with chronic diseases or with a very weak constitution are more likely to have this disorder. • When Lung-Qi and Kidney-Qi are weak, breathing becomes shallow and quick, and patients may also suffer from cough and wheezing. 193 Syndrome of abnormal discharge and formula compositionCHapter Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Directly stop abnormal discharge Most of the herbs that stabilize the essence, body fluids, blood and Qi are sour or astringent. Herbs with a sour taste have a contracting ability and inward-moving tendency; herbs with astringent properties are able to prevent or reverse abnormal discharge of essence, body fluids and Qi. When herbs are calcined, they develop an astringent pro- perty. This procedure is particularly useful in acute conditions. Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus), Wu Mei (Mume fructus), He Zi (Chebulae fructus) and Bai Guo (Ginkgo semen) These herbs are particularly able to stabilize the Lung-Qi. They are used to relieve thirst, shortness of breath and chronic cough. They are used in con- ditions of sudden or severe Qi scattering and fluid consumption of the Lung. Ma Huang Gen (ephedrae radix)* and Nuo Dao Gen Xu (Oryzae glutinosae radix et rhizoma) These herbs specialize in stabilizing the exterior and can effectively stop sweating. Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus), Fu Xiao Mai (tritici fructus germinatus), Mu Li (Ostrea concha) and Long Gu (Mastodi fossilium ossis) These substances are particularly effective in stabi- lizing the Heart-Qi. They are used to treat palpita- tions, restlessness, spontaneous sweating, night sweats and insomnia. Of these herbs, Mu Li is par- ticularly effective for treating night sweats; Fu Xiao Mai and Long Gu can treat both night sweats and spontaneous sweating. Shan Zhu Yu (Corni fructus), Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus), Wu Zei Gu (Sepiae seu sepiellae os), Qian Shi (euryalis semen), Fu Pen Zi (rubi fructus), Lian Zi (Nelumbinis semen) and Lian Xu (Nelumbinis stamen) These are the substances that particularly stabilize the Kidney-essence. They are used in the treatment of frequent night urination, enuresis, spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation in conditions of Kidney- Yang or Kidney-Qi deficiency.


the formulas that can stabilize and bind the body essence, fluids, blood and Qi are similar to the formulas that tonify in some aspects. they both treat deficiency syndrome without exterior pathogenic factors and they both use strengthening methods. However, their foci are different. Formulas in this chapter focus on stabilizing the material substances and Qi in the body, just like closing all the doors of a house. they treat only the manifestations of a deficiency syndrome and are used in acute conditions. the formulas that tonify focus on tonifying the shortage of the essential substances of the body, treat the cause of a deficiency syndrome and are used in chronic conditions. In clinical practice these two methods can be used together and may be used for a longer period of time.


1. Make sure there are no excess pathogenic factors in the body: the formulas that stabilize and bind are only used in deficiency conditions. there should be no exterior pathogenic factors or phlegm, dampness or blood stagnation in the body. Otherwise, they may retain the pathogenic factors in the body. 2. Make a correct differentiation: there are many factors that can cause abnormal discharge of the body fluids and essence besides Qi deficiency. For example, diarrhea can be caused by damp- heat in the intestines; excessive urination or spermatorrhea can be the result of damp-heat in the Lower-Jiao; shortness of breath can be the consequence of phlegm accumulation; excessive sweating is often caused by excess heat or empty-heat in the body. thus a correct differentiation of the syndrome is required. 3. Use only in acute and severe conditions for a reasonably short time: the formulas that stabilize abnormal discharge of the essential substances focus on treating the manifestations. as they do not have sufficient function to treat the cause of the disorder, they are only used for a short period of time. When the abnormal discharge stops, formulas that tonify should be used in the first instance, or tonifying herbs should be added to the original formulas. 194


Wu Mei (Mume fructus), Wu Bei Zi (Chinensis galla), Ying Su Ke (papaveris somniferi pericarpium), Qian Shi (euryalis semen), Rou Dou Kou (Myristicae semen), He Zi (Chebulae fructus), Chi Shi Zhi (Halloysitum rubrum), Lian Zi (Nelumbinis semen), Fu Long Gan (terra flava usta) and Jin Ying Zi (rosae laevigatae fructus) These herbs bind up the intestines and are used to treat chronic diarrhea or heavy diarrhea due to defi- ciency of Spleen-Qi, Spleen-Yang, Kidney-Qi and Kidney-Yang. Qian Shi (euryalis semen), Jin Ying Zi (rosae laevigatae fructus), Sang Piao Xiao (Mantidis oötheca), Shan Zhu Yu (Corni fructus) and Yi Zhi Ren (alpiniae oxyphyllae fructus) These substances are particularly effective in stabi- lizing the Bladder and are used to stop frequent urination, a large amount of urine, incontinence of urine and enuresis in the syndrome of Kidney-Qi deficiency. Duan Mu Li (calcinated Ostrea concha) and Duan Long Gu (calcinated Mastodi fossilium ossis) After being calcined, these minerals develop an astringent nature. They can stabilize the essential substances of the body and prevent leakage. Deputy: Tonify Qi, Yin and Yang of the related organs Ren Shen (Ginseng radix), Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix), Bei Sha Shen (Glehniae radix) and Sheng Huang Qi (raw astragali radix) These herbs are often used to tonify the Qi and nourish the Yin of the Lung when shortness of breath and cough are caused by Lung-Qi deficiency. Ren Shen can strongly tonify the Lung-Qi and Kidney-Qi and therefore smooth the breath. Mai Men Dong and Bei Sha Shen can nourish the fluid and Yin of the Lung, and relieve dry cough, thirst and chest pain. Their function of generating Yin can be increased by Ren Shen. If spontaneous sweating is present and is obvi- ously caused by deficiency of Spleen-Qi and Defen- sive-Qi, Sheng Huang Qi can be selected in the formula to strengthen and ascend the Qi, stabilize the exterior and stop the sweating. Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata), Suan Zao Ren (Ziziphi spinosae semen), Fu Shen (poriae cocos pararadicis) and Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) In a syndrome of Heart-Qi deficiency, astringent herbs should be prescribed with herbs that tonify the Qi and Yin of the Heart and calm the mind. Zhi Gan Cao and Fu Shen can tonify the Heart-Qi and calm the mind. Suan Zao Ren can nourish the blood, stabilize the Yin, improve sleep and therefore calm the mind. Mai Men Dong can nourish the Heart-Yin and the sweet Zhi Gan Cao and sour Suan Zao Ren can enhance its function. Huang Qi (astragali radix), Bai Zhu (atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma), Fu Ling (poria) and Bai Bian Dou (Dolichoris lablab semen) These herbs can be used in the formula to treat diarrhea and prolapse of internal organs due to Spleen-Qi deficiency. Huang Qi has the function of tonifying and lifting the Qi, and is a perfect herb to be used in the treat- ment of diarrhea and prolapse of the rectum caused by deficiency and sinking of Spleen-Qi. It can also improve the condition of the muscles and treat tiredness. Bai Zhu and Fu Ling are able to tonify the Spleen- Qi and dry dampness. They are particularly selected in the formula when dampness accumulates in the Middle-Jiao caused by Spleen-Qi deficiency. Bai Bian Dou is bland and neutral. It can gently tonify the Spleen-Qi and is used in mild and chronic conditions of Spleen-Qi deficiency. It is also an astringent herb, and can stabilize the Qi and Yin in the Middle-Jiao. It is often selected to treat chronic diarrhea when the Qi and Yin are both weakened in the Middle-Jiao. Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma), Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus), Sha Yuan Zi (astragali complanati semen), Tu Si Zi (Cuscutae semen) and Rou Gui (Cinnamomi cassiae cortex) These herbs can be added to formulas when the abnormal discharge is caused by Yang deficiency. Gan Jiang is used particularly to warm the Spleen and treats diarrhea due to Spleen-Yang deficiency, 195 Syndrome of abnormal discharge and formula compositionCHapter which is manifested as thin, watery feces without smell, worsening after taking cold food and drinks, no abdominal pain but with a cold sensation in the abdomen. Gui Zhi enters the Heart, Bladder and Lung meridians, can warm the Yang and accelerates the steaming process of water changing into Qi. It can therefore reduce frequent urination, wheezing and cough with a large amount of cold-phlegm. Sha Yuan Zi, Tu Si Zi and Rou Gui particularly warm the Kidney-Yang. They can be selected in conditions of frequent urination in the night, enu- resis, impotence, spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation due to Kidney-Yang deficiency. Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix), E Jiao (asini corii colla) and Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) These three substances are able to nourish blood and moisten dryness. E Jiao can directly stop bleeding. Bai Shao Yao can stabilize the blood due to its sour and cold properties. These substances are often used in the formula to treat bleeding due to blood deficiency. Assistant: Regulate the Qi Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix), Xiang Fu (Cyperi rhizoma), Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) and Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) If there is Liver-Qi stagnation in the syndrome, this is often revealed by tension in the symptoms, such as severe palpitations, shortness of breath, abdomi- nal cramp, urgent and frequent urination and diarrhea. Chai Hu can disperse and spread the suppressed Liver-Qi. Xiang Fu can regulate the Liver-Qi and smooth the movement. The sour Bai Shao Yao and sweet Zhi Gan Cao can soften the Liver, ease the tendons and reduce the tension. They are often used in herbal formulas. Qian Hu (peucedani radix) and Pi Pa Ye (eriobotryae folium) These herbs can descend the Lung-Qi and transform phlegm. They can be used as assistants in the condi- tion where the Lung-Qi fails to disperse or descend and causes accumulation of phlegm in the Lung. They can also reduce the possibility that astringent herbs will obstruct the Lung-Qi and hold back phlegm. Mu Xiang (aucklandiae radix)**, Sha Ren (amomi xanthioidis fructus) and Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix) These herbs are able to regulate the Qi and elimi- nate dampness of the Spleen and Large Intestine. They are mainly used in the condition of diarrhea with distension of the abdomen that is caused by Qi and dampness accumulation. Sang Piao Xiao (Mantidis oötheca) and Yi Zhi Ren (alpiniae oxyphyllae fructus) These substances are able to tonify the Kidney- Yang, separate the clear fluid from turbid water and treat frequent urination and enuresis. Envoy: Harmonize the herbs in the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet in nature and enters all merid- ians. It can harmonize the herbs in the formula, smooth their functions and moderate their tem- peratures and tastes. Moreover, it can also reduce the intensity of the progress of the disorder. Examples of classical formulas Yu Ping Feng San (Jade Windscreen Powder) Source: Da Xi Xin Fa Huang Qi (Astragali radix) 30 g Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 60 g Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix) 30 g Analysis of the formula This formula strengthens the Qi, stabilizes the exter ior and stops sweating. It is used to treat weak- ness of the Defensive-Qi, which is unable to control the opening and closing of pores and causes sponta- neous sweating, aversion to wind and easily catching a cold. Patients may often have a blocked nose, a pale complexion, a pale tongue with a white coating and a superficial but weak and soft pulse. 196


In this formula: • Huang Qi is used as chief. It is sweet and warm, and enters the Lung and Spleen meridians. As it can strongly tonify the Spleen-Qi and Lung-Qi, it can strengthen the Defensive-Qi and stop sweating. It treats both the cause and the manifestations of the syndrome. • Bai Zhu is used as deputy. It is bitter and warm, and enters the Spleen meridian. It can tonify the Spleen-Qi, promote digestion and enhance the ability of Huang Qi. • Fang Feng is used as assistant. It is pungent and neutral, and enters the Spleen and Lung meridians. It enters the superficial and subcutaneous regions and can expel wind. Commentary on strategies This formula treats both the cause and the manifes- tations of the syndrome. • The application of Fang Feng as the assistant of Huang Qi is very sensible. One is dispersing, the other is tonifying. With the help of Fang Feng, Huang Qi will not keep the wind in the body. • Although it is a small formula, it is balanced in composition. It is very effective and often used in clinical practice to prevent catching cold in the winter. Jiu Xian San (Nine-Immortal Powder) Source: Yi Xue Zheng Zhuan Qi and Yin of the Lung. Patients sweat easily and often have a weak and rapid pulse. In this formula: • Ying Su Ke and Ren Shen are used as chief. The former stabilizes the Lung-Qi directly; the latter can tonify the Qi of the Lung and Kidney, and therefore stabilizes the Lung-Qi. They are used together to treat both the cause and the manifestations of the syndrome. • The deputies in this formula are E Jiao, Wu Wei Zi and Wu Mei. E Jiao can nourish the Yin and moisten the Lung; Wu Wei Zi and Wu Mei can stabilize the Lung-Qi and stop cough. • The remaining herbs in the formula are assistants. Kuan Dong Hua and Chuan Bei Mu eliminate the phlegm and stop cough. Sang Bai Pi descends the Lung-Qi and Jie Geng ascends the Lung-Qi. They regulate the Lung-Qi and relieve cough. When all these herbs are used together, the Lung-Qi is stabilized and strengthened, and the cough stops. Commentary on strategies This formula represents the methods of treating chronic cough. • Herbs that tonify the Qi and herbs that stabilize the Qi are used together. • At the same time, herbs that regulate the Lung-Qi and eliminate phlegm are used following the pathological change in the Lung.

It is used to treat weakness of the Yang of Spleen and Kidney. The water accumulates in the intestines and causes diarrhea. The diarrhea usually occurs before sunrise every day. This can be explained by the Yang of nature enhancing the Yang of the body, and the Yang is strong enough to eliminate the damp-cold in the intestines. Patients often have a poor appetite, weak legs, knees and back, a pale tongue with a white coating, and a deep and weak pulse. In this formula: • Bu Gu Zhi is used as chief. It is very warm, bitter and pungent, and enters the Kidney meridian, especially the vital gate. It can strengthen and warm the Yang and indirectly warm the Spleen. • Wu Zhu Yu and Rou Dou Kou, as deputies, are pungent and warm, and enter the Spleen meridian. They can warm the Spleen and expel cold there. Rou Dou Kou can eliminate dampness and directly stop diarrhea. • The assistants are Wu Wei Zi, Sheng Jiang and Da Zao. Wu Wei Zi can stabilize the food essence and stop diarrhea; Sheng Jiang and Da Zao are used for strengthening the function of the Spleen. When all the herbs are used together, the Middle- and Lower-Jiao are warmed and strengthened, and diarrhea stops. Commentary on strategies This is a small formula, but it is strong and effective in function. It treats the cause and manifestations together, and treats the Middle- and Lower-Jiao together. It is an appropriate formula for studying the strategies of composition and treatment methods. Jin Suo Gu Jing Wan (Metal Lock Pill to Stabilize the Essence) Source: Yi Fang Ji Jie Sha Yuan Zi (Astragali complanati semen) 60 g Qian Shi (Euryalis semen) 60 g Lian Xu (Nelumbinis stamen) 60 g Duan Long Gu (calcined Mastodi fossilium ossis) 30 g Duan Mu Li (calcined Ostrea concha) 30 g Lian Zi (Nelumbinis semen) 120 g Analysis of the formula This formula stabilizes the Kidney and binds up the semen. It is used to treat deficiency of the Kidney, which is unable to control the semen. Patients suffer from abnormal spermatorrhea and long-term impo- tence, and often feel tired, have tinnitus, a weak and sore lower back and legs, a pale tongue with a white coating, and a weak and thready pulse. In this formula: • Sha Yuan Zi, as chief, is sweet, warm and moist in nature, and enters the Spleen and Liver meridians. It can tonify the essence, strengthen the Kidney-Yang and treat the cause of the syndrome. • Lian Zi and Qian Shi are astringent and are used as deputies to stabilize the semen directly and treat the manifestations of the syndrome. • Duan Long Gu and Duan Mu Li are astringent after being calcined and are used as assistants to stabilize the semen and enhance the ability of the deputies. • Lian Xu is another assistant. It is sweet, neutral and astringent, and enters the Kidney and Bladder meridians. Lian Xu is the first choice for stabilizing the semen and treating spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation. Commentary on strategies • This formula is based on a large amount of astringent substances. In particular, when Long Gu and Mu Li are calcined by fire, they develop an astringent property and are used for 198


stabilizing and binding the essential substances in the body. • In clinical practice, to treat a chronic condition, tonifying herbs should be added to this formula. Gu Chong Tang (Stabilize Chong Meridian Decoction) Source: Yi Xue Zhong Zhong Can Xi Lu very large dosage, and can powerfully and effectively stabilize the blood and stop bleeding. • Duan Long Gu and Duan Mu Li serve as assistants. They are astringent substances and can stabilize the blood directly and stop bleeding. Wu Zhi Gu, Wu Bei Zi and Zong Lü Tan are also astringent. As assistants, they enhance the ability of the other herbs in the formula to stop bleeding. • Since there are a number of astringent substances that may cause stagnation, Qian Cao Gen is used as corrective assistant. It can stop bleeding yet promote blood circulation. At the same time, it can also remove congealed blood. Commentary on strategies • This is a formula that treats both the cause and the manifestations of bleeding syndrome due to Spleen-Qi deficiency. • The use of Qian Cao Gen shows how to prevent and treat blood stagnation caused by astringent substances. Shi Hui San (Ten Partially-Charred Substances Powder) Source: Shi Yao Shen Shu Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 30 g Huang Qi (Astragali radix) 18 g Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) 12 g Shan Zhu Yu (Corni fructus) 24 g Duan Long Gu (calcined Mastodi fossilium ossis) 24 g Duan Mu Li (calcined Ostrea concha) 24 g Wu Zei Gu (Sepiae seu sepiellae os) 12 g Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) 1 5 g Zong Lü Tan (charred Stipulae trachycarpi fibra) 6 g Qian Cao Gen (Rubiae radix) 9 g Analysis of the formula This formula is able to strengthen the Middle-Jiao and stop uterine hemorrhage due to Spleen-Qi defi- ciency. In this syndrome, the Spleen is unable to keep the blood moving in its normal pathway, and bleeding starts. Afterwards, the blood and Yin of the Liver are weakened. Patients suffer from heavy menstrual bleeding, the blood is thin and the color is light. The accompanying symptoms are palpita- tions, shortness of breath, a pale tongue, and a thready and weak pulse. In this formula: • Bai Zhu and Huang Qi are used in large dosages as chief herbs. They strongly tonify the Spleen-Qi so as to control the blood. Huang Qi can also ascend and hold the Qi, and stop bleeding. They are used to treat the cause of bleeding. • Bai Shao Yao and Shan Zhu Yu, as deputies, treat the cause as well as the manifestations of the syndrome. They are sour in taste and enter the Liver meridian. They can tonify the blood and Yin of the Liver. Shan Zhu Yu is used in a Da Jì (Cirsii japonici herba seu radix) Xiao Ji (Cirsii herba) He Ye (Nelumbinis folium) Ce Bai Ye (Platycladi cacumen) Bai Mao Gen (Imperatae rhizoma) Qian Cao Gen (Rubiae radix) Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) Da Huang (Rhei rhizoma) Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex) Zong Lü Pi (Petiolus trachycarpi) Herbs in the formula are without dosage as this is not recorded in the source book They should be applied in even dosage Analysis of the formula This formula is used to cool the blood and stop bleeding. It is used for acute bleeding in any part of 199 Syndrome of abnormal discharge and formula compositionCHapter the body. The cause is internal heat, which injures the blood vessels and pushes blood moving upwards and leaving its normal pathway. In this formula: • The chief herbs are Da Jì, Xiao Ji, Ce Bai Ye, Qian Cao Gen and Bai Mao Gen. These herbs are able to cool the blood and stop bleeding. • The deputies are Zong Lü Pi, Zhi Zi and Da Huang. Zong Lü Pi is astringent and is able to stabilize the blood and help the chief herbs to stop bleeding. Zhi Zi and Da Huang clear the heat and thus can reduce the intensity of bleeding. • Mu Dan Pi, on one hand, serves as helping assistant, together with Da Huang, to cool the blood and dissolve congealed blood; on the other hand, it serves as corrective assistant to disperse the congealed blood and regulate blood circulation, so as to prevent blood stagnation caused by all the cooling herbs. • He Ye, like Mu Dan Pi, serves as both helping and corrective assistant. The partially charred He Ye, like other herbs, can stop bleeding. However, its light fragrant smell can also disperse the Qi and blood stagnation caused by the astringent herbs and the cold herbs. Commentary on strategies This formula treats the manifestations rather than the cause of the syndrome. Some special treatment of the herbs and administration should be men- tioned. These particular procedures are devised to meet treatment need. • First, all the herbs in the formula are partially charred. Through this process, the herbs gain astringent properties that can enhance the strength of stopping bleeding. • Second, the partially charred herbs are ground to a fine powder, sealed in an earthenware container and buried in the earth for a night. This procedure reduces any fire nature that the herbs may have developed from the charring process, which is inappropriate for bleeding conditions. • Third, before ingestion, the herbal powders are mixed with sweet radish juice and Chinese ink, which is made from charred cypress and pine with cooked sticky rice. This enhances their ability to stop bleeding. • Since acute bleeding is unexpected, the formula is prepared and kept for emergency use. Chinese ink and radish are usually available in the home and the prepared formula should be used promptly. These procedures suggest wider possibilities in the treatment of unexpected bleeding: people may quickly burn plants to black and put the powder on the wound to stop bleeding, or eat fresh vegetables to cool the blood. 200

The syndrome of dampness is directly caused by dampness accumulation in the body. The causes of the syndrome can be exterior and interior. Damp- ness, as one of the exogenous pathogenic factors, can invade the body and accumulate in the subcutaneous region, the muscles and the joints; it obstructs the meridians and collaterals. This disorder occurs par- ticularly in areas where the climate is humid. Exter- nal dampness can also directly invade the Middle-Jiao as a result of consuming inappropriate drinks and food that cause accumulation of dampness. Interior dampness is a result of dysfunction of the water metabolism, involving the Lung, Spleen, Kidney, Bladder and San Jiao. No matter how the dampness is formed (either by exterior or interior factors), as soon as it accumulates, it becomes a pathogenic factor, blocking the Qi circulation and causing further pathological changes. In the diagnosis, the syndrome of dampness can be divided into damp-cold syndrome and damp-heat syndrome, which are decided by constitution and dietary habit of the individual, as well as the nature of the pathogenic factors. The treatment principles and the strategies of composing formulas are quite different in these two types. For clarity, these two syndromes are discussed separately.

## 1 Damp-cold syndrome

Associated disorders in western medicine Acute and chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory infection, pulmonary emphysema, pulmonary heart disease, heart failure, acute nephritis and renal failure, chronic nephritis, gastritis, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, fibro- myalgia, rheumatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Analysis of the syndrome Water metabolism depends on the proper func- tioning of the Lung, Spleen, Kidney and San Jiao, especially the Yang and Qi aspects of these organs. • When the functions of the Lung, Spleen, Kidney and San Jiao are disturbed, the water may accumulate inside the body. Edema and accumulation of fluid are the most commonly seen symptoms. • If the Lung-Qi is blocked, edema often shows on the face and fingers, there is cough with thin, watery phlegm and hydrothorax. • If the Spleen is disturbed, or the Yang and Qi are weak, edema shows in the legs and joints, and in ascites. Diarrhea may also occur. • If the Kidney is disturbed or the Yang and Qi of the Kidney are weak, edema appears mainly in the legs and joints. Patients may suffer from difficult urination, retention of urine and incontinence. • Dampness is a Yin pathogenic factor and has a stagnating tendency. This characteristic is shown not only by the symptoms, but also by a lingering, recurrent or chronic pathological process. Exterior dampness is a Yin pathogenic factor. It often invades the body with wind and cold. • The exterior dampness stays at the skin, the subcutaneous region, the muscles and the joints. It blocks the Qi movement and blood circulation, and causes Bi syndrome. • When dampness predominates, patients have heaviness of the body and swelling of the joints of a lingering and recurrent nature. Complaints can get worse in humid weather. A constitution of internal cold and a diet of cold and raw food or low-calorie food may generate Main symptoms Edema, cough with thin, watery phlegm, hydrothorax, ascites, diarrhea, difficult urination or retention of urine, painful, swollen, heavy and cold limbs, fear of cold. Secondary symptoms Heaviness of the body, distension in the abdomen and fullness in the chest, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, vertigo, vomiting and tiredness. The syndrome has a lingering and recurrent process. Tongue Slightly pale with a watery or moist coating. Pulse Soft. 203 Syndrome of dampness and formula compositionChapter cold, further injure the Yang of the Spleen and form damp-cold in the body. Milk products may also increase the possibility of dampness accumulation. (See Figure 7.1 on page 221.) • When Qi is blocked, fullness of the chest, stomach and abdomen occur. • When Qi is unable to move freely, patients may easily feel tired. • When there is Yang deficiency in the body, the accumulated cold fluid in the Lower-Jiao may move upward and attack the Heart, Lung and head, causing palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, vertigo and vomiting. • Damp-cold obstructs and weakens the Yang, thus patients often have a feeling of cold in the limbs and are also afraid of cold. • A watery tongue coating and a soft pulse indicate the accumulation of dampness in the body. (See Figure 7.2 on page 222.) Treatment principle: Disperse, dry, dissolve and leach out dampness, regulate and strengthen the function of the Lung, Spleen, Kidney and San Jiao leach out dampness or warm the Kidney and accelerate water metabolism. • Second, pungent and warm herbs that can warm the interior are selected. • Herbs that strengthen and tonify the Spleen in order to activate its function are used in all types of dampness syndrome. • A small amount of sour herbs can be added to the formula to protect the Yin, along with sweet herbs to protect the Stomach. • To treat Bi syndrome, herbs that expel damp- cold from the meridians are used. • Herbs that promote digestion and regulate the Qi are often selected.


1. Caution in Yin deficiency: herbs and formulas that drain dampness are pungent, warm, bitter or bland and they may injure the Yin. patients with Yin deficiency should not use them, especially for a long period of time. 2. avoid large dosage: Since dampness is a Yin pathogenic factor and has a heavy, turbid and sticky nature, herbs and formulas should have a steady and constant action. Large dosage should be avoided in a long treatment course. 3. Caution in pregnancy: pregnant women should use the formulas with caution as these formulas contain aromatic, pungent and bitter herbs, which can easily move Qi and blood, and drain dampness. they may bring danger to the pregnancy. 4. avoid heavy sweating in the treatment: When wind, dampness and cold attack the superficial region of the body, the treatment method of inducing mild sweating may help to open the pores and expel dampness there. however, sweating heavily does not help to remove dampness, as dampness has a lingering nature and heavy sweating can also injure the Yin of the body. 5. avoid sweet food and herbs: Sweet food and herbs may cause dampness retention in the Middle-Jiao and should be avoided. 204


Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Treat dampness directly – (A) . Dampness in the Upper-Jiao: Induce mild sweating and expel dampness; descend the Lung-Qi, warm the Lung and regulate the water passage Qiang Huo (Notopterygii rhizoma), Qin Jiao (Gentianae macrophyllae radix), Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix), Xiang Ru (Moslae herba), Xing Ren (armeniacae semen) and Dan Dou Chi (Sojae semen praeparatum) Qiang Huo is pungent, bitter and warm. It enters the Bladder Meridian primarily and the Liver and Kidney meridians secondly. The pungent and warm nature gives Qiang Huo a strong dispersing and ascending ability; it can very effectively and quickly expel wind, dampness and cold in the superficial region of the body, such as the skin, sub- cutaneous region and the muscles, especially of the upper half of the body. It can be selected as chief in a formula to treat general pain, headache and stiffness of the back due to obstruction of the meridians by damp-cold. Since it has a strong drying property, it has a tendency to consume the fluid, blood and Yin, and therefore should be used with caution. Qin Jiao is pungent, bitter and neutral, and pri- marily enters the Stomach and Large Intestine meridians. Pungent can disperse the dampness, and bitterness can drain and dry the dampness. In par- ticular, this herb expels the dampness from the sub- cutaneous region and the muscles and can therefore relax the tendons and muscles. It can be used as chief in a formula to expel dampness in the Upper- Jiao. Since it is a neutral herb, it can be used in either damp-cold or damp-heat syndrome. Fang Feng is sweet, pungent and warm, and enters the Bladder, Liver and Spleen meridians. It can expel the wind, eliminate the dampness and relieve the exterior. It treats heaviness and pain of the body. This herb can be selected as chief in a formula where there is dampness in the superficial region. Compared with Qiang Huo and Qin Jiao, this herb is gentle in action and does not have a drying nature; thus it can be used in a mild condition or for a reasonably long period of time. Xiang Ru is a warm and aromatic herb. It is able to induce sweating, disperse wind and dampness, and release the exterior. It is especially useful when there is fever, general pain and heaviness of the body but no sweating in the symptoms. This herb is referred to as Summer Ma Huang because its gentle action is similar to that of Ma Huang (Ephedrae herba)* in inducing sweating. It is better to use Xiang Ru in the summer when the pores are not closed as tightly as in the winter. It also has the function of transforming dampness in the Middle- Jiao and can treat abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea and edema, but this function is not as strong as that of the other three herbs. Xing Ren is bitter and warm, and enters the Lung meridian. Dan Dou Chi is warm and pungent if it is processed by Zi Su Ye (Perillae folium); it enters the Lung and Stomach meridians. These two herbs can disperse the constrained Qi in the chest and acceler- ate the dispersing and spreading of the Qi and fluid in the Upper-Jiao, preventing the accumulation of dampness there. Moreover, as Dan Dou Chi can induce mild sweating, it can therefore eliminate dampness. Ting Li Zi (Lepidii/Descurainiae semen), Sang Bai Pi (Mori cortex), Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus), Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) and Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma) Ting Li Zi and Sang Bai Pi are cold, and enter the Lung meridian. They are able to direct the Lung-Qi downwards, and eliminate phlegm and water accu- mulation. They can therefore reduce obstruction of the Lung-Qi and arrest wheezing. They are used together in formulas to treat cough, asthma, fullness in the chest, edema and difficult urination. Ting Li Zi is very pungent, bitter and cold. In a damp-cold syndrome, this herb must be used together with warm herbs and is selected for its strong function. It is much stronger than Sang Bai Pi in directing the Lung-Qi downwards and draining water. It is thus considered as an agent that drives out water and phlegm. It also enters the Large Intes- tine meridian, and can drain water and phlegm via bowel movement. It is only suitable for treating the excess syndromes of phlegm and water accumula- tion in the Lung. However, since Ting Li Zi is a harsh and cold herb, and easily injures the Qi, Yang and Yin of the Lung, it is only used in excess syndromes for a short period of time. 205 Syndrome of dampness and formula compositionChapter Sang Bai Pi is sweet, bland and cold. It is gentler than Ting Li Zi in directing the Qi downwards and eliminating the accumulation of water and phlegm. Together with warm and pungent herbs, it can be used as chief in the formula when the dampness obstructs the Lung-Qi. Gui Zhi, Sheng Jiang and Gan Jiang are all warm and pungent. They can warm the interior, disperse the cold, accelerate the water metabolism and transform dampness in the Upper-Jiao. They can be used as chief in formulas that treat water obstruc- tion in the Upper-Jiao. Among these herbs, Gui Zhi accelerates the water metabolism through stimu- lating the Yang, accelerating the process of water changing into Qi; Sheng Jiang enters the Lung and Stomach meridians, disperses the congested water and soothes the Stomach-Qi; Gan Jiang is warmer than Sheng Jiang and primarily enters the Spleen meridian. As it dries dampness and warms the Yang of the Middle-Jiao, it can control the water that has the tendency of rising and attacking the Lung and Heart. Chief: Treat dampness directly – (B) . Dampness in the Middle-Jiao: Dry and transform dampness Cang Zhu (atractylodis rhizoma), Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex), Sha Ren (amomi xanthioidis fructus) and Bai Dou Kou (amomi fructus rotundus) Cang Zhu is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. It has a strong drying nature. It can either disperse the exterior dampness from the meridians or transform the interior dampness in the Middle-Jiao. Thus it can be chosen as chief in formulas that treat dampness. Hou Po is bitter, pungent and warm. Bitterness can descend the Qi; pungent and warm can disperse and dry the dampness. It is a very effective herb to transform dampness and phlegm, and to descend the Qi, thereby reducing the fullness in the chest and distension in the abdomen. Since it enters the Spleen, Stomach, Lung and Large Intestine meridi- ans, it can be used to treat Qi obstruction due to dampness and phlegm in the Upper-, Middle- and Lower-Jiao. Sha Ren and Bai Dou Kou are pungent, warm and aromatic, and enter the Spleen and Stomach merid- ians. They are able to transform dampness, regulate the Qi and revive the function of the Spleen. However, Sha Ren is stronger in regulating the Qi in the Middle-Jiao and reducing distension, nausea and pain in the abdomen; Bai Dou Kou is stronger in transforming dampness and warming the Middle- Jiao. It treats abdominal pain with a cold sensation, vomiting of clear fluid and watery diarrhea. Huo Xiang (agastachis herba) and Pei Lan (eupatorii herba) Huo Xiang and Pei Lan are pungent and aromatic, and enter the Spleen and Stomach meridians. Both are able to transform dampness in the Middle-Jiao, revive the Spleen, improve appetite and reduce the fullness in the Stomach. Huo Xiang and Pei Lan are often used together to enhance the ability of trans- forming dampness. These two herbs have strong aromatic smells, which have a very special function in transforming dampness and opening up the blockage of the Qi. They can penetrate into turbid dampness because their light but sharp smells are able to separate the clean from the turbid. In addition, their light but exceptional smell can wake up the Spleen that has been covered and confused by dampness. The aro- matic and pungent smells of these herbs can, on the one hand, stimulate the Spleen to transform damp- ness and treat the causes of dampness accumulation; on the other hand, these smells can activate the Qi movement so as to accelerate the functions of the involved organs. Huo Xiang is slightly warm, aromatic and pungent. It can penetrate into the turbidity and scatter the accumulation of dampness. Its action is strong but not harsh and is particularly effective in regulating the Qi in the Middle-Jiao, soothing the Stomach-Qi and treating nausea, vomiting and poor appetite. Pei Lan is neutral and gentle. Its light fragrant smell can particularly separate the clean from the turbid in the Middle-Jiao and revive the Spleen. It is effective in treating the sweet and sticky sensation in the mouth, a foul smell in the mouth, fullness in the chest, heavy limbs and a heavy sensation in the head. Chief: Treat dampness directly – (C) . Dampness in the Lower-Jiao: Warm the Lower-Jiao, leach out dampness Fu Ling (poria) Fu Ling is sweet, bland and neutral, and enters the Heart, Spleen, Stomach, Lung and Kidney 206


meridians. It is able to drain out dampness by pro- moting urination. It can also tonify the Spleen and calm the mind. Compared with the other herbs that transform dampness, it is bland and neutral in nature; thus Fu Ling is characterized by being applied for either damp-heat or damp-cold syn- drome. Because it is sweet and bland, it drains out dampness without the side effect of injuring the Yin and Yang of the body. Fu Zi (aconiti radix lateralis preparata)*, Rou Gui (Cinnamomi cassiae cortex) and Wu Yao (Linderae radix) These pungent and hot herbs enter the Kidney meridian. They are able to strengthen the Kidney- Yang and accelerate the water metabolism by steam- ing the water so as to separate the clean water from the turbid part. They can be used as chief in formu- las to treat chronic or severe cases of accumulation of water or dampness in the body. Among these herbs, Fu Zi is the strongest at expelling cold and dampness; however, its harsh and poisonous nature can bring side effects and therefore it is used for only a short period of time in severe cases. Rou Gui is pungent, warm and sweet. As its sweet taste brings a moderate but consistent dispersing and drying action, it can be used for a longer period of time. Wu Yao is able to warm the Lower-Jiao, Kidney, Bladder and Liver, and spread the Qi, thus accelerating the water metabolism and treating dampness in the Lower-Jiao. Deputy: Regulate the Qi; enhance the ability of the chief herbs Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium), Mu Xiang (aucklandiae radix)**, Sha Ren (amomi xanthioidis fructus) and Da Fu Pi (arecae pericarpium) These herbs are all pungent and warm. They can effectively promote the Qi movement to enhance the ability of the chief herbs in eliminating damp- ness. Chen Pi principally regulates the Qi in the Middle-Jiao; Mu Xiang regulates the Qi of the Liver and Large Intestine; Sha Ren regulates the Spleen and intestines; Da Fu Pi moves both Qi and water in the entire abdomen. Assistant: Strengthen the Spleen; promote Qi movement; nourish the Yin Bai Zhu (atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) and Huang Qi (astragali radix) These herbs tonify the Spleen-Qi so as to accelerate water transportation and transformation. Huang Qi is sweet and warm, and enters the Spleen and Lung meridians. It can strengthen and ascend the Qi. It is used principally to treat tired- ness, weakness and heaviness of the muscles. Bai Zhu is bitter and warm, and enters the Spleen meridian. As it not only tonifies the Spleen-Qi, but also dries dampness, it is a perfect herb for a syn- drome of dampness accumulation due to Spleen-Qi deficiency. Ma Huang (ephedrae herba)* and Jie Geng (platycodi radix) Ma Huang is able to enhance the chief herbs that expel dampness in the Lung by dispersing and descending the Lung-Qi, regulating the water passage and promoting urination. Jie Geng enters the Lung meridian. It has obvious ascending ability. As it can disperse the Lung-Qi, it can accelerate the descending action of the other herbs. Peels According to Chinese herbal conception, peels and bark of plants enter the skin of humans. Some peels can be used as assistants to treat dampness accumu- lation in the subcutaneous region that causes mild edema. The commonly used peels are Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium), Fu Ling Pi (Poriae cocos cortex), Sheng Jiang Pi (Zingiberis rhizoma recens cortex), Sang Bai Pi (Mori cortex) and Da Fu Pi (Arecae pericarpium). Mu Gua (Chaenomelis fructus) and Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) Mu Gua is sour and warm, and enters the Liver and Spleen meridians. It is used as a helping assistant in the formula because its sour taste can stabilize the body fluids and Yin, and its warm nature can dis- solve dampness. It is also selected to treat cramping, stiffness, swelling and heaviness of the joints and muscles. Wu Wei Zi is also sour and warm. It can stabilize the Yin and Qi, and is used as an assistant to correct the side effects of pungent, bitter and warm herbs. 207 Syndrome of dampness and formula compositionChapter Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Food accumulation: add Jiao Mai Ya (deep-fried Hordei fructus germinatus), Jiao Shen Qu (deep-fried Massa medicata fermentata) and Jiao Shan Zha (deep-fried Crataegi fructus) to treat food accumulation. • Phlegm accumulation: add Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) and Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) to remove the phlegm. • Blood stagnation: add Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma), Hong Hua (Carthami flos) and Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) to promote blood circulation. Examples of classical formulas Qiang Huo Sheng Shi Tang (Notopterygium Decoction to Overcome Dampness) Source: Nei Wai Shang Bian Huo Lun In this formula: • The pungent and warm Qiang Huo and Du Huo are used as chief. They can expel wind, cold and dampness from the upper part of the body and the lower part of the body respectively. Qiang Huo can reduce headache on the back of the head and can also treat stiffness of the neck. • The deputies are Fang Feng and Gao Ben. Fang Feng enters the Bladder and Spleen meridians, expels wind-dampness from superficial and subcutaneous regions and reduces the heavy sensation of the head. Gao Ben enters the Bladder meridian, expels wind and cold, and effectively relieves headache as its aromatic smell can quickly reach the top of the head. • Man Jing Zi, as helping assistant, can expel wind-dampness, regulate the Qi in the head and relieve headache with blurred vision. Chuan Xiong also serves as assistant. It can activate the Qi and blood, expel wind and relieve headache, especially on the lateral sides of the head. • Zhi Gan Cao is used as envoy in the formula to harmonize the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies In this formula, a group of herbs that treat head- ache are introduced. According to the meridian entered, they treat headache in different parts of the head. • Qiang Huo enters the Bladder meridian and treats headache particularly on the back of the head. • Gao Ben also enters the Bladder meridian, but treats pain on the top of the head. • Chuan Xiong enters the Liver and Gall Bladder meridians, and relieves headache, especially on the lateral sides of the head. In this formula, pungent, warm and aromatic herbs are used to expel wind, dampness and cold. However, the dosages are quite small, which sug- gests that a gentle dispersing action in the superficial region is expected at this moment because the heavy and lingering dampness in the superficial region cannot be expelled by a quick moving action of herbs. Qiang Huo (Notopterygii rhizoma) 6 g Du Huo (Angelicae pubescentis radix) 6 g Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix) 3 g Gao Ben (Ligustici sinensis radix) 3 g Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma) 3 g Man Jing Zi (Viticis fructus) 2 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 3 g Analysis of the formula This formula expels wind and eliminates dampness from the superficial part of the body and the subcu- taneous region. It treats wind-dampness at the superficial level of the body and the Qi movement and blood circulation are blocked. This disorder is manifested as stiffness and pain of the neck, back and shoulders, headache, heaviness of the body, aversion to cold with mild fever, a white, slightly sticky tongue coating and a superficial pulse. 208


Analysis of the formula This formula can warm the Lung and transform cold-phlegm. It is used for treating accumulation of cold-phlegm in the Lung. The manifestations are cough with a large amount of thin, watery or white phlegm, an uncomfortable sensation in the chest, a white and moist tongue coating and a wiry and slip- pery pulse. In this formula: • Gan Jiang and Xi Xin are chosen as chief to warm the interior, especially the Spleen and Kidney respectively, accelerate the water metabolism and dissolve the accumulation of water and cold-phlegm in the Lung. • Fu Ling, as deputy, is used in a reasonably large dosage to leach out dampness directly by increasing urination. • Wu Wei Zi is a corrective assistant. It stabilizes the Lung-Qi, thus protecting the Yin and fluid, which can be consumed by the hot herbs. • Zhi Gan Cao serves as both assistant and envoy. As assistant, it is used to protect and strengthen the Middle-Jiao; as envoy, it harmonizes the herbs in the formula that work on different aspects and in different directions. Commentary on strategies • This formula demonstrates two approaches to remove cold-phlegm from the Lung – one is to warm the interior, the other is to dissolve phlegm. • Although there are only five herbs in this formula, each has a specific function and demonstrates one procedure of treating cold- phlegm in the Lung. The dispersing herbs are used with stabilizing herbs. Since they are strong, effective and active, it is not necessary to use extra herbs to regulate the Qi. This formula clearly shows the composition style of Dr Zhang Zhong Jing. Ping Wei San (Calm the Stomach Powder) Source: Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang Cang Zhu (Atractylodis rhizoma) 15 g Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex) 9 g Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) 9 g Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) 4 g Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) 2 slices Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) 2 pieces Analysis of the formula This formula can dry dampness and stimulate the Spleen, regulate the Qi and soothe the Stomach. It treats accumulation of dampness in the Middle-Jiao that obstructs the Qi movement of the Spleen and Stomach. The symptoms are distension and fullness in the epigastria and abdomen, reduced appetite, nausea, vomiting, belching and acid regurgitation, heaviness of the limbs and reluctance to move. A white, sticky or thick tongue coating and a slow and soft pulse indicate the accumulation in this syndrome. In this formula: • Cang Zhu is used as chief. It is bitter, warm and pungent, can directly dry the dampness in the Middle-Jiao and restore the function of the Spleen and Stomach. • Hou Po is the deputy. It is pungent, bitter and warm, can effectively promote the Qi movement, dry dampness and particularly reduce the distension. • Chen Pi is used as an assistant. It is also pungent, warm and bitter, but is gentler than the first two herbs. It is used particularly to regulate the Qi of the Middle-Jiao, promote digestion and remove food accumulation, a common accompanying condition with dampness accumulation in the Middle-Jiao. Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma) 9 g Xi Xin (Asari herba)* 6 g Fu Ling (Poria) 12 g Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) 6 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 6 g Ling Gan Wu Wei Jiang Xin Tang (Poria, Licorice, Schisandra, Ginger and Asarum Decoction) Source: Jin Kui Yao Lue 209 Syndrome of dampness and formula compositionChapter • Dry-fried Gan Cao can tonify the Spleen-Qi without the side effect of retaining dampness when compared with honey-fried Gan Cao. Together with a small dosage of Sheng Jiang and Da Zao, it strengthens digestion and therefore helps to remove dampness. These herbs are assistants in the formula. Commentary on strategies As the formula shows the basic principles of elimi- nating dampness from the Middle-Jiao, it is consid- ered a principal formula for treating dampness. • It is characterized by using bitter, warm and pungent herbs to dry the dampness directly. • Herbs that regulate the Qi and strengthen the Spleen and Stomach are used to enhance the function of herbs that dry the dampness. Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San (Agastache Powder to Rectify the Qi) Source: Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang The symptoms are developed from these two path- ological changes. On the one hand, the exterior wind-damp-cold shows itself in chills, fever, head- ache and general pain of the body; on the other hand, damp-cold in the Stomach causes nausea, vomiting and fullness in the chest and epigastria. As dampness blocks the Middle-Jiao, the Spleen-Qi is unable to ascend, and diarrhea and abdominal pain thus appear. A white and sticky tongue coating and a soft pulse suggest the presence of dampness. In this formula: • Huo Xiang is used as chief. It has the function of either expelling wind, damp and cold from the exterior, or eliminating damp-cold from the Middle-Jiao. These functions are derived from its warm, pungent and aromatic properties and the ability to enter the Lung, Stomach and Spleen meridians. • The deputies are divided into two groups: – Zi Su Ye, Bai Zhi and Jie Geng enhance the ability of Huo Xiang to expel wind, dampness and cold in the exterior. – Hou Po, Chen Pi and Zi Su Ye enhance the function of Huo Xiang to eliminate damp- cold in the Middle-Jiao and harmonize the Qi. • The assistants are: – Fu Ling, Ban Xia and Da Fu Pi. They focus on regulating the Qi. Moreover, Fu Ling can leach out dampness by promoting urination; Ban Xia can eliminate phlegm and soothe the Stomach-Qi; Da Fu Pi eliminates the dampness and promotes Qi movement in the entire abdomen. – Bai Zhu, Sheng Jiang, Da Zao and Zhi Gan Cao. As helping assistants they focus on recovering the function of the Spleen and Stomach. Bai Zhu can strengthen the function of the Spleen and thus reduce dampness; Sheng Jiang, Da Zao and Zhi Gan Cao are able to strengthen the Middle-Jiao and promote digestion. • Zhi Gan Cao is also used as envoy to harmonize the herbs in this formula. Commentary on strategies Although this formula is quite large, its structure is clear. • One chief treats two pathogenic changes in the body. The remaining herbs are clearly divided into two groups of deputies and two groups of Huo Xiang (Agastachis herba) 90 g Bai Zhi (Angelicae dahuricae radix) 30 g Zi Su Ye (Perillae folium) 30 g Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) 60 g Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) 60 g Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 60 g Fu Ling (Poria) 30 g Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex) 60 g Da Fu Pi (Arecae pericarpium) 30 g Jie Geng (Platycodi radix) 60 g Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) 3 slices Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) 1 piece Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 75 g Analysis of the formula This formula can release exterior, transform damp- ness, regulate the Qi and harmonize the Middle- Jiao. It is used for treating invasion of exterior pathogenic wind-cold-dampness in the superficial region, as well as obstruction of damp-cold in the Middle-Jiao by inappropriate eating and drinking. 210


assistants. Each group has its special function. When they are used together they can enhance the ability of the chief and widely cover the secondary symptoms. • This formula has gathered the functions and strategies of Ping Wei San (Calm the Stomach Powder), which removes dampness, and Er Chen Tang (Two-Cured Decoction), which removes phlegm. The variations bring a deeper understanding of the relationship between the syndromes and the variations of composition. • The dosages of the herbs in the formula are only for making a large stock in pharmacies. A total dose of 6 g of fine powder can be prescribed, and mild sweating is expected to occur after taking it. Shi Pi Yin (Bolster the Spleen Decoction) Source: Chong Ding Yan Shi Ji Sheng Fang In this formula: • Gan Jiang, Fu Zi and Cao Guo are used as chief. They can warm the Spleen and Kidney directly, expel cold and accelerate water metabolism. • Bai Zhu, Fu Ling and Gan Cao are used as deputies to strengthen the function of the Spleen and accelerate the transformation and transportation of water. In addition, Bai Zhu can directly dry dampness and Fu Ling can leach out dampness by promoting urination. • Hou Po, Mu Xiang, Da Fu Pi and Cao Guo, as assistants, can promote Qi movement and eliminate the dampness. • Mu Gua is used as both helping assistant and corrective assistant because it can transform dampness directly as well as stabilize the Yin, which can be injured by the pungent and hot herbs or the herbs that move the Qi and drain the water. • Sheng Jiang is able to warm the Middle-Jiao and to promote digestion. Da Zao can tonify the Qi and blood. They are used as a pair of assistant herbs to strengthen the Middle-Jiao so as to help the chief and deputy herbs to eliminate dampness. Commentary on strategies This formula is large in composition and strong in function. It shows the four essential approaches to draining water so as to reduce severe edema: warming the Yang, strengthening the Spleen, regu- lating the Qi and draining water. These functions are balanced by using the sour and warm Mu Gua. Ling Gui Zhu Gan Tang (Poria, Cinnamon Twig, Atractylodes Macrocephala and Licorice Decoction) Source: Jin Kui Yao Lue Fu Zi (Aconiti radix lateralis preparata)* 6 g Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma) 6 g Fu Ling (Poria) 6 g Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 6 g Mu Gua (Chaenomelis fructus) 6 g Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex) 6 g Mu Xiang (Aucklandiae radix)** 6 g Da Fu Pi (Arecae pericarpium) 6 g Cao Guo (Tsaoko fructus) 6 g Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) 3 g Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) 5 slices Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) 1 piece Analysis of the formula This formula can warm the Yang, strengthen the Spleen, move the Qi and drain the water. It treats severe accumulation of water in the body due to Spleen-Yang and Kidney-Yang deficiency. The man- ifestations are severe edema, particularly of the abdomen and legs, cold hands and feet, no thirst, fullness and distension of the chest and abdomen, soft stool, a thick and sticky tongue coating and a deep and slow pulse. Fu Ling (Poria) 12 g Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) 9 g Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 6 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 6 g 211 Syndrome of dampness and formula compositionChapter Analysis of the formula This formula can warm and transform congested fluid, strengthen the Spleen and resolve dampness. It is used to treat congested fluid in the epigastria and weakness of the Spleen-Yang. The manifesta- tions are fullness in the chest and hypochondria, palpitations, shortness of breath, coughing up clear and watery sputum, dizziness or vertigo, a pale, flabby tongue with a white and watery coating and a slippery, wiry or deep pulse. In this formula: • Fu Ling is used as chief in a comparatively large dosage. It can directly leach out the dampness and promote urination. • Gui Zhi is used as deputy. As it can stimulate the Yang and accelerate the water turning into Qi, it can reduce the retention of water. • Bai Zhu and Zhi Gan Cao are used as assistants to strengthen the function of the Spleen so as to stimulate the transforming process of water. Bai Zhu can also dry dampness. • Zhi Gan Cao is used as envoy to harmonize the functions of the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, the basic strategies that have been shown in other formulas for eliminating water, such as leaching out dampness and strengthening the Spleen, are used. • Moreover, a unique new strategy is carried out by using Gui Zhi. As it is light and subtle, it can steam water into Qi and therefore dissolve the water.

## 2 Damp-heat syndrome

In the Middle-Jiao Main symptoms Heaviness and aching of the body, fever, irritability, thirst, fullness in the Stomach and no appetite. Secondary symptoms Sticky sensation in the mouth, reduced appetite, nausea, vomiting; eczema or other itchy and weeping skin disorders; Bi syndrome of wind- damp-heat type, poor concentration, inability to study, impaired memory, slow reactions; convulsions and mental confusion; heavy, painful and stiff limbs, swollen joints; tiredness, lassitude, jaundice. In the Lower-Jiao Main symptoms Difficult urination, difficult bowel movement and soft and sticky stool. Secondary symptoms Blood, pus and mucus in the stool, abdominal pain, distension, diarrhea and tenesmus; painful, urgent and frequent urination, blood in the urine. Tongue Red with a sticky white or yellow coating. Pulse Rapid, soft or slippery. In the Upper-Jiao Main symptoms Mild chills, fever, a warm sensation that remains in the flesh and cannot escape, headache with a heavy sensation, sleepy, generalized pain and heaviness of the body. Secondary symptoms Cough, dizziness, fullness in the chest. Associated western disorders Acute and chronic viral, bacterial, microbial and parasitic infections, skin disease, metabolic disor- ders, chronic liver disease and kidney disease. Analysis of the syndrome Damp-heat syndrome is a very complicated condi- tion. It is often caused by external damp-heat and is seen frequently in damp-febrile disease, referred to as Shi Re Bing in Chinese. Damp-febrile disease is one type of febrile disease; the other is warm-febrile disease, which is discussed in Chapter 3, Internal heat syndrome and formula composition. Damp-febrile disease is an infectious disease caused by exterior pathogenic damp-heat and is related to area and climate. • Pathogenic damp-heat invades the body through the nose and mouth. Sometimes the body reacts directly to the pathogenic factor, starting with exterior syndrome characterized by fever and chills with a superficial pulse. • Sometimes the pathogenic factor has an incubation period. It stays in the body without 212


any symptoms and starts after a certain period of time when the body’s resistance is weak. • The disease is characterized by the symptoms of tidal fever, afternoon fever or low-grade fever, but the heat cannot get out of the body. It mainly disturbs the function of the Spleen and Stomach and causes disorders of digestion and water metabolism. It has a lingering course and patients need time to recover. (See Figure 7.3 on page 222.) • Damp-heat usually invades the Upper-Jiao first. It mainly disturbs the function of the Lung, causing disorders in the superficial region and water passage, and leads to fever, chills, cough and fullness of the chest. • When damp-heat in the Upper-Jiao is not eliminated in time, it can invade the Middle- Jiao, obstruct the Qi and disturb the functions of the Spleen, Stomach, Large Intestine, Liver and Gall Bladder. It causes digestive disorders, skin diseases, tiredness, and swelling, pain and heaviness of the muscles and joints. The lingering dampness holds the heat, which can remain in the body for a very long period of time. When the function of the Spleen is injured by damp-heat, the excess condition of damp-heat can be complicated by Spleen deficiency. • Damp-heat can descend to the Lower-Jiao when it has accumulated for too long in the Middle-Jiao. It disturbs the Qi and blood, which shows in abnormal bowel movement and urination. • As well as the common development of damp- heat in the body, sometimes damp-heat can invade the Middle- and Lower-Jiao directly. (See Figure 7.4 on page 223.) In addition to the above causes of damp-heat syn- drome, as well as the influence of climate, an indi- vidual’s constitution and eating habits can directly generate damp-heat in the body. A Yang constitu- tion and indulgence in sweet, greasy and heavy food may generate damp-heat in the Middle-Jiao. After a long period of time, the Spleen is injured and the syndrome becomes excess with deficiency. When the function of the Spleen and Stomach have been impaired for a long period of time, a damp-heat syndrome can also arise. Once this complicated con- dition exists, it is very difficult to eliminate. (See Figure 7.5 on page 223.) • Dampness is a Yin pathogenic factor; heat is a Yang pathogenic factor. When they are mixed together, dampness may restrain the heat. Fever appears but is normally not high. If the body’s resistance is strong, patients can have high fever. • Whether the fever is high or low, patients experience a very unpleasant sensation when the damp-heat remains in the flesh, cannot escape and cannot be reduced by heavy sweating. • Since Qi is obstructed by dampness, fullness, distension, tiredness and heaviness of the body may occur. • As the Spleen relates to flesh, damp-heat can cause skin and muscular disorders. • When damp-heat obstructs bile secretion, jaundice may present. • When there is damp-heat in the Large Intestine and when dampness obstructs the Qi movement, irregular bowel movement, diarrhea, abdominal pain, distension, tenesmus and a bearing-down sensation may appear. • If damp-heat injures the blood and the flesh, mucus and blood appear in the stool. • If damp-heat obstructs the Bladder and injures blood vessels, urine is painful, frequent and bloody. • The Spleen is responsible for thinking and study. If the Spleen is covered by dampness, patients may feel sleepy, be unable to study and suffer from poor concentration and impaired memory. • When the clean-Qi of the Spleen is unable to ascend to support the Heart, patients may have difficulty in observation and responding quickly to the environment. • Damp-heat disturbs the function of the Spleen and Stomach and often causes digestive disorders leading to accumulation of food and phlegm. The tongue coating can therefore be yellow, sticky and thick, which is increased by the degree of damp-heat in the body. A red color indicates the degree of heat in the body at the same time. A soft pulse indicates the presence of dampness. In a strong person, or in a case of severe food, phlegm or water accumulation, a slippery, forceful or wiry pulse can be felt; a rapid pulse is the result of heat. (See Figure 7.6 on page 224.) 213 Syndrome of dampness and formula compositionChapter


Treatment principle: Separate dampness and heat by dispersing, transforming, drying and draining damp-heat; regulate the Qi; protect and strengthen the function of the Spleen • Herbs that promote digestion and regulate the Qi in the Middle-Jiao should be used. • Herbs that regulate the function of the Spleen and Stomach, and herbs that promote bile secretion and open the Heart orifice should be used when damp-heat disturbs the functions of the Gall Bladder and Heart. • Herbs that open up the collaterals and benefit the muscles and joints should be used as required. 1. pay attention to the condition of the Yin: herbs that treat dampness should be used with caution in conditions of Yin consumption. this is because, in the process of separating dampness from heat, pungent and warm herbs are used to disperse dampness, bitter and warm herbs are used to dry dampness and bland herbs are used to leach out dampness. 2. pay attention to the condition of the Yang: Cold herbs that clear heat should be used with caution as they can weaken the Yang and may increase the possibility of dampness generation. 3. Use steady and constant action in the treatment course: Since dampness is a Yin pathogenic factor and heat is a Yang pathogenic factor, when heat is held by dampness, it cannot leave easily from the body. herbs in formulas to eliminate damp-heat should have a steady and constant action. Large dosage should be avoided. 4. Caution in pregnancy: pregnant women should use the formulas with caution as these formulas contain aromatic, pungent and bitter herbs, which can activate Qi and blood, and drain dampness. they may bring danger to the pregnancy. 5. avoid sweet food and herbs: Sweet food and herbs may cause dampness retention in the Middle-Jiao and should be avoided. 214


Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Separate dampness and heat, and eliminate them Ma Huang (ephedrae herba)* or Xiang Ru (Moslae herba), Xing Ren (armeniacae semen), Jin Yin Hua (Lonicerae flos) and Bo He (Menthae herba) These herbs treat damp-heat that starts in the super- ficial region and in the Upper-Jiao. Ma Huang and Xiang Ru are both pungent and warm. As they can disperse the Lung-Qi, open the pores and induce mild sweating, they can eliminate dampness. They are often used for an exterior wind- dampness syndrome. Xiang Ru is gentler than Ma Huang. When damp-heat blocks the Qi in the Upper-Jiao, either one can be used. In addition, since both herbs can also descend the Qi and fluid from the Lung, they can increase urination and elim- inate dampness. Xing Ren is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Lung meridian. It can regulate the Qi of the Lung as its pungent and warm property has a dis- persing function and its bitter taste brings a descend- ing action. Xing Ren is often used when damp-heat obstructs the Qi in the Lung. In addition, it can also dry dampness and eliminate phlegm. Jin Yin Hua and Bo He are aromatic but cold herbs. They can disperse, penetrate the dampness, clear and reduce the heat. They are frequently selected when damp-heat invades the Upper-Jiao. When these pungent, aromatic herbs with warm and cold natures are used together, the damp and heat can be separated and eliminated. Huo Xiang (agastachis herba), Yi Yi Ren (Coicis semen) and Hua Shi (talcum) These herbs particularly treat damp-heat accumula- tion in the Middle-Jiao. Huo Xiang is pungent and slightly warm, and enters the Lung, Spleen and Stomach meridians. It can aromatically disperse dampness, revive the func- tion of the Spleen and Stomach, and transform the dampness from the Middle-Jiao. Yi Yi Ren is sweet, bland and slightly cold, and enters the Spleen, Stomach and Lung meridians. It can directly dis- solve damp-heat in the Middle-Jiao. Hua Shi is sweet and cold, and can leach out dampness by promoting urination. When these herbs are used together, they can disperse, transform and leach out dampness. Bai Dou Kou (amomi fructus rotundus) with Zhu Ling (polyporus) and Ze Xie (alismatis rhizoma) These herbs particularly treat dampness accumula- tion in the Lower-Jiao and the damp-heat disturbs the function of the Bladder. Bai Dou Kou is pungent and warm, and enters the Spleen, Stomach and Lung meridians. It is able to dry and disperse dampness, and promote the Qi movement in the Middle-Jiao. Zhu Ling is sweet and neutral and Ze Xie is sweet, bland and cold. They can eliminate the damp-heat by promoting urina- tion. The combination of warm and cold, pungent and bland can activate the water metabolism in the Lower-Jiao. Deputy: Eliminate damp-heat by promoting urination; dry dampness and drain damp-heat; regulate the Qi; stimulate and revive the function of the Spleen, open the orifice and meridians Dan Zhu Ye (Lophatheri herba), Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus), Mu Tong (Mutong caulis)* and Deng Xin Cao (Junci medulla) These herbs can be used alone or in a group as deputy in the formulas. They are bitter and cold, and enter the Heart and Small Intestine meridians. They can clear the heat from the Heart and Small Intestine, promote urination and thus leach out damp-heat. They are particularly used when stress and emotional disturbance create heat in the Heart that influences urination. Since they move down- wards, they can regulate the San Jiao water passage and accelerate the Qi movement in the San Jiao. Among these herbs, Dan Zhu Ye and Deng Xin Cao are the gentle ones and can be used for a relatively long period of time; Zhi Zi and Mu Tong are the strong ones and are only used for acute cases and for a short time. Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix), Yin Chen Hao (artemisiae scopariae herba), Yu Jin (Curcumae radix) and Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus) This group of herbs can be used as deputies to trans- form the damp-heat from the Middle-Jiao, promote bile secretion and reduce jaundice. 215 Syndrome of dampness and formula compositionChapter Huang Qin is bitter and cold, and can directly dry dampness and clear heat. Yin Chen Hao has an aromatic smell, can disperse the turbid dampness, revive the function of the Spleen and benefit the Gall Bladder. Yu Jin promotes the Qi movement and blood circulation. As it is pungent, bitter and cold, it can remove damp-heat in the Liver meridian. Lian Qiao is bitter and cold but has an aromatic smell; it can remove heat-toxin as well as disperse the dampness. Ban Xia (pinelliae rhizoma), Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex) and Su Geng (perillae caulis) The herbs in this group are pungent and warm, or pungent, bitter and warm. They can be used as deputies when the dampness accumulates in the Middle-Jiao, especially in the Stomach, which causes fullness and nausea. These herbs should be used with herbs that clear heat. They can promote Qi movement, disperse and transform dampness, and soothe the Stomach-Qi in the Middle-Jiao. Ban Xia can break up the accumulation of damp- ness as well as phlegm. It can efficiently soothe the Stomach-Qi. Hou Po has a strong and steady func- tion of eliminating, drying the dampness and pro- moting the Qi movement. The strong point of this herb is that it can activate the Qi so as to eliminate dampness in the Upper-, Middle- and Lower-Jiao. Su Geng is the gentlest of the three and particularly promotes the Qi movement in the Upper- and Mid- dle-Jiao. Huo Xiang (agastachis herba) and Pei Lan (eupatorii herba) Huo Xiang and Pei Lan can be used as deputies to treat damp-heat in the Middle-Jiao. They are aromatic herbs and can penetrate the dampness and revive the Spleen. They can therefore disperse the heat and dampness, and transform the damp- ness. They should be used with herbs that clear the heat. Shi Chang Pu (acori graminei rhizoma) and Yu Jin (Curcumae radix) These two herbs are commonly used as deputies to open the orifices. Shi Chang Pu and Yu Jin are cold and aromatic. They can remove dampness from the Middle-Jiao and allow the clear Qi to ascend to the head. They are particularly used in conditions of headache, heaviness in the head, poor concentration and mental confusion. Han Fang Ji (Stephaniae tetrandrae radix), Yi Yi Ren (Coicis semen), Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix), Qin Jiao (Gentianae macrophyllae radix) and Cang Zhu (atractylodis rhizoma) Han Fang Ji and Yi Yi Ren are cold and are able to eliminate damp-heat, increase urination, and relax the tendons and muscles. They can be used in the condition of Bi syndrome due to damp-heat in the Middle-Jiao. Fang Feng is pungent and slightly warm, and enters the Spleen meridian. It can disperse wind- dampness, ascend the clear Qi of the Spleen, elimi- nate dampness from the muscles and subcutaneous region, and treat heaviness and uneasy sensations in the muscles. Fang Feng can also promote digestion in the sense of reducing abdominal distension. Qin Jiao is pungent, bitter and neutral, and is able to induce mild sweating and reduce dampness in the superficial region of the body, as well as treat stiff- ness, heaviness and pain of the muscles. Cang Zhu is very pungent and warm. It can directly dry dampness in the Middle-Jiao. As it can also slightly induce sweating, it can disperse wind and dampness from the superficial region of the body. Assistant: Strengthen the Spleen; reduce the heat, remove phlegm and food accumulation; stabilize the Yin and body fluids Bai Bian Dou (Dolichoris lablab semen), Fu Ling (poria) and Bai Zhu (atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) These herbs are able to tonify the Spleen-Qi as well as eliminate dampness from the Middle-Jiao. Bai Bian Dou has a very gentle function of tonify- ing the Spleen-Qi and is also able to transform the dampness. It is astringent and can stabilize the fluid from the intestines. This herb is particularly selected for treating chronic diarrhea due to Spleen-Qi defi- ciency and dampness accumulation in the Middle-Jiao. Fu Ling is bland and neutral, and enters the Spleen and Bladder meridians. It is able to tonify the Spleen, promote urination and therefore leach out dampness from the Middle- and Lower-Jiao. Bai Zhu can directly dry dampness as it is pungent and warm. It has a relatively strong function to tonify the Spleen-Qi compared with the other two herbs. 216


Fresh Jin Yin Hua (Lonicerae flos), He Ye (Nelumbinis folium), Bai Mao Hua (Imperatae cylindricae flos) and Si Gua Luo (Luffae fructus) These aromatic fresh herbs can reduce the summer- heat and transform and disperse the dampness. They can be used as assistants in the formula if the damp-heat occurs in a humid and warm area. The main indications are fullness in the chest, reduced appetite, a sticky feeling in the mouth and sleepi- ness. The aromatic fresh herbs can penetrate the dampness in the Middle-Jiao, revive the function of the Spleen and accelerate the transformation of dampness. Fo Shou (Citri sarcodactylis fructus), He Ye (Nelumbinis folium), Sha Ren (amomi xanthioidis fructus), Mai Ya (hordei fructus germinatus) and Shen Qu (Massa medicata fermentata) These herbs are able to promote digestion, regulate the Qi in the Middle-Jiao and revive the function of the Spleen and Stomach. They are often used in the recovery period of syndromes of damp-heat in the Spleen and Large Intestine. Fo Shou is also able to spread the Liver-Qi and is more suitable to treat distension in the epigastria and hypochondriac region with slight depression. He Ye has a light fragrant smell; it can wake up the Spleen and improve appetite. Sha Ren is particularly useful for distension in the abdomen and for treating Qi stagnation with damp- ness in the Large Intestine. Mai Ya and Shen Qu are useful for treating poor appetite because they particularly aid the digestion of wheat, rice and cereals respectively. Sang Bai Pi (Mori cortex) and Gua Lou (trichosanthis fructus) These two herbs can remove phlegm, clear heat and descend the Qi. They are often used when phlegm has accumulated together with dampness. Mu Gua (Chaenomelis fructus) and Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) These are sour herbs. Mu Gua is warm and Bai Shao Yao is cold. They may be used in formulas as cor- rective assistants in order to stabilize the Yin and body fluids which can be weakened by the large group of herbs that eliminate dampness. Mu Gua enters the Liver and Spleen meridians, and can dis- solve dampness. It treats cramping, stiffness, swell- ing and heaviness of the joints and muscles. Envoy An envoy is not usually necessary since the chief, deputy and assistant are not harsh in action or tem- perature. In addition, Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata), the most commonly used envoy, is not suitable in this case as sweetness may retain and generate dampness. Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Blood and mucus in stool: use Bai Tou Weng (Pulsatilla radix), Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix), Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) and Huang Bai (Phellodendri cortex) to clear the heat and dry the dampness. • Painful, bloody urine due to urinary tract stone: use Hai Jin Sha (Lygodii spora) and Jin Qian Cao (Lysimachiae herba) to clear heat and remove the tiny stones, which are often referred to as sand. • Red, itchy and weeping skin disorder: use Bai Xian Pi (Dictamni cortex), Di Fu Zi (Kochiae fructus) and Ku Shen (Sophorae flavescentis radix) to clear heat and dry dampness. • Abscess: use Dong Gua Zi (Benincasae semen), Yi Yi Ren (Coicis semen) and Lu Gen (Phragmitis rhizoma) to clear heat and transform pus. • Leukorrhea: use Jing Jie (Schizonepetae herba), Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) and Shan Yao (Dioscoreae rhizoma) to disperse and transform dampness. • Mental confusion: use Shi Chang Pu (Acori graminei rhizoma), Yu Jin (Curcumae radix), Bing Pian (Borneol) and Niu Huang (Bovis calculus)** to open the Heart orifice. 217 Syndrome of dampness and formula compositionChapter Examples of classical formulas Xin Jia Xiang Ru Yin (Newly-Augmented Elsholtzia Decoction) Source: Wen Bing Tiao Bian light in function. They possess a dispersing nature. San Ren Tang (Three-Nut Decoction) Source: Wen Bing Tiao Bian Xiang Ru (Moslae herba) 6 g Jin Yin Hua (Lonicerae flos) 9 g Xian Bai Bian Dou Hua (fresh Dolichoris lablab flos) 9 g Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex) 6 g Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus) 6 g Analysis of the formula This formula is able to induce sweating and expel dampness in the superficial region. It treats damp- cold invasion of the superficial region and summer- heat that is constrained in the body. The manifestations are chills, fever, no sweat, general pain and heaviness, fullness in the stomach, irrita- tion, thirst, scanty urine, a white, sticky tongue coating and a soft and rapid pulse. In this formula: • Xiang Ru is used as chief to induce a mild sweating so as to expel dampness and cold in the superficial region. • Jin Yin Hua, Lian Qiao and Bian Dou Hua are also used as chief. As they have a light, aromatic smell, they can gently disperse the obstructed Qi, penetrate dampness and eliminate it. At the same time, they clear the summer-heat. They make a good combination with the pungent and warm Xiang Ru. • Hou Po is the deputy. It can directly dry dampness and regulate the Qi. Commentary on strategies • The combination of herbs in the formula demonstrates the strategy of inducing sweating together with clearing heat. • Following the principle of treating dampness in the Upper-Jiao, in the superficial region of the body, all herbs are aromatic, light in weight and Xing Ren (Armeniacae semen) 15 g Bai Dou Kou (Amomi fructus rotundus) 6 g Yi Yi Ren (Coicis semen) 18 g Hua Shi (Talcum) 18 g Tong Cao (Tetrapanacis medulla) 6 g Dan Zhu Ye (Lophatheri herba) 6 g Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex) 6 g Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) 10 g Analysis of the formula This formula can promote free flow of Qi and elim- inate damp-heat. It is used to treat dampness which is mingled with mild heat that obstructs the Qi in the Middle-Jiao. This occurs at the initial stage of damp-febrile disease or in humid summer condi- tions. The manifestations are headache with a heavy sensation, heaviness of the body, a wan complexion, fullness in the chest and epigastria, no appetite, afternoon fever, an absence of thirst, a white, sticky, thick tongue coating and a wiry, thready pulse, which is soft in the deep position. In this formula, three seeds are used as chief herbs: • Xing Ren, Bai Dou Kou and Yi Yi Ren are used together to disperse, transform and leach out dampness respectively. They treat damp-heat in the Upper- and Middle-Jiao. • Xing Ren is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Lung and Large Intestine meridians. The pungent and warm nature can disperse the Lung-Qi and the dampness and open up the Upper-Jiao. The bitterness can descend the Qi, and bitter with warm can dry dampness directly. • Bai Dou Kuo is also pungent and warm, but it enters the Spleen meridian. It can dry the 218


dampness in the Middle-Jiao and regulate the Qi there. • Yi Yi Ren is bland and slightly cold, and enters the Spleen, Stomach and Lung meridians. It can eliminate the dampness from the Middle-Jiao and clear the heat by increasing urination. When these three herbs are used together, they can separate the dampness and eliminate it. Qi move- ment in the San Jiao passage is therefore freed and all the symptoms disappear. • Hou Po is used as deputy. It is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Lung, Spleen and Large Intestine meridians. It is an excellent herb to regulate the Qi in the San Jiao passage, as well as removing phlegm and dampness, thereby enhancing the ability of the chief herbs. • Ban Xia is an assistant. It can directly dry the dampness in the Middle-Jiao and help Bai Dou Kuo. • Hua Shi, Tong Cao and Dan Zhu Ye form a group of assistants. They promote urination and assist Yi Yi Ren to clear heat and leach out dampness. Commentary on strategies This formula demonstrates how to separate and elim- inate damp-heat when dampness and heat are mixed together, accumulate in the Middle-Jiao, spread over the entire body and block the Qi movement. Gan Lu Xiao Du Dan (Sweet Dew Special Pill to Eliminate Toxin) Source: Wen Re Jing Wei Analysis of the formula This formula is able to leach out and transform turbid dampness and clear heat-toxin. It is used for treating damp-febrile disease when the damp-heat accumulates in the Qi level and the dampness and heat are equal in intensity. They block the Qi move- ment and injure the Yin. The manifestations are fever, sleepiness, fullness in the chest, abdominal distension, stiff and sour limbs, painful and swollen throat, thirst, vomiting, diarrhea, difficult urination, wan complexion or jaundice, a white or thick, sticky or dry, yellow tongue coating and a soft and rapid pulse. In this formula, the chief herbs are administered in large dosages and are used to separate and elimi- nate damp-heat: • Hua Shi is sweet and cold, can clear heat, leach out dampness and generate the body fluids. • Yin Chen Hao is an aromatic herb. It can disperse and transform dampness, and clear heat in the Upper- and Middle-Jiao. • Huang Qin is bitter and cold, can clear heat and dry dampness in the Upper- and Middle-Jiao. • Mu Tong is bitter and cold. It can strongly clear heat and promote urination so as to leach out damp-heat from the body. Several assistants enhance the ability of the chief herbs: • Shi Chang Pu, Bo He and Huo Xiang enhance the ability of Yin Chen Hao. They are all aromatic herbs and especially reduce the sleepy and heavy sensation of the head. • Chuan Bei Mu, She Gan, Lian Qiao and Bai Dou Kou enhance the ability of the chief herbs from different approaches. They all have a pungent taste. Chuan Bei Mu and She Gan can regulate the Qi and open up the Upper-Jiao; Lian Qiao can disperse and clear heat from the Heart; Bo He can disperse the heat in the Upper-Jiao and spread the Qi of the Liver and Gall Bladder; Bai Dou Kou can dry dampness and regulate the Qi in the Middle-Jiao. Commentary on strategies As the damp-heat pathogenic factor has two con- flicting natures in one, and it blocks many places in the body, several combinations are used in this formula to suit this complicated situation. • The aromatic and pungent herbs, which can disperse dampness and heat and open up the Hua Shi (Talcum) 450 g Yin Chen Hao (Artemisiae scopariae herba) 330 g Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) 300 g Shi Chang Pu (Acori graminei rhizoma) 180 g Chuan Bei Mu (Fritillariae cirrhosae bulbus) 150 g Mu Tong (Mutong caulis)* 150 g Huo Xiang (Agastachis herba) 120 g She Gan (Belamcandae rhizoma) 120 g Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus) 120 g Bo He (Menthae herba) 120 g Bai Dou Kou (Amomi fructus rotundus) 120 g 219 Syndrome of dampness and formula compositionChapter Upper-Jiao, are used with the bitter and cold herbs, which directly dry dampness, clear heat and descend the Qi. • Herbs that leach out damp-heat are used with herbs that dry dampness and herbs that disperse dampness. • Herbs that enter the San Jiao, Spleen, Large Intestine, Heart and Lung as well as Liver meridians are used together. • All these combinations come from profound thought about the syndrome and the treatment. Xuan Bi Tang (Disband Painful Obstruction Decoction) Source: Wen Bing Tiao Bian • The remaining herbs are assistants. Zhi Zi drains damp-heat from San Jiao; Yi Yi Ren transforms damp-heat from the Middle-Jiao. Together with Chi Xiao Dou, Yi Yi Ren eliminates the damp- heat in the meridians, muscles and joints. Ban Xia and Can Sha can open the obstruction of the Qi and eliminate dampness. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, herbs are selected with pungent, bitter and cold properties to treat Bi syndrome. • Herbs are selected with the function of regulating the San Jiao, particularly eliminating damp-heat from the meridians, muscles and joints.

The manifestations are high fever, chills, dark complexion, painful and swollen joints, a gray or yellow sticky tongue coating, and a soft and rapid pulse. In this formula: • Han Fang Ji, which is bitter, pungent and cold, is used as chief. It is able to clear heat, transform dampness, benefit the joints and stop pain. • Xing Ren and Hua Shi are deputies. Xing Ren enters the Upper-Jiao, disperses the Lung-Qi and regulates the water passage. Hua Shi enters the Lower-Jiao, clears heat and leaches out dampness. Yin Chen Hao (Artemisiae scopariae herba) 30 g Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) 15 g Da Huang (Rhei rhizoma) 9 g Analysis of the formula This formula can clear heat, transform dampness and reduce jaundice. It is used to treat damp-heat in the Spleen, Stomach, Liver and Gall Bladder which obstructs bile secretion. The manifestations are jaundice with a fresh tangerine color, slight abdominal distension, thirst and difficult urination, a yellow, sticky tongue coating and a deep, rapid pulse. In this formula: • Yin Chen Hao is used as chief. It is bitter and cold, and enters the Liver, Gall Bladder, Spleen and Stomach meridians. It can clear heat and eliminate dampness. It has an aromatic smell, can revive the function of the Spleen and transform the dampness. It can benefit the Gall Bladder and reduce the jaundice. • Zhi Zi is used as deputy. It is bitter and cold, and enters the San Jiao meridian. It can 220


clear heat, reduce the fire, regulate the San Jiao, promote urination and eliminate dampness. • Da Huang is used as assistant. It is bitter and cold, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. It is used in a relatively small dosage compared with the formulas of Dr Zhang Zhong Jing to purge the bowel. Here it is used to reduce damp-heat, increase urination, promote blood circulation and reduce heat- toxin and dampness accumulation. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, ascending and descending actions of herbs are used together to separate the dampness and heat. • The cold and bitter properties of the herbs are used to eliminate heat and dampness. • Herbs that clear heat are greater in number and stronger in function than those for treating dampness. • Da Huang is used in small dosage to reduce damp-heat, increase urination, promote blood circulation and reduce heat-toxin and dampness accumulation. Ba Zheng San (Eight-Herb Powder for Rectification) Source: Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang Analysis of the formula This formula can clear heat, drain excess fire, promote urination and relieve pain. It is used to treat Lin syndrome (painful urinary dysfunction) due to damp-heat in the Bladder, which injures the blood and blocks the Qi. The manifestations are turbid and dark urine, painful and difficult urination, lower abdominal pain and distension, dry mouth and thirst, a yellow and sticky tongue coating, and a slip- pery and wiry pulse. Commentary on strategies When the dampness invades the Lower-Jiao, it can be eliminated via urination. • In this formula, many bitter and cold herbs are used to clear heat and promote urination so as to eliminate damp-heat. • At the same time, Da Huang is used to promote bowel movement, which is a strategy to reduce dampness via the intestines. • Gan Cao is used as assistant to protect the Stomach from the cold and draining herbs. It also serves as envoy to harmonize the herbs in the formula.

It is used to treat heat-toxin and dampness accu- mulation in the intestines, which obstruct the Qi and injure the blood. The manifestations are abdom- inal pain, tenesmus, a burning sensation around the anus, diarrhea containing more blood than pus, and thirst. Patients often have a red tongue with a yellow coating, and a wiry and rapid pulse. 221 Syndrome of dampness and formula compositionChapter In this formula: • Bai Tou Weng is chosen as chief to reduce the heat directly and to cool the blood. As it enters the Large Intestine meridian, it can effectively clear heat-toxin there. • Huang Lian and Huang Bai are deputies. They are bitter and cold, and enter the Middle- and Lower-Jiao respectively. They can effectively clear heat and dry dampness in the intestines. • Qin Pi is an assistant. It is bitter, cold and astringent, and can clear heat and eliminate dampness. As it can also bind up the intestines, it can stop diarrhea. It is essential to use this herb in chronic conditions where the diarrhea lasts for a long time and the Spleen-Qi has been injured. Commentary on strategies In clinical practice, this formula should be used with variation. • This formula is used for treating the syndrome where heat predominates and manifests in the amount of blood and the burning sensation of the anus. • Most of the herbs in the formula are cold and bitter, and can strongly reduce the damp-heat in the intestines. • In acute and excess conditions, some herbs should be added, such as Di Yu (Sanguisorbae radix) and Huai Hua (Sophorae flos), which can enhance the ability of Bai Tou Weng (Pulsatilla radix) to cool the blood; Zhi Ke (Aurantii fructus) and Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix), which can moderate the Liver-Qi and reduce the urgent, frequent bowel movement and tenesmus; and Jing Jie (Schizonepetae herba) and Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus), which can clear the obstruction of Qi and blood. • Qin Pi is essential in the treatment of chronic conditions where the diarrhea lasts for a long time and the Spleen-Qi has been injured. However, it should not be used in excess conditions when the heat in the intestines is strong.

## Syndrome of food accumulation and


Food stagnation is a condition where the food is not properly digested and transported. The undigested food accumulates in the stomach and intestines, obstructs the Qi and causes related symptoms. The accumulated food can further generate or transform into dampness and phlegm that disturb the func- tions of the internal organs. Although food accumulation is not commonly seen nowadays in developed countries, food accu- mulation might still occur in certain situations: • It may occur in infants, since their Spleen and Stomach are not fully developed and the parents may lack experience or knowledge of the best way to feed and nurse their child. • It also happens among elderly people since their digestion is slower than before. • It can arise in people with a weak constitution, patients who suffer from chronic diseases, people who have been eating under stress for a long period of time, and people who change their diet dramatically. Because their Spleen and Stomach are not strong, food can easily become stagnant in the Middle-Jiao. • Acute cases can sometimes occur in the vacation period when the diet is changed significantly, or among people who overindulge in food.

## Syndrome of food accumulation

Associated disorders in western medicine Acute or chronic diseases and disorders of the diges- tive system and the immune system, such as chronic gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, irritable bowel syn- drome, food allergy and intolerance. Analysis of the syndrome Proper digestion depends on the cooperation of the Stomach and Spleen. In the Middle-Jiao, the Stomach-Qi moves downwards and the organ receives and ripens food; the Spleen-Qi moves upwards and the organ transforms the food into Qi and blood, which are further transported to the Lung. Through the dispersing function of the Lung, Qi and blood spread throughout the entire body. • When food accumulates in the Stomach, the Qi in the Middle-Jiao is blocked. Patients may feel fullness and distension, sometimes with pain in the stomach and abdomen. • When Stomach-Qi fails to descend, nausea and vomiting may occur. • Since the Stomach is a Yang Ming organ, it is active in ripening food with its Yang and heat. When the Qi is blocked, heat can over-ripen the food, which leads to foul breath, and patients may vomit undigested food. • The Large Intestine is a Yang Ming organ; constipation may present when there is dry-heat there. • In a chronic condition, particularly when the Qi is too weak to ascend to transform the food into essence, dampness may accumulate and phlegm may be formed, which leads to diarrhea. • When food accumulation is in an acute stage, the color of the tongue is almost normal; however, it will turn dark if the accumulation becomes chronic. The thickness of the tongue coating indicates the degree of accumulation; a yellow tongue coating indicates the degree of heat in the Stomach; sticky indicates the accumulation of dampness and phlegm of the Spleen. As to the pulse, a slippery, forceful and rapid pulse indicates an excess condition of accumulation; a wiry pulse indicates pain and tension in the Middle-Jiao; a thready pulse suggests deficiency. (See Figure 8.1 on page 232.) Main symptoms Fullness in the stomach, belching, nausea, vomiting with a foul smell, distending pain in the abdomen, constipation or diarrhea. Secondary symptoms Chronic indigestion, poor appetite, distension of abdomen, particularly after meals or after taking heavy, unfamiliar food, impairment of general condition and development in children. Tongue Normal tongue with a white or slightly yellow sticky coating. Pulse Slippery, forceful and rapid. 227 Syndrome of food accumulation and formula compositionChapter Treatment principle: Promote food digestion, regulate the Qi in the Middle-Jiao and strengthen the Spleen 2. Caution in pregnancy: Formulas that remove food accumulation should be used with caution during pregnancy as they contain a number of herbs that activate Qi movement to remove food, phlegm and dampness. 3. pay attention to the condition of the Spleen and Stomach in chronic cases: Formulas that remove food accumulation are suitable for excess and acute conditions. In a condition of chronic food accumulation, among people who have deficiency of the Spleen and Stomach, a formula with tonifying herbs should be used for a long period of time, together with gentle herbs that promote digestion. 4. avoid sweet food and herbs: Sweet food and herbs should be avoided as they can increase the dampness in the Middle-Jiao in a condition of food accumulation. Furthermore, they make the dampness accumulation worse and patients may easily feel nauseous. 5. Follow an appropriate diet: During treatment, patients should take soft, gentle and warm foods, which are easily digested while being rich in nutrition. after recovery, appropriate dietary advice should be given to patients according to the digestive capacity of each individual.


• Formulas that treat food accumulation and formulas that drain downwards have similarities in application. Both treat accumulation and they both descend the Qi in the Stomach and intestines. • Formulas that reduce food accumulation are relatively gentle. the purpose of the treatment is to dissolve the accumulation gradually, and they are used for mild accumulations. • Formulas that drain downwards can powerfully stimulate the intestines and purge the accumulation. these formulas are strong, and the purpose is to guide out the accumulation vigorously and quickly in a very short time.


1. Choose a short treatment course for acute and excess accumulation: Because formulas that reduce food accumulation can digest and dissolve food and phlegm, they can also injure the Stomach, Spleen, Qi and blood. they are usually only used for a short period of time. When the accumulated food has been digested, these formulas should be stopped. Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Reduce food accumulation and aid the digestion Mai Ya (hordei fructus germinatus), Shen Qu (Massa medicata fermentata) and Shan Zha (Crataegi fructus) These three herbs have the function of promoting digestion. Since they are often used together and are very effective in treating food stagnation, they have another name – Jiao San Xian; Jiao means deep dry-fried, San means three and Xian means immor- tal. In other words, it means three very effective herbs. These herbs are often deeply dry-fried until their colors change to deep brown, based on the belief that this makes them easier to digest. They work particularly on the Middle-Jiao. These three herbs are often used together because their different functions can enhance each others’ 228


therapeutic effects. Mai Ya is sweet and neutral, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. It especially aids the digestion of wheat, rice and fruits. Shen Qu is pungent, sweet and warm, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. It par- ticularly aids the digestion of grains and dispels the effects of alcohol. Shan Zha is sour, sweet and slightly warm, and enters the Spleen, Stomach and Liver meridians. It especially aids the digestion of meat, fat and milk. In most cases of food stagnation these kinds of food and drink are all involved, hence these herbs are often used together. Lai Fu Zi (raphani semen) and Ji Nei Jin (Gigeriae galli endothelium corneum) Lai Fu Zi is pungent, sweet and neutral, and enters the Lung and Spleen meridians. Lai Fu Zi is a strong herb to remove food accumulation. In addition, it can descend the Lung-Qi, soothe the Stomach-Qi and promote bowel movement. It can also eliminate phlegm in either the Lung or the Stomach. Ji Nei Jin is sweet and slightly cold, and enters the Stomach, Spleen and Bladder meridians. It aids digestion of all kinds of food. Its function is quite strong. Since it is cold in temperature, it is also able to reduce heat and eliminate irritability. It is par- ticularly suitable for use in children with malnutri- tion when chronic food stagnation has already produced heat. Deputy: Regulate the Qi in the Middle- Jiao and remove dampness and phlegm Ban Xia (pinelliae rhizoma) and Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) Ban Xia and Chen Pi are often used to regulate the Qi in the upper abdomen and reduce Qi stagnation, thus accelerating the transformation and transporta- tion of food and drink in the Middle-Jiao. They can soothe the Stomach-Qi and treat nausea and fullness of the stomach. Mu Xiang (aucklandiae radix)**, Bing Lang (arecae semen) and Sha Ren (amomi xanthioidis fructus) Mu Xiang and Bing Lang can regulate the Qi in the lower abdomen and reduce distension. They can accelerate food transformation and transportation in the Middle-Jiao. They can treat constipation and diarrhea. Sha Ren is pungent, aromatic and warm. It can effectively regulate the Qi as well as transform dampness in the abdomen and improve digestion. It is often used for treating abdominal distension. Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex) Hou Po is pungent, warm and bitter, and enters the Spleen, Stomach, Large Intestine and Lung meridi- ans. It can effectively regulate the Qi in the chest and the whole abdomen, and reduce distension. It can also remove phlegm and dampness. Assistant: Tonify the Spleen-Qi and strengthen the Middle-Jiao Bai Zhu (atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) Bai Zhu is sweet and warm, and can tonify the Spleen-Qi. However, as it is also bitter and warm, it can dry dampness. It is used to treat chronic food accumulation caused by Spleen-Qi deficiency where poor appetite, diarrhea and distension of the stomach and abdomen may exist. Fu Ling (poria) Fu Ling is neutral and bland. It can gently tonify the Spleen-Qi and eliminate dampness in the Middle- Jiao. Its function is gentle and it can be used for a long period of time. It is suitable for use in chronic food accumulation and mild Spleen-Qi deficiency. Fu Ling can also tonify the Heart-Qi and is there- fore used for calming the mind. It is particularly useful for children with mild Heart-Qi and Spleen- Qi deficiency who suffer from restless sleep due to food accumulation. Ren Shen (Ginseng radix), Huang Qi (astragali radix) and Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix) Ren Shen and Huang Qi are strong herbs to tonify the Spleen-Qi and promote digestion. They are used for severe cases of deficiency of Spleen-Qi, espe- cially in chronic conditions. A large dosage of Dang Shen is often used as a substitute for Ren Shen. Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) and Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus) Huang Lian is bitter and cold. Bitterness can descend the Qi and cold can clear fire. It is believed that a small amount of this bitter and cold herb can strengthen the function of the Stomach where the heat easily accumulates. Lian Qiao is also bitter and cold. However, it has fragrant smell and thus not only descends the Qi and 229 Syndrome of food accumulation and formula compositionChapter clears the heat, but also disperses the restrained heat that is produced by food accumulation. Envoy: Harmonize the herbs in the whole formula in the aspects of temperature, taste, working directions and levels, and characteristics Since all of the chief herbs enter the Spleen merid- ian and promote digestion, it is not necessary to use a guide herb. Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Nausea and vomiting with a foul smell: use Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma), Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) and Zhu Ru (Bambusae caulis in taeniam) to soothe the Stomach-Qi and clear the heat. • Bitter taste in the mouth with a foul smell: use Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) or Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus) to reduce the heat from the accumulation of food. • Constipation: use Da Huang (Rhei rhizoma) to purge the intestines and use Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) to moisten the intestines. • Stomach fullness due to stress and emotional disturbance: use Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix), Fo Shou (Citri sarcodactylis fructus) and Xiang Yuan (Citri fructus) to regulate the Liver and Stomach. • Burning pain in the stomach due to Stomach-heat and Liver-heat: add Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix), Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) and Mei Gui Hua (Rosae flos) to reduce heat and regulate the Qi. • Loose stool without smell, sensitivity to heavy food, bloating and defecation with wind: add Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix), Jing Jie (Schizonepetae herba) and Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) to regulate the function of the intestines. • Cold sensation in the Stomach with cramping pain: use Zi Su Ye (Perillae folium) and Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) to warm and ease the Stomach. • Poor appetite, malnutrition in children: use Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) and Hu Huang Lian (Picrorhizae rhizoma) to promote digestion. Examples of classical formulas Bao He Wan (Preserve Harmony Pill) Source: Dan Xi Xin Fa Shan Zha (Crataegi fructus) 180 g Shen Qu (Massa medicata fermentata) 60 g Lai Fu Zi (Raphani semen) 30 g Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) 30 g Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) 90 g Fu Ling (Poria) 90 g Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus) 30 g Analysis of the formula This formula can promote digestion and regulate Qi movement in the Middle-Jiao. It is used to treat acute food stagnation when the Qi is blocked and slight heat is generated. The manifestations are full- ness in the stomach, belching, nausea, vomiting with a foul smell, distending pain in the abdomen, con- stipation or diarrhea. The tongue body is normal or slightly red, and the coating is thick, white or slightly yellow. The pulse is slippery, forceful and rapid. In the formula: • Shan Zha, Shen Qu and Lai Fu Zi are used as chief. They are used together to promote digestion of all types of food. Lai Fu Zi also descends the Qi and removes food and phlegm. • Chen Pi and Ban Xia serve as deputies. They soothe the Stomach-Qi, promote digestion and improve appetite, thus enhancing the ability of the chief herbs and treating Qi stagnation caused by food accumulation. • Fu Ling is used as assistant. It tonifies the Spleen-Qi, removes the dampness, stops diarrhea and calms the mind. Lian Qiao, another assistant, can disperse and clear the heat that is produced by food accumulation. Together with Fu Ling, Lian Qiao calms the mind and relieves irritability due to uneasy sensations in the stomach. 230


When all the herbs are used together, food accu- mulation can be effectively removed. Commentary on strategies Lian Qiao is used in this formula although there is no obvious sign of heat. If the accumulation happens in the Yang organ, the Stomach, and it is impossible to reduce the accumulation quickly, logically the accumulation will surely generate heat. To prevent heat generation, therefore, Lian Qiao is used in a smart way in the formula. Zhi Shi Dao Zhi Wan (Immature Bitter Orange Pill to Guide Out Stagnation) Source: Nei Wai Shang Bian Huo Lun – Shen Qu aids digestion and dissolves food accumulation. – Huang Qin and Huang Lian are able to clear damp-heat and treat diarrhea and abdominal pain. – Fu Ling and Ze Xie are able to leach out dampness and stop diarrhea. – Bai Zhu and Fu Ling can strengthen the function of the Spleen, dry the dampness in the Middle-Jiao and enhance the ability of herbs that remove the accumulation. They also serve as corrective assistant as they can protect the Spleen and Stomach from bitter and cold herbs, such as Huang Lian and Huang Qin, as well as the harsh action of Da Huang. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, herbs are used in groups to treat accumulation of food, dampness and heat. • The action of intense reducing herbs is balanced by using tonifying herbs. • These strategies are effective in treating a quite severe but complicated condition of accumulation. Jian Pi Wan (Strengthen the Spleen Pill) Source: Zheng Zhi Zuen Sheng Da Huang (Rhei rhizoma) 30 g Zhi Shi (Aurantii fructus immaturus) 15 g Shen Qu (Massa medicata fermentata) 15 g Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) 9 g Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) 9 g Fu Ling (Poria) 9 g Ze Xie (Alismatis rhizoma) 6 g Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 9 g Analysis of the formula This formula treats not only food accumulation, but also a severe complicated condition of food and damp-heat accumulation in the intestines. The man- ifestations are abdominal distension and pain, foul- smelling diarrhea, constipation and scanty urine. The tongue is red with a yellow and sticky coating. The pulse is deep and firm. In this formula: • Da Huang is used as chief with a large dosage to purge the intestines and remove the accumulation. • Zhi Shi, as deputy, descends the Qi in the intestines, reduces distending pain and enhances the function of the chief. • The remaining herbs are used as assistants to remove the accumulation and strengthen the Middle-Jiao: Chao Bai Zhu (dry-fried Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 75 g Fu Ling (Poria) 60 g Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 45 g Shan Yao (Dioscoreae rhizoma) 30 g Rou Dou Kou (Myristicae semen) 30 g Shan Zha (Crataegi fructus) 30 g Chao Shen Qu (dry-fried Massa medicata fermentata) 30 g Chao Mai Ya (dry-fried Hordei fructus germinatus) 30 g Mu Xiang (Aucklandiae radix)** 22.5 g Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) 30 g Sha Ren (Amomi xanthioidis fructus) 30 g Jiu Zhi Huang Lian (wine-fried Coptidis rhizoma) 22.5 g Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) 22.5 g 231 Syndrome of food accumulation and formula compositionChapter Analysis of the formula This formula is able to strengthen the Spleen, reduce food stagnation and promote digestion. It is used for food stagnation due to weakness of the Spleen. The manifestations are reduced appetite, bloating and focal distension of the epigastria and abdomen, belching, soft stool or diarrhea. The tongue is slightly pale with teeth marks and the coating is slightly yellow and sticky. The pulse is weak. In this formula: • Bai Zhu is used in a large dosage as chief to tonify the Spleen-Qi, dry the dampness and thereby promote digestion. • There are two groups of deputies: Ren Shen, Shan Yao and Fu Ling tonify the Spleen and strengthen the function of Bai Zhu; Mai Ya, Shen Qu and Shan Zha resolve food accumulation and aid digestion. • There are three groups of assistants: – Rou Dou Kou is warm and pungent. It warms the Middle-Jiao, dries dampness and promotes digestion; together with Shan Yao it can also stop diarrhea. – Mu Xiang, Chen Pi and Sha Ren are able to reduce food accumulation through activating the Qi movement in the Stomach and Large Intestine. They can also reduce the cloying and heavy nature of the tonifying herbs. – Huang Lian is used for reducing constrained heat produced by the accumulation. • Gan Cao is sweet in nature and enters the Spleen meridian. It is used as envoy to harmonize the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, herbs that strengthen the Spleen, reduce food stagnation and promote digestion are used together. • The herb selection is very sensible and the processing procedures suit the weak and sensitive Stomach and Spleen. Bai Zhu, Mai Ya and Shen Qu are all dry-fried. After this processing, they particularly enter the Spleen and their function of promoting digestion is more effective. Huang Lian is processed by alcohol because alcohol can reduce its cold nature, thus avoiding the likelihood of injuring a weak and sensitive Stomach. Alcohol can also disperse heat from the accumulation in the Stomach. Rou Dou Kou is covered with pasta and gently baked, thus removing the oil in this herb which may cause diarrhea. Zhi Zhu Wan (Immature Bitter Orange and Atractylodes Macrocephala Pill) Source: Nei Wai Shang Bian Huo Lun Composition Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 60 g Zhi Shi (Aurantii fructus immaturus) 30 g Pills made from the above two herbs should be taken with He Ye (Nelumbinis folium) tea, 2 g dissolved in 50 ml of hot water, up to a total dosage of He Ye of 6–9 g. Analysis of the formula This formula can strengthen the Spleen and dissolve the food accumulation. It is used to treat poor appet ite, fullness in the stomach and weakness of the muscles due to malnutrition. It is particularly used for children who have impaired digestion. This is a small formula that is formed with two herbs: • Bai Zhu is used as chief in a large dosage to tonify the Spleen-Qi and promote digestion. • Zhi Shi is used as deputy to descend the Qi in the Stomach and intestines, remove the accumulation and reduce distension. Commentary on strategies Although this formula is very small in size, it clearly shows the way to reduce food accumulation in a chronic condition when the Spleen-Qi is not strong. • In the formula, tonifying and reducing herbs are used together. The dosage of the tonifying herb is much greater than that of the reducing herb, indicating the emphasis of the formula. • This formula is used in pill form, which is particularly suitable for chronic conditions and is less irritating to a weak and sensitive stomach. • Moreover, the pills are taken with He Ye tea, which has a fragrant smell, can ascend the clear Qi of the Spleen and promote digestion. This tea is easily accepted by children. 232

## Syndrome of phlegm

Phlegm is both a pathological product and a second- ary pathogenic factor that will lead to further path- ological changes in the body. In the concept of traditional Chinese medicine, phlegm and dampness are considered to be sub- stances with the same nature and to come from the same origin. They are the pathological products of failure of water metabolism, which is caused directly by dysfunctions of the Lung, Spleen, Kidney and San Jiao. If water spreads without visible form, it is referred to as dampness; if water becomes thick and turbid, accumulates in one place and has form, it is referred to as phlegm. Dysfunctions of the Lung, Spleen, Kidney and San Jiao are the principal causes of phlegm: the Lung disperses and descends the water; the Spleen trans- ports the water and transforms it into body fluids; the Kidney receives body fluids and separates the clean from the turbid by steaming them, as well as warming the Spleen-Yang to accelerate the function of the Spleen; the San Jiao is the passage of Qi and water. Dysfunction of these organs can lead to water accumulation. Other factors may also influence the formation of phlegm. Cold can condense water, make water move slowly in the body and cause accumulation; exterior dampness can directly invade the body via skin, nose and mouth, as well as from food and drink; heat can consume body fluids, which become turbid and thick and form phlegm with other path- ogenic factors; Qi stagnation can cause water accu- mulation directly. Constitution and dietary habit are also important in producing phlegm. A Yang consti- tution and a diet with spicy, hot and fatty food may easily generate phlegm-heat. A Yin constitution and a diet with cold and raw food or low-calorie food may generate cold, further injure the Yang of the Spleen and form damp-phlegm or phlegm-cold. As soon as the phlegm is formed, it interferes and blocks the normal Qi movement. In addition, it is also pushed by Qi to move throughout the body. A type of visible phlegm often accumulates in the Lung, nose, sinuses, stomach and intestines and can be expectorated or discharged; a type of invisible phlegm exists in other parts of the body and cannot be discharged. These types of phlegm can result in different symptoms. In general, phlegm syndrome is divided into damp-phlegm/cold-phlegm syndrome and phlegm-heat syndrome. Main symptoms Damp-phlegm/cold-phlegm syndrome: large amount of white, sticky, thick or thin phlegm without smell that is easy to expectorate. Phlegm-heat syndrome: large amount of green or yellowish sticky phlegm with a foul smell that can be expectorated. Symptoms according to the affected regions and organs Phlegm in the Lung and sinus: cough, wheeze, phlegm that can be expectorated, nose obstruction or runny nose. Phlegm obstruction of the throat: sticky phlegm that is difficult to expectorate, or having a sensation that a plum-pit blocks the throat which cannot be swallowed or expectorated. Phlegm obstruction of the Stomach: nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fullness in the upper abdomen. Phlegm accumulates in the intestines: discharge of mucus and pus. Phlegm obstruction of the sensory orifices: dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, deafness, heavy sensation in the head, loss of consciousness, wind-stroke and epilepsy. Phlegm obstruction of the Heart: palpitations, chest pain, restlessness, insomnia, depression, mental confusion, delirium and mania. Phlegm obstruction of the meridians and collaterals: in blocked areas, having the sensation of numbness, heaviness, tingling, cramp, twitch and pain. Phlegm obstruction with other pathogenic factors for a long period of time: lymphadenitis, scrofula and tumors. Secondary symptoms Fullness, distending sensation or pain in the related areas. Tongue Damp-phlegm/cold-phlegm syndrome: pale or dull pale with a white sticky coating. Phlegm-heat syndrome: red with a yellow sticky coating. Pulse Damp-phlegm/cold-phlegm syndrome: slippery, wiry or deep. Phlegm-heat syndrome: slippery and rapid. 235 Syndrome of phlegm and formula compositionChapter Associated disorders in western medicine Sinusitis, laryngopharyngitis, acute and chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, upper respira- tory infection, pneumonia, lung abscess, influenza, gastritis, morning sickness of early pregnancy, dys- entery, colitis, migraine and Ménière’s disease, schizophrenia, depression, facial paralysis, facial spasm, epilepsy, hemiplegia, neuralgia, lymphadeni- tis, nodules, goiter, scrofula, hepatosplenomegaly, cirrhosis of liver and tumors. Analysis of the syndrome Phlegm is a pathological product caused by failure of water metabolism. As soon as phlegm is formed, it interferes and blocks the normal flow of Qi. At the same time, it is pushed by Qi to travel through- out the body and cause different symptoms. Visible phlegm Phlegm can be easily observed when it accumulates in the Lung as it can be expectorated: • When there is no heat, the phlegm is white, sticky, thick or thin, present in large amounts and easy to expectorate. • When there is heat, the phlegm has a yellow or green coloration. Because heat consumes dampness, the phlegm becomes sticky and is difficult to expectorate. • When the Lung-Qi is unable to disperse and descend, coughing, wheezing and fullness in the chest often exist, sometimes accompanied by pain and a stifling sensation. • When the sinuses are filled with phlegm, symptoms often present as a blocked sensation and pain in the cheeks or over the forehead with a copious nasal discharge. • If phlegm blocks the throat, sticky, difficult-to- expectorate phlegm may occur, or plum-pit syndrome presents. • If phlegm accumulates in the stomach, there may be nausea and vomiting of fluid, phlegm and food, patients lose their appetite and feel fullness in the upper abdomen. • If the phlegm accumulates in the intestines, it presents as mucus or pus in the feces. Invisible phlegm Invisible phlegm can result in different symptoms: • If the phlegm is pushed by the rebellious Qi, moves upwards and disturbs the sensory orifices of the head, patients will have dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, deafness, a heavy sensation in the head, possible loss of consciousness, wind- stroke or epilepsy. • If phlegm obstructs the Heart, blocks the blood circulation and disturbs the mind, it causes palpitations, chest pain, restlessness, insomnia, depression, mental confusion, delirium and mania. • If phlegm obstructs the meridians and collaterals, blocks the blood circulation and Qi movement, some corresponding symptoms may occur in the local area: on the face, there may be deviation of the mouth and the eyes; in the limbs or the trunk, there will be a sensation of numbness, heaviness, tingling, cramp or twitch. • If phlegm accumulates over a long period of time, if combined with other pathogenic factors it can form masses and can present as different types of tumor. • When phlegm accumulates, a sticky tongue coating and a slippery and wiry pulse are the typical signs. In a cold-phlegm syndrome, a deep, wiry pulse can be felt as cold obstructs the Qi and blood; in a phlegm-heat syndrome, a rapid and forceful pulse can be felt as the Qi forcefully pushes the phlegm. (See Figure 9.1 on page 247 and Figure 9.2 on page 248.) Treatment principle: Expel, transform, dry and eliminate phlegm; regulate the function of the internal organs 236


5. Follow an appropriate diet: an appropriate diet to strengthen the Spleen-Qi as well as to reduce phlegm generation should be advised. Structure of the formula and selection of the herbs Chief: Dry dampness, clear heat and eliminate phlegm Ban Xia (pinelliae rhizoma), Ju Hong (Citri erythrocarpae pars rubra epicarpii) and Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) Ban Xia, Ju Hong and Chen Pi are the most com- monly used herbs to treat damp-phlegm no matter where it is located. Ban Xia is warm, pungent and poisonous, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. This herb is able to dry dampness and transform phlegm in the Middle-Jiao. When dampness is removed, the trans- portation function of the Spleen is recovered and phlegm is no longer generated. In the formulas that treat phlegm, Ban Xia is often selected as chief to dry and eliminate phlegm, as it particularly treats cough with a large amount of white sputum and tightness in the chest. Ban Xia can also effectively soothe the Stomach-Qi and transform damp-phlegm in the Stomach. It can relieve nausea, vomiting and fullness in the epigastria, and improve appetite. Since raw Ban Xia is poisonous, this herb is often used after processing. Ju Hong is fresh tangerine peel that has been dried and stored for up to 1 year. It is warm and pungent, and enters the Lung and Stomach merid- ians. Like Ban Xia, it can dry dampness and remove damp-phlegm. It is particularly used when there is a large amount of phlegm that can be easily expec- torated. Since Ban Xia and Ju Hong work via the same approach, they are often used together to enhance each other’s ability. Chen Pi is tangerine peel that has been dried and stored for more than a year. Its pungent and warm nature decreases with time, but it is excellent to move the Qi. It enters the Stomach and Spleen meridians. In the formula for removing phlegm, it is often selected to enhance the ability of Ban Xia to dry and eliminate phlegm. Its aromatic smell can soothe the Stomach-Qi and stimulate the Spleen to transform dampness. • Second, for treating damp-phlegm syndrome, bitter and warm herbs that can dry dampness, or sweet and bland herbs that can leach out dampness, are selected; for treating phlegm- heat syndrome, cold and moistening herbs that can dilute phlegm are selected. • Third, herbs that promote food digestion, purge the accumulation and regulate the Qi should be selected to assist the herbs that dissolve, dry and eliminate phlegm. • Herbs that clear heat or warm the interior can be used in the formula to treat phlegm-heat or damp-phlegm respectively. • Herbs that strengthen the Spleen are often used in chronic conditions to prevent the generation of phlegm. 1. pay attention to the Spleen: Dysfunction of the Spleen is considered the main source of phlegm generation. there is a saying in traditional Chinese medicine: Spleen is the generator of phlegm and the Lung is a container of the phlegm. 2. refer to other chapters and selections of herbs: In this chapter, the study emphasis is mainly on the accumulation of phlegm in the Spleen and the Lung. When phlegm exists in other regions and causes related symptoms and syndromes, the herbs in the other chapters should be consulted – for example, herbs that dissolve dampness, remove food stagnation, purge accumulation, transform dampness aromatically, treat Spleen deficiency, extinguish Liver-wind, calm the mind or open the orifices, as well as herbs that regulate the Qi. 3. avoid sweet and sour herbs when treating phlegm: as phlegm is an excess pathogenic factor, herbs that are sweet or sour in taste may retain dampness and phlegm, and should be avoided in a formula. 4. advance warning about uneasy sensations: Formulas that actively and intensively remove phlegm, especially invisible phlegm, may cause unpleasant feelings and sensations at the start of treatment because the phlegm is moving in the body. practitioners should therefore inform patients in advance. 237 Syndrome of phlegm and formula compositionChapter Chuan Bei Mu (Fritillariae cirrhosae bulbus), Zhe Bei Mu (Fritillariae thunbergii bulbus), Gua Lou (trichosanthis fructus), Gua Lou Ren (trichosanthis semen), Dan Nan Xing (pulvis arisaemae cum felle bovis) and Zhu Ru (Bambusae caulis in taeniam) These herbs are the most commonly used herbs to treat phlegm-heat. They are selected as chief in formulas to treat phlegm-heat syndrome. Bei Mu is divided into Chuan Bei Mu and Zhe Bei Mu. Both are bitter and cold, and enter the Lung and Heart meridians. They can transform phlegm- heat, dissipate nodules and treat cough with thick green sputum that is difficult to expectorate, as well as dryness in the mouth and nasal cavities. Chuan Bei Mu is also sweet but less cold than Zhe Bei Mu; thus it can moisten the Lung, transform phlegm and relieve cough. It is effective for treating phlegm-heat syndrome with signs of Lung-Yin or fluid deficiency. The symptoms are of a small amount of very sticky and thick sputum that is dif- ficult to expectorate. It is often used with herbs that nourish the body fluid to dilute the phlegm. Fur- thermore, this herb can dissipate thick phlegm and disperse the constrained Qi in the chest. If com- bined with herbs that spread the Liver-Qi, it can treat depression, plum-pit syndrome and nodules, which are caused by the obstruction of Qi and phlegm. Zhe Bei Mu is more bitter and colder than Chuan Bei Mu. It has no function in moistening the Lung, but is stronger in clearing heat and reducing fire, and is more suitable for treating severe phlegm-heat in the Lung. This herb is also stronger in breaking up congealed phlegm and dissipating nodules than Chuan Bei Mu. It can be selected to treat red, swollen and painful scrofula or abscesses. If com- bined with other herbs, it is used to treat tumors. Gua Lou and Gua Lou Ren are also frequently selected to treat phlegm-heat. They are sweet, bitter and cold, and enter the Lung, Stomach and Large Intestine meridians. Both can clear heat from the Lung, transform phlegm-heat and unbind the Qi in the chest. They are selected as chief to treat cough with a large amount of green sputum, distension, constriction and pain in the chest, and irritability. They can also be used for treating abscesses. The strong point of these herbs is that they can promote bowel movement and treat constipation, as well as accelerate the descending of Lung-Qi and remove phlegm-heat in the Lung. Comparing the functions of the two herbs, Gua Lou is stronger in clearing heat and transforming phlegm; Gua Lou Ren is stronger in moistening the intestines and promoting bowel movement. If combined with herbs that clear heat, Gua Lou Ren is effective for removing phlegm- heat from the intestines and for treating colitis and dysentery. When the powder of Tian Nan Xing (Arisaematis rhizoma) is processed with bovine bile, it is called Dan Nan Xing. Dan Nan Xing is bitter and cold. It is characterized by its ability to clear heat, eliminate phlegm, extinguish wind and calm spasm. It can effectively treat cough without phlegm or with scanty green sputum that is difficult to expectorate. Moreover, since it is particularly able to eliminate the invisible phlegm that covers the Heart and blocks the orifices, it can treat epilepsy and wind- stroke. Zhu Ru is slightly cold and enters the Lung, Stomach and Gall Bladder meridians. As well as clearing heat and transforming phlegm from the Lung, it can effectively disperse the constrained Qi, eliminate irritability and calm the mind. It is often selected in formulas that treat depression, anxiety and other mental disorders due to phlegm-heat dis- turbing the Heart, Gall Bladder and Stomach. It is also effective for soothing the Stomach-Qi, clearing heat and treating nausea and vomiting, such as morning sickness of early pregnancy, heatstroke, migraine and Ménière’s disease. Deputy: Eliminate phlegm from different organs and regions Shi Chang Pu (acori graminei rhizoma) and Yuan Zhi (polygalae radix) These herbs are able to remove damp-phlegm and phlegm-heat from the Heart meridian. Damp-phlegm may disturb or cover the Heart and cause mental disorders, which manifest as poor concentration, forgetfulness and difficulty with making decisions, a white and sticky tongue coating and a slippery pulse. Shi Chang Pu is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Heart and Stomach meridians. As its aromatic smell and pungent property can transform phlegm and open up the Heart orifice, it treats all these symptoms. Yuan Zhi is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Heart, Spleen and Lung meridians. It can stim- ulate the Heart-Yang and Qi, connect the Heart-Qi with the Kidney-Qi and remove the phlegm from 238


these meridians, thus improving concentration and memory. Shi Chang Pu and Yuan Zhi are often used together to enhance the ability to remove phlegm and open up the orifices. Tian Zhu Huang (Bambusae concretio silicea) and Zhu Li (Bambusae succus) These herbs are able to remove phlegm-heat from the Heart meridian. They are sweet and cold, and enter the Heart meridian. They have the functions of clearing heat and transforming phlegm. They are selected either as deputy or chief in formulas that remove phlegm-heat from the Heart. Zhu Li is colder than Tian Zhu Huang. It enters the Heart, Lung and Stomach meridians. It has a lubricating nature and its function is characterized by strongly eliminating phlegm-heat from the Heart and reviving the Heart-shen. It treats a syndrome where patients lose consciousness and have gurgling sounds in the throat, such as in epilepsy, cerebrovas cular accident and myocardial infarction. Zhu Li is also often used to treat conditions such as schizophrenia and anxiety when phlegm-heat disturbs the mind. Tian Zhu Huang enters the Heart and Liver meridians. It is effective in dislodging phlegm, clear- ing heat, cooling the Heart and controlling convul- sions. It is often used to reduce high fever, irritability and convulsions caused by disturbance of the Heart and Liver by phlegm-heat. In order to increase the strength of their action, they are often used in formulas with other herbs that transform phlegm or regulate the Qi, such as Tian Ma (Gastrodiae rhizoma)**, Yu Jin (Curcumae radix), Zhu Ru (Bambusae caulis in taeniam), Zhi Ke (Aurantii fructus), Zhi Shi (Aurantii fructus imma- turus) and Meng Shi (Lapis micae seu chloriti)*. They are also used with herbs that promote blood circulation and calm the mind, such as Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix), Hong Hua (Carthami flos), Hu Po (Succinum), Ci Shi (Magnetitum) and Zhen Zhu Mu (Concha margaritifera usta). Xuan Fu Hua (Inulae flos), Zi Su Zi (perillae fructus), Zi Su Ye (perillae folium), Zhu Ru (Bambusae caulis in taeniam), Pi Pa Ye (eriobotryae folium) and Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) These herbs can be selected as deputy to remove phlegm from the Stomach. As they soothe the Stomach-Qi, they can relieve nausea, vomiting, full- ness in the epigastria, reduced appetite and disten- sion in the abdomen. In most cases, patients have a sticky tongue coating and a rapid, wiry or slippery pulse. Xuan Fu Hua, Zi Su Zi and Zi Su Ye are warm in nature; they are particularly used for damp-phlegm syndrome. Zhu Ru, Pi Pa Ye and Huang Qin are cold in nature; they are used for phlegm-heat syndrome. Huo Xiang (agastachis herba), Bai Zhi (angelicae dahuricae radix) and Cang Er Zi (Xanthii fructus) These herbs are used particularly to transform phlegm and open the nose orifice. They are warm and aromatic. As they can effectively transform dampness and phlegm, and open the nose orifice, they are used for runny nose, blocked nose and loss of the sense of smell, such as in sinusitis. Hai Fu Shi (pumex), Hai Ge Ke (Meretricis/ Cyclinae concha) and Wa Leng Zi (arcae concha) These substances are able to moisten the Lung and loosen sputum, and are particularly suitable for treating scanty sputum caused by heat consuming the fluid in the Lung. They are selected in formulas when the main complaint is scanty sputum that is difficult to expectorate, or cough without phlegm. In this syndrome, the tongue is red with a thin, dry, yellow coating and the pulse is rapid and thready. In order to increase the therapeutic result, these herbs are often used with herbs that moisten the Lung and nourish the Lung-Yin, such as Sang Ye (Mori folium), Tian Hua Fen (Trichosanthis radix), Lu Gen (Phragmitis rhizoma), Bei Sha Shen (Gleh- niae radix) and Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix). Zi Wan (asteris radix), Kuan Dong Hua (tussilaginis farfarae) and Bai Bu (Stemonae radix) These three herbs are used to treat chronic cough with phlegm. All are slightly warm in nature and enter the Lung meridian. They can moisten the Lung, descend the Lung-Qi, transform phlegm and relieve cough. Although they are warm, pungent and bitter, they have no drying property. They can be used for treating different types of cough caused by either exterior or interior pathogenic factors, at the acute or chronic stage, in excess or deficiency condi- tions, or in a heat or cold syndrome. Comparing the functions of the three herbs, Zi Wan is the strongest to transform phlegm, Kuan 239 Syndrome of phlegm and formula compositionChapter Dong Hua is the most effective to relieve cough and Bai Bu is the one most commonly used to treat chronic cough. Zhi Nan Xing (processed arisaematis rhizoma), Bai Fu Zi (typhonii rhizoma praeparatum)*, Bai Jie Zi (Sinapis albae semen), Tian Zhu Huang (Bambusae concretio silicea), Zhu Li (Bambusae succus) and Tian Ma (Gastrodiae rhizoma)** These herbs are able to transform wind-phlegm and open up the meridians and collaterals. Zhi Nan Xing, the processed product of Tian Nan Xing, is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Lung, Spleen and Liver meridians. It has a very strong dispersing ability and can intensively dry dampness and dissolve damp-phlegm. It is also able to eliminate phlegm from the meridians and col- laterals and is used for syndromes of wind-phlegm obstruction in the meridians, which manifests as numbness, heaviness and tingling of the limbs, such as in arthritis, facial paralysis and facial spasm. Bai Fu Zi is another important herb to eliminate wind-phlegm. It is pungent, sweet, very hot and very poisonous. It has a strong ascending ability and can expel wind, remove phlegm and dry dampness. It is used for headache, migraine, deviation of the tongue, facial paralysis or cramp due to the obstruction of phlegm in the meridians and collaterals. Bai Jie Zi is warm in nature and enters the Lung meridian. It is pungent and dispersing, spreads the Qi, expels cold-phlegm and reduces swelling of the joints, muscles and subcutaneous region. It treats numbness, stiffness, cramping and pain of the muscles and joints. Tian Zhu Huang enters the Heart and Liver meridians, and is effective in dislodging phlegm, clearing heat, cooling the Heart and controlling con- vulsions. It is often used for childhood disorders when there is high fever, irritability, convulsions and night crying caused by disturbance of the Heart and Liver by phlegm-heat. Zhu Li enters the Heart, Lung and Stomach meridians. It can strongly eliminate phlegm-heat, especially when the phlegm blocks the Heart merid- ians and collaterals. It is used to treat numbness, tingling or cramp of the limbs in epilepsy, hemiple- gia and facial paralysis. Tian Ma can expel wind. It is sweet and neutral, and can extinguish internal wind as well as expel external wind. Since it has a moderate and moist nature, it is widely used in different types of wind- phlegm syndrome. It can be selected to treat dizzi- ness with nausea and vomiting caused by disturbance of wind-phlegm. It is effective for calming spasms and convulsions from high fever. Together with herbs that promote the Qi movement and blood circulation, it can be used to treat stiff, painful, numb and tingling limbs, such as in Bi syndrome, or the sequelae of cerebrovascular accident, dementia and Parkinson’s disease. Except for Zhu Li and Tain Zhu Huang, all the other herbs are warm and pungent in nature. As Tian Nan Xin and Bai Fu Zi are very warm, pungent and poisonous, dosages and processing procedures should be carefully monitored. In formulas to treat phlegm obstruction of the meridians and collaterals, they are often used with herbs that regulate the Qi and blood, expel wind-dampness and extinguish internal wind. Hai Zao (Sargassum) and Kun Bu (eckloniae thallus) These herbs are used for transforming phlegm, sof- tening hardness and dissipating nodules. They are salty and cold, and enter the Liver, Lung and Kidney meridians. As both can clear heat, transform phlegm, soften hardness and dissipate nodules, they are often used together in formulas to treat nodules, such as goiter and scrofula. Comparing the functions of these two herbs, Hai Zao is stronger in transforming phlegm and dissipat- ing nodules, and is suitable to treat soft masses, such as goiter and scrofula. Kun Bu is stronger in soften- ing hardness and reducing congealed blood, and is more suitable to treat hard masses, such as hepat- osplenomegaly, cirrhosis of the liver and tumors. To enhance their therapeutic effect, they are used with other herbs that also have the function of softening hardness to dissipate nodules, such as Mu Li (Ostrea concha), Huang Yao Zi (Dioscoreae bulb- iferae rhizoma), Zhe Bei Mu (Fritillariae thunbergii bulbus), Xia Ku Cao (Prunellae spica) and Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix). Assistant: Regulate the Qi, eliminate dampness, promote digestion, enhance the ability of the chief from different approaches Jie Geng (platycodi radix) and Xing Ren (armeniacae semen) Jie Geng and Xing Ren both enter the Lung merid- ian. They are often selected as assistants to regulate the Lung-Qi so as to eliminate phlegm. In addition, 240


they can effectively relieve cough, a direct symptom of phlegm obstruction in the Lung. Jie Geng is pungent, bitter and neutral. It is able to transform phlegm and stop cough. As it is light in weight and in nature, its function is characterized by ascending the Lung-Qi gently but sufficiently. Xing Ren is bitter, warm and slightly poisonous. As it can descend the Lung-Qi, disperse the accu- mulation of phlegm and the stagnation of Qi, it can stop cough. It contains oil, which gives this herb a moist nature. Comparing Jie Geng and Xing Ren, one moves upwards and the other moves downwards; one dis- perses the Lung-Qi and the other descends the Lung-Qi. They match each other perfectly to regu- late the Lung-Qi, eliminate phlegm and relieve cough, hence they are often used together in formu- las to treat damp-phlegm. Ting Li Zi (Lepidii/Descurainiae semen) and Sang Bai Pi (Mori cortex) Ting Li Zi and Sang Bai Pi are cold and enter the Lung meridian. They are able to direct the Lung-Qi downwards, eliminate phlegm and accumulated water, and therefore reduce obstruction of the Lung-Qi and arrest wheezing. They are used together to treat conditions where there is coughing, wheezing, fullness in the chest, edema and difficult urination. Ting Li Zi is very pungent, bitter and cold, and is much stronger than Sang Bai Pi in directing the Lung-Qi downwards and draining water. It is more suitable for treating the excess syndromes of phlegm and water accumulation in the Lung. It also enters the Large Intestine meridian and can drain heat, water and phlegm via bowel movement. However, since Ting Li Zi is a harsh, cold herb and easily injures the Qi, it is only used in excess syndromes for a short time. Sang Bai Pi is sweet, bland and cold. It can clear heat and leach out dampness without the side effect of Yin consumption. As Sang Bai Pi is gentler than Ting Li Zi in directing the Qi downwards and elim- inating the accumulation of water and phlegm, it has fewer side effects and can be used for a longer period of time. Bai Qian (Cynanchi stauntonii radix) and Qian Hu (peucedani radix) Bai Qian and Qian Hu are pungent in nature and enter the Lung meridian. They are effective for relieving cough and have the ability to disperse and descend the Lung-Qi. They are often selected as assistants to treat fullness in the chest, cough and wheezing due to obstruction of the Lung-Qi. Bai Qian is a warm herb and its action of descending the Lung-Qi is stronger than that of Qian Hu. It is suitable to treat damp-phlegm syndrome. Qian Hu is cold in nature and is more suitable to clear heat in the Lung and treat phlegm-heat syndrome. Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex), Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium), Mu Xiang (aucklandiae radix)**, Sha Ren (amomi xanthioidis fructus), Zhi Shi (aurantii fructus immaturus), Zhi Ke (aurantii fructus) and Xiang Fu (Cyperi rhizoma) These herbs can regulate the Qi of the Lung, Stomach, Spleen and San Jiao and therefore can be selected in formulas as assistants to enhance the ability of herbs that remove phlegm. Hou Po is bitter, pungent and warm, and enters the Spleen, Stomach, Lung and Large Intestine meridians. It can descend the Qi, dissipate the obstruction of phlegm and dry dampness. It can be selected in formulas to remove phlegm as it can effectively reduce the distension in the Upper-, Middle- and Lower-Jiao, and enhance the ability of the chief to remove damp-phlegm. Chen Pi, Mu Xiang and Sha Ren are all aromatic herbs and warm in nature. They can promote diges- tion and Qi movement and reduce distension. Chen Pi is particularly selected for treating Qi obstruction in the Stomach; Mu Xiang is for stagnation in the intestines and Liver; and Sha Ren is for Qi obstruc- tion in the Large Intestine. Zhi Shi is cold and has a bitter taste. It moves downwards. It has an intensive action of opening the obstruction of the Qi, breaking up the accumula- tions of Qi, blood, food or phlegm, and can also promote bowel movement. In formulas that elimi- nate phlegm, this herb is often used when the Qi is obstructed and bowel movement is difficult. It is also used to treat constipation. Zhi Ke is cold in nature and its function of regu- lating the Qi is gentle and slow. It moves horizon- tally in the Upper- and Middle-Jiao. It is very often used as assistant in formulas that eliminate phlegm to open up the Qi obstruction in the chest, stomach and hypochondria. Xiang Fu is a very commonly used herb to regu- late the Liver-Qi. It is pungent, sweet, slightly bitter 241 Syndrome of phlegm and formula compositionChapter and warm, and enters the Liver and San Jiao merid- ians. Xiang Fu is an effective and gentle herb to regulate Qi. It is warm and pungent without a harsh or drying nature. It promotes Liver-Qi movement without the likelihood of injuring the Yin and blood. As it is somewhat bitter, it can reduce the slight Liver-heat that is generated by Liver-Qi stagnation. The sweetness can soften the Liver and moderate the speed of the Qi movement. Because it enters the San Jiao meridian that is the passage of the Qi and water, it can effectively spread the Qi in the entire body. Shi Gao (Gypsum) and Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) Shi Gao and Huang Qin can reduce heat from the Lung and relieve fire-toxin so as to clear excess heat from the Lung. In phlegm-heat syndrome, when the heat is strong and the herbs that remove phlegm- heat are not sufficient to clear the heat, Shi Gao and Huang Qin should be used. Shi Gao is pungent, sweet and very cold, and enters the Stomach and Lung meridians. It can clear heat and disperse the constrained Qi and fire. It has another strong point in that it can protect the body fluids from excess heat in the Stomach and Lung as the sweet and cold nature can generate Yin. Huang Qin is bitter and cold, and enters the Lung and Large Intestine meridians. It can dry dampness and clear heat. It is especially suitable to be selected when there is damp-heat in the Lung and Large Intestine. Xi Xin (asari herba)*, Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma) and Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) These herbs are all warm in nature and may be used in formulas to treat cold-phlegm, which mani- fests as thin sputum, a cool sensation in the throat when the phlegm is expectorated, cold limbs and a fear of cold. Xi Xin is very hot and primarily enters the Kidney meridian. It can warm the interior, disperse the accumulated fluid and treat cold-phlegm due to Yang deficiency of the Kidney and Lung. Gan Jiang can warm the Spleen and treat damp-phlegm due to Spleen-Yang deficiency and Sheng Jiang can warm the Stomach and disperse the water accumulation there. Cang Zhu (atractylodis rhizoma), Bai Zhu (atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma), Fu Ling (poria), Ze Xie (alismatis rhizoma) and Yi Yi Ren (Coicis semen) Cang Zhu and Bai Zhu are pungent and warm, and can effectively dry the dampness. Cang Zhu is warmer and more pungent than Bai Zhu, and is better selected for a severe damp-phlegm syndrome. Bai Zhu is characterized by tonifying the Spleen-Qi and drying the dampness, and is a perfect choice for a chronic damp-phlegm syndrome. The other three herbs are able to leach out damp- ness and promote urination. They can be selected in the formula to assist the chief and deputy herbs to remove damp-phlegm. Among these herbs, Fu Ling is neutral and can gently tonify the Spleen-Qi; Ze Xie and Yi Yi Ren are cold and are more suitable for treating phlegm-heat syndrome. Since all these herbs eliminate dampness, they should be used with caution in patients who suffer from constipation or other disorders caused by heat or dryness. Jiao Mai Ya (deep-fried hordei fructus germinatus), Jiao Shen Qu (deep-fried Massa medicata fermentata), Jiao Shan Zha (deep-fried Crataegi fructus), Zhi Shi (aurantii fructus immaturus) and Da Huang (rhei rhizoma) These herbs can be selected to aid digestion. Poor digestion is often a cause of phlegm generation. Removing food accumulation is a strategy to remove phlegm accumulation in the Middle-Jiao. In addi- tion, if phlegm has accumulated in the Middle- Jiao, food digestion is often disturbed too, especially among children whose digestive function has not yet fully developed. Herbs that promote digestion can therefore be chosen as assistant in the formulas. Deep-fried Mai Ya, Shen Qu and Shan Zha can aid digestion of starchy food, alcohol, protein and fat respectively, and they are often used together. Zhi Shi can regulate the Qi and remove phlegm, as well as promote bowel movement. Da Huang can purge the accumulation intensively from the intestines. A small dosage of Da Huang can promote digestion. Both Zhi Shi and Da Huang can enhance herbs that remove phlegm from the Spleen and intestines. 242


Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix), Bai Zhu (atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) and Huang Qi (astragali radix) These herbs are applied to directly tonify the Spleen. To treat a chronic condition of phlegm syndrome, herbs that tonify the Spleen-Qi are often used to strengthen the functions of transportation and trans- formation of the Spleen. Dang Shen is sweet and neutral, and enters the Spleen and Lung meridians. It is an effective and gentle herb for treating Spleen-Qi deficiency in chronic conditions. Bai Zhu is warmer than Dang Shen but is bitter. The strong point of this herb is that it can either tonify the Qi or dry dampness. It can also treat the cause and manifestations of phlegm. It is often selected to treat damp-phlegm syndrome. Huang Qi can strongly tonify and ascend the Spleen-Qi and strengthen the muscles. It is there- fore effective in treating tiredness and heaviness of the body. The only side effect of this herb is that it can keep dampness inside the body due to its tonify- ing, stabilizing and ascending actions. It should be used in the formula with other herbs that remove phlegm. Lu Gen (phragmitis rhizoma), Bai Mao Gen (Imperatae rhizoma) and Tian Hua Fen (trichosanthis radix) This group of herbs is particularly used to nourish the fluid and dilute scanty phlegm, which is caused by fluid deficiency in the Lung. They are cold in nature and enter the Lung meridian. They can clear heat, nourish the fluid and moisten the dryness of the Lung, thus diluting the phlegm. Lu Gen can transform pus; Bai Mao Gen is able to cool the blood and stop bleeding; Tian Hua Fen is able to nourish the fluid of the Stomach. All are used at the late stage or during the recovery period of febrile diseases, such as acute bronchitis or influ- enza. Moreover, as these herbs do not have a cloying nature, they do not have the same side effects as the Yin tonifying herbs. Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus), Bai Guo (Ginkgo semen) and Wu Mei (Mume fructus) These herbs can stabilize the Lung-Qi. They have a sour taste and are only used in conditions where the Qi of the Lung disperses excessively, such as in severe wheezing, cough and asthma. Since the sour taste may retain phlegm and make the syndrome more difficult to treat, these herbs should be used in a small dosage and in a well-organized formula. Envoy: Guide herbs entering the involved region Jie Geng (platycodi radix) Jie Geng is light in weight and nature, and can dis- perse and ascend the Lung-Qi. It is often used as envoy to guide other herbs in the formula entering the Lung and removing phlegm there. Examples of classical formulas Er Chen Tang (Two-Cured Decoction) Source: Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) 15 g Ju Hong (Citri erythrocarpae pars rubra epicarpii) 15 g Fu Ling (Poria) 9 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 5 g Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) 3 g Wu Mei (Mume fructus) 1 piece Analysis of the formula This formula can dry dampness, transform phlegm, regulate the Qi and harmonize the Middle-Jiao. It is used for treating damp-phlegm accumulation in the Lung and Stomach. The manifestations are cough with white sputum that is easily expectorated, dis- tension and a stifling sensation in the chest and upper abdomen, dizziness, palpitations, nausea or vomiting, a flabby tongue with a white, thick, sticky coating and a slippery pulse. In this formula: • Ban Xia is used as chief. It is pungent and warm, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. It can particularly dry dampness and eliminate phlegm, as well as soothe the Stomach-Qi and relieve fullness and nausea in the stomach. 243 Syndrome of phlegm and formula compositionChapter • The deputy is Ju Hong. As it can aromatically transform dampness and regulate the Qi in the Middle- and Upper-Jiao, it can strengthen the function of the chief to remove damp-phlegm. • Fu Ling is the assistant. It can promote urination so as to leach out dampness. It can also strengthen the Spleen-Qi and thus reduce the formation of phlegm. • Sheng Jiang is also an assistant. It can help Ban Xia and Ju Hong to disperse and dissolve phlegm, soothe the Stomach-Qi and promote digestion. It is used as a corrective assistant because it can reduce the toxin from Ban Xia. • Another corrective assistant is Wu Mei. On the one hand, it can stabilize the Lung-Qi that has been dispersed excessively due to obstruction of phlegm in the Lung; on the other hand, it can reduce the dispersing action of the pungent and warm herbs in the formula and make the formula more balanced. • Zhi Gan Cao is sweet in nature and enters the Spleen meridian. It is used as envoy to harmonize the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, each herb has its own specific function. Using different approaches, they reach the goal of removing damp-phlegm. • In practice, Zhi Gan Cao and Wu Mei can be removed from the formula as sweet and sour may generate and retain dampness and phlegm in the body. • It is a balanced and well-organized formula that shows the main procedures and strategies for eliminating damp-phlegm. It is therefore considered to be the principal formula for treating phlegm. Qing Qi Hua Tan Wan (Clear the Qi and Transform Phlegm Pill) Source: Yin Fang Kao Dan Nan Xing (Pulvis arisaemae cum felle bovis) 45 g Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) 30 g Gua Lou Ren (Trichosanthis semen) 30 g Zhi Shi (Aurantii fructus immaturus) 30 g Analysis of the formula This formula can clear heat and transform phlegm, regulate the Qi and stop cough. It is used for treat- ing phlegm-heat accumulation in the Lung, which leads to Qi obstruction. The manifestations are cough with yellow sticky sputum that is difficult to expectorate, fullness in the chest and distension in the upper abdomen, scanty urine, difficulty in breathing in a severe case, a red tongue with a yellow sticky coating and a slippery and rapid pulse. In this formula: • Dan Nan Xing, which is bitter and cold, is used as chief. It can directly clear heat and dissolve the phlegm so as to treat the main complaints. • Among the deputies, Huang Qin and Gua Lou Ren can clear heat and remove phlegm-heat respectively. Zhi Shi and Chen Pi can regulate the Qi and remove phlegm. Gua Long Ren and Zhi Shi can descend the Qi in the Large Intestine and promote bowel movement, thereby accelerating the Lung-Qi to move properly in order to actively eliminate phlegm. In this way, the fullness in the Lung and Stomach can also be reduced. • There are three assistants. Xing Ren and Ban Xia can disperse and descend the Lung-Qi and remove phlegm. They can enhance the ability of promoting bowel movement. Fu Ling can strengthen the Spleen-Qi and leach out dampness by promoting urination. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, most herbs enter the Lung meridian, have descending properties and can directly remove phlegm-heat from the Lung. • Moreover, some herbs enter the Large Intestine meridian, can descend the Qi and promote bowel movement in order to enhance the herbs that descend the Qi of the Lung and remove phlegm. This strategy regulates the function of the Lung. • Some herbs have a dispersing function. They can enhance the herbs that descend the Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) 30 g Fu Ling (Poria) 30 g Xing Ren (Armeniacae semen) 30 g Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) 45 g 244


Lung-Qi as they make the Qi movement in the Lung more active. In this way, the heat and phlegm can be removed properly. • Only a few herbs in this formula reduce heat. As soon as the phlegm is removed and the Qi moves freely in the Lung, the heat is also reduced. • The herbs in this formula demonstrate several approaches of treating phlegm-heat, e.g. eliminating phlegm-heat, clearing heat, descending the Qi and drying dampness. Bei Mu Gua Lou San (Fritillaria and Trichosanthes Fruit Powder) Source: Yi Xue Xin Wu – Tian Hua Fen is sour and sweet, slightly bitter and cold. These properties bring the actions of clearing heat, generating the fluid and moistening the Lung so as to dilute the phlegm. – Ju Hong and Jie Gen can directly remove phlegm and stop cough. – Fu Ling tonifies the Spleen-Qi and leaches out the dampness. Commentary on strategies • This formula shows the approaches of eliminating phlegm by using herbs that clear heat and moisten the Lung instead of using pungent and warm herbs. • Moreover, Bei Mu, Gua Lou and Tian Hua Fen are used to moisten the Lung instead of sweet and cold herbs to nourish the Yin, which may keep the phlegm from its rich and cloying nature. Ling Gan Wu Wei Jiang Xin Tang (Poria, Licorice, Schisandra, Ginger and Asarum Decoction) Source: Jin Gui Yao Lue Chuan Bei Mu (Fritillariae cirrhosae bulbus) 5 g Gua Lou (Trichosanthis fructus) 3 g Tian Hua Fen (Trichosanthis radix) 2.5 g Ju Hong (E Citri erythrocarpae pars rubra epicarpii) 2.5 g Fu Ling (Poria) 2.5 g Jie Geng (Platycodi radix) 2.5 g Analysis of the formula This formula can moisten the dryness of the Lung, clear heat, dilute phlegm and stop cough. It is used for treating dry-phlegm syndrome of the Lung, which is caused by exterior dryness or heat. The main symptoms and signs are scanty phlegm that is very difficult to expectorate, dry throat, a dry and red tongue with a thin, sticky, yellowish coating, and a thready, wiry and rapid pulse. In this formula: • Chuan Bei Mu is used as chief. It is pungent, bitter and slightly cold, and enters the Lung meridian. It can clear heat, moisten the Lung, eliminate the phlegm and stop cough, so it acts directly against the main symptoms. • The deputy is Gua Lou. Its functions are similar to those of Bei Mu but it also can regulate the Qi and reduce the fullness. It enhances the function of the chief. • The assistants can be divided into three groups: Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma) 9 g Xi Xin (Asari herba)* 6 g Fu Ling (Poria) 12 g Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) 6 g Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) 6 g Analysis of the formula This formula can warm the Lung and transform the cold-phlegm. It is used for treating accumulation of cold-phlegm in the Lung. The manifestations are cough with a large amount of thin, watery or white phlegm, an uncomfortable sensation in the chest, a white and moist tongue coating and a wiry and slip- pery pulse. In this formula: • Gan Jiang and Xi Yin are chosen as chief to warm the interior, especially the Spleen and 245 Syndrome of phlegm and formula compositionChapter Kidney respectively to accelerate water metabolism and dissolve the accumulation of water and cold-phlegm in the Lung. • Fu Ling is used as deputy in a reasonably large dosage to leach out dampness directly by increasing urination. • Wu Wei Zi is a corrective assistant. Since it stabilizes the Lung-Qi, it protects the Yin and fluid, which can be consumed by the hot herbs. • Gan Cao is also used as assistant to protect and strengthen the Middle-Jiao. It is additionally used as envoy to harmonize the herbs in the formula that work on different aspects and in different directions. Commentary on strategies • Although there are only five herbs in this formula, each of them has a specific function and demonstrates one procedure of treating phlegm in the Lung. • This formula demonstrates two approaches to removing cold-phlegm from the Lung – to warm the interior and to dissolve phlegm. • As all the herbs are strong, effective and active, it is not necessary to use extra herbs to regulate the Qi. This formula clearly shows the composition style of Dr Zhang Zhong Jing. Ding Xian Wan (Arrest Seizures Pill) Source: Yi Xue Xin Wu Tian Ma (Gastrodiae rhizoma)** 30 g Chuan Bei Mu (Fritillariae cirrhosae bulbus) 30 g Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) 30 g Fu Ling (Poria) 30 g Fu Shen (Poriae cocos pararadicis) 30 g Dan Nan Xing (Pulvis arisaemae cum felle bovis) 15 g Quan Xie (Scorpio)* 15 g Jiang Can (Bombyx batrycatus) 15 g Hu Po (Succinum) 15 g Deng Xin Cao (Junci medulla) 15 g Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) 20 g Yuan Zhi (Polygalae radix) 20 g Shi Chang Pu (Acori graminei rhizoma) 15 g Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix) 60 g †An alternative name for Zhu Sha is Chen Sha. Analysis of the formula This formula can eliminate phlegm, extinguish wind and open the orifice. It is devised for treating epi- lepsy due to wind-phlegm. Epilepsy usually occurs when phlegm is present in the body. The phlegm is generated by inappropriate diet, disturbed functions of the internal organs and disturbed emotions. Under acute stress, the Liver-Qi stagnates and rises. The Qi and phlegm attack the Heart and block its orifice. The manifestations are vertigo and a stifling sensation in the chest, followed by suddenly falling down, loss of consciousness, convulsions, spitting up mucus with a loud, raspy sound from the throat, a white and sticky tongue coating and a wiry and slip- pery pulse. In this formula: • Dan Nan Xing and Tian Ma are used as chief as they particularly eliminate and diminish wind-phlegm. • Zhu Li is also used as chief because it can effectively remove phlegm in the collaterals and open the Heart orifice. • The pungent and warm Sheng Jiang Zhi, Ban Xia and Chen Pi can transform phlegm; Chuan Bei Mu can break up phlegm accumulation. They are used as deputies and enhance the ability of Zhu Li to open the Heart orifice. • Yuan Zhi and Shi Chang Pu can eliminate phlegm and thus connect the Heart and Kidney and revive the Heart. There are a number of assistants which enhance the ability of the chief herbs from different aspects and restore the normal function of the Heart: • Jiang Can and Quan Xie open up the collaterals, extinguish wind and calm convulsions. • Mai Men Dong nourishes the Yin of the Heart. • Dan Shen regulates the blood, removes congealed blood in the collaterals and the Heart meridian, where congealed blood often resides, Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) 60 g Zhu Sha† (Cinnabaris)* 9 g Zhu Li (Bambusae succus) 1 cup (100 ml) Sheng Jiang Zhi (Zingiberis rhizoma recens succus) 1 cup (50 ml) Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) 120 g 246


especially in recurrent attacks. Together with Mai Men Dong, Dan Shen can sufficiently regulate the blood. • Fu Ling and Deng Xin Cao leach out dampness, eliminating phlegm in an indirect way. • Gan Cao and Fu Shen calm the mind. • Hu Po and Zhu Sha sedate the Heart-shen. • Gan Cao is used as both assistant and envoy. As assistant, it reduces the side effects of the harsh herbs and moderates their speed; as envoy, it harmonizes the substances in the formula. Commentary on strategies The composition of this formula shows several inter- esting strategies to treat wind-phlegm. • First, it focuses on phlegm and wind, the two main factors in a seizure attack, and on two groups of herbs selected to eliminate phlegm and extinguish wind, and which can specifically enter or work on the collaterals. • Second, special attention is paid to the Heart. Although the Liver is obviously involved in the attack, and Liver-Qi stagnation and wind are present, the Heart is the organ where the Shen resides and this controls all activities while patients are conscious. When patients suddenly lose consciousness, this suggests that the Heart- shen is disturbed. Herbs that particularly remove phlegm from the Heart and open the Heart orifice should be used. The substances that sedate the Heart-shen, calm the mind and regulate the Qi, blood and Yin of the Heart should also be used. • Third, the processing procedures of the herbs are essential in order to reach a maximal therapeutic effect and minimal side effects: Ban Xia is processed by Sheng Jiang Zhi to reduce its toxic effect and increase its dispersing capacity; Quan Xie, Jiang Can and Yuan Zhi are processed by Gan Cao to reduce their toxic, harsh properties; Zhu Sha is ground with water and used as a coating for the pill, reducing the toxic action sufficiently to treat this stubborn and severe condition. • Furthermore, the administration order is careful and clear. All the herbs are ground to a fine powder and cooked with 120 g Gan Cao, to which is added 100 ml Zhu Li and 50 ml Sheng Jiang Zhi. When it becomes a paste, small pills can be made and eventually coated with Zhu Sha. Patients take one pill (6 g) twice a day. Hai Zao Yu Hu Tang (Sargassum Decoction for the Jade Flask) Source: Yi Zong Jin Jian Hai Zao (Sargassum) 3 g Kun Bu (Eckloniae thallus) 3 g Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) 3 g Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) 3 g Qing Pi (Citri reticulatae viride pericarpium) 3 g Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus) 3 g Zhe Bei Mu (Fritillariae thunbergii bulbus) 3 g Dang Gui (Angelicae sinensis radix) 3 g Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma) 3 g Du Huo (Angelicae pubescentis radix) 3 g Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) 3 g Hai Dai (Laminariae japonicae herba) 1.5 g Analysis of the formula This formula can transform phlegm, soften masses, and reduce and dissipate goiter. It is used for treat- ing goiter, which is considered to be an accumula- tion of phlegm, dampness and blood due to disharmony of the functions of the Spleen and Liver. The manifestations are immovable masses in the front of the neck. There is no pain and the skin color is not changed. In the formula: • Hai Zao, Kun Bu and Hai Dai are the chief substances. They eliminate phlegm and soften the masses directly. • Ban Xia and Zhe Bei Mu are the deputies. They eliminate phlegm and dissipate masses, thus enhancing the ability of the chief substances. • The assistants help to remove the stagnation. – Chen Pi and Qing Pi promote the Qi movement of the Spleen and Liver respectively. – Dang Gui and Chuan Xiong regulate the blood and dissipate the blood stagnation. – The pungent and warm Du Huo is used to disperse dampness. 247 Syndrome of phlegm and formula compositionChapter – Lian Qiao, with its pungent and aromatic properties, can disperse stagnation and accumulation, but is used here principally for clearing the heat that is produced by the stagnation as it is a cold herb. – Gan Cao is used as both assistant and envoy to protect the Spleen from the action of the reducing herbs, and to harmonize the formula. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, herbs are clearly organized in groups to eliminate phlegm, soften hardness and regulate Qi and blood. • Moreover, the salty and pungent substances are preferred as they have stronger actions of eliminating phlegm and dispersing the stagnation so as to reduce the masses.

## Syndrome of Qi stagnation

<!-- chunk -->

## and formula composition


Qi is one of the essential substances of the body and is also the sign of life because Qi moves con- stantly and smoothly in the body and promotes the physiological functions of the internal organs. In a pathological condition, the movement of Qi can be obstructed; the Qi then stagnates, and even moves in an opposite direction, which causes different symptoms. The characteristic of the syndrome of Qi stagna- tion is distension in the affected region. The quality of distension is determined by the degree of stagna- tion; generally speaking, fullness exists in a mild case, distension is seen in an advanced case and pain occurs in a severe condition. The syndrome of Qi stagnation varies according to the affected organs and regions: • If the Lung-Qi stagnates, the symptoms are breathlessness, stifling in the chest, cough and wheezing. • If the Stomach-Qi and Spleen-Qi stagnate, the manifestations are fullness and distension of the entire abdomen, reduced appetite, belching, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and irregular bowel movement. • If the Liver-Qi stagnates, the symptoms are hypochondriac distension and pain, pain in the lower abdomen and the lateral sides of the abdomen, irritability, depression, distension and pain in the breasts, and irregular menstruation. • If the Qi stagnates in the meridians, the main symptoms are stiffness, heaviness, numbness or tingling of the limbs in the affected regions, or migrating pain in the limbs. Stagnation of Qi is often caused by emotional dis- turbance and accumulation of internal cold, heat, phlegm, water and food. It also occurs in trauma and stagnation of blood. The compositions of the formulas that regulate the Qi have the following characteristics:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Herbs with a pungent and warm nature are

selected because pungency possesses a moving capacity and warmth may activate the Qi movement.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Herbs that enter the Liver, Spleen, Stomach,

Large Intestine and Lung meridians are often used because these organs directly influence the Qi movement of the body.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Herbs that remove different obstructions in

order to promote the Qi movement are used, such as herbs that eliminate phlegm, remove food stagnation, promote bowel movement, transform dampness, warm the interior, clear heat and release the exterior. Although Qi moves in every organ of the body, the Liver, Spleen, Stomach, Large Intestine and Lung directly influence Qi movement. As the syn- dromes of Qi stagnation are more often seen in these organs, in this chapter the syndromes and composi- tions of formulas are introduced particularly for these organs.


1. Caution during pregnancy, heavy menstruation or in bleeding conditions: Since the formulas can activate the blood circulation as well as the Qi movement, they can make the bleeding heavier or may cause miscarriage in early pregnancy. 2. Caution in conditions of Yin deficiency: Formulas that regulate Qi contain many pungent and warm herbs and they easily injure the Yin and body fluids. patients with Yin deficiency should not use these formulas in large dosage or for a very long period of time.

## stagnation

Main symptoms Distension (even pain) in hypochondria and lateral sides of the lower abdomen, stiffness of the muscles and tendons, especially of the neck, shoulders and back, irregular menstruation, easily irritated, restlessness, dream-disturbed sleep and depression . Secondary symptoms Fullness in the chest, hoarseness, cough, distension in the stomach, obviously reduced or increased appetite, belching, nausea, vomiting, difficult urination, difficult bowel movement or diarrhea, dysmenorrhea, irregular menstruation . Tongue Normal, slightly pale, red or purple, with a white coating or a sticky coating if accompanied by accumulation of dampness, food or phlegm . Pulse Wiry, or wiry and thready if accompanied by blood or Yin deficiency . 251 Syndrome of Qi stagnation and formula compositionChapter Associated disorders in western medicine Dysmenorrhea, irregular menstruation, premen- strual syndrome and menopause syndrome, hepati- tis, peptic ulcer, duodenal ulcer, irritable bowel syndrome, colitis, cholecystitis and depression. Analysis of the syndrome The Liver is considered to be a very important organ for Qi movement throughout the entire body. The Liver-Qi moves freely through the San Jiao passage, promotes the Qi movement of all the other organs and accelerates their physiological functions. Patho- logically, movement of the Liver-Qi can be disturbed by different factors, such as emotional disturbance, especially stress, anger and frustration, which can directly cause the stagnation. • When the Liver-Qi is stagnant, patients usually lose their amiable manner and show symptoms such as irritability, quick temper, high tension of muscles and depression. In addition, distension and pain often occur in the hypochondriac region and lateral sides of the lower abdomen. • Since the Liver houses the Hun (soul), patients may suffer from insomnia and dream-disturbed sleep when the Liver-Qi is stagnant. • When the Liver-Qi and Liver-blood both stagnate, dysmenorrhea or irregular menstruation may appear. • Stagnation of the Liver-Qi shows in a normal or slightly pale tongue with a white coating and a wiry pulse. Once the Liver-Qi stagnates, it easily overacts or insults the other organs. • When the Liver-Qi attacks the Spleen and Stomach, fullness, distension of the abdomen and obviously reduced or increased appetite may occur. In a severe condition where the Stomach-Qi cannot descend, belching, nausea and vomiting may present. When the Spleen-Qi fails to ascend, difficult bowel movement or diarrhea may occur. • If the Liver-Qi attacks the Lung, shortness of breath, hoarseness and cough may start. • When the Liver-Qi blocks the San Jiao passage, there may be difficult urination. • If the Liver-Qi affects the Heart, restlessness and insomnia take place. (See Figure 10.1 on page 269.) Treatment principle: Regulate Liver- Qi; nourish Liver-Yin and Liver- blood; harmonize Qi movement of other involved organs Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Spread the Liver-Qi Xiang Fu (Cyperi rhizoma) and Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) Xiang Fu is a very commonly used herb to regulate the Liver-Qi. It is pungent, sweet, slightly bitter and warm, and enters the Liver and San Jiao meridians. Xiang Fu is an effective and gentle herb to regulate Qi. It is warm and pungent without a harsh and drying nature. It promotes the Liver-Qi movement without the side effect of injuring the Yin and blood of the Liver. As it is somewhat bitter, it can reduce the slight Liver-heat that is generated by the Liver- Qi stagnation. The sweetness can soften the Liver and moderate the speed of the Qi movement. All these characteristics match the pathological changes 252


in the syndrome of Liver-Qi stagnation. Because it enters the San Jiao meridian that is the passage of the Qi and water, it can effectively spread the Qi in the entire body. Since Xiang Fu is gentle and effective in regulat- ing the Liver-Qi, it is often selected in formulas for treating both excess and deficiency syndromes that are associated with Liver-Qi stagnation. Chai Hu is another commonly used herb to reg- ulate the Liver-Qi, and it is a gentle herb too. Unlike Xiang Fu, it is pungent and neutral. It has the func- tion of dispersing and ascending the Liver-Qi rather than promoting the circulation of the Liver-Qi. It is particularly suitable for use as chief in formulas to treat constraint of the Liver-Qi, such as in stress, depression with anger and frustration, and chronic Liver and Gall Bladder diseases. Since it has an upward-moving tendency, it should be used with caution when treating syndromes where Qi, fire or Yang of the Liver move upwards, as it can easily cause headache or dizziness. Qing Pi (Citri reticulatae viride pericarpium), Chuan Lian Zi (toosendan fructus) and Wu Yao (Linderae radix) Qing Pi is the peel of unripe tangerines. It is warm and bitter, and enters the Liver, Gall Bladder and Spleen meridians. It can break up Qi stagnation and is effective in promoting the free flow of Liver-Qi and alleviating pain. It is often selected in a formula to treat distending pain in the chest, breasts and hypo- chondriac region. It can also dissolve phlegm accu- mulation. Because its action is strong, it may injure the Qi and Yin. Therefore this herb is only used for a short period of time and in excess conditions. Chuan Lian Zi is very bitter and cold. It can intensively drain the Liver-fire and direct the Liver- Qi downwards. It is selected in formulas for treating syndromes where Liver-fire flares up and Liver-Qi movement is disturbed. The disorder is manifested as irritability, distension in the hypochondria, insom- nia, quick temper, red eyes, headache, red tongue with a yellow coating and a forceful, wiry and rapid pulse. Because Chuan Lian Zi is very bitter and cold, it easily injures the Stomach. This herb should not be used for a long period of time or in large dosage, because it is a toxic herb. Overdose may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspnea and arrhythmia. Wu Yao is pungent and warm, and enters the Lung, Spleen, Kidney and Bladder meridians. Wu Yao can warm these organs and expel the cold, regulate the Qi and release the pain. Since the Liver meridian passes the external genital region, Wu Yao can also regulate the Liver-Qi. It is particularly effective in relieving pain in the lateral sides of the lower abdomen and the genital area, and treats dys- menorrhea, hernia inguinalis, frequent urination and urinary incontinence due to cold in the Liver and Kidney meridians and stagnation of the Liver-Qi. Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) Since the Liver stores blood, which is the basis of free flow of the Liver-Qi, deficiency of blood can cause stagnation of Liver-Qi. However, as stimulat- ing the Qi in treatment may injure the blood and cause further stagnation of the Qi, it is necessary to nourish the blood in order to spread the Liver-Qi. Bai Shao Yao is the most commonly used herb to soften the Liver. It is sour, bitter and slightly cold. It is able to nourish the Yin and blood of the Liver, and its cold and bitter nature can reduce heat, which is caused by deficiency of blood and stagnation of the Liver-Qi. It is often used in a formula to treat Liver-Qi stagnation, which is caused by Yin and blood deficiency. As well as the common symptoms of Qi stagnation, a thready and wiry pulse is often an indication for using this herb in the formula. Deputy: Regulate the Qi movement and blood circulation in related organs Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium), Zhi Ke (aurantii fructus) and Zhi Shi (aurantii fructus immaturus) These herbs are selected to regulate the Qi. Chen Pi is dried tangerine peel. It is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Stomach and Spleen meridi- ans. It is effective for regulating the Qi of these organs. In the formula for promoting Liver-Qi move- ment, it is often selected to enhance the chief by moving the Qi and eliminating the dampness and phlegm from the Middle-Jiao. Its aromatic smell can stimulate the Spleen, transform the dampness and soothe the Stomach-Qi. Chen Pi is often used for distension and pain in the abdomen, reduced appe- tite, fullness of the stomach, nausea and vomiting. Zhi Ke has a similar function to Chen Pi but it is cold in nature and its function of regulating the Qi is gentler and slower. It moves horizontally in the Upper- and Middle-Jiao. In a formula that treats Liver-Qi stagnation with slight Liver-heat, Zhi Ke is very often used to open up the Qi obstruction in the chest, stomach and hypochondria to reduce fullness and distension. 253 Syndrome of Qi stagnation and formula compositionChapter Zhi Shi is cold and bitter, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. It moves downwards and can intensively break up accumulations of Qi, blood, food or phlegm; it can also promote bowel movement. In formulas that regulate the Liver-Qi, this herb is often used when the Qi in the Middle-Jiao is obstructed by the Liver-Qi and the bowel movement is difficult. Xiang Yuan (Citri fructus), Fo Shou (Citri sarcodactylis fructus) and Zi Su Geng (perillae caulis et flos) These herbs are used when Liver-Qi attacks the Stomach. Xiang Yuan and Fo Shou are bitter, sour and slightly warm, and enter the Liver, Spleen and Stomach meridians. Both are very effective in pro- moting Liver-Qi movement and treating hypochon- driac pain, distension and depression. Moreover, they are particularly effective in treating a condition where stagnant Liver-Qi disturbs the Stomach and leads to stifling in the chest and distension in the gastric and hypochondriac regions. They can soothe the Stomach-Qi, thereby improving appetite and stopping vomiting and belching. Zi Su Geng is slightly pungent and warm, and enters the Lung and Spleen meridians. This herb has a similar function to Xiang Yan and Fo Shou, but it is gentler. It is particularly suitable for a weak person who suffers from Liver-Qi stagnation and Stomach- Qi disturbance. It can also calm the fetus and is useful for pregnant women who suffer from dishar- mony between the Liver and the Stomach. Ju Luo (Citri reticulatae fructus retinervus), Si Gua Luo (Luffae fructus), Ju Ye (Citri reticulatae folium) and Ju He (aurantii semen) These herbs are used to dissipate nodules. Ju Luo is sweet, bitter and neutral, and enters the Liver and Lung meridians. According to the concept that the pith of fruit enters the collaterals of the human body, Ju Luo is able to regulate the Qi, open up the collaterals and remove phlegm there. It can be used with other herbs such as Si Gua Luo and Ju Ye to regulate the Liver-Qi in order to treat distending pain in the breasts and hypochondria, such as in premenstrual syndrome and mastopathy. Ju Ye is pungent, bitter and neutral. Like Ju Luo, it enters the Liver meridian, particularly regulates the Liver-Qi and dissipates nodules. Its action is stronger than that of Ju Luo. It also enters the Stomach meridian and regulates the Stomach-Qi. Because the Liver and Stomach meridians pass the breasts, this herb is able to treat distending pain of the breasts. Ju He is pungent, bitter and neutral, and enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. It is effective for regulating Qi, dissipating nodules and stopping pain. According to the concept that seeds move down- wards, it is especially applied to treat cold accumu- lation in the Liver meridian that is manifested as cramping pain on the lateral sides of the lower abdomen with a cold sensation, such as in dysmen- orrhea, amenorrhea, inguinal hernia and hydrocele of the testis. Mu Xiang (aucklandiae radix)** Mu Xiang is pungent, bitter, warm and aromatic, and enters the Gall Bladder, Spleen and Large Intes- tine meridians. It can strongly and quickly activate the Qi movement; it especially regulates Qi in the intestines and alleviates pain. It also strengthens the Spleen and promotes digestion. It is particularly effective in treating disorders where Liver-Qi over- acts on the Spleen, causing stomachache, abdominal pain and distension, diarrhea, poor appetite and poor digestion, such as in colitis, peptic ulcer, hepa- titis and irritable bowel syndrome. Since this herb is quite warm and pungent, and is strong in action, its dosage should be controlled carefully. Mei Gui Hua (rosae flos), Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma), Yu Jin (Curcumae radix) and Yan Hu Suo (Corydalidis rhizoma) These herbs are selected to promote blood circula- tion. Mei Gui Hua has the function of harmonizing the Qi of the Liver and Stomach, and treating the syndrome of Liver-Qi attacking the Spleen and Stomach. Its function is quite similar to that of Xiang Yuan (Citri fructus) and Fo Shou (Citri sar- codactylis fructus). However, this herb can promote both Qi and blood circulation and is an appropriate herb to treat disorders due to both Qi and blood stagnation, such as in irregular menstruation and dysmenorrhea. Chuan Xiong, Yu Jin and Yan Hu Suo are herbs that promote blood circulation. As they are able to move the Qi in the blood, they are considered as the Qi-moving herbs in the blood. In formulas that reg- ulate the Liver-Qi, they may be selected in condi- tions of Qi and blood stagnation, or for the purpose of activating the blood in order to accelerate the Qi movement. As Chuan Xiong and Yan Hu Suo are warm in temperature and Yu Jin is cold, they should be selected according to the nature of the syndrome. 254


Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) Mu Gua (Chaenomelis fructus), and Bai Shao Yao These herbs are selected to relax tendons. Gan Cao is sweet in nature and enters all meridians. It is often used together with sour herbs such as Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) and Mu Gua to generate Yin to soften the Liver, ease the muscles and tendons, relieve cramp and reduce high tension in the body. Mu Gua is sour and warm, and can relieve cramp of the muscles. Its function is quite different from that of Bai Shao Yao, which is able to soften the Liver, nourish the Yin and ease the muscles. Mu Gua is able to remove dampness from the meridians, thus treating cramp of the muscles and tendons. Assistant: Tonify the blood and Qi; reduce the excess in order to harmonize the Liver-Qi Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) and Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix) They are the most commonly used pair of herbs in a formula that treats Liver-Qi stagnation caused by blood deficiency. A thready and wiry pulse is an important sign of blood deficiency with stagnation of the Liver-Qi. Dang Gui is pungent, sweet and slightly warm; Bai Shao Yao is sour, bitter and slightly cold. When Dang Gui and Bai Shao Yao are used together, they can harmonize the blood circula- tion properly: the first is warm, and it can disperse and promote the blood circulation; the second is cold, and it can moderate and stabilize the blood circulation. Although both can tonify the blood, Dang Gui is focused on the promoting function of the blood while Bai Shao Yao is focused on nourish- ing the substantial part of the blood. Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix) and Bai Zhu (atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) Dang Shen and Bai Zhu are able to tonify the Qi and strengthen the function of the Spleen. They are often used as assistants in a formula that treats Liver-Qi stagnation with Spleen-Qi deficiency. Another reason to use herbs which tonify the Spleen is that, as in a chronic condition of Liver-Qi stagna- tion, the Liver is almost always overacting on the Spleen. It is wise therefore to tonify the Spleen before it is badly weakened. Bai He (Lilii bulbus) and Suan Zao Ren (Ziziphi spinosae semen) These herbs can be used as assistants in formulas that spread the Liver-Qi when the Qi disturbs the mind and influences sleep. Bai He is sweet and slightly cold, and enters the Lung and Heart meridians. It can calm the mind and treat depression, anxiety and insomnia. Suan Zao Ren is able to nourish the blood of the Liver and improve sleep. Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus), Shi Jue Ming (haliotidis concha), Gou Teng (Uncariae ramulus cum uncis) and Ju Hua (Chrysanthemi flos) Zhi Zi is bitter and cold, and enters the San Jiao meridian. It can clear the heat and reduce the excess fire from the Heart, Liver and Bladder by increasing urination. In formulas that regulate Liver-Qi, this herb can be used in cases of Liver-heat or Liver-fire presentation. A red tongue with a yellow coating and a wiry pulse suggest the existence of this disorder. Shi Jue Ming is a mineral substance that can descend the Liver-Yang. It is used in a formula when the Liver-Yang ascends. Common symptoms are dizziness, dry eyes and blurred vision, and a wiry or tight pulse. Gou Teng can cool the Liver and relieve convul- sions. Ju Hua can disperse Liver-heat. Both can be applied in either an excess or a deficiency condition of Liver-heat syndrome. Jiang Can (Bombyx batrycatus), Di Long (pheretima) and Chan Tui (Cicadae periostracum) These substances particularly open up the meridians and collaterals, and treat numbness of the limbs caused by Liver-wind. Jiang Can and Chuan Tui are also used for itchy skin disorders caused by Liver- wind and Liver-heat. Envoy: Harmonize the herbs in the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet in nature and is used as envoy to harmonize the herbs that regulate the Qi by moving in different directions in the body. 255 Syndrome of Qi stagnation and formula compositionChapter Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Fullness in the stomach and reduced appetite due to Liver-Qi attacking the Spleen: use Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) and Fu Ling (Poria) to strengthen the Spleen; use Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex), Sha Ren (Amomi xanthioidis fructus) and Mu Xiang (Aucklandiae radix)** to regulate the Qi in the Spleen and Large Intestine; use Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix) to expel wind caused by tension in the Large Intestine; use Xiang Yuan (Citri fructus) and Fo Shou (Citri sarcodactylis fructus) to harmonize the Liver and Stomach. • Nausea and belching due to Liver-Qi attacking the Stomach: use Zi Su Ye (Perillae folium), Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma), Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) and Pi Pa Ye (Eriobotryae folium) to soothe the Stomach-Qi. • Distending pain of abdomen and irregular bowel movement due to Liver-Qi disturbing the function of the Large Intestine: add Mu Xiang (Aucklandiae radix)** and Bing Lang (Arecae semen) to regulate the Qi in the Liver and Large Intestine. • Fullness in the chest, difficult urination and edema due to Liver-Qi blocking the San Jiao water passage: add Sang Bai Pi (Mori cortex), Su Geng (Perillae caulis) and Xing Ren (Armeniacae semen) to descend and regulate the Qi in the Lung. • Jaundice, reduced appetite, hypochondriac pain and fullness due to Liver-Qi disturbing the Gall Bladder: use Yin Chen Hao (Artemisiae scopariae herba), Zhu Ru (Bambusae caulis in taeniam) use Yu Jin (Curcumae radix) to regulate the Qi and remove the damp-heat from the Gall Bladder. • Distending pain in the breasts, especially before menstruation, due to Liver-Qi obstructing the collaterals: use Ju Luo (Citri reticulatae fructus retinervus) and Si Gua Luo (Luffae fructus) to open up the collaterals. Analysis of the formula This formula is able to free the constrained Liver-Qi and regulate the Spleen. It is a formula devised for stagnation of Liver-Qi, which may happen in a stressful situation. When Qi stagnates, the patient has fullness in the chest and distension of the hypo- chondria and abdomen. When Qi is not able to reach the extremities, the patient has cold fingers. If the Liver overacts on the Spleen, abdominal pain may also present. The patient may have a wiry pulse. In this formula: • Chai Hu is used as chief. It directly disperses the Qi and releases the constraint of the Qi in the Liver, Gall Bladder and San Jiao. • Zhi Gan Cao is used as deputy to strengthen the Spleen and protect the Middle-Jiao. It is particularly useful when the Liver overacts on the Spleen. • The sour Bai Shao Yao and sweet Zhi Gan Cao are used together as deputies to generate the Yin. They can soften the Liver, ease the muscles and release the cramp and stiffness so as to help Chai Hu spread the Liver-Qi. • Zhi Shi is used as assistant to descend the Qi to help the chief regulate the Qi efficiently. It can also regulate the Qi in the intestines, and reduce distension and pain. • Zhi Gan Cao is also used as envoy in the formula to harmonize the herbs that work on different aspects in the syndrome.

Commentary on strategies Although there are only four herbs in this formula, it shows several treatment strategies to spread the Liver-Qi. • First, Chai Hu is used to free the constrained Qi instead of using Xiang Fu (Cyperi rhizoma), the most commonly used herb to regulate the Liver-Qi. Because Chai Hu moves upwards and outwards, it is more suitable in situations of Qi constraint. • Second, the combination of ascending and descending herbs can activate the Qi movement more effectively than using herbs that move in only one direction. • Third, herbs that soften the Liver are used to help spread the Qi smoothly. • Fourth, herbs that harmonize the Liver and Spleen are used at the same time. Chai Hu Shu Gan San (Bupleurum Powder to Spread the Liver) Source: Jing Yue Quan Shu This formula can be considered a variation of Si Ni San (Frigid Extremities Powder): • Chai Hu, Bai Shao Yao and Zhi Gan Cao are used for the same purpose of spreading the Liver-Qi and softening the Liver. • At the same time, Xiang Fu is added to enhance the ability of Chai Hu to spread the Qi in the Liver, Gall Bladder and San Jiao meridians. • Zhi Ke is used instead of Zhi Shi (Aurantii fructus immaturus). It can broaden the chest and regulate the Qi in the chest and epigastria. Together with Chen Pi, it can reduce distension and pain. • Moreover, Chuan Xiong is added to regulate the blood, enhance the herbs that regulate the Qi and stop pain. Commentary on strategies If comparing this formula with Shi Ni San (Frigid Extremities Powder), the herbs that move Liver-Qi are increased in number and strength, and a herb that regulates blood is added. This formula is there- fore more powerful to spread the Qi and reduce the distension and pain. It is a formula not only for study, but also a formula that is often used effec- tively in clinical practice with a better and quicker result.

It is used to treat syndromes where the cold stays in the Liver meridian and blocks the Qi move- ment in the Lower-Jiao. The manifestations are cramping pain in the lower, lateral sides of the abdomen, which may radiate to the testicles. In female patients, there may be dysmenorrhea. Patients often have a pale tongue with a white coating and a wiry, deep and slow pulse. In this formula: • Wu Yao is used as chief to warm the Lower- Jiao, promote the Qi movement in the Liver, Kidney and Bladder meridians and thus relieve cramping pain. • Qing Pi and Mu Xiang are used as deputies to regulate the Liver-Qi and relieve pain in lower abdomen. • Xiao Hui Xiang and Gao Liang Jiang also serve as deputies to enhance the ability of the chief. They warm the Middle- and Lower-Jiao, scatter the cold and spread the Qi so as to relieve cramp. • Bing Lang, as assistant, moves downwards, can break up the Qi stagnation and relieve pain. • Jin Ling Zi, also named Chuan Lian Zi, is another assistant. It drains the Liver-Qi and breaks up Qi stagnation. It enhances the functions of Qing Pi and Mu Xiang to treat the pain. Its very cold nature is removed by processing with Ba Dou, which is hot and toxic, but is not used directly in this formula. This processing may neutralize the temperature but retains the function of Jin Ling Zi. • This formula is taken with alcohol, which can quickly and powerfully expel cold and accelerate the speed of the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies In this formula, the chief has two functions: to spread the Qi and to warm the Lower-Jiao. These functions are enhanced in strength by two groups of herbs. The structure is very clear. In addition, the processing of Jin Ling Zi shows the strategy of using the function of a herb while at the same time avoid- ing its unnecessary nature. Xiao Yao San (Rambling Powder) Source: Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) 9 g Dang Gui (Angelicae sinensis radix) 9 g Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) 9 g Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 9 g Fu Ling (Poria) 9 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 4 .5 g Wei Sheng Jiang (roasted Zingiberis rhizoma recens) 6 g Bo He (Menthae herba) 3 g Analysis of the formula This well-known formula spreads the Liver-Qi, nourishes the blood and tonifies the Spleen. It is devised to treat Liver-Qi stagnation due to Qi and blood deficiency. The manifestations are hypochondriac pain, headache, vertigo, a bitter taste in the mouth, dry mouth and throat, fatigue, reduced appetite; in some cases alternating fever and chills, irregular menstruation or distending pain in the breasts. The tongue is pale or pink with a thin white coating and the pulse is wiry and deficient. In this formula there are three groups of herbs that are used as chief and which form the main part of the formula: • Dang Gui and Bai Shao Yao are chosen to nourish the Liver-blood and soften the Liver in order to promote the movement of the Qi. • Bai Zhu and Fu Ling are used to tonify the Spleen-Qi to generate the blood, which is the basis of movement of Liver-Qi. • Chai Hu is used to disperse constrained Liver-Qi, which is supported by sufficient Liver blood. • Bo He disperses and clears the heat generated by the constrained Liver-Qi and serves as assistant to Chai Hu. • Sheng Jiang can soothe the Stomach-Qi and promote digestion. It serves as assistant to Bai Zhu and Fu Ling. 258


• Zhi Gan Cao is used as envoy to harmonize the herbs that work on different aspects of the syndrome. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, there is no herb that directly promotes Liver-Qi movement. The strategy to spread Liver-Qi works via the approach of softening the Liver and nourishing the blood. It is a balanced and gentle formula for treating a deficiency condition. • Since each of the three aspects – deficiency of blood, deficiency of Spleen-Qi and stagnation of Liver-Qi – can be the cause or the consequence of each other, the roles and the dosages of the three groups of herbs that tonify the blood, tonify the Spleen and disperse the Liver-Qi can be changed according to the syndrome.

## in the Stomach, Spleen and

<!-- chunk -->

## Large Intestine

Analysis of the syndrome The Stomach and Large Intestine are Fu organs and their physiological function is to transport the food and feces. Their characteristic is often explained as moving the Qi downwards and emptying the organ at the same time. The Stomach and Large Intestine are considered as the Yang Ming family, full of Yang and Qi, which are important for digestion. They prefer to be moistened rather than dried. Since they open directly to the outside environment, they are vulnerable to exterior pathogenic factors by taking food and drink. • As soon as the Qi movement and the transportation functions of these organs are disturbed, fullness and distension (even pain) may start in the gastric and abdominal regions. • In a severe disorder, if the Stomach-Qi is unable to descend and is forced to ascend because of the obstruction, reduced appetite and nausea (even vomiting) may occur. • When the Qi is unable to descend in the Large Intestine, difficult bowel movement and constipation may present. • When the Yin and fluid are injured and heat is very strong, heartburn, thirst, bad breath and constipation may present. Moreover, physiologically, Liver-Qi may promote the digestion and ensure that the Qi moves smoothly in the Middle-Jiao. • When Liver-Qi attacks the Stomach and Large Intestine, the Qi moves improperly in the digestive tract and the above-mentioned symptoms may arise suddenly. Alternatively, constipation and diarrhea may occur. The Spleen’s physiological features are opposite to those of the Stomach. It is a Zang organ and its principal function is to transform food and drink into Qi and blood. Therefore its Qi should ascend and the organ prefers being dry rather than wet. • If the function of the Spleen is not strong, food and drink can easily become stagnant, leading to accumulation of dampness, food or phlegm. • When Qi is obstructed in the body, there may be symptoms such as heaviness of the body, reluctance to move, tiring easily, reduced appetite and having a sticky sensation in the mouth. • A wiry pulse indicates the tension of the obstruction and the pain; a pale tongue indicates the Qi and blood deficiency of the Main symptoms Distension (even pain) in gastric and abdominal regions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation . Secondary symptoms All the above-mentioned symptoms change with time, can start abruptly and disappear quickly . There may also be heartburn, thirst, bad breath and constipation; heaviness of the body, reluctance to move, tiring easily, reduced appetite and a sticky sensation in the mouth . Tongue Normal or slightly pale with a white coating or sticky coating if accompanied by accumulation of dampness, food or phlegm . Pulse Wiry; soft in the case of damp accumulation; slippery in the case of phlegm accumulation . Associated disorders in western medicine Acute and chronic gastritis, enteritis, peptic ulcer, duodenal ulcer and irritable bowel syndrome. 259 Syndrome of Qi stagnation and formula compositionChapter Spleen; the sticky and thick tongue coatings indicate the degree of dampness, phlegm and food accumulation. Treatment principle: Regulate and smooth the movement of Qi in the Stomach and Large Intestine an aromatic herb, it can also transform dampness in the Middle-Jiao to treat Qi stagnation and dampness accumulation. It should be used with caution when there is Yin deficiency or heat in the Stomach as it can consume the Yin. Ban Xia is pungent and warm, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. Although this herb is mostly used for removing phlegm, it can effec- tively soothe the Stomach and treat nausea and vomiting. It is often used together with other herbs such as Chen Pi to regulate the Qi of the Stomach. Like Chen Pi, it can consume Yin and should be used with caution. Zi Su Geng is pungent and warm, and enters the Lung and Spleen meridians. It can gently descend the Qi in the Middle-Jiao and is particularly suitable for treating fullness in the epigastria and chest due to Qi stagnation with food accumulation. Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex) Huo Po is bitter, pungent and warm, and enters the Lung, Stomach and Large Intestine meridians. As well as its function of descending Qi, it can disperse obstruction and dry dampness, and is an excellent herb to reduce distension. It is often selected to treat Qi and dampness accumulation in these organs and the involved regions. Tan Xiang (Santali albi lignum) Tan Xiang is pungent, aromatic and warm, and enters the Spleen, Stomach and Lung meridians. It has a strong function of scattering cold and opening Qi obstruction, thus relieving pain. It is particularly suitable to be selected for severe pain in the chest and stomach. It is often used with Sha Ren (Amomi xanthioidis fructus) to enhance its function. Ding Xiang (Caryophylli flos), Shi Di (Kaki diospyri calyx) and Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) The first two herbs are particularly effective for reducing the rebellious Qi of the Stomach and are used for treating belching and hiccup due to cold disturbing the Stomach. Ding Xiang is warm and its function to descend the Stomach-Qi is enhanced by Shi Di which is neutral in nature. Sheng Jiang is pungent and warm, and enters the Stomach meridian. It particularly warms the Stomach, soothes the Stomach-Qi and disperses the cold fluid. It therefore treats fullness, cramp in the Stomach and even vomiting out clear fluid. Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Descend the Qi in the Stomach and Large Intestine; remove dampness and phlegm in the Middle-Jiao Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium), Ban Xia (pinelliae rhizoma) and Zi Su Geng (perillae caulis et flos) These three herbs all can descend the Stomach-Qi and are often selected in cases of Stomach-Qi stag- nation. Chen Pi is dried tangerine peel. It is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Stomach and Spleen meridians It is commonly used to regulate the Qi of the Stomach and it can treat poor appetite, disten- sion in the epigastria, nausea and vomiting. As it is 260


Xuan Fu Hua (Inulae flos) and Dai Zhe Shi (haematitum) These two substances can strongly descend the Stomach-Qi and are used for severe vomiting in an acute and severe case of rebellious Stomach-Qi. Xuan Fu Hua is bitter, pungent, salty and slightly warm, and enters the Lung, Stomach and Large Intestine meridians. It can strongly descend the Qi and remove phlegm from the Stomach. Its function is enhanced by Dai Zhe Shi. Dai Zhe Shi is a mineral substance; it is bitter and cold, and enters the Liver meridian. As it moves downward rapidly, it can direct the rebellious Stomach-Qi downwards. Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex), Mu Xiang (aucklandiae radix)**, Sha Ren (amomi xanthioidis fructus), Bai Dou Kou (amomi fructus rotundus), Bing Lang (arecae semen) and Zhi Shi (aurantii fructus immaturus) All of these herbs can regulate the Qi in the Large Intestine. Hou Po is bitter, pungent and warm, and is the most often selected herb in formulas that reduce the fullness in the whole abdomen due to Qi and damp- ness obstruction. Mu Xiang can strongly and effectively regulate Qi in the Large Intestine and alleviate pain. It is pungent, bitter, warm and aromatic. As well as reg- ulating the Qi in the Large Intestine, it can effec- tively treat disorders of Liver-Qi overacting on the Spleen because it enters the Gall Bladder, Spleen and Large Intestine meridians. It treats cramping pain and distension in the abdomen and irregular bowel movement. Sha Ren is pungent and warm, and enters the Spleen, Stomach and Kidney meridians. It particu- larly regulates the Qi in the Middle- and Lower-Jiao. Like Hou Po, it treats Qi stagnation which is com- bined with dampness. In addition, its aromatic smell can improve the digestion and remove dampness and food accumulation. It is often used with Mu Xiang because of their enhancing action of regulating the Qi from each other. Bai Dou Kou is pungent and warm, and its func- tions are similar to those of Sha Ren. However, it is more effective for regulating the Qi in the Middle- Jiao and is also less warm and less dry in property than Sha Ren. Bing Lang is bitter, pungent and warm, and enters the Stomach and Large Intestine meridians. It can strongly descend the Qi in the Middle- and Lower- Jiao and reduce food accumulation. It can effec- tively treat abdominal pain, distension and difficult bowel movement. Zhi Shi is the only cold herb in this group of herbs to regulate the Qi in the Middle- and Lower-Jiao. Its cold and bitter property can strongly direct the Qi downwards. It has an intense action of opening the obstruction of the Qi and breaking up the accu- mulations of Qi, blood, food or phlegm. It is often selected to treat distending pain of the abdomen and constipation. Deputy: Remove dampness in the Middle-Jiao and regulate the Liver-Qi Pi Pa Ye (eriobotryae folium), Lu Gen (phragmitis rhizoma) and Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) These three herbs are moist in nature. They can nourish the Stomach-Yin and descend the Stomach- Qi. They can be chosen as deputies in formulas that regulate the Stomach-Qi and treat nausea and reduced appetite in cases of fluid and Yin deficiency, such as after a febrile disease. Yi Yi Ren (Coicis semen), Fu Ling (poria) and Bai Zhu (atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) These three herbs can leach out or dry dampness. They are used as deputies to treat dampness accu- mulation in the Middle- and Lower-Jiao. Yi Yi Ren is slightly cold and can be used in a damp-heat con- dition; Fu Ling and Bai Zhu can tonify the Spleen- Qi. Together they accelerate the transformation of dampness. Xiang Yuan (Citri fructus) and Fo Shou (Citri sarcodactylis fructus) Xiang Yuan and Fo Shou are bitter, sour and slightly warm, and enter the Liver, Spleen and Stomach meridians. They can effectively promote Liver-Qi movement, as well as soothing the Stomach-Qi. They are particularly used to treat the syndrome where Liver-Qi overacts on the Stomach and leads to distension in the gastric and hypochondriac regions, reduced appetite, vomiting and belching. 261 Syndrome of Qi stagnation and formula compositionChapter Assistant: Promote food digestion and enhance the ability of the chief; treat the causes and accompanying syndromes Mai Ya (hordei fructus germinatus), Shen Qu (Massa medicata fermentata), Shan Zha (Crataegi fructus) and Lai Fu Zi (raphani semen) These herbs can be selected in cases of food accu- mulation. Moreover, they can be used to prevent food accumulation, which often happens when the Stomach-Qi stagnates. The first three substances are often used together as they aid digestion of starch, cereal, fat and protein-rich food. Lai Fu Zi can effec- tively regulate the Qi and remove phlegm in the intestines; it aids the digestion of all types of food. Da Huang (rhei rhizoma) and Mang Xiao (Natrii sulfas) Da Huang and Mang Xiao can be selected if consti- pation occurs due to dryness and heat in the Large Intestine. Da Huang can stimulate the Large Intes- tine and purge the feces; Mang Xiao can increase the fluid in the intestines and soften the feces. As both are cold in nature, they can also reduce heat in the intestines. Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) and Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus) These two herbs are often selected to reduce heat from the intestines, as both are bitter and cold in nature. Huang Qin is particularly suitable for treat- ing damp-heat in the intestines; Lian Qiao can dis- perse the constrained heat and is used to disperse the heat from accumulated food. Mei Gui Hua (rosae flos), Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma), Yu Jin (Curcumae radix) and Yan Hu Suo (Corydalidis rhizoma) These herbs can stimulate the Qi and blood, and are used for treating severe Qi stagnation. Mei Gui Hua can promote both Qi and blood circulation and is an appropriate herb to treat disor- ders due to Qi and blood stagnation, such as focal distending pain and cramping. Since it has the func- tion of harmonizing the Qi in the Liver and Stomach, it treats the syndrome of Liver-Qi attacking the Spleen and Stomach. It is used when pain is present and gets worse in cases of stress. Chuan Xiong, Yu Jin and Yan Hu Suo can promote blood circulation. As they are able to move the Qi in the blood, they are considered as the Qi-moving herbs in the blood. In formulas that regulate the Stomach-Qi, they are selected in cases of both Qi and blood stagnation. They can also be selected to move the blood in order to accelerate the Qi move- ment. Chuan Xiong and Yan Hu Suo are warm in nature and Yu Jin is cold. They should be selected according to treatment need. Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix) and Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) These two herbs are the most commonly used herbal combination in a formula to tonify the blood, which is the basis of the Qi. Dang Gui is pungent, sweet and slightly warm; Bai Shao Yao is sour, bitter and slightly cold. When Dang Gui and Bai Shao are used together, they can harmonize the blood circulation as Dang Gui focuses on tonifying and promoting the function of the Liver and Bai Shao Yao focuses on nourishing the substantial part of the blood. A pale tongue with a thin coating and a thready and wiry pulse are the important signs for selecting these two herbs. Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix) and Bai Zhu (atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) Dang Shen and Bai Zhu are able to tonify the Qi and strengthen the function of the Spleen. They are often used as assistants in a formula that treats Qi stagnation when the Spleen-Qi is too weak to move in the Middle-Jiao. Another reason for using herbs that tonify the Spleen is when the Spleen is weak, the Liver can easily overact on the Spleen, and thus the Spleen should be strengthened at the same time. Envoy: Harmonize the herbs in the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and is used as envoy in the formula to harmonize the herbs that regulate the Qi by moving it in different directions. Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Heartburn due to Stomach-Yin deficiency with heat: use Sheng Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix), 262


Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma), Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex) and Sheng Ma (Cimicifugae rhizoma) to reduce the heat and regulate the Qi and blood. • Constipation due to dry-heat in the intestines: use Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) and Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix) to increase the fluid; use Huo Ma Ren (Cannabis semen) and Yu Li Ren (Pruni semen) to moisten the intestines. • Alternating diarrhea and constipation due to Liver-Qi overacting on the Stomach and Spleen: use Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) and Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) to harmonize the Spleen and Liver; use Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix) and Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) to regulate the Qi. Examples of classical formulas Ban Xia Hou Po Tang (Pinellia and Magnolia Bark Decoction) Source: Jin Gui Yao Lue a poor appetite with fullness in the epigastria and chest. The tongue coating is white and sticky and the pulse is wiry and slippery. In this formula: • Ban Xia and Hou Po are chief. They can descend the Qi in the Upper- and Middle-Jiao and eliminate phlegm. They treat the main pathological condition. • Fu Ling, as deputy, can tonify the Spleen and increase urination, thus leaching out the dampness in the body. • Sheng Jiang and Zi Su Ye soothe the Stomach-Qi and promote digestion so as to stop the production of dampness and phlegm. When all these herbs are used together, they can open the obstruction of Qi, dampness and phlegm, and the symptoms disappear. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, there are only five herbs, all of which move downwards. They open the obstruction of Qi and phlegm via the approaches of descending the Qi, leaching out the dampness, transforming the phlegm and promoting digestion. • Moreover, Sheng Jiang and Zi Su Ye have dispersing and ascending abilities besides descending the Qi. They can enhance the descending actions of all the herbs and activate the Qi movement efficiently. Tong Xie Yao Fang (Important Formula for Painful Diarrhea) Source: Jing Yue Quan Shu quoted from Liu Cao Chuang Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) 12 g Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex) 9 g Fu Ling (Poria) 12 g Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) 9 g Zi Su Ye (Perillae folium) 6 g Analysis of the formula This formula can promote the movement of Qi, dissipate clumps, direct rebellious Qi downwards and transform phlegm. It was originally used to treat plum-pit Qi syndrome, a syndrome caused by Qi and phlegm obstructing the throat. Patients have a feeling that something blocks the throat that can neither be swallowed nor ejected, and a stifling sen- sation in the chest and hypochondria. This formula can also treat depression due to Qi and phlegm obstruction in the Middle- and Upper-Jiao. Patients may complain about loss of interest in doing things, tiredness, a heavy sensation in the body, and having Chao Bai Zhu (dry-fried Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 90 g Chao Bai Shao Yao (dry-fried Paeoniae radix lactiflora) 60 g Chao Chen Pi (dry-fried Citri reticulatae pericarpium) 45 g Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix) 60 g 263 Syndrome of Qi stagnation and formula compositionChapter Analysis of the formula This formula can harmonize the functions of the Liver and the Spleen and can treat a condition of Liver-Qi overacting on the Spleen with disturbance of Qi movement in the Middle-Jiao. The manifesta- tions are borborygmi, abdominal pain, an urge to defecate, and diarrhea with abdominal pain subsid- ing after completion. The tongue coating is thin and white and the pulse is wiry. In this formula: • Bai Zhu is used as chief against the attack of the Liver and to strengthen the Spleen-Qi. • Bai Shao Yao, as deputy, nourishes the Liver- Yin, softens the Liver and reduces the tension of the muscles and tendons when the Liver attacks the Spleen. • Chen Pi, as assistant, regulates the disturbed Qi in the Middle-Jiao. • Fang Feng also serves as assistant. It pacifies the wind generated by sudden cramp of the abdomen. It smoothes the muscles and reduces the speed of the disturbed Qi in the Middle- Jiao. Commentary on strategies • This formula, although containing only four herbs, clearly shows the specific function of each herb and the relationships between them. • It suggests the basic strategies in the case of the Liver-Qi overacting on the Spleen – to strengthen the Spleen, to reduce the Liver and to soothe the Qi. • Not only is it an excellent formula to study, it is also an effective formula that is frequently used in clinical practice.

It is used for stagnation of food, which causes obstruction of Qi and accumula- tion of damp-heat. The manifestations are focal and general distension, fullness and pain in the epigastria and abdomen, constipation or dysenteric diarrhea with mucus and blood. The tongue is red or purple with a yellow, sticky coating and the pulse is strong. This is an excess syndrome and the main disorder is accumulation, which obstructs the Qi and gener- ates dampness and heat. The damp-heat injures the mucus in the intestines, leading to dysenteric diarrhea. In the formula: • Mu Xiang and Bing Lang are chief. They are bitter, pungent and warm, and enter the Large Intestine meridian. Since they can strongly move the Qi in the Middle- and Lower-Jiao and reduce the food accumulation, they can effectively treat abdominal pain, distension and difficult bowel movement. • Da Huang and Qian Niu Zi are deputies. As they are bitter and cold purgatives, they can strongly descend the Qi and eliminate the accumulation and heat in the Large Intestines. • The remaining herbs serve as assistants. Qing Pi, Xiang Fu and Chen Pi aid the function of the chief by promoting Qi movement of the Liver and Stomach and by reducing the distension. E Zhu can regulate the blood circulation and break up accumulation. Huang Lian and Huang Bai are bitter and cold, and clear the damp-heat in the Large Intestine. When the accumulation is removed, Qi and blood move properly and the symptoms disappear. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, all the herbs are strong and active. They work on different aspects in treating the syndrome. Each group has a specific 264


function and they work together to suit all the aspects of the pathological changes. • This formula follows the principle of treating diarrhea by purging accumulations. Normally, when diarrhea occurs, one may first think to stop it by the natural choice of herbs that can stop diarrhea. However, this formula suggests to us that no matter how heavy the diarrhea, even with blood and mucus, and no matter how long the disorder lasts, the cause of the diarrhea should be treated first. To stop diarrhea by using astringent herbs in this case may prolong the accumulation. This would generate more heat and dampness, and the diarrhea could get worse. In this formula, herbs that intensively purge the Large Intestine and remove the accumulation are chosen to treat the cause primarily. In addition, herbs that regulate Qi and particularly reduce tenesmus are used. • Herbs that regulate blood and remove heat and toxins are used as they can directly stop blood and mucus discharge. Ban Xia Xie Xin Tang (Pinellia Decoction to Drain the Epigastrium) Source: Shang Han Lun tions are epigastric fullness and tightness with very slight pain, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, reduced appetite, a thin, sticky, yellow tongue coating and a wiry, rapid pulse. This is a formula devised by Dr Zhang Zhong Jiang. It was originally used in a condition where Shao Yang syndrome was not treated by a harmoniz- ing method, but by a purging method, which injured the Yang of the Middle-Jiao. In this pathological process, the heat sinks deeper, binds with cold caused by Yang deficiency, and the excess patho- genic factor binds with the weakened Qi. In the Middle-Jiao, as the Qi is blocked, nausea, vomiting, borborygmi and diarrhea appear. In this formula: • Ban Xia is used to disperse the obstruction of the Qi and soothe the Stomach-Qi so as to reduce distension. • Gan Jiang warms the Middle-Jiao and disperses coldness. • Huang Qin and Huang Lian are bitter and cold. They clear the pathogenic heat, descend the Qi and open the obstruction. When the pungent-warm herbs and the bitter- cold herbs are used together, the bonding of cold and warm, as well as excess and deficiency, is dissolved and the Qi movement is harmonized in the Middle-Jiao. • Ren Shen, Zhi Gan Cao and Da Zhao serve as assistants. They tonify the Spleen and thus prevent further pathological development. When the seven herbs are used together, heat and cold are removed, the Spleen-Qi ascends, the Stomach-Qi descends, and the symptoms disappear. Commentary on strategies • This formula demonstrates using a combination of pungent-warm herbs with bitter-cold herbs to treat a complicated syndrome. • The strategy of using pungent-warm herbs and bitter-cold herbs together is not only used in the original condition of mistreated Shao Yao syndrome, but is also used widely in similar conditions, such as acute and chronic gastroenteritis, hyperchlorhydria, prolapsed stomach, dilatation of the stomach, peptic and duodenal ulcer, nausea and vomiting due to nervousness, irritable bowel syndrome, allergies, and the side effects of western medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

## in the Lung

• When the Qi is not spread in the whole body by the Lung, patients may easily feel tired and reluctant to move. • If the water passage is blocked in the Upper- Jiao, edema or puffiness occurs. • The blockage of Lung-Qi shows in a normal or slightly pale tongue with a white coating. A sticky coating can be found if there is accumulation of phlegm or dampness. The pulse is rapid because of compensation for the blockage, and it is superficial in the Lung position. It can also be slippery in the case of phlegm accumulation. Treatment principle: Regulate the Lung-Qi and eliminate the pathogenic factors in the Lung Main symptoms Short and shallow breathing, a stifling sensation in the chest, cough and wheezing . Secondary symptoms Edema, puffiness, tiredness, reluctance to move, weak voice . Tongue Normal or slightly pale with a white coating or sticky coating if accompanied by accumulation of dampness, food or phlegm . Pulse Rapid, superficial in the first position on the right side; slippery in the case of phlegm accumulation . Associated disorders in western medicine Acute and chronic bronchitis, asthma, emphysema, pulmonary heart disease, heart failure. Analysis of the syndrome The Lung is one of the Zang organs and it governs respiration. It is exposed to the outside and can easily be attacked by exterior pathogenic factors. The Lung is also a very light and fragile organ, which cannot bear warmth, coldness and dryness. It needs fluid to nourish its light body and Qi to support its function. Qi must disperse and descend without obstruction in the Lung. As the Lung is located in the Upper-Jiao, the Qi should descend. • As soon as the Lung-Qi is obstructed by exterior pathogenic factors or disturbed by other internal organs, it moves upwards instead of downwards, and patients can immediately feel a stifling sensation in the chest, the breath becomes quick and shallow, and the voice becomes weak. • When the Qi is blocked in the Lung, fluid can accumulate and forms phlegm, frequently leading to cough with phlegm. Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Descend the Lung-Qi and remove phlegm and dampness Ting Li Zi (Lepidii/Descurainiae semen) and Sang Bai Pi (Mori cortex) Ting Li Zi and Sang Bai Pi are cold in nature and enter the Lung meridian. They are able to direct the Lung-Qi downwards, eliminate phlegm and accumu- lated water, thus reducing the obstruction of the 266


Lung-Qi and arresting wheezing. They are used together in conditions of cough, wheezing, fullness in the chest, edema and difficult urination. Ting Li Zi is very pungent, bitter and cold, and is much stronger than Sang Bai Pi in directing the Lung-Qi downwards and draining water. It is more suitable for treating the excess syndromes of phlegm and water accumulation in the Lung. As it also enters the Large Intestine meridian, it can drain heat, water and phlegm via bowel movement. However, since Ting Li Zi is a harsh, cold herb and easily injures the Qi, it is only used in excess syn- dromes for a short period of time. Sang Bai Pi is sweet, bland and cold. It can clear heat and leach out dampness without the side effect of Yin consumption. Sang Bai Pi is gentler than Ting Li Zi in directing the Qi downwards and eliminating the accumulation of water and phlegm. It therefore has fewer side effects and can be used for a longer period of time. Zi Su Zi (perillae fructus) and Xing Ren (armeniacae semen) Zi Su Zi and Xing Ren are warm in temperature and enter the Lung meridian. They are seeds and can effectively descend the Lung-Qi and arrest wheez- ing. They contain oil and can moisten the Lung and intestines, descend the Qi and eliminate phlegm. As Zi Su Zi can also broaden the chest, and Xing Ren can stop cough, they can be selected for slightly different situations. Xing Ren is bitter, warm and slightly poisonous, and the dosage should be control- led carefully. Deputy: Regulate the Lung-Qi; eliminate phlegm, dampness, heat or cold from the Lung Bai Qian (Cynanchi stauntonii radix) and Qian Hu (peucedani radix) Bai Qian and Qian Hu are often prescribed together. Both are pungent and enter the Lung meridian. They are effective for relieving cough, and can disperse as well as descend the Lung-Qi. They are often selected as assistants to treat fullness in the chest, cough and wheezing due to obstruction of the Lung-Qi. Bai Qian is a warm herb and its action of descend- ing the Lung-Qi is stronger than that of Qian Hu. It is suitable for treating damp-phlegm syndrome. Qian Hu is cold in nature and is more suitable for clearing heat in the Lung and treating phlegm-heat syndrome. Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) and Shi Gao (Gypsum) Huang Qin and Shi Gao are cold in nature and enter the Lung meridian. As they can clear heat of the Lung, they can descend the Qi and relieve the sti- fling sensation. Huang Qin is bitter and cold. As it can dry damp- ness, it is often selected in the condition of damp- heat or phlegm-heat in the Lung. When it is used with a small amount of dispersing herbs, such as Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma), its function of clearing heat becomes more active. Shi Gao is pungent, sweet and cold. It can clear dry-heat of the Lung, as well as generating the Yin. It is a mineral substance and has a strong function in descending the Lung-Qi. When it is used with herbs that open the Lung-Qi, such as Ma Huang (Ephedrae herba)*, its functions of clearing heat and arresting wheezing become more effective. Pi Pa Ye (eriobotryae folium) and Gua Lou (trichosanthis fructus) Pi Pa Ye and Gua Lou are cold in nature and enter the Lung meridian. They can effectively eliminate phlegm and clear the heat in the Lung. They are often selected in formulas because they are used not only to treat these secondary symptoms, but also to descend the Lung-Qi and moisten the Lung. Ban Xia (pinelliae rhizoma) and Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) Ban Xia and Sheng Jiang are pungent and warm, and enter the Lung meridian. They can descend the Lung-Qi and warm the Lung. They are selected in conditions where the Lung-Qi is obstructed by damp-cold or phlegm-cold. Comparing the func- tions of the two herbs, Sheng Jiang can disperse the cold, release the exterior and transform accumu- lated fluid in the Lung; Ban Xia specifically trans- forms cold-phlegm. Assistant: Regulate the Liver; tonify the Spleen and Lung; warm the Kidney; stabilize the Lung-Qi Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) and Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) The combination of Chai Hu and Bai Shao Yao can be used in the formula. They regulate the Liver-Qi as well as smooth the Lung-Qi in stressful condi- tions. They also prevent the Liver attacking the Lung 267 Syndrome of Qi stagnation and formula compositionChapter when the Lung-Qi and Liver-Qi are both obstructed. Chai Hu can ascend and disperse the Liver-Qi and promote the Qi to move freely in the San Jiao passage; Bai Shao Yao is used to nourish the Yin and blood and can therefore soften the Liver because Liver-blood is the basis of free flow of Liver-Qi. Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) Ren Shen is sweet and slightly warm. It can strengthen the Source-Qi and the Lung-Qi. It can be selected in the condition where the Lung and Kidney are both deficient, which manifests as shallow breath, tiredness and a weak voice. Rou Gui (Cinnamomi cassiae cortex) Rou Gui is sweet and warm, and enters the Kidney meridian. It can warm the Kidney-Yang and strengthen the fire of the vital gate. It is selected to treat the syndrome where the Kidney-Yang is too weak to grasp the Qi that descends from the Lung. The manifestations are cold back and lower abdomen, weakness of the legs, shortness of breath and a weak voice. Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus), Bai Guo (Ginkgo semen) and Wu Mei (Mume fructus) These herbs have a sour taste and are only used where Lung-Qi disperses excessively, such as in severe wheezing, cough and asthma. Since a sour taste may keep the phlegm inside and make the syndrome more difficult to treat, these herbs have to be used in a small dosage and in a well-organized formula. Jie Geng (platycodi radix) Jie Geng is pungent, bitter and neutral, and enters the Lung meridian. Jie Geng is light in weight and in nature, and can ascend the Lung-Qi gently but sufficiently. It is also able to transform phlegm and stop cough. In the formula to regulate the Lung-Qi, most of the herbs move downwards. A small amount of Jie Geng can ascend and open the Lung-Qi in order to accelerate the herbs that descend the Qi, thereby regulating the Lung-Qi more effectively. Envoy: Harmonize the herbs in the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and is used as envoy in the formula to reduce the stress caused by breathless- ness and to harmonize the herbs that regulate the Lung-Qi to move in different directions. Common accompanying symptoms and treatment • Lung-Qi is obstructed by exterior wind-cold: use Jing Jie (Schizonepetae herba) and Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix) to expel the wind-cold. • Lung-Qi is obstructed by exterior wind-heat: use Jin Yin Hua (Lonicerae flos), Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus), Jing Jie (Schizonepetae herba) and Sang Ye (Mori folium) to expel wind-heat. • Shortness of breath and hoarseness caused by exterior dryness: use Sang Ye (Mori folium), Tian Hua Fen (Trichosanthis radix), Lu Gen (Phragmitis rhizoma) and Bai He (Lilii bulbus) to moisten the Lung. • Constipation due to obstruction of the Lung-Qi: use Xing Ren (Armeniacae semen), Zi Su Zi (Perillae fructus), Gua Lou Ren (Trichosanthis semen) and a small amount of Jie Geng (Platycodi radix) to regulate the Qi and moisten the intestines.

Analysis of the formula This formula directs rebellious Qi downwards in the Lung, arrests wheezing, stops cough and transforms phlegm-cold. It is used to treat a syndrome where the Kidney-Yang is too weak to support the Yang and Qi of the Lung and therefore the cold-phlegm remains in the Lung for a long time. When the patient catches a cold, the Lung is obstructed by the exterior wind-cold and the cold-phlegm. The mani- festations are cough with watery, copious sputum, a stifling sensation in the chest, shallow breath, shorter inhalation and longer exhalation, tiredness, weakness of the back, edema, a white and sticky tongue coating and a rapid and restless pulse. In this formula: • The pungent and warm Zi Su Zi is used as chief to descend the Qi directly and eliminate phlegm in order to arrest wheezing. • Ban Xia, Hou Po and Qian Hu are used as deputies. They can descend the Qi, dry the cold-phlegm and enhance the strength of the chief. Qian Hu can also stop cough. • There are several assistants: – Rou Gui warms the Yang, accelerates water metabolism to eliminate phlegm, warms the Kidney-Yang and grasps the Qi to arrest wheezing. – Dang Gui can nourish the Liver-blood. It is used together with Rou Gui to improve the Liver and Kidney. – Zi Su Ye disperses the Lung-Qi and expels wind-cold in the superficial region. – Sheng Jiang and Da Zao promote digestion, strengthen the Middle-Jiao and prevent generation of phlegm. • Zhi Gan Cao is used as envoy to harmonize the functions of the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, the moving herbs and the tonifying herbs are used together; the drying herbs and the moistening herbs are used together; both Upper- and Lower-Jiao are involved; and both the manifestations and the cause of the disorder are treated. • It is clear from the herb selections and dosages that this formula focuses more on treating the manifestations than the cause. It is devised for an acute condition of wheezing. Ding Chuan Tang (Arrest Wheezing Decoction) Source: She Sheng Zong Miao Fang Bai Guo (Ginkgo semen) 9 g Ma Huang (Ephedrae herba)* 9 g Zi Su Zi (Perillae fructus) 6 g Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) 3 g Kuan Dong Hua (Tussilaginis farfarae) 9 g Xing Ren (Armeniacae semen) 9 g Sang Bai Pi (Mori cortex) 9 g Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) 6 g Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) 9 g Analysis of the formula This formula is able to descend the Lung-Qi, elimi- nate phlegm-heat and arrest wheezing. It is used for an acute condition of wheezing caused by phlegm- heat obstruction in the Lung. Originally, these patients had hidden phlegm in the Lung from unbal- anced functions of internal organs. The phlegm turns to phlegm-heat and obstructs the Lung in the condition of wind-cold invasion in the superficial region. In this formula: • Ma Huang is used as chief. It is very warm and very pungent, enters the Lung meridian and can quickly and efficiently disperse the Lung-Qi. It also enters the Bladder meridian and can eliminate the exterior pathogenic wind and cold, thus relieving cough and wheezing. • The sweet and astringent Bai Guo is also used as chief. It can eliminate phlegm as well as stabilize the Lung-Qi, and therefore arrests wheezing. When Ma Huang and Bai Guo are used together, one disperses the Lung-Qi and the other stabilizes the Lung-Qi. This combination can regulate the function of the Lung effectively. • The deputies are Zi Su Zi, Xing Ren, Ban Xia and Kuan Dong Hua. They all direct the Qi downward and eliminate phlegm, as well as stopping cough. 269 Syndrome of Qi stagnation and formula compositionChapter • Sang Bai Pi and Huang Qin serve as assistants.

## Syndrome of blood stagnation and


As one of the essential substances of the body, blood has the function of nourishing, supporting and warming the body. It is generated by the food- essence, which is transformed and transported by the Spleen. In addition, it can be generated indi- rectly from the Kidney-essence. Blood needs to move constantly and is stimulated by the Qi of the Heart and regulated by the Liver. A proper state and function of the blood depends on certain condi- tions. Generally speaking, blood prefers slight warmth and needs an unobstructed pathway. Warmth stimulates the circulation, whereas slight cold may calm the circulation. Moreover, a stable and free flow of Qi may assist the blood circulation directly. If the physiological conditions are not fulfilled, the blood may stagnate. There are different degrees of blood stagnation. In a mild case, the blood moves slower than it should. If the situation does not change, blood stagnates. In a severe case, congealed blood may be complicated by phlegm, heat or cold, and forms a solid mass that blocks the circulation. The main manifestation of blood stagnation is localized pain of a deep, sharp and piercing nature. Patients who have suffered from stagnation of blood for a long period of time may have such symptoms as a dark complexion, purple lips and nails, fragile nails and hair, and dry skin, and some may suffer from mental confusion. In women, menstruation disorders may be present. Blood stagnation is caused by several factors: • Heat may overstimulate the blood circulation, hasten its speed and even cause bleeding. • Heat can consume the fluid in the blood and make the blood thicker so that the blood movement becomes slower. • Cold may freeze the blood, allow the circulation to slow down and eventually cause stagnation. • Blood stagnation is often the result of Qi stagnation, which is frequently caused by emotional disturbance, such as stress, anger, brooding or depression for a long period. • Trauma or fracture may cause blood stagnation directly in the local area. • Wind, dampness and cold that lodges in the meridians can also cause blood stagnation, as 1. Caution during pregnancy and in bleeding conditions: Herbs that promote the blood circulation are pungent; they can make the blood circulate quickly, break up congealed blood or soften hardness. these actions may harm the fetus, causing miscarriage and heavier bleeding. 2. Use with caution in patients with weakness of the Spleen and Stomach and deficiency of Qi: Formulas that promote blood circulation are quite strong in action and have strong smells and tastes that can easily injure the Stomach and place an extra burden on the Spleen. these formulas should therefore be taken after meals, especially in patients with a sensitive stomach. Moreover, since these formulas are very active in stimulating the blood circulation, they may also consume Qi and patients may feel tired. they should be applied with caution, especially among patients who are already suffering from Qi deficiency. 3. Select appropriate herbs from the strength scale to compose a formula for treating a specific syndrome of blood stagnation: If the stagnation is severe and the applied herbs are too gentle, the congealed blood cannot be eliminated. If the blood stagnation is mild but the prescribed formula is very strong, the Qi and blood can be injured. thus, appropriate herbs should be selected from the strength scale to compose a formula for treating a specific syndrome of blood stagnation. Furthermore, appropriate herbs should be selected according to the condition and constitution of the patient, the location and nature of the stagnation and the duration of the disease. 4. Be careful when using these herbs together with anticoagulants from western medicine. can accumulation of phlegm, water, food and parasites in the body for a long period of time. • If the Qi and blood are deficient, they will not be able to promote the blood circulation, and this too will lead to blood stagnation. 273 Syndrome of blood stagnation and formula compositionCHapter eventually form a solid mass. The masses can be tumors or enlarged, hard organs. • Since the blood cannot circulate smoothly, a choppy pulse can be felt, and a purple tongue with purple spots can be observed, especially on the tip or border, the region of the Heart and Liver.

## Syndrome of blood stagnation

Main symptoms Localized pain of a deep, sharp and piercing nature, worsening in the night, and a palpable, solid, immobile mass in severe cases Secondary symptoms Dark complexion, purple lips and nails, fragile nails and fragile and dry hair, dry skin, amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, irregular menstruation, mental confusion and mental disorders Tongue A purple tongue with purple spots on the tip or border Pulse Wiry and choppy Associated disorders in western medicine Rheumatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, trauma, strain, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, sequel ae of cerebrovascular accident, chronic hepa- titis, cirrhosis of the liver, enlarged spleen, various tumors, as well as psychiatric disorders. Analysis of the syndrome • Pain is the first and most important sign of blood stagnation. Different from distending pain due to Qi stagnation, blood stagnation is manifested as a localized, deep, sharp pain. • When congealed blood is formed and the blood circulation has become slow, the patient may have a dark complexion, purple lips and nails, and menstruation becomes irregular. • When the blood is not able to nourish the body, dry skin, brittle nails, fragile and dry hair may be present. • If the blood stagnation stays for a long period of time, in severe cases congealed blood may be complicated by phlegm, heat or cold. These can 274


Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief and deputy: Regulate the blood circulation and remove congealed blood by selecting appropriate herbs according to their strength and working region A number of herbs can directly circulate the blood and remove congealed blood. In a formula, one or two herbs in reasonably large dosages are chosen as chief. They act directly against the cause of the stagnation and they reach to the affected region. To prevent side effects and to enhance the ability of the chief, herbs that move the blood should be chosen as deputies. For convenience, the chief and deputy substances are discussed together in the following groups according to their strength of function, their nature and their particular influence on a certain region. (A) Selection according to strength in function and nature Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma), Yan Hu Suo (Corydalidis rhizoma), Hong Hua (Carthami flos) and Yue Ji Hua (rosae chinensis flos) These herbs can invigorate blood and promote blood circulation. They are warm in nature. The herbs in this group are used widely in different types of disorder caused by blood stagnation. Most are effective for relieving pain and some can be used topically. Chuan Xiong is pungent and warm, and enters the Liver, Gall Bladder and Pericardium meridians. Chuan Xiong is a very effective herb to invigorate the blood and to promote the blood circulation. It is characterized by fast-moving speed and strength. As it moves upwards, downwards, inwards and out- wards, and can reach every part of the body, it is regarded as the herb that moves the Qi in the blood. In a formula, it is often selected to promote blood circulation and stop pain caused by Qi and blood stagnation complicated by cold, such as headache on the lateral side of the head, intercostal neuralgia, chest pain, pain from trauma, pain in the joints, dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea and irregular menstrua- tion. Since Chuan Xiong is very effective, it is often used as chief. In combination with other herbs, it can be used in syndromes of excess, deficiency, cold or heat. Although Chuan Xiong is effective in promoting blood circulation, it can lead the Qi and blood to ascend rapidly and therefore it should be used with caution in patients who suffer from syndromes of Liver-Yang ascending, up-flaring of Liver-fire or Heart-fire, such as hypertension, glaucoma and cer- ebrovascular accident. Moreover, since this herb is warm and very pungent, a large dosage may consume the Yin and Qi, and patients with Yin deficiency or with a weak constitution should not use this herb in large dosage. Yan Hu Suo is pungent, warm and slightly bitter. It is characterized by entering the Qi and blood level, and promoting the Qi movement and blood circulation. It is an excellent herb to relieve pain and this effect is stable and strong. In clinical practice, it can be used as a single herb, and in Chinese medicine it is considered to be a painkiller. If this herb is fried with a little vinegar, pain relief is even stronger. Yan Hu Suo is slightly poisonous and therefore should not be used for too long. It is rec- ommended for use in a formula where it can obtain assistance from other herbs, especially in the treat- ment of a chronic condition of blood stagnation. Hong Hua is pungent and warm, and enters the Heart and Liver meridians. It is able to invigorate the blood and promote the blood circulation. If a small dosage is applied, it can regulate the blood circulation; if a large dosage is applied, it can break up the congealed blood and stop pain. It can be used as chief or deputy in a formula for different types of blood stagnation, such as endometriosis, amenor- rhea, dysmenorrhea, irregular menstruation and infertility. Since it can strongly move the blood, it may cause bleeding or make bleeding heavier, thus the dosage and treatment course should be control- led carefully. During menstruation, this herb should be used in a smaller dosage or should be stopped for 3 days to avoid heavy menstrual bleeding. As well as treating menstruation disorders, Hong Hua is one of the commonly used herbs for treating trauma as it is effective for reducing swelling and pain. In these cases, it can be used both orally and topically. Yue Ji Hua is sweet and warm. It has a fragrant smell and enters the Liver meridian. It regulates not only the blood circulation, but also the Liver-Qi movement. It is often used as deputy in a formula to harmonize Qi and blood of the Liver and it par- ticularly treats menstruation disorders. 275 Syndrome of blood stagnation and formula compositionCHapter Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix) and Chi Shao Yao (paeoniae radix rubra) These herbs are cold in nature and can invigorate blood. They promote blood circulation, relieve pain and can also be used topically. Dan Shen is bitter and slightly cold, and enters the blood level of the Heart and Liver meridians. It is able to promote the blood circulation, cool the blood, calm the mind and eliminate irritability. It is especially suitable for treating the syndrome of blood stagnation complicated by heat. The syn- drome is often caused by stress and emotional dis- turbance, which lead to stagnation of Liver-Qi or generation of heat in the Liver and Heart. It is selected in formulas to treat chest pain, hypochon- driac pain, heartburn, depression, irritability, insom- nia and restlessness. It is also an important herb for treating gynecological disorders due to heat and blood stagnation, such as dysmenorrhea, irregular menstruation, premenstrual tension syndrome and menopause syndrome. Chi Shao Yao is sour, bitter and slightly cold. It is characterized by reducing the excess heat in the blood and regulating the blood circulation. It can also reduce swelling and pain and is often used in formulas to treat abscesses, furunculosis, appendici- tis, intestinal obstruction and dysmenorrhea. It can be used topically to treat pain and swelling due to trauma. Wu Ling Zhi (trogopterori faeces), Ze Lan (Lycopi herba), Yue Ji Hua (rosae chinensis flos), Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix), Yu Jin (Curcumae radix) and Yi Mu Cao (Leonuri herba) The herbs in this group can be selected as chief and deputies to dissolve congealed blood; they can also stimulate blood circulation. They are mainly used to treat the more severe or chronic syndromes of blood stagnation where the blood becomes thicker and blood clots are formed, such as in atherosclerosis, hyperlipemia, thrombosis, endometriosis, adhesions in chronic infection and after surgical operations. The herbs that are warm in nature are Wu Ling Zhi, Ze Lan and Yue Ji Hua; the herbs that are cold in nature are Dan Shen, Yu Jin and Yi Mu Cao. They can be used when cold or heat respectively is in the blood. Wu Ling Zhi is bitter, sweet and warm. The strong point of this substance is that it can dissolve congealed blood in a gentle but constant way. As it is effective for removing congealed blood without the side effect of injuring the normal part of the blood, it is used for chronic diseases when the con- gealed blood is not easily removed in a short period of time. Wu Ling Zhi can also promote blood circu- lation and stop pain. It is often prescribed in formu- las for treating gynecological disorders and liver diseases. Ze Lan is pungent and bitter, and enters the Liver and Spleen meridians. It is slightly warm and is able to promote blood circulation and open obstructions. It is characterized by removing congealed blood without the side effect of injuring the normal blood, and it is especially suitable for treating stagnation of blood caused by cold in the Lower-Jiao and in blood. As it is an aromatic herb and is able to spread the Liver-Qi and the Spleen-Qi, it is an excellent herb to treat stagnation of Liver-Qi and blood in both excess and deficiency conditions. It is often used as deputy in the formula to treat menopause syn- drome, irregular menstruation, premenstrual tension syndrome, depression, liver disease and chronic urinary tract infection. Yue Ji Hua is sweet and warm, has a fragrant smell and enters the Liver meridian. It not only regulates the blood circulation, but also dissolves congealed blood. Moreover, it can regulate the Liver-Qi. This herb is often used as deputy in a formula to regulate Qi and blood, and to reduce congealed blood in a gentle way. It is often used for menstruation disorders and liver diseases. Dan Shen is bitter and cold, and primarily enters the Heart meridian. It cools the blood and moder- ates the speed of blood circulation. It is especially effective for clearing heat in the Heart and promot- ing the blood circulation in the chest. It is often selected in a formula to treat heat and blood stagna- tion in the chest, manifested as irritability, restless- ness, palpitations, insomnia and chest pain. Dan Shen can also remove congealed blood, and is used for treating more severe conditions, such as myocar- dial infarction, angina pectoris, atherosclerosis, hyperlipemia and thrombosis. It is also used to treat hepatosplenomegaly because it can soften the organs, reduce their size and improve their func- tions. Yu Jin primarily enters the Liver meridian, on which its function focuses. It is pungent, bitter and cold, and is able to invigorate the Liver-blood. Because of the high speed of its action, it is regarded as the herb that moves the Qi in the blood and is considered as the herb that is able to break up con- 276


gealed blood. Moreover, Yu Jin can cool the blood and stop bleeding. Together with other herbs, it can be used as chief or deputy in a formula to break up and remove congealed blood and stop bleeding. It is used for dysmenorrhea, mastopathy, liver cirrhosis and tumors, as well as bleeding due to Liver heat. As well as the above-mentioned functions, this herb has other functions that can be used as a refer- ence in selecting herbs in a formula. It is an aromatic herb, and is able to penetrate damp-heat, clear damp-heat and promote bile secretion. It can be used as deputy in a formula when there is damp- heat in the Upper- and Middle-Jiao, the symptoms of which are fullness in the chest and epigastric region, jaundice and reduced appetite, such as in malaria and hepatitis. In addition, Yu Jin can spread the Liver-Qi, clear the Liver-heat and eliminate irri- tability. It can be selected to treat headache and a tight sensation in the chest caused by Qi and blood stagnation and damp-heat obstruction. Yi Mu Cao specifically treats stagnation of blood in the Lower-Jiao and is often used as deputy to treat gynecological disorders, such as dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea and irregular menstruation. It is used frequently to clear heat and remove congealed blood from the Lower-Jiao, thus it is often used in acute and chronic infections and inflammations in that region, such as cervicitis and adnexitis. Tao Ren (persicae semen), Hong Hua (Carthami flos), Yu Jin (Curcumae radix), Ru Xiang (Olibanum) and Mo Yao (Myrrhae) The substances in this group are able to break up

## congealed blood. They are also used to treat severe

and chronic blood stagnation when congealed blood is present in the body for a long period of time. The congealed blood becomes a hard clotted or solid mass, such as a tumor or swollen glands. These sub- stances are used in trauma when there is acute and severe blood stagnation with pain. They are pungent, salty or bitter in property. Tao Ren is bitter, sweet and neutral, and enters the Heart, Liver and Large Intestine meridians. Since its bitter taste is dominant, this herb moves downward and can break up congealed blood. It is often used with large dosages of Hong Hua, which is warm and pungent, and enhances the ability of Tao Ren to remove the congealed blood. Yu Jin is pungent, bitter and cold, and is able to invigorate the Liver-blood. It moves with high speed, can break up congealed blood, cool the blood and stop bleeding. Ru Xiang is warm and pungent, and enters the Heart and Liver meridians; Mo Yao is neutral and enters the Liver meridian. Ru Xiang and Mo Yao are a pair of herbs that are often used together. They can strongly disperse and descend congealed blood, open up the meridians and collaterals, and are very effective in relieving pain. If comparing the functions of the two herbs, Ru Xiang promotes the Qi movement and can also relax the tendons. As it is particularly suitable for condi- tions where the joints and muscles are very stiff, swollen and painful, it is often used in trauma or fracture, and is also more often used topically than Mo Yao. Mo Yao is more bitter and its dispersing action is stronger in breaking up congealed blood. It is used not only in trauma or fracture, but also in hard masses, such as tumor. These two herbs are often used together to enhance their therapeutic effect and they form a main part in formulas to break up congealed blood. Since both herbs have a strong smell that can easily cause nausea, and overdose may injure the stomach, they are often used in pill form and have to be taken after a meal. San Leng (Sparganii rhizoma), E Zhu (Curcumae rhizoma), Zhe Chong (eupolyphaga seu opisthoplatia)*, Mang Chong (tabanus)* and Shui Zhi (Hirudo) These substances can break up or drive out con- gealed blood. They are used to treat a solid mass that is formed by congealed blood, phlegm, damp- ness, cold or heat and toxin. Some substances in this group are poisonous. Their poisonous nature can effectively conquer the pathogenic substances in the body. They are only used in formulas that treat very severe conditions, such as hepatosplenomegaly, liver cirrhosis and cancer. San Leng and E Zhu can strongly promote Qi movement and blood circulation, and break up con- gealed blood. These two herbs are often used together to enhance their actions because San Leng is stronger in breaking up congealed blood and E Zhu is stronger in breaking up the constrained Qi. They can be used in formulas as chief or deputies to treat severe blood stagnation, such as hepatosplenomeg- aly, liver cirrhosis, ectopic pregnancy and tumors. Since San Leng and E Zhu can strongly break up congealed blood, they can also injure the Qi. For treating patients with Qi deficiency or with a weak constitution, these herbs must be used together with herbs that tonify the Qi. 277 Syndrome of blood stagnation and formula compositionCHapter Zhe Chong, Mang Chong and Shui Zhi are insects and are poisonous. They all enter the Liver meridian and are able to break up congealed blood, soften hardness and reduce masses. They are used in the treatment of hepatosplenomegaly, liver cirrhosis and tumors. Comparing their action of breaking up con- gealed blood, Zhe Chong is the weakest of the three and Mang Chong is the strongest. As these three substances can cause the side effect of injuring the Qi and blood, they should be used with caution and combined with herbs that tonify the Qi and blood in patients with deficiency syndromes. Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma), Ji Xue Teng (Spatholobi caulis et radix) and Hong Hua (Carthami flos) These herbs can regulate the blood and promote blood circulation in the entire body. Chuan Xiong is a commonly used herb for pro- moting blood circulation. It is characterized by high moving speed and strength. As it moves upwards, downwards, inwards and outwards, and can reach every part of the body, it can be used in a general condition of blood stagnation. As it is warm, pungent and moves at a high speed, it should be used with caution. Ji Xue Teng is sweet, slightly bitter and warm, and enters the Liver meridian. It can invigorate the blood and treat blood stagnation. The difference between this herb and the other herbs that promote blood circulation is that Ji Xue Teng is able to tonify blood and can treat blood deficiency, such as in chronic diseases or in patients with a weak constitu- tion. Moreover, according to the concept in tradi- tional Chinese herbal medicine, Vines enter collaterals, this herb is able to regulate the collater- als and to treat numbness, stiffness and cramp of the limbs, and is often used for treating chronic arthritis, sequelae after cerebrovascular accident, restless legs and other vascular and neurological dis- eases. Hong Hua is pungent and warm, and enters the Heart and Liver meridians. It has a dispersing nature and can promote the circulation of blood in the whole body and stop pain. It is also often used in a general condition of blood stagnation. (B) Selection according to region Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma) Chuan Xiong is particularly selected if the blood stagnation manifests in the head. It is considered as a Qi-moving herb in the blood. Its action is charac- terized by high moving speed and strength. It moves upwards and can reach the top of the head. It enters the Liver and Gall Bladder meridians and therefore effectively opens the blockage of blood on the lateral side of the head. Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma), Hong Hua (Carthami flos), Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix) and Chuan Niu Xi (Cyathulae radix) These herbs are particularly selected if the blood stagnation manifests in the chest. Chuan Xiong and Hong Hua are pungent and warm, and enter the Heart meridian. They are often chosen to promote blood circulation in the chest. They can effectively relieve chest pain and therefore are used to treat myocardial infarction and angina pectoris. Dan Shen also enters the Heart meridian, has similar functions to Chuan Xiong and Hong Hua, and it also is used in myocardial infarction and angina pectoris. However, it is cold in nature and is used in a syndrome with heat in the blood and in the Heart. Like Dan Shen, Chuan Niu Xi is cold, but it can direct the blood downward. It is particularly suitable for use when the blood and heat accumulate in the head or chest, or when blood and heat have a ten- dency of ascending. Yu Jin (Curcumae radix), Chi Shao Yao (paeoniae radix rubra), Yan Hu Suo (Corydalidis rhizoma) and Su Mu (Sappan lignum) These herbs are particularly selected if the blood stagnation manifests in the hypochondriac region and upper abdomen. Yu Jin primarily enters the Liver meridian, on which its function focuses. It is pungent, bitter and cold, and is able to invigorate the Liver-blood at a high speed. As it can also clear damp-heat, it is often used for hypochondriac pain caused by blood, dampness, Qi stagnation and heat accumulation. Chi Shao Yao is sour, bitter and slightly cold. It is characterized by reducing excess heat in the blood and regulating the blood circulation. It is good at reducing pain and swelling due to trauma. 278


Yan Hu Suo is pungent, warm and slightly bitter. It is characterized by entering the Qi and blood level and promoting the Qi movement and blood circula- tion. It is an excellent herb to relieve pain and its action is steady and strong. Su Mu is sweet, salty, pungent and cold, and enters the Heart, Liver and Spleen meridians. The dominant pungent taste brings about a strong dis- persing action. A small dosage of Su Mu can activate the blood circulation and a large dosage can break up congealed blood. It is often used for gynecologi- cal disorders caused by Liver-blood stagnation. It is also an important herb to reduce pain and swelling in trauma. Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix), Yue Ji Hua (rosae chinensis flos), Ze Lan (Lycopi herba), Yi Mu Cao (Leonuri herba) and Wu Ling Zhi (trogopterori faeces) These herbs are particularly selected if the blood stagnation manifests in the abdomen. They are often used for irregular menstruation, dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, infection and inflammation in the pelvis. Dang Gui is pungent, sweet and warm, and enters the Liver, Spleen and Heart meridians. It can tonify and warm the blood, and stimulate the blood circulation in a gentle but steady way. Yue Ji Hua is sweet and warm, has a fragrant smell and enters the Liver meridian. It can reduce congealed blood in a gentle way and is often used for menstruation disorders and liver diseases. Ze Lan can disperse the constrained Liver-Qi, remove congealed blood and stop pain. It is a very important herb for regulating menstruation and is a commonly used herb for gynecological disorders. Yi Mu Cao has functions similar to those of Ze Lan, but is cold in temperature. It is often chosen to treat dysmenorrhea, endometriosis and inflamma- tions in the pelvis due to heat in the blood. Wu Ling Zhi is sweet and warm, and enters the Liver meridian. It is an important substance to stop pain caused by blood stagnation. It is characterized by gradually dissolving the congealed blood without consuming the normal blood, which is the side effect of most herbs that move blood. Tao Ren (persicae semen) and Hong Hua (Carthami flos) These herbs are particularly selected if the blood stagnation manifests in the lower abdomen. Tao Ren and Hong Hua are warm and pungent. Since Tao Ren moves downward and can break up congealed blood, and Hong Huan can enhance this function, they are often used together to treat blood stagnation in the Lower-Jiao. Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma), Su Mu (Sappan lignum), Chuan Niu Xi (Cyathulae radix) and Jiang Huang (Curcumae longae rhizoma) These herbs are particularly selected if the blood stagnation manifests in the limbs. They all have a strong moving ability, are able to open up the meridians and treat stiffness and pain of the limbs. As their high speed and strength can also expel cold, wind and dampness, they are often used for treating Bi syndrome caused by wind, cold and dampness. Wang Bu Liu Xing (Vaccariae semen), Lu Lu Tong (Liquidambaris fructus) and Di Long (pheretima) These herbs are particularly selected if the blood stagnation manifests in the collaterals. Wang Bu Liu Xing, Lu Lu Tong and Di Long are commonly used substances to open the collaterals. They can eliminate congealed blood from the col- laterals and promote Qi movement and blood circu- lation. They are often used as deputies in formulas to treat chronic pain, stubborn pain, tingling and stiffness or numbness of the limbs, such as in migraine, sequelae of cerebrovascular accident and other neurological disorders. Tao Ren (persicae semen), Hong Hua (Carthami flos), Ru Xiang (Olibanum), Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma), Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix), San Qi (Notoginseng radix) and Xue Jie (Daemonoropsis resina) These herbs are particularly selected for topical use. They can be used for making lotions, ointments, tinctures and plasters. They should be applied when the bleeding has stopped and not on an open wound. San Qi is an exception. As it can stop bleeding and remove congealed blood at the same time, it can be applied to an open wound. 279 Syndrome of blood stagnation and formula compositionCHapter Assistant: (A) Promote the Qi movement, warm the interior, eliminate dampness and phlegm, tonify the Qi so as to promote blood circulation and remove congealed blood (B) Nourish the blood and Yin, protect the Stomach and Spleen to reduce the side effect of the herbs that stimulate blood She Xiang (Moschus)**, Cong Bai (allii fistulosi bulbus) and alcohol These substances particularly promote Qi move- ment in the head. They are warm and pungent, and move quickly and forcefully. They have a strong ascending and dispersing ability, and therefore are often used to stimulate the Qi to promote blood circulation in the head. Tan Xiang (Santali albi lignum) and Jiang Zhen Xiang (Dalbergiae odoriferae lignum) These herbs particularly promote Qi movement in the chest. They are aromatic herbs and have a strong and quick action to stimulate the Qi movement in the chest to promote blood circulation. They can broaden the chest and relieve pain and a stifling sensation in the chest. Jie Geng (platycodi radix) and Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) These herbs particularly regulate the Qi in the Upper-Jiao. Jie Geng and Chai Hu are pungent in nature and enter the Lung and Gall Bladder meridians respec- tively. They have ascending and dispersing proper- ties, and can ascend and spread the constrained Qi in the Upper-Jiao. They are often used together with herbs that descend the Qi in the chest to acti- vate the Qi and blood in this region. Xiang Fu (Cyperi rhizoma), Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) and Mu Xiang (aucklandiae radix)** These herbs particularly promote Qi movement in the Liver. Xiang Fu is the most commonly used herb to regulate the Liver-Qi in the San Jiao meridian. It is a gentle but effective herb and can be used for a long period of time. Chai Hu enters the Liver and Gall Bladder merid- ians. It has an ascending property and is more suit- able for spreading the constrained Qi and treating hypochondrial distension. Mu Xiang is an aromatic herb. It can effectively move the Qi. It particularly relieves pain due to its strong action of moving the Qi. Since it also enters the Spleen and Large Intestine meridians, it is more suitable for treating pain in the hypochondriac region and abdomen. Xiang Yuan (Citri fructus) and Fo Shou (Citri sarcodactylis fructus) These two herbs particularly promote Qi movement in the Liver and Stomach. Xiang Yuan and Fo Shou are sour and warm, and enter the Liver and Stomach meridians. They can harmonize the Qi of the Liver and Stomach, and are often used in the condition where Liver-Qi overacts on the Stomach, causing poor appetite and fullness in the stomach and hypochondriac regions. Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) and Zhi Ke (aurantii fructus) These herbs particularly promote Qi movement in the upper abdomen. Chen Pi and Zhi Ke can regulate the Qi in the Lung and Stomach, remove phlegm and promote digestion. They can reduce fullness of the stomach and improve appetite. Both are pungent, but as Chen Pi is warm and Zhi Ke is cold, they can be selected separately to meet treatment need. Wu Yao (Linderae radix), Qing Pi (Citri reticulatae viride pericarpium) and Zhi Shi (aurantii fructus immaturus) These herbs particularly promote Qi movement in the lower abdomen. These herbs are able to promote Qi movement in the Lower-Jiao and stimulate blood circulation there. They also treat Qi stagnation and reduce distension directly. They are all strong herbs and can effectively reduce pain caused by Qi stagnation. Since they enter different meridians, they can treat Qi stagnation in different regions: Wu Yao enters the Kidney and Bladder meridians, Qing Pi the Liver meridian and Zhi Shi the Large Intestine meridian. 280


Qin Jiao (Gentianae macrophyllae radix), Qiang Huo (Notopterygii rhizoma), Du Huo (angelicae pubescentis radix), Wei Ling Xian (Clematidis radix), Fu Zi (aconiti radix lateralis preparata)*, Di Long (pheretima), Quan Xie (Scorpio)* and Wu Gong (Scolopendra)* These herbs particularly expel wind, damp and cold, and promote Qi movement in the limbs. In chronic Bi syndromes, blood stagnation often presents with wind, damp, cold or heat in the syn- drome. Because wind, dampness and cold can block the Qi and blood circulation, they should be removed in order to improve the blood circulation. Qin Jiao is particularly used to expel wind-damp- ness; Qiang Huo and Du Huo can expel wind, cold and dampness; Wei Ling Xian and Fu Zi, the toxic but strong herbs, can expel the cold and particularly reduce pain; Di Long, Quan Xie and Wu Gong are able to expel wind from the collaterals and relax the stiffness and numbness. They are often used with herbs that regulate the blood, particularly those entering the meridians and collaterals. Xing Ren (armeniacae semen), Bai Dou Kou (amomi fructus rotundus), Yi Yi Ren (Coicis semen), Hou Po (Magnoliae cortex), Qin Jiao (Gentianae macrophyllae radix) and Cang Zhu (atractylodis rhizoma) These herbs are particularly selected for eliminating dampness and phlegm. When blood stagnates, the Qi is also obstructed. If it fails to accelerate the digestion and the water metabolism, dampness, phlegm and food may accu- mulate. Herbs that eliminate these pathological products can also reduce the causes of blood stagna- tion and therefore improve the condition of the blood. Xing Ren, pungent and warm, is able to remove the phlegm and descend the Lung-Qi. It is particu- larly suitable for use when there is damp-phlegm in the Lung. Both Bai Dou Kou and Yi Yi Ren can eliminate dampness from the Middle-Jiao. Bai Dou Kou can regulate the Qi and transform dampness; Yi Yi Ren is able to promote urination and therefore to leach out dampness. Hou Po is pungent and warm, and can remove the dampness from the Upper-, Middle- and Lower- Jiao. It can also remove phlegm, descend the Qi and reduce the fullness and distending sensation. It is thus a very commonly used and effective herb in a general sense to activate Qi, and to remove damp and phlegm. Qin Jiao and Cang Zhu are pungent herbs that can dry and disperse dampness. As they can elimi- nate dampness from muscles and meridians, they are often used in treating Bi syndrome. Cong Bai (allii fistulosi bulbus), Xie Bai (allii macrostemi bulbus), Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens), Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma), Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) and Rou Gui (Cinnamomi cassiae cortex) These herbs are selected to warm the interior, promote blood circulation and remove congealed blood. All the herbs in this group are warm and pungent. Cong Bai and Xie Bai are often used to disperse cold in the Upper-Jiao and to stimulate Heart-Yang. Sheng Jiang is more suitable to warm the Stomach, and Gan Jiang to warm the Spleen. As for Gui Zhi and Rou Gui, the former enters the Heart meridian and is effective for promoting Yang and Qi circula- tion in the meridians and limbs; the latter enters the Kidney meridian and is particularly able to warm the Lower-Jiao and the Kidney-Yang. Huang Qi (astragali radix), Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix), Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix), Hei Zhi Ma (Sesami semen nigricum) and E Jiao (asini corii colla) These herbs are selected to tonify the Qi, and to nourish the blood and Yin to reduce the side effect of herbs that stimulate the blood. Since the herbs that promote blood circulation and remove or break up congealed blood are pungent, they easily consume the Qi and injure the blood and Yin. Patients may feel tired during treatment, espe- cially patients who suffer from chronic diseases or have a weak constitution, and therefore herbs that tonify should be used as assistants. Huang Qi is warm and sweet, and enters the Lung and Spleen meridians. It can powerfully tonify the Qi and strengthen the muscles. It can be used as corrective assistant in the formula to prevent and treat Qi deficiency. It can also be used as assistant for strengthening the Qi to invigorate the blood and promote blood circulation. 281 Syndrome of blood stagnation and formula compositionCHapter Dang Gui is often used as a helping assistant to tonify the blood and promote blood circulation. It treats a syndrome where blood stagnation and blood deficiency coexist. It also serves as a corrective assistant. It nourishes the blood that has been con- sumed by pungent and warm herbs that promote Qi and blood in the formula. Hei Zhi Ma and E Jiao can tonify the blood and Yin, and moisten dryness. They are used to treat dry skin, fragile nails and brittle hair due to blood stag- nation and blood deficiency. Sheng Di Huang is sweet, bitter and cold. It can nourish the Yin and reduce heat to allow blood to move smoothly and calmly. It is particularly suitable for situations where blood and Yin are weak and heat is in the blood, or where pungent and warm herbs have injured the Yin of the body. All of these can make the blood circulation slow down. Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata), Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) and Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) These herbs are selected to protect the Stomach and Spleen. Herbs that promote blood circulation and break up congealed blood can injure the Stomach and Spleen, disturb their ascending and descending functions and cause nausea, fullness or pain of the stomach. Zhi Gan Cao, Sheng Jiang and Da Zao are often used to prevent these disorders. Sheng Jiang can soothe the Stomach Qi and promote digestion, and Da Zao can tonify the Qi and blood. They are often used together to strengthen the function of the Stomach and Spleen, protecting them from damage by disease as well as from the side effects of the harsh herbs. Zhi Gan Cao not only tonifies the Qi and moder- ates the harsh action of the strong herbs, it also eases the muscles. Furthermore, as it can reduce tension in the Middle-Jiao, it is often used to protect the Stomach and Spleen. Envoy: Harmonize the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao can moderate the herbs that have strong actions and integrate the functions of all the herbs that work on different aspects and in different directions in a formula. Examples of classical formulas The following six formulas are all devised by a famous, courageous physician, Wang Qing-ren (1766–1831). He did not follow the previous theory that there is only clear Qi moving in the chest. He observed different organs and blood vessels and he came to the conclusion that the chest is the resi- dence of the blood. In his book Correcting the Errors in the Forest of Medicine (Yi Lin Gai Cuo), he created these formu- las to drive out congealed blood and promote blood circulation. In his formulas, he selected herbs to treat blood stagnation in different regions. In addi- tion, he paid attention to the relationship between Qi and blood, and selected herbs to move and tonify Qi and to stimulate Yang respectively.

The manifestations are pain in the chest and hypo- chondria, stubborn headache with a fixed piercing quality, hiccups, palpitations, restlessness, insomnia, irritability, a dull complexion, dark purplish lips, purple tongue with dark spots on the border, and a choppy, wiry or tight pulse. The composition of the formula can be divided into two parts: 282


• The first part is to stimulate the blood – Chuan Xiong, Tao Ren, Hong Hua, Chi Shao Yao, Chuan Niu Xi and Dang Gui are in this group. • The second part is to activate the Qi movement in the chest to drive out the blood stasis – Chai Hu, Jie Geng, Zhi Ke and Chuan Niu Xi are in this group. Commentary on strategies The strategies are shown in combining Chai Hu, Jie Geng, Zhi Ke and Chuan Niu Xi. Chai Hu and Jie Geng disperse and ascend the Qi; Zhi Ke moves Qi horizontally so that it can open and broaden the chest; Chuan Niu Xi, together with Tao Ren, can lead the blood downwards. With this combination, Qi and blood are moving actively in the chest in a clear downward direction because the dosages of Chuan Niu Xi and Tao Ren are larger than the ascending herbs. In this way the congealed blood can be driven out from the chest. Tong Qiao Huo Xue Tang (Unblock the Orifice and Invigorate the Blood Decoction) Source: Yi Lin Gai Cuo because they can reach the head, disperse the Qi to stimulate the blood and open up the meridians in the head. • Alcohol can enhance the moving speed and strength of all the herbs in the formula.

The manifestations are stubborn headache, vertigo, tinnitus, deafness, hair loss, dark color around the eyes, a dull complexion, a purple tongue and a choppy pulse. • In this formula, in addition to using blood- moving herbs, She Xiang and Cong Bai – strong, pungent and aromatic substances – are used Wu Ling Zhi (Trogopterori faeces) 9 g Dang Gui (Angelicae sinensis radix) 9 g Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma) 6 g Tao Ren (Persicae semen) 9 g Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex) 6 g Chi Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix rubra) 6 g Wu Yao (Linderae radix) 6 g Yan Hu Suo (Corydalidis rhizoma) 3 g Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) 9 g Xiang Fu (Cyperi rhizoma) 3 g Hong Hua (Carthami flos) 9 g Zhi Ke (Aurantii fructus) 5 g Analysis of the formula and commentary on strategies This formula is used for blood stasis and Liver-Qi stagnation in the area below the diaphragm. The manifestations are palpable abdominal masses accompanied by fixed pain, and chronic malnutri- tion in children. • In the composition, in addition to using the blood-moving herbs in general, Wu Ling Zhi and Yan Hu Suo are selected. They enter the Liver meridian and are particularly used to treat blood stagnation in the hypochondriac region. • In addition, both warm and cold herbs are used. Herbs that tonify the blood and herbs that reduce congealed blood are used together. They balance the physiological need of the blood and the function of the Liver. • Moreover, just like the composition of other formulas in this series, the herbs Xiang Fu, Zhi Ke and Wu Yao can promote Qi movement and are used to stimulate the blood in this specific region. 283 Syndrome of blood stagnation and formula compositionCHapter Shao Fu Zhu Yu Tang (Drive out Blood Stasis in the Lower Abdomen Decoction) Source: Yi Lin Gai Cuo Xiao Hui Xiang (Foeniculi fructus) 1 5 g Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma) 3 g Yan Hu Suo (Corydalidis rhizoma) 3 g Dang Gui (Angelicae sinensis radix) 9 g Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma) 3 g Mo Yao (Myrrhae) 3 g Rou Gui (Cinnamomi cassiae cortex) 3 g Chi Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix rubra) 6 g Pu Huang (Typhae pollen) 9 g Wu Ling Zhi (Trogopterori faeces) 6 g Analysis of the formula and commentary on strategies This formula is used for blood stasis in the lower abdomen. The symptoms are palpable masses or pain in the lower abdomen, irregular menstruation, dark purple menstrual flow with black clots, and a cold, cramping sensation in the lower abdomen. • In this formula, in addition to using blood- moving herbs in general, the warm herbs Pu Huang, Rou Gui, Xiao Hui Xiang and Gan Jiang are chosen to warm the Yang of the Kidney and Spleen so as to activate the Qi movement and warm the blood in the Lower-Jiao. • At the same time, herbs that promote blood circulation and remove congealed blood in the Lower-Jiao, particularly in the Liver meridian, such as Yan Hu Suo, Wu Ling Zhi and Mo Yao, are selected.

The symptoms are chronic pain of all joints and general pain of the body. In this formula, the herbs that promote blood circulation are used as in the other formulas men- tioned previously. • Moreover, substances such as Di Long and Chuan Xiong, which can reach the collaterals, are applied. • Herbs that expel wind, cold and dampness are also used, such as Qin Jiao and Qiang Huo, to encounter the need of treating Bi syndrome. • Chuan Xiong, Mo Yao and Xiang Fu are also used to stimulate the Qi so as to enhance the strength of eliminating the congealed blood, wind, cold and dampness.

Analysis of the formula This formula tonifies the Qi, invigorates the blood and opens up the meridians. It is used for treating sequelae of wind-stroke, including hemiplegia, paralysis and atrophy of the lower limbs due to deficiency of Qi and stasis of blood. The blood stag- nates in the collaterals for a long period of time, resulting in coldness, swelling, numbness, tingling and pain of the affected limbs. The tongue is pale or dark with a white coating and the pulse is weak and slow. In this formula: • Huang Qi, as chief, is used in a very large dosage. The strategy is to tonify the Qi strongly in order to stimulate the blood circulation. Huang Qi can also warm and strengthen the muscles directly. The remaining substances in the formula are deputies. • Dang Gui, Chuan Xiong, Chi Shao and Hong Hua stimulate the blood circulation. • Tao Ren breaks up the congealed blood in the collaterals with the help of Di Long which opens the collaterals. Commentary on strategies • This formula suggests a treatment method by tonifying the Qi and therefore stimulating the blood. • In clinical practice, the dosage of Huang Qi should be reduced to a dosage in a common range. Dr Wang Qing-ren explained that the circulation of the blood in the entire body can be considered in ten portions and that, in the situation of hemiplegia, half of the ten portions are blocked. With the help of this formula, the blood circulation in that half can be recovered, hence the name of this formula – Tonify the Yang to Restore Five (tenths) Decoction.

## Syndrome of bleeding and


Blood is one of the basic substances in the body and supports all the physiological functions of the internal organs. Heavy bleeding or prolonged bleeding may bring serious consequences. Bleeding should be stopped in time in these severe and acute conditions. Bleeding exists in different conditions. All kinds of factors that directly injure the blood vessels can cause bleeding, such as in trauma and injury. For internal diseases, bleeding may occur when certain functions – particularly of the Heart, Liver and Spleen – are disturbed, because the Heart governs the blood, the Liver regulates the blood and the Spleen holds the blood in its pathway. Among the dysfunctions of these organs, heat in the blood, cold in the blood and stagnation of blood are the main direct causes of bleeding, because: • heat can stimulate the blood and force the blood to leave its normal pathway • cold can slow the blood circulation and lead to blood stagnation, thus the blood behind the stagnation is not able to follow its normal pathway • blood stagnation can cause bleeding directly when the blood behind the stagnation is forced to find a new pathway, such as in different types of tumor • weakness of Spleen-Qi from poor nutrition and chronic diseases may fail to control the blood and cause chronic bleeding.

## Syndrome of bleeding

Tongue In acute conditions: red or purple tongue body with a white or yellow coating In chronic conditions: pale with teeth marks and a white coating Pulse In acute conditions: slippery, forceful and rapid In chronic conditions: weak, thready, rapid or slow Main symptoms Bleeding caused by trauma or injury, nose bleeds, gum bleeding, retinal bleeding, coughing out or vomiting blood, blood in the urine or stool, heavy menstruation and purpura The amount of blood loss can be large or small; the color can be red, dark-red, purple-red or pinkish; the quality can be thin or thick Secondary symptoms In chronic conditions: pale complexion, dizziness, general weakness, shortness of breath, cold sensation of the body, or irritability, thirst, insomnia, palpitations, warm palms Associated disorders in western medicine Bleeding caused by injury; acute or chronic blood diseases such as thrombocytopenia, anemia, leuke- mia, allergic purpura; diseases that lead to a bleeding condition, such as bronchiectasis, bleeding due to infection or abscess of the lung, gastric ulcer, duo- denal ulcer, colitis, dysentery, hemorrhoids, urinary tract infection, stones in the urinary tract and bladder, dysfunctional uterine hemorrhage, hystero- myoma, heavy uterine bleeding due to retained placenta. Analysis of the syndrome Bleeding occurs when the blood vessels are injured. No matter which region is involved, the reasons are mainly pathogenic heat, cold, Spleen-Qi deficiency or obstruction of Qi and blood in the related regions. • Heavy bleeding with a red color indicates the presence of heat. • Chronic bleeding of small amount and with a pinkish color indicates deficiency of Qi. • Purple-red or dark-red color of the blood with pain indicates blood stagnation or cold in the blood. • Nose bleeds and coughing blood are related to the Lung. • Vomiting blood is related to the Stomach. • Blood in the stool is related to the Large Intestine. • Bleeding of swollen gums with a foul smell in the mouth is related to excess heat in the Stomach. • Slight bleeding of gums with loose teeth is related to empty-heat in the Kidney. • Retinal bleeding is related to up-flaring of Liver- fire with stagnation of blood in the Heart. • Blood in the urine is related to the Bladder and Small Intestine. 287 Syndrome of bleeding and formula compositionChapter • Uterine bleeding is related to dysfunction of the Chong, Ren and Dai meridians. • Purpura or chronic bleeding indicates weakness of the Spleen-Qi. If the loss of blood is excessive, Qi and Yang scatter because they lose their carrier. • When Qi and blood are weak, the patient may feel dizzy and weak with a pale complexion, and shortness of breath. • When Yang is too weak to warm the body, a cold sensation arises. A pale tongue and a weak, thready pulse may be present. At the compensation stage, the pulse may be rapid and floating, but hollow. If there is heat in the blood, it consumes Yin. • Heat may push the blood and disturb the functions of the Heart and Liver. Patients may present with irritability, thirst, insomnia and palpitations, a red tongue and a rapid and thready pulse. (See Figure 12.1 on page 295.) Treatment principle: Stop bleeding in time, treat the cause of bleeding and regulate the internal organs 1. Select treatment sequence according to the intensity of bleeding: herbs that stop bleeding are particularly used for relatively acute conditions in order to control the bleeding in time. they treat the manifestation rather than the cause of the syndrome. however, after bleeding stops, even when bleeding still exists, herbs that treat the causes can be applied. 2. Send patients to hospital in a severe bleeding condition: although the formulas that stop bleeding are effective in treating many kinds of bleeding conditions, patients should be sent to hospital immediately when heavy bleeding may bring danger to the patients. If it is impossible to reach a hospital in a short time, a large dose of ren Shen (Ginseng radix) should be applied together with the herbs that stop bleeding in order to hold the Qi so as to control the blood and stop bleeding on the way to the hospital. 3. Choose herbs according to the location of bleeding: If the bleeding is in the upper part of the body, herbs that have dispersing and ascending properties should not be used, or used only in combination with descending herbs. If the bleeding is in the lower part of the body, herbs that have a descending tendency should not be used. 4. Use for only a short period of time: Since the herbs that stop bleeding have sour, astringent and cold properties, they may cause blood stagnation and complicate the syndrome. Formulas that stop bleeding should not be used for a long period of time. 5. Caution in using tonifying and warming herbs: Since tonifying and warming herbs can strengthen the Qi and stimulate the Yang, they may overstimulate the blood and make bleeding heavier in a severe bleeding condition when Qi is unable to hold the blood. they should therefore be used with caution and their dosages should be gradually increased after the bleeding stops or slows down. 6. prevent blood stagnation: Stopping bleeding suddenly may cause blood stagnation because most of the herbs that stop bleeding are sour, astringent and cold. as soon as the bleeding stops, herbs that treat or prevent congealed blood should be used. 288


Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Directly stop bleeding by using sour, astringent and charred herbs; tonify Qi to hold the blood; stop bleeding by treating the cause and symptoms together Bai Ji (Bletillae tuber)**, Ou Jie (Nelumbinis nodus rhizomatis), Zong Lü (Stipulae trachycarpi fibra) and Hua Rui Shi (Ophicalcitum) Since sour and astringent substances have an inward moving tendency, these substances can stop bleed- ing. They treat the symptom of bleeding rather than the cause and are often used in different bleeding conditions as a first aid procedure. Zao Xin Tu (terra flava usta) and Long Gu (Mastodi fossilium ossis) These astringent substances can directly reverse the abnormal leakage of blood. They treat the symptom of bleeding rather than the cause and they are used as a first aid procedure. Partially charred herbs In traditional Chinese medicine, it is believed that partially charred herbs can directly and effectively stop bleeding. After being charred, herbs gain astrin- gent properties that can help stabilize blood and stop bleeding. In clinical practice, many herbs are par- tially charred for this purpose. Commonly used par- tially charred herbs are Da Jì (Cirsii japonici herba seu radix), Xiao Ji (Cirsii herba), Pu Huang (Typhae pollen), Ou Jie (Nelumbinis nodus rhizomatis), Zong Lü (Stipulae trachycarpi fibra) and Xue Yu Tan (Crinis carbonisatus). Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) In a very severe bleeding condition, if it is impossible to reach a hospital in time, or the speed of blood loss is faster than that of the blood transfusion, a large dose of Ren Shen should be applied together with herbs that stop bleeding. It can hold the Source-Qi in order to hold the blood. Da Jì (Cirsii japonici herba seu radix) and Xiao Ji (Cirsii herba) These herbs can treat bleeding caused by heat. Da Jì and Xiao Ji are sweet and cold, and enter the Liver and Heart meridians. The fresh or raw herbs are able to cool blood and stop bleeding. Da Jì is colder than Xiao Ji and has a stronger action in reducing heat, cooling blood and stopping bleeding. It is used for bleeding caused by heat, such as in pulmonary tuberculosis, gastric ulcer, menor- rhagia or diseases of the liver. Xiao Ji is not as cold, and its function of cooling blood and stopping bleeding is not as strong as that of Da Jì. It is particularly effective in reducing heat in the Lower-Jiao and in treating bleeding caused by damp-heat in the Lower-Jiao, such as in acute urinary tract infection, cystitis and pyelonephritis. If they are charred, these herbs gain astringent properties, and can stabilize blood and stop bleed- ing. In clinical practice, they are often used together to enhance their actions of stopping bleeding. Xiao Ji (Cirsii herba) and Bai Mao Gen (Imperatae rhizoma) Xiao Ji and Bai Mao Gen are sweet and cold. Both can cool blood and stop bleeding. They can also promote urination and eliminate damp-heat from the Lower-Jiao. They are especially effective in treating blood in the urine caused by damp-heat, which injures the blood vessels and disturbs the local blood circulation in the Lower-Jiao. Xiao Ji enters the Heart and Liver meridians. Besides cooling the blood and stopping the bleeding, it can also promote urination and reduce edema. Bai Mao Gen enters the Lung and Stomach meridians. Compared with Xiao Ji, it has a weaker function of cooling the blood and stopping the bleeding in the Lower-Jiao. The characteristic of Bai Mao Gen is that it not only stops bleeding in the Lower-Jiao, but also in the Upper-Jiao, such as nose bleeds and coughing blood. It also generates body fluids and relieves thirst. It is more suitable for situations where patients suffer from thirst, dry mouth and nose, and, at the same time, have blood in the urine, such as in acute urinary tract infection, nephritis and after a febrile disease. Huai Hua (Sophorae flos), Huai Jiao (Sophorae fructus) and Di Yu (Sanguisorbae radix) These three herbs are bitter and cold, and their moving tendency in the body is downward. They enter the Liver and Large Intestine meridians. They are effective for clearing heat in the Lower-Jiao, cooling blood and stopping bleeding, and are used in the treatment of colitis, dysentery and hemorrhoids. 289 Syndrome of bleeding and formula compositionChapter In clinical practice, they are often used together to increase this therapeutic effect. Huai Hua is slightly cold. Its functions of clearing heat and cooling blood are not as strong as that of the other two herbs, but it has a stronger function of stopping bleeding than Huai Jiao. It is an impor- tant herb for treating dysentery and hemorrhoids. Since it enters the Liver meridian, and the flower has a tendency to ascend and disperse constrained heat, it can cool the Liver and clear heat in the head at the same time. Huai Jiao is colder than Huai Hua, and its func- tions of clearing heat and reducing fire are also stronger. Since it moves downwards, it is very effec- tive for treating hemorrhoids and is often added to creams for topical use. Like Huai Hua, it also has the function of clearing heat in the Liver. Di Yu is bitter, sour and cold. Not only does it cool the blood and stop bleeding, it also contracts and holds the blood. It treats bleeding in the Lower- Jiao and is used for colitis and menorrhagia. As it is also able to reduce swelling and stop pain, it is suit- able for treating external hemorrhoids. Fresh herbs Fresh herbs can cool the blood and stop bleeding. As they are considered stronger in cooling blood and clearing heat, they are more effective for treating bleeding conditions than dry herbs. Commonly used fresh herbs are Xiao Ji (Cirsii herba), Bai Mao Gen (Imperatae rhizoma), Huai Hua (Sophorae flos) and Di Yu (Sanguisorbae radix). San Qi (Notoginseng radix) San Qi is a very effective herb for stopping bleeding due to stagnation of blood. It is sweet, slightly bitter and warm, and enters the Liver and Stomach merid- ians. Sweetness can slow down the development of a critical situation, warmth can unblock meridians and bitterness can purge congealed blood. San Qi is effective in breaking up congealed blood and harmonizing it. As soon as the congealed blood has disappeared, the blood turns back to its normal pathway and the bleeding will stop. If the blood circulates properly, the swelling is reduced and the pain stops. Since San Qi can treat bleeding due to blood stagnation, and can stop bleeding without the side effect of causing new blood stagnation, it is widely used in the treatment of trauma, wounds, skin ulcers, carbuncles, epistaxis, hematemesis, uterine bleeding, blood in the urine and intestinal hemor- rhage. It can be used internally and topically. Qian Cao Gen (rubiae radix), Sheng Pu Huang (typhae pollen), Xue Yu Tan (Crinis carbonisatus) and Hua Rui Shi (Ophicalcitum) These herbs treat bleeding due to stagnation of blood. All these substances have the function of promot- ing blood circulation and stopping bleeding. They are particularly used when the bleeding is caused by obstruction of congealed blood, such as in menor- rhagia caused by hysteromyoma, and heavy bleeding due to retained placenta after labor. Ai Ye (artemisiae argyi folium), Pao Jiang (quick-fried Zingiberis rhizoma preparatum) and Zao Xin Tu (terra flava usta) These three substances treat bleeding due to inter- nal cold. Ai Ye is warm and aromatic, and enters the Liver, Spleen and Kidney meridians. It is able to warm the interior, expel cold, stop bleeding and alleviate pain. Its function focuses on the blood level of the Lower- Jiao. It is effective in treating menorrhagia, uterine bleeding during pregnancy, and uterine bleeding due to hysteromyoma when there is cold in the Lower- Jiao and in the blood. This herb can also be used topically. Ai Ye is also used in moxibustion. It is the sub- stance from which the moxa sticks are made. It can penetrate the skin and meridians, warm the Qi and blood, and expel internal cold. Pao Jiang is bitter and warm, enters the Spleen and Liver meridians and also enters the blood level. Like Ai Ye, it can warm the interior, stop bleeding and alleviate pain, but its function focuses on the Middle-Jiao. It is especially effective for treating bleeding due to Spleen-Yang and Qi deficiency failing to control the blood. Such bleeding may be located in the stomach, intestines and uterus. Zao Xi Tu is warm and astringent, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. It warms the inte- rior and stops bleeding in both the Middle- and Lower-Jiao, such as bleeding from the stomach, intestines and uterus. Moreover, it binds up the intestines and stops diarrhea. It is more suitable for conditions of Spleen-Yang deficiency, such as chronic colitis, which manifests as abdominal pain and cramp, diarrhea, intestinal hemorrhage, cold hands and feet, and a pale complexion. 290


Deputy: Treat the cause of bleeding Zhi Mu (anemarrhenae rhizoma), Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix), Nu Zhen Zi (Ligustri lucidi fructus) and Han Lian Cao (ecliptae herba) These herbs are able to cool the blood, reduce heat and nourish the Yin. They can be used alone or in combination for treating bleeding due to Yin defi- ciency with empty-fire in the blood. Zhi Mu and Sheng Di Huang are stronger in cooling the blood and should not be used for too long, otherwise they may cause blood stagnation. Nu Zhen Zi and Han Lian Cao are more gentle. Not only can they be used for a longer period of time without the blood stagnation side effect of Zhi Mu and Sheng Di Huang, they can also be used in generating the Yin of the Kidney without cloying, sticky side effects. Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix), Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) and Huang Bai (phellodendri cortex) Huang Qin, Huang Lian and Huang Bai are bitter and cold. They can strongly clear heat and reduce fire. They are used for treating excess heat in the body. Huang Qin particularly reduces heat in the Lung and Large Intestine, Huang Lian in the Heart and Liver, and Huang Bai in the Kidney and Bladder. When the heat spreads in the entire body, these three herbs are often used together for a short period to powerfully reduce the excess heat. Huang Qi (astragali radix) and Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Huang Qi is sweet and warm, and enters the Lung and Spleen meridians. It can tonify the Spleen- Qi and Lung-Qi, and has an ascending tendency. It is often used in a chronic bleeding condition due to Spleen deficiency that fails to control the blood. Zhi Gan Cao is sweet in nature and primarily enters the Spleen meridian. It can tonify the Qi, slow down pathological development, ease the muscles and tendons, and stabilize the Qi and blood. It tonifies the Qi without the side effect of stimulat- ing the Qi, and is particularly suitable in a crucial bleeding condition when the Qi and blood are too weak to bear strong tonification. Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) and E Jiao (asini corii colla) These two substances can tonify the blood and are often used in chronic bleeding conditions. Unlike many tonifying herbs that can move the blood, Bai Shao Yao and E Jiao tonify and stabilize the blood because Bai Shao Yao is sour and E Jiao is sweet. They can either tonify the blood or stop the bleeding. Assistant: Harmonize internal organs and smooth the blood circulation; reduce the side effect of herbs that stop bleeding; tonify and ascend the Spleen- Qi, control the blood, reduce the speed of bleeding; stabilize the Qi and blood Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex), Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix) and San Qi (Notoginseng radix) These herbs are used to promote blood circulation and disperse congealed blood. A small amount of Mu Dan Pi, Dan Shen or San Qi can be used as corrective assistants in formulas that stop bleeding. They promote blood circulation and also disperse and dissolve the congealed blood, a side effect caused by herbs that have cold, sour, astringent and descending properties. Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix), Jing Jie Sui (Schizonepetae flos) and Huai Hua (Sophorae flos) These herbs are dispersing and ascending in nature. They are used as assistants to disperse the restrained Qi and heat and calm the wind, which is produced by the high speed of bleeding, physical tension and mental stress, and the rapid development of patho- logical conditions. Huang Qi (astragali radix), Sheng Ma (Cimicifugae rhizoma) and Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) These herbs can tonify and ascend the Spleen-Qi, control the blood and reduce the speed of bleeding. In clinical practice and in laboratory trials, it has been shown that Huang Qi is able to tonify the Spleen-Qi and ascend the Qi, and can be used to control the blood in a bleeding condition. This func- tion can be enhanced by a small amount of Sheng Ma and Chai Hu. 291 Syndrome of bleeding and formula compositionChapter Sheng Ma and Chai Hu have an ascending and moving tendency, but their effects of ascending the Spleen-Qi and strengthening the muscles are only shown when they are used together with tonifying herbs, particularly Huang Qi. When the three herbs are used together in a bleeding condition caused by Qi deficiency, they can strongly and effectively hold the Qi in order to control the blood. Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet in nature and primarily enters the Spleen meridian. It reduces tension that is caused by the high speed of bleeding, physical and mental stress, and the rapid development of patho- logical conditions. As it eases the muscles and tendons, and stabilizes the Qi and blood, it can slow down the speed of bleeding in a crucial bleeding condition. Envoy: Harmonize the herbs in the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao can harmonize the functions and prop- erties of herbs in a formula. Examples of classical formulas Shi Hui San (Ten Partially-Charred Substances Powder) Source: Shi Yao Shen Shu Analysis of the formula This formula is used to cool the blood and stop bleeding. It is used for acute bleeding in any part of the body. The cause is internal heat, which injures the blood vessels and pushes blood moving upwards and leaving its normal pathway. In this formula: • The chief herbs are Da Jì, Xiao Ji, Ce Bai Ye, Qian Cao Gen and Bai Mao Gen. These herbs are able to cool the blood and stop bleeding, and treat the cause and manifestations. • The deputies are Zong Lü Pi, Zhi Zi and Da Huang. Zong Lü Pi is astringent and is able to stabilize the blood and assist the chief herbs to stop bleeding; Zhi Zi and Da Huang clear the heat and can therefore reduce the intensity of bleeding. • Mu Dan Pi serves as assistant. On the one hand, it plays the role of helping assistant together with Da Huang to cool the blood and dissolve congealed blood; on the other hand, as corrective assistant, it disperses the congealed blood and regulates the blood circulation. It thus prevents blood stagnation, a side effect caused by all the cold herbs. • He Ye is another assistant. It can clear heat and assist the chief herbs. It can also ascend the clear Qi of the Middle-Jiao so as to prevent Qi stagnation due to the cold and astringent nature of the chief and deputy herbs. Commentary on strategies This formula treats the manifestation rather than the cause of the syndrome. This can be seen in the special treatment of the herbs. • First of all, the herbs in the formula are all partially charred. Through this process, the herbs gain astringent properties that can enhance the strength of stopping bleeding. • Second, the partially charred herbs are ground to a fine powder, sealed in an earthenware container and buried in the earth for a night. This procedure reduces any fire nature that the herbs may have developed from the charring process, which is inappropriate for bleeding conditions. • Third, before ingestion, the herbal powders are mixed with sweet radish juice and Chinese ink, which is made from charred cypress and pine Da Jì (Cirsii japonici herba seu radix) Xiao Ji (Cirsii herba) He Ye (Nelumbinis folium) Ce Bai Ye (Platycladi cacumen) Bai Mao Gen (Imperatae rhizoma) Qian Cao Gen (Rubiae radix) Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) Da Huang (Rhei rhizoma) Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex) Zong Lü Pi (Petiolus trachycarpi) Herbs in the formula are without exact dosage as this is not recorded in the source book They should be applied in even dosage 292


with cooked sticky rice. This enhances their ability to stop bleeding. • Since acute bleeding is unexpected, the formula is prepared and kept for emergency use. Chinese ink and radish are usually available in the home. These particular procedures are devised to meet treatment need in acute, unexpected situations. • These procedures suggest wider possibilities in unexpected bleeding conditions: people may quickly burn plants to black and put the powder on the wound to stop bleeding, at the same time taking fresh vegetables to clear heat. Ke Xue Fang (Coughing of Blood Formula) Source: Dan Xi Xin Fa • He Zi serves as assistant and is used to preserve the Lung-Qi that is dispersed widely by the intense cough. Commentary on strategies • The combination of herbs in this formula suggests that when bleeding occurs in the upper part of the body, the substances that move downwards and inwards should be used. • Although the bleeding manifests in the Lung, the Liver-fire should be drained primarily in order to recover the function of the Lung. Huai Hua San (Sophora Japonica Flower Powder) Source: Ben Shi Fang Qing Dai (Indigo naturalis) 6 g Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) 9 g Gua Lou Gen (Trichosanthis radix) 9 g Hai Fu Shi (Pumex) 9 g He Zi (Chebulae fructus) 6 g Analysis of the formula This formula is able to clear fire, transform phlegm, preserve the Lung and stop cough and bleeding. It is used for treating a syndrome where the excess Liver-fire attacks the Lung, injures the blood vessels and ascends the Qi. The symptoms are coughing blood, blood in the sputum, thick sputum that is difficult to expectorate, a bitter taste in the mouth, irritability, sharp pain in the chest and hypochon- dria, red cheeks, constipation, a red tongue with a yellow coating and a wiry and rapid pulse. In this formula: • Qing Dai and Zhi Zi are chief. They drain the excess Liver-fire and cool the blood to reduce the aggression of the Liver. • Hai Fu Shi and Gua Lou Gen are deputies. Hai Fu Shi is able to remove sticky and thick sputum and Gua Lou Gen can eliminate phlegm-heat in the Lung. Both move downwards and treat the disorder of the Lung. Huai Hua (Sophorae flos) 12 g Ce Bai Ye (Platycladi cacumen) 12 g Jing Jie Sui (Schizonepetae flos) 6 g Zhi Ke (Aurantii fructus) 6 g Analysis of the formula This formula can cool the intestines, stop bleeding, disperse wind and regulate Qi. In this way it treats intestinal wind syndrome that is caused by wind- heat or damp-heat accumulation in the intestines that blocks the Qi and injures the blood vessels. The manifestations are fresh red blood before or after defecation, blood in the stool, bleeding due to hem- orrhoids, a red tongue and a wiry and rapid pulse. The sign of wind in the intestines is quick-spreading blood drops before defecation. In this formula: • The fragrant Huai Hua is used as chief. It can regulate and ascend the Qi, clear the heat, cool the blood and stop bleeding in the intestines. • Ce Bai Ye, as deputy, helps Huai Hua to cool the blood and stop bleeding. It can also promote wound healing and relieve pain. • Jing Jie Sui, as assistant, can disperse the restrained Qi and heat in the intestines and stop bleeding. 293 Syndrome of bleeding and formula compositionChapter • Zhi Ke, which serves as assistant to Jing Jie Sui and Huai Hua, regulates the Qi in the intestines to calm the wind and reduce the tension. Commentary on strategies This formula suggests several strategies. • When the bleeding manifests in the lower part of the body, herbs that move upwards should be selected in the formula. • Herbs that clear heat and herbs that disperse heat should be used together. • When heat disturbs the blood, light and gentle herbs should be selected to ascend the clear Qi and disperse the constrained heat and Qi without the likelihood of the blood being forced to move. When the herbs fulfill these conditions, the wind calms down and the bleeding in the intestines stops. Although there are only four herbs in the formula, each has more than two functions or properties to suit the syndrome. It is a perfect example of herb selection. Xiao Ji Yin Zi (Cirsii Decoction) Source: Ji Sheng Fang frequent, painful urination, blood in the urine, a red tongue and a rapid pulse. In this formula: • Xiao Ji is used as chief to treat the cause and manifestations of bleeding. • Ou Jie and Pu Huang, the deputies, stop bleeding as well as regulating the blood to prevent the formation of congealed blood. • Hua Shi, Zhi Zi, Mu Tong and Dan Zhu Ye serve as assistants. They clear the heat and increase urination in order to eliminate damp- heat in the Lower-Jiao. • Dang Gui serves as corrective assistant to tonify the blood and stimulate the blood circulation to prevent blood stagnation caused by the cold herbs. • Sheng Di Huang, another corrective assistant, is used to nourish the Yin that is injured by heat or by the herbs that drain the dampness and promote urination. • Zhi Gan Cao is used as envoy to moderate the nature of the cold herbs and to harmonize the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies • This formula focuses on cooling blood and stopping bleeding, while at the same time increasing urination and leaching out damp-heat to treat the cause of bleeding. • The herb that prevents blood stagnation is used in the group of cooling herbs; the herb that tonifies the Yin is used in the group of draining herbs. The combinations fit the syndrome perfectly and therefore the formula can have effective results in treatment.

Analysis of the formula and commentary on strategies This formula can cool blood and stop bleeding, and is used to treat nose bleeds and vomiting of blood caused by heat in the blood. • One of the strategies shown in this formula is using the fresh herbs He Ye, Ce Bai Ye and Sheng Di Huang. As fresh herbs they have a stronger function of cooling the blood and stopping bleeding. • The second strategy is using fresh Ai Ye as assistant because it can promote blood circulation and prevent blood stagnation caused by cold herbs. Although it is pungent and warm, its function is very gentle, and it can warm the blood without the side effect of moving the blood vigorously. • In addition, the aromatic smell of He Ye and Ai Ye is used to disperse the restrained Qi and heat, which may arise in the process of clearing and descending the heat. Huang Tu Tang (Yellow Earth Decoction) Source: Jin Kui Yao Lue deficiency of Spleen-Yang and Spleen-Qi. The man- ifestations are blood in the stools, uterine bleeding, vomiting of blood, or having purpura, cold limbs and a wan complexion, a pale tongue with a white coating and a deep, thready and slow pulse. In this formula: • The chief is the warm and astringent Zao Xin Tu. It is used in a large amount to warm the Middle-Jiao directly and to stop bleeding. • Gan Cao, as deputy, tonifies the Spleen-Qi and harmonizes the Qi movement and blood circulation to help the chief in stopping the bleeding. • Fu Zi and Bai Zhu, as assistants, warm the Yang and expel cold to enhance the ability of the chief to stop bleeding. • Gan Di Huang and E Jiao also serve as assistants to tonify the blood and stop bleeding. • Huang Qin is used as a corrective assistant in the formula to reduce heat and prevent bleeding caused by the hot Fu Zi. Commentary on strategies This formula shows several features. • Combination of very hot, pungent herb with sweet herbs: The violent moving ability of Fu Zi is moderated by the sweet Gan Di Huang and E Jiao; the cloying nature of Gan Di Huang and E Jiao can be reduced by Fu Zi and Bai Zhu. This combination can sufficiently spread warmth in the Middle-Jiao, strengthen the Spleen and tonify blood in a steady and balanced way. • Combination of cold herbs with warm herbs: This considers both the syndrome and the nature of blood. It is a perfect example of treating bleeding due to internal cold.

## Heart-shen and formula composition


According to Five-Element theory, the five internal organs not only carry out specific physiological activ- ities, they also play a role in mental activities. There- fore, the five organs are also called the five Shen (mind or psyche) organs. Each of these five organs has its own characteristic emotion. When the five organs are strong, the person experiences emotions and mood changes within a normal range. When the five organs are weak, their related emotions may show themselves clearly. If a certain emotion dom- inates the mood for too long, it can cause mental and somatic illness. Heart The Heart is the most important organ among the five. It decides the emotional features and cognitive ability of the individual. It houses the Shen (psyche) and dominates all mental activities in the conscious state. It concerns the ability to know the external world through sensory organs. All information or stimuli, including introspection and insight into oneself and the ability to feel emotions, are first received by the Heart and are further felt and evaluated with the cooperation of different internal organs. The Heart is then able to formulate the information intelligently at emotional and cognitive levels, and enables one to respond based on a proper evaluation of the stimuli. The emotional attribute of the Heart is joy, which makes the Qi relax and move without clear direction and boundary. A healthy and positive attitude towards life makes the Heart strong. Having too little joy in life or, conversely, an overindulgence in joy, may weaken the Heart. The Heart-Qi and Heart-Yang, as the functional aspects of the body, are constantly active in all mental activities. The blood and the Yin of the Heart, as the material aspects of this organ, are responsible for supplementing and nourishing the Heart in order to sustain the mental activities. The main physiological function of the Heart is govern- ing the blood and dominating blood circulation. If this function is impaired, the Shen loses nourish- ment and control of the Heart, and mental confu- sion, anxiety, palpitations and difficulty falling asleep may occur. The balance between the Kidney-Yin (water) and Heart-fire provides another indicator of mental state. In an acutely stressful situation, such as being frightened or shocked, Heart-fire becomes hyperact- ive and easily loses connection with the Kidney- water; this may directly cause anxiety, restlessness and sleep disorders. Liver The Liver houses the Hun and has its main influence on the sleeping process, dreams and all activities in the subconscious state. Flexibility in one’s tempera- ment and in how one deals with things is a sign of a strong and properly functioning Liver. The emo- tional attribute of the Liver is anger, which can easily push the Qi upwards. Relaxation and flexibility in temperament make the Liver strong and allow the Liver-Qi to flow freely; anger and frustration make the Liver-Qi stagnate (even move upwards) and eventually weaken this organ. The Liver-Yin and blood are very important in maintaining the function of the Liver. When they are strong, the person sleeps well, feels calm and satisfied, has a sense of humor and moves in a quick and harmonious manner. When the blood and Yin are deficient, the Liver-Qi stagnates and the sleep becomes restless and disturbed by dreams, the person easily feels irritation, anger and frustration, or loses relaxation and flexibility in character. More- over, Liver is the mother organ of the Heart. Liver- Qi stagnation and up-flaring of Liver-fire can quickly influence the Heart and cause restlessness of the Heart-shen. Kidney The Kidney is often called the root of life. This is because it stores the Kidney-Qi (Source-Qi or Yuan- Qi) which is the initial life force inherited from one’s parents. It determines the vitality of each indi- vidual and is the source of the Qi of the other organs. The Kidney houses the Zhi (will-power) which relates to an individual’s ambitions and goals in life. It derives from the biological drive for sur- vival. The emotional attribute of the Kidney is fear, which concerns the well-being of the individual and which serves to safeguard the individual from dan- gerous situations. Fear leads the Qi downwards. Having both short- and long-term goals, and leading a life with appropriate challenges but without threat, make the Kidney strong and Kidney-Qi firm. It is particularly important to create these conditions for the physical and mental development of children and young people. 299 Syndrome of disturbance of Heart-shen and formula compositionChapter The Kidney stores the essence that is inherited from one’s parents and is the source of development of the other internal organs and the whole body. It determines the constitution, strength and stability of an individual’s mental and physical condition. When the Kidney-essence and Kidney-Qi are firm, people are energetic, stable and have self-confidence. They get things done with instinct and initiative. When the Kidney-Qi and Kidney-essence are weak, people (especially children) may have mental and physical slowdown, get nervous easily and are frightened, have low self-esteem and lack a goal in life and the motivation to start doing things. Moreover, when the Kidney-Qi is not firm, it may lead to unstable func- tion of the Heart-Qi and the Lung-Qi, resulting in palpitations and shortness of breath; in a severe case, panic attack and hyperventilation may occur. Spleen The function of the Spleen is also very important. The Spleen transforms food and drink into Qi and blood. These supplement the Qi and blood of the whole body and are also transformed into essence, which supplements the Kidney-essence; a strong Spleen thus sustains the vitality of the individual in the long run. The Spleen houses the Yi (intention) and this determines the ability and profundity of feeling, thinking, studying, planning and memorizing things, and directly influences these processes. It determines the level of an individual’s intelligence. The emo- tional attributes of the Spleen are empathy, sympa- thy, care and worry. These feelings slow down the movement of the Qi and may even make it stagnate. When the function of the Spleen is too weak or is disturbed, the person may lose the ability to study, understand, plan, concentrate and memorize things. If the function of the Spleen is too weak to generate the Qi and blood, the person may get worried easily and feel gloomy and tired. When the Spleen-Qi is weak or blocked, a person may lose the feeling of sympathy and care. The Spleen is also important for maintaining balance in the functions of the internal organs. Located in the middle of the body, it is like a turbine, controlling the upward and downward movement of the Qi. It can therefore connect the Lung and Heart, which are located in the upper part of the body, and the Kidney and Liver, which are located in the lower part of the body. (See Figures 13.1 and 13.2 on page 311.) Phlegm and blood Besides the disorders of the internal organs, phlegm and congealed blood can also be causative factors in mental disorders. When the dietary habit of the patient is inappropriate or the function of the Spleen is too weak, phlegm is easily formed. It can be pushed by Qi moving in the body, covering the mind and blocking the meridians, and cause disorders of the Heart-shen. The congealed blood is a patho- logical product, which is formed when the Qi stag- nates over a long period of time. It can block the Heart orifice and also cause disorders of the Heart- shen. The Lung The Lung houses the Po. It relates to the boldness, courage, realistic self-confidence and self-esteem of the individual. The emotional attribute of the Lung relates to the change from optimism and courage to pessimism and sadness. The Lung gathers the Qi, which is mixed from the air from inhalation and the Qi that is generated from food and drink. The Lung is also responsible for distributing the Qi throughout the body in order to carry out all physical and mental activities. This function directly influences the inten- sity and changes of mental activities and emotions. When the Qi is strong and disperses properly, the person is optimistic, stable in mood and behaviour, is courageous and dares to take on challenges and responsibilities. When the Lung-Qi is deficient, it is too weak to spread out and the person is prone to sadness, negative and dissatisfied feelings, is unable to take responsibility and does not manage to reach one’s goals in life. When the Lung-Qi descends too much, the person may feel depressed, is often self- critical and feels guilty. On the contrary, when the Lung-Qi ascends too much, a person is conceited and often takes a dominating position. If the Lung-Qi moves upwards and downwards intensely and rapidly, the person may switch quickly from being conceited to having low self-esteem. Moreover, the proper function of the Lung is very closely related with the Heart and Liver, as the Heart governs the blood and directly influences Qi movement; and the proper movement of Liver-Qi may smooth the dis- persing and descending functions of the Lung-Qi. In acute stress conditions, the Liver-Qi disturbs the Lung-Qi and Heart-Qi; shortness of breath, restless- ness, even hyperventilation and panic attack may occur. (See Figure 13.3 on page 312.) 300


Nowadays, these coping reactions still present in stressful situations when the individual is worried, frustrated and frightened. • At the same time, the Kidney-Qi descends due to fear and shock, and the connection between the Kidney and the Heart is broken. The Liver-Qi overacts on the Spleen and the Qi in the Middle-Jiao is blocked. The Liver-fire and Heart-fire often flare up attacking the lung. These result in anxiety, rapid breathing, vigilance, night sweats, insomnia and poor concentration – even panic attacks and hyperventilation. • These physical and mental reactions strongly consume the Qi, and the patient easily and quickly feels tired. • A red tongue and a wiry, forceful and rapid pulse indicate the existence of fire. • If this situation continues for a fairly long period of time, the Heart-Yin is injured by the fire and causes further severe disturbance of Heart-fire. When the Heart-shen is unable to stay in the Heart, persistent restlessness, palpitations, reduced ability to concentrate and insomnia arise, even without an obvious reason. In a chronic condition: • The persistent anxiety, palpitations and insomnia often occur without an obvious reason. These are mainly caused by blood and Yin deficiency of the Heart and Liver. • If there is only Qi and blood deficiency, the tongue body is usually pale or delicate red with a thin white coating and the pulse is thready, weak and restless. • If there is Yin deficiency, the patient may have night sweats, vigilance, irritability, a red tongue without coating and a rapid, thready and wiry pulse. • Phlegm is frequently formed due to poor digestion and Qi stagnation. It covers the Heart and causes cognitive impairment, poor memory and poor concentration, as well as restlessness and palpitations. In this case, a sticky tongue coating and a slippery pulse are present. • The congealed blood can also be formed by Qi disturbance of the internal organs and by chronic illness. It can block the Heart and cause stubborn pain, restlessness and palpitations. In this case, a purple tongue and a choppy pulse are present. Main symptoms Restlessness, anxiety, palpitations, irritability, insomnia, stress, inability to concentrate, anticipation of misfortune, being afraid of losing control In severe cases, panic attacks or hyperventilation Secondary symptoms Shakiness, stiffness of muscles, dry mouth, indigestion, vigilance, quick breathing, night sweats, tiring easily and quickly Tongue Red, purple or pale, trembling; may have a yellow or sticky coating Pulse Wiry, rapid, irregular; forceful in an excess condition, thready and restless in a deficiency condition Associated disorders in western medicine Anxiety, depression, insomnia, different types of phobia, obsessive–compulsive disorder, post-trau- matic stress disorder, panic attacks, acute stress dis- order. It is also related to chronic diseases, such as anemia, and diseases of the heart and lung. Analysis of the syndrome In an acute and excess condition, the stress is severe and has an obvious cause, but the physical condition of the patient is good. • The Heart-fire and Liver-fire are intensively stimulated by stress and flare-up, and the Heart-Qi and Lung-Qi are hyperactive and dispersed. These result in restlessness, palpitations, dry mouth, sweating, shakiness and stiffness of muscles. These changes can be traced back to humans’ fight-or-flight survival response in dangerous situations: the heart beats more rapidly to supply more blood to the muscles; breathing becomes faster to obtain more oxygen for the physiological need.

301 Syndrome of disturbance of Heart-shen and formula compositionChapter Treatment principle • In an acute and excess condition: Sedate the Heart-Yang and Liver-Yang, clear the Heart-fire and Liver-fire, regulate the Liver-Qi and descend the Lung-Qi to calm the mind. • In a chronic and deficiency condition: Nourish the Heart-blood and Heart-Yin, tonify the Heart-Qi, harmonize the Qi and blood and calm the mind. • In a deficiency condition with acute stress: Sedate the Heart-shen, reduce fire or descend the Liver-Yang, regulate Qi and blood, and tonify the blood and Yin. 1. Determine the treatment order: the treatment order is to sedate the Shen and to treat the manifestations in an acute and severe condition primarily, and to treat the cause and manifestations secondly. 2. Caution when using mineral substances: Mineral substances can strongly sedate the Shen and descend the fire and Qi, thus suppressing Qi and causing an uneasy sensation in the chest. For these reasons they should not be used in a large dosage for a long period of time. When the condition of the patient improves, gentle herbs that calm the mind should be used instead of mineral substances. 3. protect the Stomach: as mineral substances are heavy for the stomach and may cause a heavy sensation in the stomach, stomach pain and constipation, they should be used with other herbs that protect the stomach. When the condition of the patient improves, gentle herbs that calm the mind should be used instead of mineral substances. 4. Influence on concentration: the formulas that strongly sedate the Shen can cause a sleepy sensation and decrease the ability to concentrate if they are used in an inappropriate dosage. If these signs are present during the day, one should reduce the dosage of the formula or only use it before going to bed at night. 5. Caution in pregnancy: the substances that sedate the Shen have a strong descending tendency. pregnant women should not use them or use them with caution. Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Sedate the Heart-shen in an acute and a severe condition; tonify the Heart and calm the mind in a chronic and a mild condition Ci Shi (Magnetitum), Zhen Zhu (Margarita usta) and Zhen Zhu Mu (Concha margaritifera usta) All of these substances are minerals. They can directly and strongly sedate the Heart-shen and are 302


effective in treating acute and excess conditions of restlessness, palpitations, anxiety and insomnia. They are often chosen as chief substances in the formula. Ci Shi is a heavy and solid mineral. It is pungent, salty and cold, and is the strongest of the three in sedating the Heart-shen. Since it enters the Liver and Kidney meridians, it is more suitable for treating Heart-shen disturbance caused by Liver and Kidney disturbance. This manifests as palpitations, restless- ness with fear, dream-disturbed sleep and easily waking up in the night. There may be a wiry and restless pulse, particularly in the second position on the left side. Ci Shi is also able to stabilize the Kidney-Qi and Kidney-essence, and descend the Liver-Yang. Zhen Zhu is sweet, salty and cold. Its function of sedating the Heart-shen is more moderate than that of Ci Shi. Its principal focus is on disorders of the Heart as it enters the Heart and Liver meridians directly. As well as sedating the Heart-shen, its sweet nature can ease the tension of conflict, calm the mind and slow down the pathological process of anxiety. It is also effective in clearing fire of the Heart and Liver, and treats restlessness, palpitations, irritability and difficulty falling asleep. In this condition, patients may have a rapid, active and restless pulse, particu- larly in the first position on the left side. Zhen Zhu Mu has a similar function to Zhen Zhu, is also cold and salty, and enters the Heart and Liver meridians. Its function of sedating the Heart-shen and calming the mind is weaker than that of Zhen Zhu, but it is stronger in descending the Liver-Yang. It is more suitable for use in the condition where the Liver-Yang ascends and the Heart is disturbed. This manifests as dizziness, headache, tinnitus, pal- pitations, irritability and insomnia. Long Chi (Mastodi fossilia dentis) and Long Gu (Mastodi fossilium ossis) Long Chi and Long Gu are different parts of fossil fragments. Both have the function of sedating the Heart-shen. Long Chi is cold in nature and enters the Heart and Liver meridians. It is heavier than Long Gu and its descending action is stronger and quicker. Long Chi is very effective for sedating the Heart-shen and calming the mind. It is used to treat severe restless- ness, agitation, insomnia and night sweats. Long Gu is sweet, neutral and astringent, and enters the Heart, Liver and Kidney meridians. Its function of sedating the Shen is not as strong as that of Long Chi but it controls fear as it can stabilize the Kidney-Qi. It can also stabilize the essence and body fluids, and treats night sweats, nocturnal emis- sions and enuresis. In addition, it can anchor the Liver-Yang and treat the Liver-Yang ascending that manifests as dizziness, tinnitus, headache and dream- disturbed sleep. It is often chosen in a formula as chief if anxiety is caused by Liver-Yang ascending, disturbance of the Heart-shen and weakness of the Kidney-Qi. Zhu Sha (Cinnabaris)* Zhu Sha is sweet, salty and slightly cold, and enters the Heart meridian. It is considered the strongest substance for calming the mind and reducing Heart- fire in acute and severe conditions of anxiety and insomnia. Zhu Sha contains mercury, a very poison- ous mineral, and it can act directly against the aggressive heat-toxin that is generated by the vigor- ously blazing fire when Qi and blood are suddenly obstructed. Since mercury is poisonous and can accumulate in the body, Zhu Sha is traditionally only used for a very short time and in a very small dosage as a coating for herbal pills. Nowadays, use of Zhu Sha is forbidden in many countries; however, it can be replaced by a combination of Long Chi (Mastodi fossilia dentis), Zhen Zhu (Margarita usta) and Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma). Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix), Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix) and Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) These three herbs are cold in nature. They can nourish Yin and reduce heat. They are often used as a part of chief substances together with minerals in a formula to sedate the Heart-shen and calm the mind in an acute and severe condition of anxiety caused by excess heat or empty-heat. They can also be used as chief herbs to treat moderate or chronic cases of anxiety and insomnia via the approach of reducing the excess fire or empty-fire of the Heart, Liver and Kidney. Sheng Di Huang is sweet, bitter and cold, and enters the Heart, Liver and Kidney meridians. As it can directly clear excess heat or empty-heat in the Heart, Liver and Kidney, it can calm the mind and relieve irritability and restlessness. It can cool the blood, thus the function of calming the mind is even stronger. It is frequently used as chief in the formula for treating excess or deficiency syndromes. 303 Syndrome of disturbance of Heart-shen and formula compositionChapter Xuan Shen is bitter, cold and salty, and enters the Kidney meridian. It can clear heat and reduce fire. Unlike Sheng Di Huang, it is not sweet and has no function in generating Yin, but it can lift the Kidney- water (Yin) upwards to reduce the excess fire of the Heart. It is often used with Sheng Di Huang to treat excess heat and empty-heat in the Heart. It can relieve thirst, dry throat, warm sensations in the chest and irritability. However, if a patient has a Yin deficiency, especially Kidney-Yin deficiency, Xuan Shen should not be used for too long. Bai Shao Yao is sour and cold, and enters the Liver meridian. It can generate Liver-Yin and reduce heat, and thus treat vigilance, irritability, night sweats, insomnia and dream-disturbed sleep. Since it can nourish the Liver-blood and soften the Liver, it can ease the tendons and relieve trembling and stiffness of the muscles. It is an import herb for use in acute and chronic conditions of anxiety and insomnia caused by disorders of the Liver. Suan Zao Ren (Ziziphi spinosae semen) and Bai Zi Ren (platycladi semen) These herbs are commonly used to calm the mind and improve sleep. They are often selected as chief in a mild or chronic condition of disturbance of the mind. Suan Zao Ren is sweet and sour; it enters the Liver meridian primarily and the Heart meridian secondly. It can tonify the Liver and Heart blood, and stabilize the blood and the Qi. It is the most commonly used herb to tonify the Liver-blood and calm the mind. It is particularly effective for treating restlessness and irritability without an obvious cause, dream-disturbed sleep and nightmares. Bai Zi Ren enters the Heart meridian primarily and the Liver meridian secondly. It is sweet and has a moistening nature. It is an excellent herb to nourish the Heart blood and calm the mind. It also has the function of stopping sweating and is suitable for treating such symptoms as difficulty falling asleep, restlessness and palpitations, becoming nervous easily and sweating. Since mental state and sleep relate to the Heart and Liver, Suan Zao Ren and Bai Zhi Ren are often used together. Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) and Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Ren Shen is sweet and slightly warm. Not only is it a very strong herb to tonify the Qi in general, it is also an effective herb to stabilize the Qi and calm the mind. Since it directly tonifies the Source-Qi and stabilizes the Heart-Qi, it is used in acute or chronic conditions of anxiety due to Heart-Qi and Kidney-Qi deficiency. However, because it can strongly tonify the Qi, it may stimulate the Qi too much and too quickly so that the patient may feel more restless and has difficulty falling asleep, espe- cially at the start of treatment with Ren Shen. To prevent this side effect, this herb should be used with small dosages initially, and the dosage increased gradually thereafter. Zhi Gan Cao is sweet in nature and enters all regular meridians; however, it primarily enters the Spleen meridian. If it is used in a reasonably large dosage (i.e. above 9 g as a crude herb) it can suffi- ciently tonify and smooth the Qi. Unlike Ren Shen, it does not cause restlessness and insomnia, and is particularly useful in an acute or persistent condi- tion of anxiety. This is because its sweet taste can reduce the tension from the conflict between the body’s resistance and the pathogenic factors, slow down the pathological process, ease the tendons and muscles, and thus calm the mind in a stable, gentle and pleasant way. Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) and Rou Gui (Cinnamomi cassiae cortex) These two herbs are sweet, pungent and warm. They can stimulate the Yang and treat anxiety, rest- lessness and palpitations due to Yang deficiency. However, since Gui Zhi enters the Heart meridian and Rou Gui enters the Kidney meridian, they calm the mind from different approaches. Gui Zhi is more pungent and has a strong moving ability. It can stimulate the Heart-Yang, expel cold and promote the blood circulation, thereby treating restlessness and palpitations due to Yang and Qi deficiency and cold in the chest. Its effect is quite quick. Rou Gui is warmer and sweeter than Gui Zhi but is not as pungent. It can strengthen the vital gate fire, the Kidney-Yang, and treat restlessness, becom- ing nervous easily, frightened or shocked due to Kidney-Yang deficiency. Both Gui Zhi and Rou Gui can be used as chief in formulas for calming the mind due to Yang defi- ciency. They are often used with herbs that tonify the Qi such as Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) and Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) to enhance and stabilize their functions. 304


Deputy: In acute and excess conditions, descend fire, nourish the Yin, cool the blood and remove congealed blood so as to calm the mind; in chronic and deficiency conditions, tonify the Yin, blood and Qi so as to calm the mind Mu Li (Concha Ostreae) Mu Li is salty, astringent and slightly cold, and enters the Kidney, Liver and Gall Bladder meridians. It has the function of descending the heat of the Kidney, anchoring the Liver-Yang and stabilizing the body fluids. It is often chosen as deputy for treating night sweats, hot flushes, restlessness and anxiety. Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma), Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) and Mu Tong (Mutong caulis)* These herbs can be used as deputies in the formula to treat acute and excess conditions where excess heat is blazing in the Heart. They are all bitter and cold, and enter the Heart and Liver meridians. They can strongly reduce the excess fire from the Heart and Liver, and therefore calm the mind. Zhi Zi and Mu Tong can also drain heat by promoting urination. These herbs can be used to treat agitation, difficulty falling asleep, a bitter taste in the mouth, mouth ulcers and scanty and difficult urination. Since Mu Tong is a poisonous herb and its use is forbidden in many countries, it can be substituted by Ku Zhu Ye (Bambusae amarae folium) or Tong Cao (Tetrapanacis medulla) with Huang Lian (Cop- tidis rhizoma) or Long Dan Cao (Gentianae radix). Hu Po (Succinum), Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix) and Yu Jin (Curcumae radix) Hu Po, Dan Shen and Yu Jin enter the Heart and Liver meridians. They can promote blood circula- tion, thus calming the mind in acute and chronic conditions. They treat palpitations, irritability, chest pain and hypochondriac pain due to blood stagnation. Hu Po is sweet and neutral, and enters the blood level of the Heart and Liver. It is particularly effec- tive in sedating the Shen and removing congealed blood. It treats palpitations and restlessness due to blood stagnation. It is used in treating severe and persistent heart and mental disorders such as coro- nary heart disease, phobia, obsessive–compulsive disorder and manic depression. Dan Shen is bitter and cold. It enters the Heart meridian primarily and the Liver meridian secondly. Its function focuses on the Heart rather than the Liver and it can directly clear heat of the Heart, cool the blood, and relieve irritability and restlessness. In this way it can calm the mind. Yu Jin enters the Liver meridian primarily and the Heart meridian secondly. It is not only bitter and cold, but also pungent. Its function focuses on the Liver rather than the Heart. Its functions of promot- ing blood circulation and removing congealed blood are also stronger than those of Dan Shen. Moreover, Yu Jin can spread the Liver-Qi and clear Liver-heat. As an aromatic herb, it can also clear damp-heat and remove damp-heat obstruction in the Upper- and Middle-Jiao. It is an appropriate choice in a formula if there are symptoms of irritability, headache, a tight sensation in the chest, agitation, and a bitter and sticky taste in the mouth. Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix), Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix), Zhi Mu (anemarrhenae rhizoma) and Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix) These herbs are all cold in nature. The first three herbs enter the Heart meridian. They can nourish the Heart-Yin, reduce heat and thus calm the mind. They are often used as deputies in the formula to treat acute and chronic anxiety, restlessness and insomnia due to excess heat or empty-heat in the Heart. Sheng Di Huang, Zhi Mu and Xuan Shen also enter the Kidney meridian. Sheng Di Huang can nourish the Kidney-Yin and reduce the empty-heat; Zhi Mu and Xuan Shen can clear heat there. They are often used as deputies in the formula to treat acute and chronic imbalance between the Heart and Kidney, which manifests as restlessness, hot flushes, night sweats, anxiousness, anxiety and agitation. Fu Shen (poriae cocos pararadicis), Ye Jiao Teng (polygoni multiflori caulis), He Huan Pi (albiziae cortex) and Bai He (Lilii bulbus) These herbs calm the mind and improve sleep, and are often used as deputies in formulas that treat chronic conditions of restlessness and insomnia. Fu Shen is sweet and neutral, and enters the Heart and Spleen meridians. It has the function of tonifying the Spleen-Qi and Heart-Qi and can calm the mind. It treats palpitations, forgetfulness, rest- less sleep and early waking. Its function is gentle but sufficient for a mild or moderate case. Ye Jiao Teng is sweet and neutral, and enters the Heart and Liver meridians. It nourishes the Heart- blood and benefits the Yin, calms the mind and 305 Syndrome of disturbance of Heart-shen and formula compositionChapter improves sleep. Since it is a vine, which can open the collaterals and activate blood circulation, it can treat pain, stiffness and restlessness of the body and limbs in conditions of blood deficiency. It is often selected specifically to treat a sensation of discom- fort in the muscles and restless legs in sleep. He Huan Pi is sweet and neutral, and enters the Heart, Spleen and Lung meridians. It regulates the Qi in the chest and calms the mind. It is particularly suitable for treating insomnia in depression due to Lung-Yin and Heart-Yin deficiency and Liver-Qi stagnation. The accompanying symptoms are sadness, a tight sensation in the chest and reduced appetite. Bai He is sweet, bland and slightly cold, and enters the Lung and Heart meridians. It is particu- larly effective for moistening the Lung-Yin and nourishing the Heart-Yin. It is able to calm the mind, and relieve sadness and irritability. Bai He is often used with He Huan Pi to treat insomnia in depression due to Lung-Yin and Heart-Yin defi- ciency and Liver-Qi stagnation. E Jiao (asini corii colla), Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix) and Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) E Jiao is sweet and warm, and has the function of tonifying the Yin, essence and blood, and moistening the dryness. Since persistent palpitations, agitation and sweating consume the Yin and blood, hasten and exhaust the Qi, these symptoms are considered as dryness of the Heart in traditional Chinese medi- cine. E Jiao is an appropriate choice for treating these disorders because it can moisten the dryness. Dang Gui and Bai Shao Yao are often used together to treat blood deficiency. Dang Gui can tonify the blood and promote blood circulation; Bai Shao Yao can nourish the Yin and reduce heat. Although they do not have a direct function of calming the mind, they are effective in nourishing the blood of the Liver. As they provide the residence of Heart-shen and Liver-hun, and can smooth the flow of Liver-Qi, they are often used to assist herbs that treat insomnia due to blood deficiency. Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet in nature and primarily enters the Spleen meridian. Sweet holds a capacity of mod- erating, tonifying and moistening. In acute and severe cases, the sweet taste of Zhi Gan Cao can reduce the tension from conflict between body resistance and pathogenic factors, slow down the pathological process, ease the tendons and muscles and thus assist the herbs that sedate the Heart-shen. In a chronic condition, it can tonify and moderate the Qi so as to calm the mind in a stable, gentle and pleasant way. Assistant: Remove the phlegm; regulate the Qi, promote blood circulation and therefore calm the mind; strengthen and stabilize the weak organs and calm the mind; strengthen the Middle-Jiao and protect the Stomach so as to reduce the side effect of the herbs that strongly sedate the Shen Meng Shi (Lapis micae seu chloriti)* Meng Shi is a mineral substance and is used to remove phlegm-heat. It has a very strong descending ability and can eliminate phlegm and reduce heat. It is used in a syndrome where phlegm-heat covers the Heart and obstructs the Heart meridian. The mani- festations are mental confusion, anxiety and rest- lessness, such as in schizophrenia. It is only used for a short period of time as it can cause uneasy sensa- tions in the stomach and intestines. Tian Zhu Huang (Bambusae concretio silicea), Zhu Li (Bambusae succus), Zhu Ru (Bambusae caulis in taeniam), Dan Nan Xing (pulvis arisaemae cum felle bovis) and Yu Jin (Curcumae radix) These cold herbs are selected to remove phlegm- heat. In the syndrome of disturbance of the Heart- shen, these herbs are selected to remove phlegm from the Heart, Stomach, Liver and Gall Bladder meridians; they can also prevent the phlegm cover- ing and blocking the Heart in the process of calming the mind. When phlegm covers the Heart, the Heart disconnects from the Kidney, as well as from the other organs and meridians, and symptoms such as mental confusion, palpitations, restlessness, insom- nia, headache, and fullness in the chest, hypochon- dria and stomach may arise. In this case, a red tongue with a yellow sticky coating and a slippery and rapid pulse are present. To treat this condition, the appropriate herbs in this group can be selected in the formula according to their characteristics. Tian Zhu Huang, Zhu Li and Zhu Ru all come from bamboo. Tian Zhu Huang enters the Heart and Liver meridians, and is effective in dislodging phlegm, clearing heat, cooling the Heart and 306


controlling convulsions. It is often used for distur- bance of the Heart and Liver by phlegm-heat when there is high fever, irritability and restless sleep. It is also often used in infant convulsions and night crying. Zhu Li is the coldest of these three herbs. It enters the Heart, Lung and Stomach meridians. It has a lubricating nature, can strongly eliminate phlegm-heat from the Heart, open the Heart orifice and unblock the meridians and collaterals so as to treat mental confusion, numbness and tingling of the limbs. Zhu Ru is slightly cold in nature and enters the Lung, Stomach and Gall Bladder meridians. As well as clearing heat and transforming phlegm, it is effec- tive in dispersing the constrained Qi, eliminating irritability and calming the mind. It is mainly used for treating restlessness, palpitations, restless sleep and depression, especially after febrile disease or in chronic diseases. Dang Nan Xing is bitter and cold, and is charac- terized by clearing heat, expelling phlegm, extin- guishing wind and calming spasm. It is able to eliminate the phlegm-heat that covers the Heart and treats headache, irritability and heaviness or numb- ness of the limbs. Yu Jin is cold, aromatic and pungent, and enters the Liver meridian. Yu Jin can spread the Liver-Qi, clear the Liver-heat and treat irritability, restless- ness, headache and fullness in the chest caused by damp-heat obstruction. It can also cool the blood and promote blood circulation. It is often selected in the formula to treat phlegm-heat obstructing the Liver, Gall Bladder and Heart meridians. Yuan Zhi (polygalae radix) and Shi Chang Pu (acori graminei rhizoma) These herbs are used together as their functions enhance each other. Yuan Zhi is pungent and bitter, and enters the Heart and Kidney meridians; Shi Chang Pu is pungent, aromatic, bitter and warm, and enters the Heart and Stomach meridians. They can remove phlegm from the Heart meridian, connect the Qi of the Heart with the Kidney and open the Heart orifice, thereby improving the functions of the Heart and calming the mind. They can be used in acute and chronic conditions of restlessness, palpita- tions, forgetfulness, poor concentration, insomnia, depression, anxiety and psychotic disorders. In clinical practice, Yuan Zhi should be used with caution, because too high a dose can irritate the gastric mucosa, cause nausea and increase the secre- tion of the respiratory tract. She Xiang (Moschus)**, Bing Pian (Borneol) and Jiang Zhen Xiang (Dalbergiae odoriferae lignum) These herbs are selected to regulate the Qi and therefore calm the mind. They are pungent and aromatic, and have a strong dispersing and moving ability. They are especially used to promote Qi movement, penetrate into dampness or phlegm and open the Heart orifice so as to treat chest pain, palpitations and restlessness. Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus), Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix), Jie Geng (platycodi radix) and Mai Ya (hordei fructus germinatus) These herbs have dispersing and ascending proper- ties. They release the constrained Qi in different organs caused by emotions, especially frustration and resentment. Constrained Qi can also be caused by accumulation of food, or from the strong and quick descending action of the sedating substances, especially minerals. Lian Qiao can particularly disperse the con- strained Qi of the Heart; Chai Hu is able to disperse the constrained Qi of the Liver and Gall Bladder; Jie Geng can disperse the Lung-Qi and remove phlegm; Mai Ya can ascend the Stomach-Qi and protect the function of the Spleen. They are often selected as corrective assistants in the formula to open obstructions and promote Qi movement. Ban Xia (pinelliae rhizoma), Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium), Xiang Yuan (Citri fructus), Fo Shou (Citri sarcodactylis fructus) and Xiang Fu (Cyperi rhizoma) These herbs are often used to regulate the Stomach- Qi and Liver-Qi, and to treat Qi stagnation, which always exists in the syndrome of disturbance of Heart-shen. Qi stagnation can also be caused by the strong and quick descending action of the sedating substances, especially the minerals, which suppress the Stomach-Qi. Moreover, the sweet, sour and astringent herbs that are selected to slow down the Qi movement also cause stagnation. Among these herbs, Ban Xia can soothe the Stomach-Qi and Chen Pi can promote the Qi move- ment in the Upper- and Middle-Jiao. Both can remove the dampness, phlegm and food accumula- tion that often arises in the same syndrome. Xiang Yuan and Fo Shou are able to harmonize the Qi of the Liver and Stomach, and are particularly used in the condition where the Liver overacts on the Stomach. Xiang Fu is the most commonly used herb 307 Syndrome of disturbance of Heart-shen and formula compositionChapter to promote Liver-Qi movement and it is widely used in all types of syndrome. As all of these herbs are pungent and warm, they consume the Yin and increase heat, especially in a syndrome where heat already exists. They should be used with caution. Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma), Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix) and Yu Jin (Curcumae radix) These herbs are often selected as assistants to help the chief and deputies to promote blood circulation and remove congealed blood. Chuan Xiong, Dan Shen and Yu Jin are the com- monly used herbs to promote blood circulation. They have high speed and are often called the Qi- moving herbs in the blood. Chuan Xiong is warm and Dan Shen and Yu Jin are cold. Chuan Xiong is able to reach all parts of the body and stop pain; Dan Shen particularly regulates blood circulation of the Heart and relieves chest pain and anxiety; Yu Jin particularly promotes the Liver blood circulation and relieves irritability. Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus), Lian Zi (Nelumbinis semen) and Long Yan Rou (Longanae arillus) These herbs can stabilize the Qi and Yin of the Heart and therefore calm the mind. Wu Wei Zi is sour and warm, and enters the Heart meridian. It can stabilize the Qi and Yin of the Heart and therefore calm the mind. Because it can strongly enhance the ability of the herbs that tonify the Qi and Yin of the Heart, it is often used as a helping assistant in the formula to treat anxiety, palpitations, restlessness and sweating. However, as this function can cause restless sleep or difficulty falling asleep in some patients, it is better to use it several hours before sleep. Lian Zi is sweet, astringent and neutral, and enters the Spleen, Kidney and Heart meridians. This herb is able to tonify the Spleen-Qi, Kidney-Qi and Heart-Qi. Its astringent property may stabilize the Qi, essence and fluid. It is often used as assistant in the formula to treat chronic, persistent restlessness, palpitations and anxiety due to weakness of the Heart, Spleen and Kidney. Long Yan Rou is sweet and warm, and enters the Heart and Spleen meridians. It can tonify the Qi and blood, and is often used as assistant in the formula to treat a chronic condition of restlessness, poor concentration and forgetfulness due to deficiency of Qi and blood of the Spleen and Heart. In addition, Lian Zi and Long Yan Rou are often used in dietary formulas for strengthening the Heart and Spleen and improving memory. Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens), Da Zao (Jujubae fructus), Mai Ya (hordei fructus germinatus) and Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) These herbs are often used as assistants in a formula to protect the Middle-Jiao because the herbs that sedate the Heart-shen are heavy and move down- wards, can injure the Stomach and Spleen, suppress the Qi in the Middle-Jiao, and cause nausea, fullness or pain of the stomach. Sheng Jiang can soothe the Stomach-Qi; Da Zao can tonify the Qi and blood. They are often used together to strengthen the function of the Stomach and Spleen and promote digestion, thus protecting the Middle-Jiao from the heavy herbs and minerals. Mai Ya is able to slightly ascend the Stomach-Qi and promote digestion. It is often used to protect the Stomach-Qi from suppression by the minerals. Zhi Gan Cao can tonify the Spleen-Qi and mod- erate the harsh action of the minerals. As it reduces the tension caused by constrained Qi in the Stomach, it is often used to protect the Stomach and Spleen. Envoy: Harmonize the formula Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) As the most commonly used herb, Zhi Gan Cao can integrate the actions and properties of herbs and minerals in a formula. Examples of classical formulas An Shen Wan (Pill to Calm the Shen) Source: Yi Xue Fa Ming Zhu Sha (Cinnabaris)* 15 g Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) 18 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 16 g Sheng Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix) 8 g Dang Gui (Angelicae sinensis radix) 6 g 308


Analysis of the formula This formula can directly descend Heart-fire and sedate the Heart-shen. It is used for a short period of time to treat acute anxiety caused by sudden uprising of Heart-fire. It can also nourish the Heart- Yin, which is injured by excess fire. In this formula: • Zhu Sha is used as chief. It is cold and heavy, enters the Heart meridian, can act powerfully and directly against the excess Heart-fire and sedate the Heart-shen. • Huang Lian is used as deputy. It is very bitter and cold, and enters the Heart meridian. It can descend Heart-fire, relieve irritability and therefore enhance the ability of Zhu Sha to sedate the Heart-shen. • The sweet Zhi Gan Cao is also used as deputy. As it moderates and smoothes the Heart-Qi, it stabilizes the function of the Heart-shen and calms the mind. • Sheng Di Huang and Dang Gui are used as assistants. Sheng Di Huang can nourish the Yin of the Heart and Kidney, which are injured by excess Heart-fire. It can also reduce the fire from the Heart and enhance the ability of Zhu Sha and Huang Lian to sedate the Shen. Dang Gui can tonify the blood, which is also injured by the excess fire. In addition, Dang Gui is used as corrective assistant in the formula to prevent blood stagnation caused by herbs with a cold nature and a downward- moving tendency. • Zhi Gan Cao also serves as assistant to protect the Stomach from the heaviness of Zhu Sha and the bitterness of Huang Lian. Commentary on strategies In this formula, several procedures are carried out to produce a quick and strong action of calming the mind. • First, all the ingredients enter the Heart meridian and work directly on the Heart. • Second, a strong mineral substance is used to intensively descend the fire, remove the fire- toxin and sedate the Heart-shen. • Third, herbs that directly reduce excess fire and empty-fire of the Heart are used to calm the mind. • Fourth, a large dosage of Zhi Gan Cao is used to smooth Qi movement and moderate the blood circulation, thus reducing tension and calming the mind. • Finally, the conditions of the Yin and blood are considered in the pathological conditions. It should be mentioned that processing of Zhu Sha is essential. It is ground with a lot of water, and only the finest powder that floats on the surface of the water is collected. After several repeated grindings and collection, the finest powder is used as a very thin coating on the herbal pills. Since the use of Zhu Sha in any form is forbidden nowadays, it can be substituted by Long Chi (Mastodi fossilia dentis), Zhen Zhu (Margarita usta) and Huang Lian (Cop- tidis rhizoma); however, the formula is no longer as strong and as quick. Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan (Emperor of Heaven’s Special Pill to Tonify the Heart) Source: She Sheng Mi Pou Sheng Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix) 120 g Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) 60 g Tian Men Dong (Asparagi radix) 60 g Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix) 15 g Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix) 15 g Dang Gui (Angelicae sinensis radix) 60 g Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 15 g Suan Zao Ren (Ziziphi spinosae semen) 60 g Bai Zi Ren (Platycladi semen) 60 g Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) 15 g Fu Ling (Poria) 15 g Jie Geng (Platycodi radix) 15 g Yuan Zhi (Polygalae radix) 15 g Zhu Sha (Cinnabaris)* (as coating of the pills; see above) Analysis of the formula This formula can nourish the Yin of the Heart and calm the mind. It is used for treating restlessness and insomnia due to Heart-Yin and Kidney-Yin defi- ciency and empty-fire. Besides restlessness and insomnia, symptoms such as palpitations, forgetful- ness, mental tiredness, constipation and ulcers in the mouth occur. A red tongue without coating and a thready, rapid pulse are also present. 309 Syndrome of disturbance of Heart-shen and formula compositionChapter In this formula: • Sheng Di Huang, sweet and cold, is used as chief to directly nourish the Yin of the Heart and Kidney. Since the bitter and cold nature of this herb can reduce fire and cool the blood, it can effectively calm the mind. • Xuan Shen, Tian Men Dong and Mai Men Dong are the deputies. They can nourish the Yin and reduce fire. They enhance the ability of Sheng Di Huang. • Dan Shen and Dang Gui are also used as deputies and work on the condition of the blood in order to house the Heart-shen. Dan Shen is able to tonify and promote the blood circulation, cool the blood of the Heart and reduce anxiety, irritability and palpitations. It also prevents blood stagnation from the side effect of the cold herbs in the formula. • There are several assistants: Ren Shen and Fu Ling tonify the Qi of the Heart so as to calm the mind; Suan Zao Ren and Bai Zi Ren nourish the Heart, calm the mind and improve sleep; Yuan Zhi and Zhu Sha calm the mind. • Jie Geng is used as envoy to guide herbs entering the Upper-Jiao. When all the herbs are used together, the Yin and blood are nourished, the Heart-Qi becomes firm and the mental state is stable again. Commentary on strategies In this formula, some features in addition to the points analyzed above are shown. • A group of herbs that enters both the Heart and Kidney meridians is selected to directly treat the disorders of these two organs; it is formed by Sheng Di Huang, Ren Shen, Yuan Zhi, Fu Ling and Wu Wei Zi. • A second group of herbs enters the Heart meridian and works directly on the disorder of the Heart; it is formed by Mai Men Dong, Dan Shen, Bai Zi Ren and Zhu Sha. • The third group works on the Kidney; it is formed by Tian Men Dong and Xuan Shen. • The final group is composed of sour herbs that are selected for stabilizing the Qi and Yin of the Heart in order to settle the mind; it is formed by Suan Zao Ren and Wu Wei Zi. All these procedures work together to fulfill the purpose of calming the mind. Analysis of the formula This formula can nourish the blood and calm the mind. It is used for treating a chronic condition of palpita- tions, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, night sweats, dizziness, and dry mouth and throat. The tongue coating is dry and the pulse is thready and wiry. These symptoms and signs are caused by blood deficiency of the Heart and Liver and the Shen of the Heart and the Hun of the Liver are unable reside there firmly. In this formula: • Suan Zao Ren is used as chief in a relatively large dosage. It can directly calm the mind and improve sleep. Since its sour taste can nourish and stabilize the Yin and Qi, it can reduce anxiousness, palpitations and night sweats. • Fu Ling, as deputy, enhances the function of Suan Zao Ren to tonify the Heart-Qi and calm the mind; Zhi Mu, another deputy, enhances the function of Suan Zao Ren to nourish the Yin and reduce heat, which is generated by long-term blood consumption in the Heart and Liver. • Chuan Xiong is used as assistant. It can activate the blood circulation, which stagnates or has the tendency to stagnate in the condition of disturbance of the Heart-shen. It also brings balance to the formula where many downward- moving herbs are used. • Zhi Gan Cao serves as assistant as well as envoy to enhance the ability of Fu Ling to tonify the Qi of the Heart. It can moderate and integrate the functions of all the herbs in this formula. Commentary on strategies This is a small formula containing only five herbs, but behind the herbs the formula is devised with a profound understanding of the pathology. Suan Zao Ren (Ziziphi spinosae semen) 15–18 g Fu Ling (Poria) 6 g Zhi Mu (Anemarrhenae rhizoma) 6 g Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma) 6 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 3 g Suan Zao Ren Tang (Sour Jujube Decoction) Source: Jin Gui Yao Lue 310


• First of all, it has a very clear structure. The five herbs treat five aspects of the disorder that are commonly seen in the chronic case – blood, Qi and Yin deficiency with empty-heat and stagnation of blood. • Second, the combination of cold herbs and warm herbs can treat the imbalance between heat and cold in longstanding mental disorders. • Third, the combination of using downward- moving herbs and upward-moving herbs indicates that it is important to harmonize the conflicted moving tendency of Qi and blood in chronic mental disorders. In chronic insomnia, disorders of blood deficiency of the Heart and Liver and stagnation of the Qi and blood, as well as empty-heat, often exist in one syndrome. This small formula matches the patho- logical condition and can therefore bring an effective result in clinical practice. An Shen Ding Zhi Wan (Calm the Shen and Settle the Will Pill) Source: Yi Xue Xin Wu Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 6 g Shi Chang Pu (Acori graminei rhizoma) 6 g Yuan Zhi (Polygalae radix) 6 g Long Chi (Mastodi fossilia dentis) 6 g Fu Ling (Poria) 9 g Fu Shen (Poriae cocos pararadicis) 9 g Analysis of the formula This formula can tonify the Qi of the Heart and Kidney, and promote a better connection of these two organs so as to calm the mind. It is used for treating a chronic condition of palpitations, restless- ness, dizziness, mental confusion and tiredness due to Qi deficiency of the Heart and Kidney and obstruction of the Heart meridian. A rapid, rootless pulse is often palpable and a pale tongue is often observed. In this formula: • Ren Shen is chief. As it tonifies the Qi of the Heart and Kidney, it can calm the Heart-shen and settle the Kidney-zhi. It is used for treating the cause of restlessness and fear. • The heavy and cold Long Chi is also chief in the formula. Since it enters both the Heart and Kidney meridians, can strongly descend the Qi and reduce heat, it can sedate the Heart-shen and settle the Kidney-zhi. It directly treats the manifestations. • Fu Shen serves as assistant. It strengthens the Qi of the Heart and enhances the function of Ren Shen. Moreover, it can directly calm the Heart-shen in a gentle and effective way. • Shi Chang Pu and Yuan Zhi are also used as assistants. They can remove the damp-phlegm that blocks the Heart meridian and thus improve the possibility of reconstructing the relationship between the Heart and Kidney. • Fu Ling is another assistant. First of all, it enhances the function of Ren Shen and Fu Shen to tonify the Qi of the Heart and calm the Heart-shen. Second, it enhances the function of Long Chi in descending the Qi as it moves downward. Third, it helps Shi Chang Pu and Yuan Zhi to dissolve the dampness. Commentary on strategies This formula shows smart composition skill in treat- ing the cause and the manifestations together in sub-acute and chronic conditions of restlessness. • It is gentle, but steady and effective, and does not have an extreme temperature feature. • In the formula, the tonifying and sedating substances are used together. Since Fu Ling and Fu Shen bring gentle actions among the strong herbs, the formula has no side effects of increasing restlessness from strong tonification or patients becoming sleepy from strong sedation. • Upward- and downward-moving herbs are used together with herbs that remove phlegm. They can sufficiently regulate and harmonize the Qi. In this way, the Heart and Kidney are connected in a very balanced way. This formula is not only a good example for study, but also an effective and commonly used formula in clinical practice. 311 Syndrome of disturbance of Heart-shen and formula compositionChapter

## 1 Syndrome of Liver-winddizziness, a slightly tight sensation in the head,

headache, blurred vision and tinnitus. • In a severe case, the Yang and heat may severely disturb the Qi movement of the Liver and also disturb the mind, leading to irritability, dream-disturbed sleep, distending pain in the hypochondriac region and a preference for a quiet and relaxing environment. • If the Liver-Yang and heat disturb the Stomach, patients may have a red face, a dry and bitter taste in the mouth, nausea or belching. • A red tongue or red border of the tongue indicates heat in the Liver; a thin, dry and yellow coating suggests heat accumulation but without obvious accumulation of food or phlegm. A thready pulse indicates deficiency of Yin, wiry indicates tension of Liver-Yang ascending and rapid is the sign of heat. These features of the pulse may become more distinct when the syndrome becomes more severe. If the Liver-Yang is not controlled with appropri- ate treatment, it may turn into Liver-wind, espe- cially under strong emotional disturbance and stress. At that time, the Liver-Yang rises rapidly and its speed stirs up the wind. • The symptoms and signs of Liver-wind are characterized by constant movement and quick change. Because the Liver controls the tendons, symptoms such as tremors or spasms of the limbs, severe dizziness, tingling or numbness of the limbs, and loss of balance in standing or walking appear. • In severe cases, the Liver-wind may disturb the Qi movement and blood circulation, and it pushes the Qi, blood, fire and phlegm to attack the head. The blood and phlegm may block the meridians and cover the mind. In this situation, the patient may suddenly lose consciousness, and afterwards suffer from hemiplegia and deviation of the eyes and mouth. • In this acute excess condition, a red tongue with a yellow and dry coating, and a wiry, forceful and rapid pulse indicate heat, Yang ascending and Qi disturbance of the Liver; a yellow and sticky tongue coating and a rapid, slippery and wiry pulse are the signs of phlegm- heat obstruction. (See Figure 14.1 on page 326.) Main symptoms Dizziness, tingling or numbness of the fingers and limbs, tremors or spasms of the limbs, headache, nausea, vomiting, loss of balance in standing or walking; in a severe case, loss of consciousness, hemiplegia, deviation of the eyes and mouth Secondary symptoms Irritability, dream-disturbed sleep, distending pain in the hypochondriac region, preference for a quiet and relaxing environment Tongue Red or only red on the border, with a thin, dry and yellow coating Pulse Thready and wiry, or thready, wiry and rapid Associated disorders in western medicine • Liver-Yang ascending: Hypertension, menopausal complaints, tinnitus, deafness, glaucoma, asthenopia, optic nerve atrophy, primary cataract and conjunctivitis. • Liver-wind disturbance: Epilepsy, severe case of hypertension and glaucoma, facial paralysis, facial spasms, cerebrovascular accident and its sequelae. Analysis of the syndrome The syndrome of Liver-Yang ascending is caused mainly by Liver-Yin deficiency. It often exists in people who are over 50 years old when the Yin of the Liver becomes weak with age; people who are under persistent stress where the restrained heat in the Liver may easily injure the Yin; people who suffer from chronic diseases, use certain medicines or have a dietary habit that leads to injury of the Liver-Yin. • When the Liver-Yin is too weak to control the Liver-Yang, the Yang rises, which disturbs the normal movement of Qi in the upper part of the body, especially the head, and causes 315 Syndrome of internal wind and formula compositionChapter Treatment principle: Anchor the Liver-Yang, pacify the Liver-wind, tonify the Yin and spread the Qi be used in smaller dosage, with a shorter treatment course or combined with herbs that protect the Stomach. Moreover, the mineral substances should not be used in pregnant women. 5. Caution when using poisonous substances: Of the substances that descend the Yang and extinguish wind of the Liver, Dai Zhe Shi (haematitum)*, Quan Xie (Scorpio)* and Wu Gong (Scolopendra)* are poisonous, thus the dosages should be carefully controlled. 1. Clear differentiation of the syndrome in the treatment process: It is important to make a clear differentiation of the syndrome and arrange appropriate treatment in order to treat the cause and the manifestations of the syndrome. In the acute situation, treat the manifestation first; in a chronic and sub-acute condition, treat both the cause and the manifestations. 2. Caution when using ascending herbs: In the formula, herbs that can stimulate the Qi and blood and have a strong ascending tendency should be used with caution because they may cause the Liver-Yang, heat, Qi and blood to ascend. 3. provide lifestyle and dietary advice: patients should avoid the factors that may cause ascending of Liver-Yang in their lifestyle and diet, such as stress and strong emotions, spicy food and alcohol. 4. Caution when using minerals: Since the mineral substances are heavy in weight, they are also heavy for the Stomach. For patients who are weak in the Spleen and Stomach, the mineral substances should Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Anchor the Liver-Yang and extinguish the Liver-wind Shi Jue Ming (haliotidis concha), Zhen Zhu Mu (Concha margaritifera usta), Ci Shi (Magnetitum), Long Gu (Mastodi fossilium ossis) and Dai Zhe Shi (haematitum) These substances are minerals, heavy in weight and strong in function. They have a descending tendency in action, can anchor the Liver-Yang, extinguish Liver-wind and direct the rebellious Qi and blood downward. These minerals can be selected sepa- rately or in a group as chief substances in the formula. Shi Jue Ming is salty and slightly cold, and enters the Kidney and Liver meridians. It is able to inten- sively descend the Liver-Yang, clear the Liver-fire and therefore extinguish the Liver-wind. It is also able to improve vision by treating disorders of the eyes due to Liver-Yang ascending and up-flaring of Liver-fire. It is often selected as one of the chief substances in formulas in both acute and chronic conditions. Zhen Zhu Mu is salty and cold, and enters the Heart and Liver meridians. Compared with Shi Jue Ming, it has the same function of descending the Liver-Yang and pacifying the Liver-wind, and can be used for the same indications, but the strength of this substance is weaker. However, the strong point of this substance is that, as it enters the Heart meridian, it can calm the mind and clear the heat there. In the formula that extinguishes the Liver- wind and anchors the Liver-Yang, it is particularly selected as chief in the condition of restless sleep, insomnia and palpitations. 316


Ci Shi is pungent, salty and cold, and enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. It is as strong as Shi Jue Ming in descending the Liver-Yang, but is less strong in calming the Liver-wind. However, Ci Shi has a stronger function of calming the mind from the approach of intensively descending the Liver-Yang. It can strengthen and stabilize the Kidney-Qi and Kidney-essence. It is selected in the formula as chief in a condition of Liver-Yang ascending and dishar- mony of Heart-Qi and Kidney-Qi, which is mani- fested as restlessness, tinnitus, deafness, weakness and stiffness of the back and legs. Long Gu is sweet, astringent and neutral, and enters the Heart, Liver and Kidney meridians. It descends the Liver-Yang and calms the Liver-wind. Since it is sweet and neutral, and causes less irrita- tion to the Stomach, it can be used for a longer period of time. Long Gu can also be used to calm the mind and treat restlessness. Dai Zhe Shi is bitter and cold, and enters the Liver and Pericardium meridians. This mineral is the strongest of these four substances to anchor the Liver-Yang and extinguish the wind. As it can intensively and quickly descend the Yang, wind, fire, phlegm, Qi and blood, it is often used for acute situations. However, since Dai Zhe Shi is a heavy, cold and bitter substance, can easily injure the Stomach and contains a little bit of arsenic, it cannot be used in a large dosage or for a long period of time. Tian Ma (Gastrodiae rhizoma)** and Gou Teng (Uncariae ramulus cum uncis) Tian Ma and Gou Teng are sweet in nature and enter the Liver meridian. They are able to pacify the Liver and extinguish Liver-wind. They are used to treat dizziness, headache, convulsions, tremor and spasm caused by Liver-wind. Tian Ma is sweet and neutral, and enters the Liver meridian. It has a moderate and moist nature. It is the first-line choice to extinguish Liver-wind because it not only pacifies the Liver and extin- guishes wind, and treats the manifestations (dizzi- ness, headache, dry and tired eyes), but also treats the cause (deficiency of Liver-Yin and blood). It can remove wind-phlegm and open the collaterals, and is used to treat dizziness with nausea and vomiting. If it is combined with herbs that promote the Qi movement and blood circulation, it can treat stiff- ness, pain, numbness and tingling of limbs, such as in the sequelae of cerebrovascular accident. Gou Teng is sweet and cold, and enters the Liver and Pericardium meridians. It has a strong function of clearing and reducing the Liver-heat, whether or not it is excess heat or empty-heat, and thus can calm the wind. It is particularly used to treat dizziness, headache, tinnitus, irritability, and red and irritated eyes. Because it enters the Pericar- dium meridian, it is also very effective for cooling the Heart, relaxing the tendons and calming the mind. Tian Ma and Gou Teng are often used together to accentuate their therapeutic actions in extin- guishing Liver-wind and are often selected in the formula as chief to treat sub-acute and chronic con- ditions. Deputy: Pacify the Liver-Yang, calm the mind, nourish the Liver-Yin and Kidney-Yin, reduce Liver-heat and descend the Qi and blood Ci Shi (Magnetitum), Long Gu (Mastodi fossilium ossis), Mu Li (Ostrea concha) and Zhen Zhu Mu (Concha margaritifera usta) These mineral substances can effectively and quickly descend the Liver-Yang and Heart-fire. In the formula to pacify the Liver in a sub-acute condition, they are particularly selected to strongly sedate the Heart-spirit and calm the mind. Since the Liver is the mother organ of the Heart, Liver-Yang ascend- ing may cause up-flaring of Heart-fire, which mani- fests as restlessness, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, a bitter taste in the mouth and a red face. Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora), Tian Men Dong (asparagi radix) and Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix) Bai Shao Yao is sour and cold, and primarily enters the Liver meridian. It can effectively nourish the Liver-Yin and soften the Liver. It can be selected as deputy in the formula to pacify the Liver-wind and descend the Liver-Yang in a chronic condition. Tian Men Dong and Sheng Di Huang are sweet and cold, and enter the Kidney meridian. Because the Liver and Kidney are closely related in physiol- ogy and pathology, deficiency of Liver-Yin and Kid- ney-Yin often exists at the same time. These herbs can indirectly tonify the Liver-Yin as well. Since Sheng Di Huang has a bitter taste, it can effectively cool the blood and reduce the fire. 317 Syndrome of internal wind and formula compositionChapter Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) and Long Dan Cao (Gentianae radix) Zhi Zi and Long Dan Cao are bitter and cold. They are often selected in formulas when excess Liver- heat presents. They can directly treat irritability, a bitter taste in the mouth, red eyes, tinnitus and scanty urine due to Liver-heat. Zhi Zi enters the Heart, Lung and San Jiao merid- ians, is able to drain heat from the San Jiao, espe- cially the Heart, and lead the heat out of the body through urination. Long Dan Cao directly enters the Liver meridian. It can powerfully and quickly drain the Liver-fire. Since these herbs have a descending tendency in action, they can enhance the strength of the substances that descend the Liver-Yang. Chuan Niu Xi (Cyathulae radix), Yi Mu Cao (Leonuri herba) and Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix) These three cold herbs all enter the Liver meridian, and have the functions of clearing heat in the blood, promoting blood circulation and removing congealed blood. They are selected in the formula to treat disturbance of blood circulation and blood stagnation. Regulating blood circulation is important in the treatment process of extinguishing Liver-wind and descending Liver-Yang because disturbance of blood always coexists in the syndrome of Liver-Yang and Liver-wind; it needs to be treated as a secondary syndrome. Moreover, when the blood circulation is disturbed, congealed blood can be formed. This is pushed by rebellious Qi and Yang, attacks and blocks the meridians, and causes related symptoms, such as in a cerebrovascular accident and heart attack, which are regarded as wind-stroke and chest Bi syn- drome respectively in traditional Chinese medicine. Furthermore, when the blood circulation is obstructed, blood may leave its pathway and bleed- ing starts. In order to prevent these serious conse- quences, the herbs that regulate and descend the blood, dissolve congealed blood and clear heat in the blood should be used in the formula. Chuan Niu Xi is bitter, sour and neutral, and enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. It can effec- tively descend the blood, promote urination, remove congealed blood and open the meridians. It also has the function of strengthening the Kidney. It is often selected for treating acute and sub-acute conditions. Yi Mu Cao is pungent, bitter and cold, and can promote blood circulation, clear heat and remove the congealed blood. It has a descending tendency in action and can promote urination. It is often selected for treating sub-acute and chronic syn- dromes of Liver-Yang ascending. Dan Shen is bitter and slightly cold, and enters the Heart and Liver meridians. Besides promoting blood circulation, it can effectively cool the blood and remove congealed blood, and treat chest pain, hypochondriac pain, a stifling sensation in the chest and irritability, especially under stress. All of these herbs help the chief to descend the Yang and pacify the wind in a more effective and quicker way. They are important deputies in the formula. Chuan Lian Zi (toosendan fructus), Xiang Fu (Cyperi rhizoma), Fo Shou (Citri sarcodactylis fructus), Xiang Yuan (Citri fructus) and Xuan Fu Hua (Inulae flos) These herbs can regulate the Qi, which is disturbed by the quick ascending of Liver-Yang and Liver- wind. As soon as the Qi descends or moves smoothly, Liver-wind is extinguished. For this reason, these herbs are often selected as deputies to treat the secondary syndrome. Chuan Lian Zi is very bitter and cold. It enters the Liver meridian and can directly and powerfully drain the fire and descend the Qi of the Liver. It is particularly selected in an acute or sub-acute condition where severe hypochondriac pain and distension exist. Since it is a poisonous herb, it is used for only a short period of time in an acute condition. Xiang Fu is pungent, bitter, sweet and neutral, and enters the Liver and San Jiao meridians. As Xiang Fu can spread and regulate the Liver-Qi in a moderate way, it can be used in both acute and chronic conditions. Fo Shou and Xiang Yuan are able to harmonize the function of the Liver and Stomach. They are particularly used for the condition where the Liver- Qi attacks the Stomach. The manifestations are loss of appetite, belching and a full sensation in the upper abdomen and hypochondriac region. Xuan Fu Hua is slightly warm, bitter, pungent and salty, and enters the Lung, Stomach and Large Intestine meridians. Since it can descend the Qi and eliminate phlegm from the Lung and Stomach, it can help the chief herbs and the herbs that regulate the Qi in the formula, especially when patients have such symptoms as shallow breathing, nausea, vomit- ing and belching. 318


Assistant: Open up the collaterals, improve vision and harmonize the Liver and Stomach Quan Xie (Scorpio)*, Wu Gong (Scolopendra)*, Di Long (pheretima) and Jiang Can (Bombyx batrycatus) In traditional Chinese medicine, some worms are considered as being able to get into the small col- laterals because they have the habit of drilling holes or passing through cracks. Worms that enter the Liver meridian can open the meridians and collater- als, and can therefore extinguish wind, relieve spasms and tremor, open the meridians and stop pain. Quan Xie and Wu Gong are pungent and poison- ous. Both are able to extinguish Liver-wind, relieve spasm, open the meridians and stop pain. The func- tions of these two substances are almost the same, but Wu Gong is stronger. They are often used together because these two substances can strongly accentuate each other’s actions and the dosage of each substance can be reduced. They are often used in the formula to treat severe cases of numbness, pain, tingling of the limbs and epilepsy attacks. Di Long is salty and cold. Its function of extin- guishing Liver-wind is weaker than that of Quan Xie and Wu Gong, but its function of clearing Liver-heat is stronger. It is more suitable for treating tremors with irritability or fever. Moreover, Di Long enters the collaterals and is able to open up the obstruc- tion. It is often selected for treating hemiplegia when the limbs are stiff, weak, numb and painful. Jiang Can is neutral and pungent. As it is able to remove the phlegm obstruction from the collaterals, it can treat spasms and numbness. It is often used in the formula to treat a chronic condition of Liver- wind. Qing Hao (artemisiae annuae herba) Qing Hao is bitter, cold and aromatic, and enters the Liver and Gall Bladder meridians. It can clear and disperse heat from these meridians, especially from the blood and Yin levels. In a formula that descends the Liver-Yang, Qing Hao is used as a cor- rective assistant to disperse and ascend the restrained Liver-Qi, which is suppressed by the heavy and cold descending minerals and herbs. Meanwhile, since Qing Hao can brighten the eyes, clear summer- heat and damp-heat, it can be selected if red and swollen eyes with blurred vision are present in the syndrome. Mai Ya (hordei fructus germinatus), Shen Qu (Massa medicata fermentata) and Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Mai Ya, Shen Qu and Zhi Gan Cao all enter the Spleen meridian. Mai Ya and Shen Qu are able to aid digestion and sweet Zhi Gan Cao can tonify the Spleen. In a formula for treating Liver-Yang ascend- ing and Liver-wind disturbance, they are used to protect the Stomach from heavy mineral substances and cold herbs. They are also used as corrective assistants to moderate the conflict between the min- erals in the formula and the Stomach-Qi. This is because, when the heavy minerals descend the Liver-Yang and sedate the Heart-shen, they can descend the rebellious Qi of the Stomach as well. On the other hand, when the action of minerals is too strong and too quick, it may suppress the Stomach-Qi. Mai Ya can slightly ascend the Qi of the Stomach and Spleen, the pungent and warm Shen Qu can disperse the constrained Qi, and the sweet Zhi Gan Cao can ease the tension between the heavy mineral substance and the rebellious Stomach-Qi. With these assistants, the formula becomes balanced.

It is used to treat acute, quick and intense ascending of Liver-Yang, which generates Liver-wind and causes dizziness, vertigo, distension of the eyes, tinnitus, a feverish sensation in the head, irritability, a flushed face and a wiry, forceful and long pulse. In an acute and severe condition, the Stomach-Qi, Liver-wind and Liver-Yang all move upwards, causing belching, severe headache, pressure in the chest, loss of balance in walking, and progressive motor dysfunction of the body or facial muscular cramp and twitch. In this condi- tion the Liver-Yang and wind should be sedated immediately in order to prevent a dangerous condi- tion – wind-stroke. This acute, excess pathological change is actually based on deficiency of Kidney-Yin and Liver-Yin, which are unable to control Liver- Yang. In this formula: • A large dosage of Huai Niu Xi is used as chief to directly descend the Liver-Yang and strengthen the Kidney. At the same time, it can lead water downwards and promote urination so as to cause the Liver-Yang to descend as well. • Dai Zhe Shi, Long Gu and Mu Li are used as deputies. All of these minerals are heavy in weight and intense in function. They can vigorously descend the Yang and extinguish the wind as they all enter the Liver meridian. They are especially used in an acute condition. • Gui Ban, Xuan Shen, Tian Men Dong and Bai Shao Yao are also used as deputies. This group helps Huai Niu Xi to nourish the Yin of the Kidney and Liver, and treat the cause of Liver- Yang ascending. They can also nourish the Yin, soften the tendons and relieve the cramp and trembling. • Chuan Lian Zi is used as assistant to drain the Liver-fire and move the Liver-Qi, thus assisting the descent of the Yang. • Yin Chen Hao is used as corrective assistant. As it ascends the Qi of the Gall Bladder, it can free the constraint of Liver-Qi, which exists as secondary syndrome and is worsened by applying herbs and minerals that have intensive descending actions. When Yin Chen Hao and Chuan Lian Zi are used together, one moves upwards and the other moves downwards; they can effectively regulate and ease the Liver-Qi. • Mai Ya also serves as corrective assistant. It ascends and spreads the Stomach-Qi, which is suppressed by the heavy minerals and cold herbs that anchor the Liver-Yang. • Zhi Gan Cao is used as both assistant and envoy to moderate the heavy and harsh substances in the formula and protect the Stomach. Commentary on strategies • This formula is characterized by strong action to anchor the Liver-Yang. • There are three big groups with clear, specific actions to treat three aspects of the syndrome and they are organized in a very balanced way. They treat the cause and the manifestations at the same time; they focus on stopping the pathological development of Liver-Yang and Liver-wind but do not ignore the proper movement of the Qi, the condition of the Stomach and the Liver. • These procedures enable herbs and minerals with strong actions to be accepted by the Stomach and the Liver without conflict in acute and excess conditions.

Analysis of the formula This formula is able to pacify the Liver-wind, clear heat and invigorate blood. It is used for treating the common syndrome or chronic condition of Liver- wind disturbance in a condition of Liver-Yin defi- ciency with Liver-Yang ascending. The main symptoms are headache, dizziness, irritability and insomnia. In this formula: • Tian Ma, Gou Teng and Shi Jue Ming are used as chief. Tian Ma is sweet and neutral, and can effectively extinguish Liver-wind in a condition of deficiency of Liver-Yin and blood. Gou Teng is sweet and cold, and can strongly clear and reduce either excess heat or empty-heat of the Liver, thereby pacifying Liver-wind. These two herbs can accentuate each other’s therapeutic actions. Shi Jue Ming can clear Liver-heat, descend the Yang and benefit the vision. When these three substances are used together, they can effectively treat dizziness, headache, blurred vision, and tired and dry eyes. • Zhi Zi and Huang Qin are used as deputies. They are bitter and cold, and can clear the heat of the Liver and in the Upper-Jiao. Because they have a descending tendency, they enhance the chief substances to descend the Yang of the Liver. They can also treat irritability, a bitter taste in the mouth and scanty urine due to Liver-heat. • Yi Mu Cao and Chuan Niu Xi are used as assistants in the formula. They regulate, descend and clear the heat in the blood. • Du Zhong and Sang Ji Sheng also serve as assistants. They enter the Liver and Kidney meridians, can tonify the Liver and Kidney, and therefore prevent the ascending of Liver-Yang and generation of Liver-wind. • Ye Jiao Teng and Fu Shen are used as assistants too. They calm the mind and improve sleep. Moreover, Sang Ji Sheng and Ye Jiao Teng relax the tendons and nourish blood, and are particularly suitable for treating insomnia with a sensation of discomfort in the body that is caused by high tension of the muscles. Commentary on strategies • This formula is used for treating a chronic, mild or common condition of Liver-Yang ascending and disturbance of Liver-wind. • It is composed in a balanced way of descending Liver-Yang and extinguishing Liver-wind, together with tonifying the Liver and Kidney. • It also considers the coexistence of Liver-heat that often disturbs sleep and brings an irritable mood. • If comparing this formula with Zhen Gan Xi Feng Tang, the previous formula, in herb selection and dosage arrangement, an obvious difference can be found between treating a severe and acute condition and a common or chronic condition of Liver-Yang ascending with Liver-wind disturbance.

<!-- chunk -->

## Heart and Liver

Main symptoms High fever, irritability, restlessness, dizziness, vertigo, twitches and spasms of extremities, and even convulsions Secondary symptoms Thirst, sweating, insomnia and restless sleep Tongue Deep red with a dry coating Pulse Wiry and rapid Associated disorders in western medicine Convulsions, especially in infectious diseases. Analysis of the syndrome This syndrome is caused by exogenous pathogenic heat which invades the body and disturbs the Heart and Liver. • The excess fire can directly generate wind that causes irritability, restlessness, dizziness and vertigo. • The excess heat consumes the Liver-Yin, which is unable to moisten and ease the tendons; therefore wind, which is manifested as spasms and twitching, may appear. 321 Syndrome of internal wind and formula compositionChapter • Heat may injure the blood and body fluids, cause blood stagnation and phlegm-heat obstruction. This may block the meridians and also cause spasm. • The signs of the tongue and pulse indicate an acute and excess heat syndrome. (See Figure 14.2 on page 327.) Treatment principle: Cool the Liver, nourish the Yin, eliminate phlegm- heat and congealed blood, and extinguish the internal wind Gou Teng (Uncariae ramulus cum uncis) Gou Teng is sweet and slightly cold, and enters the Liver and Pericardium meridians. It can directly cool the Liver and extinguish wind. It can effectively relax the tendons because it is a type of vine that particularly enters the meridians and collaterals. Qing Dai (Indigo naturalis) and Da Qing Ye (Isatidis folium) Qing Dai and Da Qing Ye are very cold herbs. They can directly cool the blood and reduce fever so as to extinguish wind. They can be selected as chief in the formula to treat a severe condition. Tian Zhu Huang (Bambusae concretio silicea) and Zhu Li (Bambusae succus) These two herbs come from bamboo. They are sweet and cold, and have the functions of clearing heat and transforming phlegm. However, the merid- ians entered and their differences in strength create differences in their application in formulas. Tian Zhu Huang enters the Heart and Liver meridians. It is effective in dislodging phlegm, clear- ing heat, cooling the Heart and controlling convul- sions. It is often used in formulas that treat childhood convulsions with high fever, irritability and night crying when phlegm-heat disturbs the Heart and Liver. Zhu Li is colder than Tian Zhu Huang. It enters the Heart, Lung and Stomach meridians. It has a lubricating nature and its function is characterized by strongly eliminating phlegm-heat, especially when the phlegm blocks the meridians and collater- als. The manifestations are numbness and tingling of limbs, and cramp and twitch of the muscles. Deputy: Nourish Yin, reduce heat and soften the Liver Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora), Tian Men Dong (asparagi radix) and Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix) Bai Shao Yao is sour, bitter and cold, and enters the Liver and Spleen meridians. Tian Men Dong and Sheng Di Huang are sweet, bitter and cold, and enter the Kidney meridian. These herbs can effec- tively nourish the Yin, reduce the heat and extin- guish internal wind. In addition, as Bai Shao Yao can soften the Liver and ease tendons, it is a good choice when there is muscle cramp and convulsions. Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Cool the Liver and extinguish wind Ling Yang Jiao (antelopis cornu)**/Shan Yang Jiao (Naemorhedis cornu), Shi Jue Ming (haliotidis concha) and Zhen Zhu Mu (Concha margaritifera usta) Ling Yang Jiao is salty and cold, and enters the Liver and Heart meridians. It can effectively cool the Liver and extinguish wind, and is often selected in formulas to treat excess heat in the Liver meridian, which stirs up the internal wind. Since Ling Yang Jiao is banned, Shan Yang Jiao can be used as a substitute. It has a weaker action compared with Ling Yang Jiao. Another substitute is the combination of Shi Jue Ming, which mainly clears the heat from the Liver, and Zhen Zhu Mu, which clears the heat from the Heart. 322


Assistant: Calm the mind and regulate the Qi and blood Zhen Zhu Mu (Concha margaritifera usta), Long Chi (Mastodi fossilia dentis), Ye Jiao Teng (polygoni multiflori caulis) and Fu Shen (poriae cocos pararadicis) Zhen Zhu Mu and Long Chi are mineral substances. They are cold in nature and enter the Heart and Liver meridians. They can intensively sedate the Heart-shen and calm the mind. They are especially used in the formula to treat restlessness and insom- nia caused by excess heat in the Heart and Liver. Ye Jiao Teng and Fu Shen have functions that are similar to those of Zhen Zhu Mu and Long Chi, but are gentler. They are often used in a less severe condition of internal wind to calm the mind and improve sleep. In addition, they can open the meridians and relax the tendons, and are par- ticularly useful in treating spasms and twitching of extremities. Sang Ye (Mori folium), Ju Hua (Chrysanthemi flos) and Bo He (Menthae herba) Sang Ye and Ju Hua are sweet, bitter and cold; Bo He is pungent and cold. They all enter the Lung and Liver meridians and have light dispersing and descending abilities. As assistants in formulas, they disperse constrained Liver-Qi and clear Liver-heat to treat secondary syndromes. They are particularly effective for treating dry eyes, blurred vision and headache. Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix) and Chi Shao Yao (paeoniae radix rubra) Dan Shen and Chi Shao Yao are bitter and cold herbs. They can cool the blood, reduce the heat from the Liver and the Heart, prevent generation of congealed blood and remove the congealed blood that has already been formed. They can be selected as assistants in the formula to treat a condition where the heat enters the blood, consumes the blood and leads to blood stagnation. Jiang Can (Bombyx batrycatus), Chuan Bei Mu (Fritillariae cirrhosae bulbus) and Zhu Ru (Bambusae caulis in taeniam) Jiang Can is neutral and pungent. As it is able to remove the phlegm that obstructs the collaterals, it can relieve spasms and treat numbness and paralysis. Chuan Bei Mu and Zhu Ru are cold and have the functions of clearing heat and removing phlegm. They can be selected as assistants in the formula to remove phlegm-heat, a product from disturbed Qi and water movement in the body. When phlegm obstructs the meridians, spasms and twitches may start. Examples of classical formulas Ling Jiao Gou Teng Tang (Antelope Horn and Uncaria Decoction) Source: Tong Su Shang Han Lun Ling Yang Jiao (Antelopis cornu)** 4 5 g Sang Ye (Mori folium) 6 g Chuan Bei Mu (Fritillariae cirrhosae bulbus) 12 g Sheng Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix) 15 g Gou Teng (Uncariae ramulus cum uncis) 9 g Ju Hua (Chrysanthemi flos) 9 g Fu Shen (Poriae cocos pararadicis) 9 g Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) 9 g Sheng Gan Cao (raw Glycyrrhizae radix) 2 4 g Zhu Ru (Bambusae caulis in taeniam) 15 g Analysis of the formula This formula is devised to treat internal wind stirred up by excess heat in the Liver and Heart. A high fever with irritability, convulsions with possible loss of consciousness, a deep red tongue with a dry coating and a wiry and rapid pulse indicate excess heat. In this formula: • Ling Yang Jiao and Gou Teng are used as chief substances to directly and intensively reduce the heat and extinguish wind. • Sang Ye and Ju Hua are used as deputies to disperse the wind and heat, and cool the Liver. • Bai Shao Yao and Sheng Di Huang are used as assistants to nourish the Yin, clear heat and ease and relax the tendons. • Chuan Bei Mu and Zhu Ru also serve as assistants to eliminate phlegm-heat that is produced by the disturbed Qi and water movement and blocks the meridians. 323 Syndrome of internal wind and formula compositionChapter • Fu Shen, as another assistant, calms the mind and relaxes the tendons. • Sheng Gan Cao is used as assistant to reduce heat-toxin and as envoy to harmonize the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, herbs that cool, pacify and soften the Liver are used together, with emphasis on clearing heat of the Liver. • In the formula, although there are only a few heavy minerals to descend the heat, there are a number of light and cooling herbs. They bring a quick, subtle and effective result. • In conditions of loss of consciousness with convulsions, formulas that open the orifices should be used in the first instance.

very strong but the body’s resistance and the Yin of the body are severely weakened. This condition can also be seen after severe dehydration from sweating, diarrhea or vomiting in infectious diseases or after improper treatment. • This pathological change has a special feature of fever, which may get worse in the Yin dominant time, such as in the afternoon and evening, or in the Yin regions of the body, such as the palms, soles and chest. Because the Yin and Qi are too weak to eliminate the pathogenic heat quickly, a lingering low-grade fever exists and the body is weak and thin. • When the Yin is not able to nourish the tendons, trembling fingers appear. • In a severe condition of Yin deficiency, dizziness, muscular spasms, rigid extremities and convulsion may occur. • When Heart-Yin is also severely injured, patients may lose consciousness. • The severe deficiency of Yin shows in a deep- red tongue with a dry coating, and a weak, thready, hollow and rapid pulse. (See Figure 14.3 on page 327.) Treatment principle: Nourish the Yin and extinguish the internal wind Main symptoms Trembling fingers, dizziness, bone steaming, warm palms and soles; in severe conditions there may be muscular spasms or rigid extremities, even loss of consciousness Secondary symptoms Dry mouth, afternoon fever, emaciation, blurred vision and headache Tongue Deep-red with a dry coating Pulse Thready, rapid, hollow or weak Associated disorders in western medicine Infectious diseases, dehydration, convulsions, peripheral neuropathy and Parkinson’s disease. Analysis of the syndrome • This syndrome is usually seen in a warm-febrile disease. When the pathogenic heat has passed Wei, Qi, Ying and Xue levels, the heat is not 324


Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Nourish Yin in order to extinguish wind Gui Ban (testudinis carapax)**, Bie Jia (trionycis carapax)**, E Jiao (asini corii colla), Ji Zi Huang (chicken egg yolk) and Huo Ma Ren (Cannabis semen) All of these substances can nourish the Yin and moisten dryness. They can be selected as chief in formulas to treat internal wind syndrome due to Yin deficiency. Gui Ban is salty, sweet and cold, and enters the Kidney and Heart meridians; Bie Jia is salty and cold, and enters the Liver meridian. Both enter the Yin and blood levels and have similar functions. They can strongly tonify the Yin, reduce empty- heat, anchor the Yang and treat bone steaming, low- grade fever, five-palm fever, dizziness, irritation, nausea and convulsions. Of these two substances, Gui Ban is stronger in tonifying the Yin and Bie Jia is stronger in reducing empty-heat. Since they are animal products, their functions are stronger than those of herbs. E Jiao is sweet and neutral, and enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. It can nourish the Yin and blood and moisten dryness. It has a similar function to Gui Ban in nourishing the Yin; however, unlike Gui Ban which can reduce heat, it can tonify the blood. Since it is also an animal product, its function is also stronger than that of herbs. Ji Zi Huang is salty and cold. It is considered a substance to nourish the Yin and moisten dryness, thereby extinguishing internal wind. It is also an animal product and is more effective in tonifying the body than herbs. Huo Ma Ren is able to moisten dryness and tonify the blood. In addition, it can moisten the intestines and promote bowel movement. It is very useful when constipation occurs in the condition of Yin and blood deficiency. Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) and Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Bai Shao Yao is sour, bitter and slightly cold, and enters the Liver meridian. Sour and cold may gener- ate the Yin, supplementing the Yin shortage and smoothing Liver-Qi movement. Moreover, since it can moisten the tendons and reduce the tension, it can indirectly extinguish wind. If the sweet Zhi Gan Cao is used together with Bai Shao Yao, the function of relaxing the tendons and smoothing the muscles will be enhanced. The bitter and cold properties of Bai Shao Yao can reduce the empty-heat that is produced by Yin deficiency. Deputy: Nourish the Yin, clear heat, descend the Liver-Yang and extinguish wind Shan Zhu Yu (Corni fructus), Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) and Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix) These three herbs have the function of nourishing the Yin. Shan Zhu Yu particularly tonifies the Liver- Yin, Mai Men Dong nourishes the Heart-Yin and Sheng Di Huang supplements the Heart-Yin and Kidney-Yin. They are used as deputies in the formula to enhance the ability of the chief to nourish the Liver-Yin and Heart-Yin, moisten dryness, relax tendons and therefore extinguish wind. Mu Li (Ostrea concha) and Shi Jue Ming (haliotidis concha) Since Kidney-Yin deficiency may lead to a tendency of Liver-Yang ascending, the cold and heavy Mu Li and Shi Jue Ming are often selected in the formula to descend the Liver-Yang and prevent the genera- tion of Liver-wind. If Liver-wind has already been generated, these minerals can directly extinguish the wind, clear heat and descend the Liver-Yang. Assistant: Calm the mind, relax tendons, open meridians and collaterals Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) and Fu Shen (poriae cocos pararadicis) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and neutral, and enters all meridians. A large dosage of Zhi Gan Cao is excel- lent in tonifying Qi and harmonizing the Qi move- ment as it has a moderate action. As its sweet taste may release tension, this herb can be used in the condition of severe Yin and Qi deficiency if the Qi 325 Syndrome of internal wind and formula compositionChapter is too weak to generate and stabilize the Yin. The moderate nature of Gan Cao is also used to ease muscles and tendons, and relieve cramp that is caused by Liver-Yin deficiency. Fu Shen is sweet, bland and neutral, and primarily enters the Heart meridian. In the formula for extin- guishing wind, it can be used as assistant to calm the mind, thus smoothing the movement of Qi, and assist the function of the other herbs to relax the tendons and muscles. Gou Teng (Uncariae ramulus cum uncis) and Luo Shi Teng (trachelospermi caulis) These herbs are cold in temperature and enter the Liver meridian. They are vines and are considered to particularly enter the meridians and collaterals. In the formula to extinguish wind, they are selected to relax the tendons and smooth the Qi movement and blood circulation in the collaterals so as to extin- guish wind. Zhu Ru (Bambusae caulis in taeniam) Zhu Ru is sweet and slightly cold, and enters the Lung, Stomach and Gall Bladder meridians. It is often used as assistant in the formula to ease the Stomach-Qi and remove phlegm-heat, which is pro- duced by disturbed Qi and water movement in the body. Xiang Fu (Cyperi rhizoma), Sang Ye (Mori folium) and Ju Hua (Chrysanthemi flos) These herbs are used as assistants in the formula to regulate the Liver-Qi and disperse the stagnation that is indirectly caused by Yin deficiency and heat disturbance. Xiang Fu is pungent, slightly bitter, sweet and neutral, and enters the Liver and San Jiao meridians. It can effectively promote and smooth the Liver-Qi movement. Sang Ye and Ju Hua are sweet, bitter and cold, and enter the Lung and Liver meridians. They have gentle dispersing and descending actions, and can be used as assistants to disperse the stagnant Liver-Qi and clear the heat. They can directly treat dry eyes, blurred vision and headache. Examples of classical formulas Da Ding Feng Zhu (Major Arrest Wind Pill) Source: Wen Bing Tiao Bian Sheng Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) 18 g E Jiao (Asini corii colla) 9 g Sheng Gui Ban (Testudinis carapax)** 12 g Sheng Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix) 18 g Huo Ma Ren (Cannabis semen) 6 g Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) 6 g Sheng Mu Li (Ostrea concha) 12 g Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) 18 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 12 g Ji Zi Huang (Chicken egg yolk) 2 pieces Bie Jia (Trionycis carapax)** 12 g Analysis of the formula This formula is devised to treat the aftermath of a warm-febrile disease. The Yin is severely injured by pathogenic heat, which causes lassitude, trembling fingers and limbs, a weak pulse, a deep-red tongue without coating and having a tendency to lose con- sciousness. In this formula: • Ji Zi Huang and E Jiao are used as chief to directly tonify the Yin and moisten the dryness in order to extinguish wind. • Sheng Di Huang, Bai Shao Yao, Mai Men Dong, Gui Ban and Bie Jia are used as deputies. They can nourish the Yin and clear heat. They enhance the ability of the chief to extinguish wind. • Huo Ma Ren, as assistant, moistens the dryness and enhances the function of the substances that nourish the Yin. • Mu Li, another assistant, clears heat and descends the Liver-Yang so as to prevent the generation of Liver-wind. It also enhances the function of the other substances to anchor and extinguish internal wind. • Wu Wei Zi and Zhi Gan Cao also serve as assistants. They are able to generate and stabilize the Yin and Qi of the body. 326


When all the substances are used together, the Yin is nourished, the heat is reduced and wind disap- pears. Commentary on strategies • The obvious feature of the composition of this formula is the use of animal products as chief and deputy substances. According to the concept of Chinese herbal medicine, humans, as

a species, are closer to animals than to plants and therefore animal products can tonify the human body quicker and more efficiently than herbal products. In a severe condition of Yin deficiency, they are the better choice in a formula. • Since some animal products are banned, it is advisable to include meat and eggs in the diet.

## Locked-up syndrome• If locked-up syndrome is caused by cold, the

Yang and Qi are blocked, and there are cold signs, such as cold limbs, pale complexion, a thick white tongue coating and a deep and wiry pulse. Treatment principle: Aromatically open the orifices, regulate the Qi and blood, clear heat or transform turbidity, eliminate phlegm Heat type Main symptoms Loss of consciousness, locked jaw, rigid limbs, clenched fists, no urination or bowel movement, high fever, irritability, red face, heavy breathing and warm limbs. Tongue Thick yellow coating. Pulse Rapid, slippery and forceful. Cold type Main symptoms Loss of consciousness, locked jaw, rigid limbs, clenched fists, no urination or bowel movement, cold limbs, pale complexion. Tongue Thick white coating. Pulse Deep and wiry. Associated disorders in western medicine Cerebrovascular accident, epilepsy, sunstroke, hys- teria, severe pain, fainting, hepatic coma and uremia. Analysis of the syndrome Locked-up syndrome is an acute, severe excess syn- drome, which may occur alone or develop from some severe disease. The pathological change is a sudden blockage of the sensory orifices and blockage of the functions of associated internal organs by rebellious Qi, blood, phlegm or ascending Yang. • The symptoms in this syndrome show obvious signs of blockage of the orifices and a locked-up body, such as loss of consciousness, locked jaw, rigid limbs, clenched fists, no urination or bowel movement. • In locked-up syndrome caused by heat, there are symptoms and signs of heat, such as high fever, irritability, red face, heavy breathing, warm limbs, a thick yellow tongue coating and a rapid, slippery and forceful pulse.


a clear differentiation between collapsing syndrome and locked-up syndrome is important. Locked-up syndrome is an acute excess syndrome. the orifices are locked up by disturbance of Qi and blood, which are complicated by phlegm, heat or cold, as well as ascending Yang. the symptoms are characterized by blockage of the orifices and a locked-up body, such as loss of consciousness, locked jaw, clenched fists, rigid limbs and a wiry, slippery and forceful pulse. treatment should be given to open the orifices, expel phlegm, clear heat or warm the internal cold, and harmonize the Qi and blood. Collapsing syndrome is a deficiency syndrome. It is caused by disharmony of Yin, Yang, Qi and blood when the Yang and Qi are too weak to hold the Yin and the blood and to carry on the functions of the internal organs. In this syndrome, patients lose consciousness gradually and have shallow respiration, shortness of breath, cold limbs, profuse sweating and incontinence of urine. the pulse is very deep and weak. this syndrome occurs in conditions where patients lose a large amount of blood, suffer from severe dehydration or myocardial infarction, or have severe infections. treatment should be given to strongly strengthen the Qi and rescue the Yang. after the patient wakes up, treatment for tonifying the weakness and harmonizing the functions of the internal organs should start. (See Figure 15.1 on page 333.) 331 Locked-up syndrome and formula compositionCHapter locked-up syndrome. Since Niu Huang and She Xiang are unavailable, this herb becomes more important in clinical practice. Synthetic She Xiang (Moschus), Su He Xiang (Styrax) and An Xi Xiang (Benzoinum) These aromatic substances are warm in nature. They can penetrate the turbidity, regulate Qi and open up blockage. They are often used in the formula to treat the cold type of locked-up syndrome. Deputy: Transform phlegm, clear heat-toxin, calm the mind and warm the interior Yu Jin (Curcumae radix), Tian Zhu Huang (Bambusae concretio silicea) and Zhu Li (Bambusae succus) These cold herbs can effectively eliminate phlegm- heat and revive the Heart-spirit. They are used in the formula to treat the heat type of locked-up syndrome. Shi Chang Pu (acori graminei rhizoma), Huo Xiang (agastachis herba) and Pei Lan (eupatorii herba) These warm and aromatic herbs can penetrate tur- bidity, transform dampness and regulate Qi move- ment. They are used in the formula to treat the cold type of locked-up syndrome. Xi Jiao (rhinoceri cornu)**, Ling Yang Jiao (antelopis cornu)**, Shi Gao (Gypsum), Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma), Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix), Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) and Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus) These cold substances can clear heat and remove heat-toxin. They are used in the formula to treat the heat type of locked-up syndrome. Xi Jiao and Ling Yang Jiao should be replaced by other substances. Jin Bo (Gold), Yin Bo (Silver), Zhu Sha (Cinnabaris)*, Zhen Zhu (Margarita usta) and Ci Shi (Magnetitum) These metals and mineral substances can calm the mind and relieve irritability. They are used in the formula to treat the heat type of locked-up syn- drome. It should be mentioned that Zhu Sha is a poisonous substance that should be replaced with other substances.


1. Select the appropriate form of administration: Since the aromatic ingredients that open the orifices can easily be destroyed by high temperature during cooking, the formulas are always prepared at low temperature. all of these formulas are available in pill form for emergency use. at present, herbal injections or transfusions are administrated for even quicker effects. 2. Use substitutes for banned products: although some substances such as She Xiang (Moschus)** and Niu Huang (Bovis calculus)** are banned, they can be substituted by synthetic versions. Xi Jiao (Rhinoceri cornu)** and Ling Yang Jiao (Antelopis cornu)** are also banned and should be replaced with other substances. 3. Choose a short treatment course: Since these aromatic substances strongly stimulate the Yin, Yang, Qi and blood, they may scatter and weaken the Qi. thus they should be applied only for a short period of time. after patients are revived from coma, treatment should be given according to the differentiation of the current syndrome. 4. Caution in pregnancy and bleeding conditions: the aromatic substances should not be used for pregnant women and in conditions of heavy bleeding as they can easily and quickly activate the Qi and blood. Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Aromatically open the orifices Synthetic Niu Huang (Bovis calculus), She Xiang (Moschus)** and Bing Pian (Borneol) These are aromatic substances. Niu Huang is cold and She Xiang is warm. They have a dispersing and penetrating ability, and as they move quickly, they can effectively open up blockage. They are often used in the formula to treat the heat type of locked- up syndrome. Bing Pian is pungent, cold and aromatic. It has a dispersing and penetrating ability, can quickly promote Qi movement and open the obstruction of the orifice. It is often used in formulas to treat 332


Assistant: Regulate the Qi and expel wind Mu Xiang (aucklandiae radix)**, Zhi Ke (aurantii fructus), Tan Xiang (Santali albi lignum) and Chen Xiang (aquilariae lignum) These aromatic herbs can particularly move the Qi and enhance the chief substances in the formula to open the orifices. Jiang Can (Bombyx batrycatus) and Quan Xie (Scorpio)* Jiang Can and Quan Xie can expel wind and elimi- nate phlegm from the collaterals. They are used in both the heat type and the cold type of locked-up syndrome. Examples of classical formulas As the following formulas are large in composition and are only used in patent form, only the differ- ences between these formulas are discussed. Comparison of the formulas An Gong Niu Huang Wan (Calm the Palace Pill with Cattle Gallstone) , Zhi Bao Dan (Greatest Treasure Special Pill) , Zi Xue Dan (Purple Snow Special Pill) and Su He Xiang Wan (Liquid Styrax Pill) The first three formulas contain substances that aro- matically open the orifices, clear heat-toxin and transform phlegm-heat. They are used for the heat type of locked-up syndrome. Although they all have the functions of the three aspects, there are some differences in applications: • for removing heat-toxin, An Gong Niu Huang Wan is the strongest and Zhi Bao Dan is the weakest • for reducing heat, Zi Xue Dan is the strongest and Zhi Bao Dan is the weakest • for transforming phlegm, Zhi Bao Dan is the strongest and Zi Xue Dan is the weakest. Su He Xiang Wan contains substances that are warm in temperature, can regulate the Qi, transform phlegm, penetrate turbidity and open the orifices. It is used for the cold type of locked-up syndrome. 333 Locked-up syndrome and formula compositionCHapter Cerebrovascular accident, epilepsy, sunstroke, hysteria, severe pain,faint Severe blood loss, severe dehydration, myocardial infarction, severe infections, terminal diseases Disturbance of Qi and blood Disharmony of Yin, Yang, Qi and blood Complicated with phlegm, heat or cold, and ascending Yang Yang and Qi fail to hold the Yin and the blood, fail to carry on the functions of the internal organs Loss of consciousness Locked-up syndrome Collapsing syndrome An acute excess syndromeA deficiency syndrome GraduallyQuickly Bl oc ks t he o rif ic es Lo ck s t he b od y Lo ss o f co ntr ol Fa il ur e t o su pp ort t he o rif ic es – very deep and weak pulse – a wiry, slippery and forceful pulse – shallow respiration – shortness of breath – cold limbs – profuse sweating – incontinence of urine – heavy breath – locked jaw – clenched fists – rigid limbs – no urine or bowel movement

skin diseases. They are often seen in cold, humid and windy places, among people who are weak in Defensive-Qi due to poor constitution or a weak- ened health condition. • As soon as pathogenic wind, cold or heat, and dampness invade the body and have passed the superficial region, they may obstruct the Qi movement and blood circulation in the meridians and collaterals, and cause pain of associated muscles and joints in the related regions. • If wind is predominant, the symptoms show a moving feature, such as pain migrating from one place to another, tingling, spasm and twitch of muscles and itch of skin. • In conditions where cold is predominant, pain is severe and worsens in cold weather. • If dampness is predominant, the symptoms show a heavy and lingering feature – for example, chronic heaviness and swelling of limbs and joints, chronic itchy and weeping skin disorder. • If damp-heat invades the body, or is transformed from stagnation of other pathogenic factors, it may obstruct the meridians and cause swelling of the joints with a red color and a warm or burning sensation, and red and weeping skin lesions. When the pathogenic factors have remained in the body for a long period of time, deficiency of the Kidney, Liver, Qi and blood may coexist with the exogenous pathogenic factors. • When the muscles and joints are not nourished and supported by Qi and blood, they become weak, stiff and numb, and the skin disorders become recurrent and chronic. • If the Kidney and Liver are injured, patients will suffer from stiffness of the joints and deep pain in the bones, which lead to difficulties with moving and walking. • A purple, bluish tongue and a wiry or tight pulse indicate the heaviness of the obstruction; a pale, flabby tongue and a weak, thready pulse indicate the deficiency. A yellow and moist tongue coating and a rapid pulse indicate the existence of wind, damp and heat. (See Figure 16.1 on page 345.) Main symptoms Pain of the body and headache, which worsen in cold, humid and windy weather; tingling, heavy, swollen, stiff and numb limbs and joints; swelling of joints with a red color and a warm or burning sensation; weakness of muscles and joints, difficulty with moving and walking for a long period of time; facial paralysis or facial spasm; skin disorders that are characterized by itchy, weeping, red skin lesions that are influenced by changes in the weather. Secondary symptoms Weakness, stiffness and numbness of muscles and joints and deep pain in the bones, which lead to difficulty in moving and walking; recurrent skin disorders. Tongue Purple or bluish tongue with a white coating, or pale and flabby with a white coating. Pulse Wiry or tight, weak or thready. Associated disorders in western medicine Rheumatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, cervical or lumbar spondylosis, osteoarthritis, sciatica, Ray- naud’s disease, vasculitis, pulmonary heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, coronary heart disease, migraine, hemiplegia after cerebrovascular accident, paralysis, facial paralysis, facial spasm, skin diseases that are influenced by changes in the weather and are characterized by itchy, weeping, red or dry skin lesions. Analysis of the syndrome The exogenous pathogenic wind, dampness, cold or heat can cause different syndromes, such as Bi syndrome (painful obstruction syndrome), Wei syndrome (weakness of muscles and paralysis) and 337 Syndromes caused by external wind, damp, cold or heatChapter Treatment principle: Expel exogenous pathogenic factors, promote Qi and blood circulation, tonify the Kidney and Liver, and tonify Qi and blood herbs, the processing method and the patient’s sensitivity, this may vary greatly. another feature is that the toxic dose is very close to the therapeutic dose, thus the dosage and therapeutic duration should be controlled carefully.


1. pay attention to the conditions of Yin, blood and body fluids: Because the herbs that expel wind, damp and cold are mostly warm, pungent and bitter, and have a drying nature, they should be used with caution in patients who suffer from deficiency of Yin, blood or body fluids. 2. Caution when using toxic herbs: although herbs that expel wind, damp and cold have very good results in alleviating pain and relieving the suffering of patients, some of these are toxic and overdose may lead to poisoning and even death. as toxicity is influenced by the growing habitat of the Structure of the formula and selection of the herbs Chief: Directly expel wind-cold- dampness or wind-damp-heat Qiang Huo (Notopterygii rhizoma) and Du Huo (angelicae pubescentis radix) Qiang Huo and Du Huo are commonly used to expel wind, dampness and cold from the body and to treat Bi syndrome. They are often used together to treat pain, heaviness, stiffness, tingling sensations and numbness of the affected regions of the body. Qiang Huo is pungent, bitter and warm. It enters the Bladder meridian primarily and the Liver and Kidney meridians secondly. Its pungent and warm nature gives Qiang Huo strong dispersing and ascending abilities. It is very effective and quick in expelling wind, dampness and cold in the superficial regions of the body such as the skin, subcutaneous region and muscles, especially in the upper half of the body. It is suitable for selection as chief in the formula for treating general pain, headache and stiff- ness of the back. Du Huo is also pungent, bitter and warm, but much gentler in nature than Qiang Huo. It enters the Kidney meridian and is especially effective in eliminating wind, dampness and cold from the deeper regions of the body, particularly the lower half. Because of its nature, Du Huo eliminates path- ogenic factors from the body in a more constant and gentle way. It is more suitable for chronic cases of arthritis and other disorders of the muscles and joints when patients complain that the pain is deep in the bones and joints. Because it enters the Kidney meridian and treats Bi syndrome, Du Huo is more effective for treating disorders of the knees, back and heels. Comparing their function, Qiang Huo is warmer and has better results in eliminating cold and reliev- ing pain; Du Huo is more effective in eliminating damp and has better results in treating heaviness and numbness of the body and joints. Qiang Huo and Du Huo are often used together to expel the wind, 338


dampness and cold in the entire body and in acute, sub-acute and chronic conditions. Fu Zi (aconiti radix lateralis preparata)*, Chuan Wu (aconiti carmichaeli radix)*, Cao Wu (aconiti kusnezoffii radix)*, Xi Xin (asari herba)*, Wei Ling Xian (Clematidis radix) and Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) These six herbs are effective for treating Bi syn- drome as a result of cold. They are very hot and pungent, and have strong ascending and dispersing abilities. They can strongly disperse wind, cold and dampness, intensively warm the meridians, acceler- ate the movement of Qi and blood, and thus effec- tively relieve pain. Fu Zi enters the Heart, Spleen and Kidney merid- ians. It is swift and violent in its action of spreading warmth, scattering cold, drying dampness and warming the meridians. Because of its strength, it is considered a herb that enters the 12 regular merid- ians. It is used as chief to treat Bi syndrome, espe- cially when cold is predominant with symptoms of severe cramping pain. Chuan Wu and Cao Wu have functions similar to those of Fu Zi but they are stronger in expelling cold and warming the interior. They are also stronger in opening the meridians and stopping pain. They are suitable to treat Bi syndrome when wind and cold are predominant. Xi Xin is very pungent and warm, and enters the Lung, Heart and Kidney meridians. Its pungent and aromatic smell gives it a penetrating ability, allowing it to enter the deeper regions of the body. No matter how deep the wind and cold invade, and how tight the tissues may be, Xi Xin is very effective in elim- inating them and opening the meridians and collat- erals, thereby alleviating pain. It is often selected as chief when the pain is severe and deep in the bones, accompanied by a purple or bluish tongue with a white coating, and a deep, slow and wiry pulse. They indicate that cold is predominant and has entered the Kidney meridian. Wei Ling Xian is pungent, salty and warm, and enters the Bladder meridian. It has dispersing, moving and opening abilities. It moves very quickly and has quite a strong action of expelling wind and transform- ing dampness. Wei Ling Xian is very effective in opening up the meridians and collaterals, and it can treat numbness and tingling sensations of the limbs. Gui Zhi is pungent, sweet and warm, and enters the Heart, Lung and Bladder meridians. Unlike Fu Zi, which spreads the warmth quickly, and unlike Xi Xin, which expels cold from deep regions, it expels wind and alleviates pain by warming the meridians, activating and tonifying the Heart-Yang, promoting the blood circulation and relaxing the tendons. It has a sweet taste, which makes this herb move more slowly than the others, but since it can tonify the Heart and its action lasts longer, the con- dition of the patients can be improved steadily. Except for Gui Zhi, these herbs are poisonous, especially Cao Wu. They must be used after process- ing, and even then the dosage must be controlled carefully. Large dosage or long-term use may consume the Yin and further injure the Yang, espe- cially when the Yang of the internal organs is weak. Again except for Gui Zhi, these herbs are pungent and hot, move quickly and recklessly, and can consume the Qi and Yin. They can improve the condition of patients quickly but briefly. For these reasons, it is recommended that some sweet and warm herbs can be added to the formula to tonify the Qi and Yin in order to reduce the side effects of these harsh herbs. Huang Bai (phellodendri cortex) and Yi Yi Ren (Coicis semen) These two herbs are usually used for Bi syndrome caused by wind, dampness and heat. They are also selected for treating some skin disorders caused by damp-heat. Huang Bai is bitter and cold, and enters the Kidney and Bladder meridians. It can dry dampness and reduce heat in the Lower-Jiao. It is suitable for use when the joints in the lower part of the body are red, warm and swollen and the skin lesions are red, itchy and weeping. Yi Yi Ren is sweet, bland and slightly cold, and enters the Spleen, Stomach and Lung meridians. This herb can eliminate dampness, promote urina- tion and clear heat. It is suitable for use when the joints are swollen with a burning sensation and the skin lesions are red, itchy and weeping. Sang Zhi (Mori ramulus), Luo Shi Teng (trachelospermi caulis) and Xi Xian Cao (Sigesbeckiae herba) These herbs are usually used to treat Bi syndrome caused by wind, dampness and heat. Sang Zhi is bitter and neutral, and enters the Liver meridian. It is the twig of the plant, and can open the meridians and expel wind and dampness. It is particularly selected when edema and cramp of the limbs are present. 339 Syndromes caused by external wind, damp, cold or heatChapter Luo Shi Teng is bitter and slightly cold, and enters the Heart, Liver and Kidney meridians. As it is a vine, which is considered to enter the meridians and collaterals, it is selected when the joints and muscles are warm, swollen, stiff and painful. Xi Xian Cao is pungent, bitter and cold, and enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. It enters the deep regions of the body, the tendons and the bones. It searches out and expels wind, dampness and heat. It is selected when a Bi syndrome is at the active stage and the joints are swollen and painful with a burning sensation. Moreover, it can eliminate wind- dampness and treat heaviness and numbness of the limbs. Because it enters the Liver and Kidney merid- ians, Xi Xian Cao is especially effective in treating weakness and stiffness of the knees and back, pain of the bones, numbness and a tingling sensation of the limbs. Deputy: Invigorate blood, open up the meridians and collaterals Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix), Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma) and Hong Hua (Carthami flos) These herbs are warm and pungent, and enter the Heart and Liver meridians. They can invigorate the blood and promote blood circulation. They are used for treating chronic Bi syndrome that is character- ized by stubborn pain, numbness, and cold, weak and stiff limbs. They can also be selected to treat chronic skin disorders when the skin lesions are purple, dark in color, itchy, dry and thick. Dang Gui is sweet, warm and pungent, can tonify the blood and promote blood circulation. Because of its tonifying function, it is particularly selected for long-term use. Chuan Xiong is pungent and warm. It moves quickly and is considered as a herb that moves the Qi in the blood. Because of its speed, it can effectively stop pain in a Bi syndrome and soften hard, thick skin lesions in skin diseases. Hong Hua is also pungent and warm. It can effectively dissolve congealed blood and promote blood circulation, and therefore can also relieve pain. It is often selected in a formula that is used for this condition. Di Long (pheretima), Dang Gui Wei (angelicae sinensis radix extremitas) and Lu Lu Tong (Liquidambaris fructus) These substances are selected particularly to open up collaterals. Di Long is salty and cold, has drilling and moving abilities, and can enter the Liver, Kidney and Lung meridians. It is able to open the meridians and collaterals and treat pain, numbness, tingling and cramp of the limbs. Dang Gui Wei is considered as having a strong function of invigorating the blood; its fine fibrils can particularly open the collaterals. It can be used to treat chronic Bi syndrome and skin disorders when the blood is deficient. Lu Lu Tong is pungent, bitter and neutral, and enters all the meridians. Lu in Chinese means road; Tong means open. The name indicates that this herb is able to open the meridians and collaterals, expel wind-dampness and treat stiffness and numbness of the limbs in Bi syndrome. Hai Feng Teng (piperis caulis) and Qing Feng Teng (Sinomenii caulis) These two herbs are commonly used for expelling wind-dampness and unblocking the meridians. When stiffness and pain of the joints and muscles are present, they can both be applied. They are vines, which are considered as entering the collaterals. Hai Feng Teng is pungent, bitter and slightly warm, and enters the Liver and the Kidney merid- ians. It is usually used for Bi syndromes character- ized by cramping pain and stiffness. Qing Feng Teng is bitter and neutral, and enters the Liver meridian. It treats Bi syndrome caused by wind-dampness. It can also promote urination, and is especially suitable for use when joints and limbs are swollen with edema and there is scanty urine. Bai Hua She (agkistrodon acutus)* and Wu Shao She (Zaocys) Bai Hua She and Wu Shao She are two types of snake. They have the function of expelling exoge- nous wind from different areas of the body no matter how long the wind has been present and how deep it has penetrated. Both substances enter the Liver meridian. It is believed that they can reach any part of the body in spite of the depth owing to their drilling and moving abilities. Bai Hua She is sweet, salty, warm and poisonous; its function of expelling wind is very strong and quick. Wu Shao She is sweet and neutral; its function is gentler and slower. They are important substances for treating chronic Bi syndrome due to wind invad- ing the meridians. They are also used to treat dry, thick and itchy skin lesions. 340


Assistant: Expel wind, cold, dampness and relax tendons, tonify the Qi and blood, strengthen tendons and bones Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix), Gao Ben (Ligustici sinensis radix), Ma Huang (ephedrae herba)* and Xing Ren (armeniacae semen) They are usually used during the onset of Bi syn- drome when the exogenous pathogenic factors are in the superficial region of the body, especially the upper part of the body. The symptoms are sudden onset of pain, swelling of joints, fever, chills and general pain. These herbs can disperse the Lung-Qi and regulate the Qi of the Bladder meridian. For these reasons they can expel exogenous pathogenic wind, dampness and cold. Shen Jin Cao (Lycopodii herba), Tou Gu Cao (tuberculate speranskia herba) and Hai Tong Pi (erythrinae cortex) These herbs are selected particularly for treating dis- orders related to tendons, bones and muscles. Shen Jin Cao is a pungent, bitter and warm herb, but it is not dry in nature. It enters the Liver meridian and is espe- cially effective in treating disorders of the tendons. It is able to expel wind, open the meridians, promote blood circulation and relax the tendons. It is mostly used for chronic Bi syndrome, which manifests as stiff limbs, difficulty with moving and walking, soreness of the tendons and bones, and numbness of the skin. Tou Gu Cao is able to reach the bones, expel wind and eliminate dampness from the bones. It is bitter and warm, and enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. When wind, dampness and cold stay in the body for a very long period of time, and the tendons become very stiff and the joints and the bones are very painful, Tou Gu Cao can be applied. Hai Tong Pi is bitter, pungent and neutral, and enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. It has func- tions of expelling wind-dampness and treating numbness of the limbs. It is characterized by opening up the meridians and collaterals, and directly reach- ing the affected region. It is used particularly for stiffness and numbness of the back and knees. As it is a neutral herb, it can be used for Bi syndrome with either cold or heat in the pathological changes. Di Long (pheretima) and Jiang Can (Bombyx batrycatus) In traditional Chinese medicine, worms are consid- ered as being able to get into the small collaterals because they have the habit of drilling holes or passing through cracks. They are often used to open the meridians, extinguish wind, relieve spasms and control tremor. In particular, they are often used together with herbs that remove phlegm which obstructs the collaterals. They can relieve spasms and twitch such as in facial paralysis or facial spasm. Di Long is salty and cold, and has the function of extinguishing wind and clearing Liver-heat. Di Long particularly enters the collaterals and is able to open up the obstruction, so it is often selected for treating hemiplegia when the limbs are stiff, weak, numb and painful. Jiang Can is neutral and pungent. As it is able to remove phlegm obstruction from the collaterals, it can relieve spasms, numbness and paralysis. Mu Gua (Chaenomelis fructus) and Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) Mu Gua and Bai Shao Yao are sour in nature and enter the Liver meridian. They can regulate the Liver and relax the tendons. They can be used together to relieve cramping pain of the muscles and tendons of the limbs. However, there are some dif- ferences in their actions. Mu Gua relaxes the muscles by transforming dampness and invigorating the collaterals; it treats cramps and stiffness, which are caused by damp- ness. Bai Shao Yao is able to nourish the Yin and blood and therefore relax the muscles and tendons; it treats cramp or spasm. In the condition when cramp is caused by dampness obstruction as well as Yin deficiency, Mu Gua and Bai Shao Yao should be used together. In addition, they can be applied as corrective assistants in the formula to prevent the pungent and hot herbs consuming the Yin. Dang Shen (Codonopsis radix), Huang Qi (astragali radix), Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix) and Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) Dang Shen and Huang Qi can effectively tonify the Qi and strengthen the muscles; Dang Gui and Bai Shao Yao can tonify the blood. They are often selected in the condition of Wei syndrome when the muscles are thin and weak. They are also selected in the formula to treat chronic Bi syndrome in the condition of deficiency of Qi and blood. They are also often used in elderly people or people with a weak constitution. 341 Syndromes caused by external wind, damp, cold or heatChapter Xu Duan (Dipsaci radix), Sang Ji Sheng (taxilli herba) and Gou Ji (Cibotii rhizoma)** These three herbs are bitter and warm, and enter the Liver and Kidney meridians. They have the func- tions of expelling wind-dampness, tonifying the Liver and Kidney and strengthening the tendons and bones. Although they can all treat chronic Bi syn- drome and Wei syndrome characterized by stiff joints, sore and painful back and knees, weakness of the muscles of the legs and difficulty with walking, there are some differences in their functions: • Xu Duan can invigorate the blood and promote the healing process of the bones and tendons; it is especially suitable to treat trauma and fracture. • Sang Ji Sheng is a gentle herb, neutral and moist; it can nourish the blood, relax the tendons and is especially suitable for treating chronic Bi syndrome. • Gou Ji enters not only the Liver and Kidney meridians, but also the Du meridian; it is especially effective in strengthening the bones, opening the obstruction and treating stiffness, weakness and pain of the back or the whole spinal column. In chronic Bi and Wei syndromes, because both the Liver and Kidney are weak, and the bones, tendons and muscles are all weak, these herbs can be used together to strengthen the therapeutic effects. Examples of classical formulas Qiang Huo Sheng Shi Tang (Notopterygium Decoction to Overcome Dampness) Source: Nei Wai Shang Bian Huo Lun Analysis of the formula This formula expels wind and eliminates dampness from the superficial and subcutaneous regions of the body. It treats wind-dampness in the superficial level of the body together with blockage of Qi movement and blood circulation – an acute and excess condition. This syndrome is manifested as stiffness and pain of the neck, back and shoulders, headache, heaviness of the body, aversion to cold with mild fever, a white, slightly sticky tongue coating and a superficial pulse. In this formula: • The pungent, bitter and warm Qiang Huo and Du Huo are chief; they can expel wind, cold and dampness from the upper and lower parts of the body respectively. • The deputies are Fang Feng and Gao Ben. Because Fang Feng enters the Spleen meridians, it especially expels wind-dampness from the superficial and subcutaneous regions. Gao Ben enters the Bladder meridian, expels wind and cold, and can effectively relieve headache as its aromatic smell can quickly reach the top of the head. • Man Jing Zi, as helping assistant, can expel wind-dampness, regulate the Qi in the head and relieve headache. Chuan Xiong also serves as assistant and is used to activate the Qi and blood, expel wind and relieve headache. • Zhi Gan Cao is used as envoy in the formula to harmonize the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies In this formula, several features are shown: • The pungent, warm and aromatic herbs are used to expel wind, dampness and cold; their dosages are quite small. This suggests that a gentle dispersing action in the superficial region should be induced at this moment because the heavy and lingering dampness cannot be expelled by a quick action. • In this formula, a group of herbs that treats headache are mentioned. Depending on the meridian entered, they treat headache in different regions of the head – Qiang Huo enters the Bladder meridian and treats headache specifically on the back of the head; Gao Ben also enters the Bladder meridian but treats pain on the top of the head; Chuan Xiong enters the Liver and Gall Bladder meridians and treats Qiang Huo (Notopterygii rhizoma) 6 g Du Huo (Angelicae pubescentis radix) 6 g Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix) 3 g Gao Ben (Ligustici sinensis radix) 3 g Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma) 3 g Man Jing Zi (Viticis fructus) 2 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 3 g 342


headache specifically on the lateral sides of the head.

It is used for treating the initial stage of a syndrome where wind and dampness invade the meridians and collaterals in a condition of Qi and blood deficiency. The path- ogenic wind and dampness obstruct the Qi and blood and generate heat, and all the pathological factors block the meridians and collaterals. The manifestations are deviation of the mouth and eyes, stiffness of the tongue, and difficulty with moving the arms and legs. In this formula: • Qin Jiao, as chief, is used with a large dosage. It can expel wind and dampness, and open the meridians and collaterals. • Qiang Huo, Du Huo, Fang Feng, Xi Xin, Sheng Jiang and Bai Zhi serve as deputies.

It is used to treat chronic Bi syndrome due to wind and damp with a chronic condition of blood and Qi deficiency. In this formula: • Du Huo is used as chief. It is able to expel wind, dampness and cold, and can tonify the Liver and Kidney. • Xi Xin, Qin Jiao and Fang Feng are used as deputies. They enhance the ability of Du Huo to expel cold, dampness and wind respectively, thus relieving pain and heaviness of the limbs. • Dang Gui, Bai Shao Yao, Shu Di Huang and Chuan Xiong are used as assistants. They tonify the blood and promote the circulation of the blood. • Ren Shen and Fu Ling are used to tonify the Qi; Rou Gui warms the Kidney; Sang Ji Sheng, Du Zhong and Huai Niu Xi can strengthen the Kidney and relax the tendons. They are all used as assistants. • Gan Cao is used as envoy to harmonize the functions of different herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies This formula contains many herbs, yet it is clear in structure and strong in function. Since it can tonify the weakness, it is suitable to be used for chronic Bi syndrome and for a reasonably long period of time. Bai Fu Zi (Typhonii rhizoma praeparatum)* Jiang Can (Bombyx batrycatus) Quan Xie (Scorpio)* The three substances are applied in equal dosage and the powder is mixed with warm alcohol. Analysis of the formula This formula can expel wind and phlegm, and thus relieve spasm. It is used when wind attacks the face where phlegm has accumulated. The wind stirs the phlegm, blocking the collaterals and causing spasm of muscles or facial paralysis. In this formula: • The pungent and hot Bai Fu Zi is used as chief to disperse the wind and eliminate phlegm in the collaterals and subcutaneous region, particularly on the face. • Jiang Can and Quan Xie are used as deputies. They particularly expel wind, invigorate the collaterals and relieve spasm. • Alcohol will stimulate these substances to spread in the affected regions and also enhances the action of this formula. It is considered as assistant and envoy in the formula. Commentary on strategies This is a very small formula but it is very strong in function and quick in action. • It focuses on treating wind and phlegm, especially on the face. • In clinical practice, it is used not only to treat facial paralysis and spasm, but also epilepsy due to wind and phlegm. • As Bai Fu Zi and Quan Xie are very poisonous, the dosage and treatment course should be controlled carefully. 344

They can strongly clear heat, especially from the muscles, and are used when red rashes appear. • Wind-heat easily injures the Yin and blood, and dryness of blood can make the itch worse. Dang Gui, Sheng Di Huang and Hei Zhi Ma are used as assistants to tonify the blood, nourish the Yin, cool the blood and moisten dryness so as to treat this condition. In addition, since the chief and deputies are drying in nature and can weaken the Yin and blood, these three herbs can reduce the side effects. • Gan Cao is used as assistant and envoy to clear heat, remove toxins and harmonize the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies • This formula contains the main treatment aspects for skin disorders, e.g. expel wind, eliminate dampness, clear heat, cool the blood and nourish Yin. As such, it is considered a principal formula to treat general conditions of common skin disorders. • Since it treats many aspects, it is not very strong in action. It is often used for chronic conditions after varying the formula to generate clearer and stronger actions in one or two specific aspects to treat a specific syndrome.

## Syndrome of dryness

Dryness has a contracting and holding nature. It is associated with the Lung and predominates in the autumn. Pathogenic dryness can be divided into external dryness and internal dryness. External dryness is one of the six exogenous pathogenic factors; it appears in the autumn and directly injures the Lung. In the early autumn, dryness is often combined with heat and it con- sumes the body fluid and Yin of the Lung – this syndrome is referred to as warm-dryness. In the late autumn, dryness is mainly combined with cold and causes obstruction of spreading of the body fluid of the Lung – this syndrome is referred to as cold- dryness. Internal dryness is caused directly by the con- sumption of body fluids. Some diseases, medicines, herbs or food products can injure the body fluids and cause dryness. Long-term stress and emotional disturbance can also cause consumption of the body fluids. As the Lung, Stomach and Large Intestine are mainly involved, the syndrome of dryness can be respectively divided into dryness in the Upper-, Middle- and Lower-Jiao. In clinical practice, external dryness and internal dryness can coexist.

Main symptoms Dry nasal cavity, dry throat, cough with scanty sputum, shortness of breath, dry mouth, thirst, acid regurgitation, constipation and hemorrhoids. Secondary symptoms Cough with blood-streaked sputum, a dry and sore throat, sadness, depression, tiredness, anxiety, mood swings, hot palms and soles, night sweats. Tongue Red with a dry, yellow, thin coating. Pulse Thready and rapid. Associated disorders in western medicine Common cold, influenza, recovery period of influ- enza, bronchitis, pneumonia, chronic rhinitis, tuber- culosis and other infectious diseases caused by bacteria and viruses, diabetes, peptic ulcer, irritable bowel syndrome, constipation and hemorrhoids, skin diseases that are characterized by dryness of the skin lesions, such as disorders of keratinization and senile pruritus. 349 Syndrome of dryness and formula compositionChapter Analysis of the syndrome The Lung is an organ that is directly exposed to the environment. It is a very fragile organ, which cannot bear warmth, cold and dryness. It needs fluid to nourish its light body and Qi to support its function. If these conditions are not fulfilled, symptoms of dysfunction immediately appear. Warm-dryness • Exogenous pathogenic warm-dryness can injure the Lung-Qi and fluid, block the Qi dispersing and descending, and directly cause cough with thin, scanty sputum. • The nose is the passage and the throat is the gateway of the Lung. When the Lung-Qi is disturbed, nasal obstruction, dry nasal cavity and dry throat may occur. • The Lung relates to the skin and controls the opening and closing of the pores. When dryness obstructs the superficial region of the body, slight headache, chills and aversion to wind and cold may exist. • The warm-dryness consumes the fluids directly and causes thirst, a red and dry tongue and a superficial and rapid pulse. Cold-dryness • When exogenous pathogenic cold-dryness invades the superficial region of the body, closes the pores, obstructs the Qi movements there and further obstructs the Lung, it may cause dysfunction of dispersing and descending of Lung-Qi. The patient may have a slight headache with chills, aversion to wind and cold, a blocked nose and cough with thin and scanty sputum. • When the distribution of fluid is blocked, and the fluid condenses and turns into phlegm, the patient may suffer from dry nasal cavities and dry skin, as well as cough with scanty, thin sputum. A white and slightly dry tongue coating and a superficial and wiry pulse are often seen in this syndrome. Internal dryness • In the syndrome of internal dryness due to Qi and Yin deficiency of the Lung, symptoms such as dry nasal cavity, dry cough, scanty sputum and thirst may exist. • When Yin deficiency is accompanied by empty- fire, the fire may push the blood into leaving its pathway, and blood may appear in the sputum. • As soon as the fluid fails to moisten the Lung, the Lung-Qi weakens and patients may feel sad, tired and depressed. If there is heat in the Lung at the same time, patients may have mood swings and feel anxious. • When the Kidney-Yin is consumed severely, night sweats, dry and sore throat and hot palms and soles appear. In this syndrome, the tongue body is red, the coating is thin and the pulse is thready and rapid. • The dryness arising in the Stomach and Large Intestine can be very severe and because they are Yang Ming organs, they are filled up with heat, the Yin and fluid are easily injured and acid regurgitation and constipation may occur. • Hemorrhoids are often caused by dryness in the intestines, heat in the blood and stagnation of blood. In this syndrome, the tongue is red, the coating is very dry and yellow, and the pulse is thready and rapid. They indicate dryness and heat in the body. (See Figure 17.1 on page 358 and Figure 17.2 on page 359.) Treatment principles • For treating warm-dryness syndrome: Slightly disperse the dryness, gently clear and moisten the Lung. • For treating cold-dryness syndrome: Disperse cold-dryness, regulate the Lung-Qi and transform the phlegm. • For treating internal dryness syndrome: Nourish the Yin and fluids of the Lung, Kidney, Stomach and Large Intestine.


1. Caution for using sweet herbs in an external syndrome: Sweet and cold herbs with a sticky and cloying nature should not be used in the syndrome of external dryness as they may hold onto the pathogenic factors. 2. Consider the condition of the Spleen: patients with Spleen-Qi and Spleen-Yang deficiency should not use herbs that are cold and sweet as they may place an extra burden on the Stomach. 350


3. Caution in syndromes of phlegm and dampness accumulation: patients who suffer from phlegm and dampness accumulation should not use formulas that mostly contain sweet and cold herbs, or must be used with caution as these herbs may increase formation of phlegm and dampness. 4. avoid foods that may generate dryness: patients who suffer from the syndrome of dryness should avoid spicy food and food that induces heat, such as hot pepper, onion, cinnamon and deep-fried food. Very sour food, such as citrus fruits and vinegar, should not be consumed in excess as they may make the fluid distribution slow or even stop. 5. avoid overstimulating the Qi: In composing formulas, the use of herbs that are very pungent and aromatic, and have a drying nature to promote the Qi movement should be avoided as they may consume the Yin. Although dryness should influence many organs, in the following sections, two syndromes are particu- larly discussed: the syndrome of dryness in the Lung, which links with climate, and the syndrome of dryness in the Stomach and Large Intestine, which links with physiological and pathological fea- tures of the Yang Ming organs and dietary habit. The dryness of internal organs can be also consulted in the sections on syndromes of Yin deficiency and syndromes of blood deficiency in Chapter 5.

## in the Lung

to nourish the Lung-Yin, generate the body fluids and clear Lung-heat. • Along with these, herbs that regulate the Lung-Qi, stop cough and moisten the Lung are often used. • Herbs that tonify the Lung-Qi in order to stimulate the generation and spreading of the Yin and fluids should be selected in the condition of Qi deficiency. • Herbs that nourish the Kidney-Yin can be added in a chronic condition of Lung-Yin deficiency. Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Directly treat the main pathological change Sang Ye (Mori folium), Bo He (Menthae herba) and Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus) These herbs are aromatic, light and cold, and enter the Upper-Jiao. Sang Ye and Bo He enter the Lung meridian and Lian Qiao enters the Heart meridian. Their aromatic smell can disperse the constrained Qi and heat in the Lung and their cold nature can reduce the heat and protect the Yin. They are often selected as chief in the formulas to treat the syn- drome of warm-dryness. Zi Su Ye (perillae folium) and Dan Dou Chi (Sojae semen praeparatum) These two herbs are pungent and warm, and enter the Lung meridian. They can gently and effectively disperse the cold-dryness from the superficial region and stimulate the Lung-Qi, thus accelerating the distribution of the Qi and fluid in the body. They are often used as chief in the formula to treat cold- dryness syndrome. Bei Sha Shen (Glehniae radix), Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix), Tian Men Dong (asparagi radix) and Bai He (Lilii bulbus) These herbs are sweet and cold, and enter the Lung meridian. They can nourish the Yin of the Lung and moisten the dryness. They are often used as chief in the formula to treat dryness caused by inter- nal heat. Bei Sha Shen, Mai Men Dong and Bai He not only nourish the Yin, but also gently tonify the Qi. 351 Syndrome of dryness and formula compositionChapter They are suitable for use in syndromes where the Qi and Yin are both weak. In addition, as Mai Men Dong and Bai He also enter the Heart meridian, they can be used when dry-heat injures the Yin of the Lung and Heart, causing anxiousness, restless- ness and insomnia in the latter. Tian Meng Dong is the coldest herb in this group and can effectively reduce heat. Since it also enters the Kidney meridian, it is often used in conditions when the Lung-Yin and the Kidney-Yin are both injured, particularly in chronic and severe syndromes of Lung-Yin deficiency. Deputy: Regulate Lung-Qi, stop cough, eliminate phlegm and moisten the Lung Xing Ren (armeniacae semen), Chuan Bei Mu (Fritillariae cirrhosae bulbus) and Pi Pa Ye (eriobotryae folium) Xing Ren, Chuan Bei Mu and Pi Pa Ye enter the Lung meridian. They are all able to remove phlegm and stop cough. Since they are moistening in nature, they eliminate phlegm without the likelihood of injuring the fluid of the Lung. They are the appropriate choice in the formula to treat dryness in the Lung in both internal and external syndromes. Sang Ye (Mori folium) and Xing Ren (armeniacae semen) Sang Ye is sweet, bitter and cold, can gently disperse the Lung-Qi, disperse and clear the heat, and moisten the dryness of the Lung. Xing Ren is pungent, bitter and warm but moist in nature. It can disperse and descend the Lung-Qi and eliminate phlegm without the likelihood of injuring the fluid. These two herbs can be selected to gently disperse the Lung-Qi and expel the cold-dryness without leading to a drying side effect. Xing Ren (armeniacae semen) and Qian Hu (peucedani radix) Xing Ren and Qian Hu are pungent and bitter, and enter the Lung meridian. Xing Ren is warm and can disperse the Lung-Qi; Qian Hu is cold and can descend the Lung-Qi. They can eliminate phlegm and stop cough without the side effect of drying. They can be selected as deputies in a formula to regulate the Lung-Qi and relieve cough in an acute syndrome of external dryness. Hei Zhi Ma (Sesami semen nigricum), Li (pyri fructus), Li Pi (pyri pericarpium) and milk Hei Zhi Ma is sweet and neutral, and enters the Kidney and Liver meridians. It can tonify the Kidney essence and Liver-blood. It can be selected as deputy in the formula to treat chronic or severe Lung-Yin and Kidney-Yin deficiency. Pear and its peel can moisten the Lung in a gentle but effective way. They are often used in the syndrome of Yin and fluid deficiency of the Lung. Since they are food products, they are often recommended in the diet. Assistant: Clear the heat from the Lung and generate body fluids Tian Hua Fen (trichosanthis radix), Lu Gen (phragmitis rhizoma) and Yu Zhu (polygonati odorati rhizoma) These herbs are often used in formulas to treat the syndrome of warm-dryness. Tian Hua Fen is sweet, bitter, sour and cold, and enters the Lung meridian. It can clear the heat and remove toxin in the Lung. It can also generate fluid of the Lung. Since it has no sticky and cloying nature, it is often used at the late stage of febrile disease where the pathogenic heat is not completely eliminated from the body and the fluid of the Lung is injured. Lu Gen is sweet and cold, can clear heat and generate fluid of the Lung; it can also transform phlegm and pus. It can be used to treat thirst, dryness of the nasal cavities, mouth and throat when there is dry-heat in the Lung, and cough with green phlegm when phlegm-heat also accumulates in the Lung. Yu Zhu is sweet and neutral, and enters the Lung meridian. This herb can gently nourish the Yin and moisten the Lung. It is often used in a chronic, mild syndrome of dryness. Shi Gao (Gypsum) Shi Gao is sweet, pungent and cold, and enters the Lung meridian. It can intensively reduce the heat and protect the fluid of the Lung. It can be used in syndromes caused by both external and internal dryness. However, it is only used in these syndromes when the heat is strong and the Qi fails to descend. In these conditions, patients suffer from obvious shortness of breath, have a red tongue and a forceful and rapid pulse. 352


Zhi Mu (anemarrhenae rhizoma) and Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix) These are two cold herbs. Zhi Mu is bitter and cold, but is moist in nature. It enters the Lung and Kidney meridians, can strongly reduce heat and protects the Yin. Sheng Di Huang enters the Heart, Liver and Kidney meridians. It can nourish the Yin, clear heat and cool the blood. Since they are both strong in action and enter the Kidney meridian, they can be used in the syndrome of internal dryness when the Yin is severely injured with excess heat and empty- heat in the Lung and Kidney. Examples of classical formulas Xing Su San (Apricot Kernel and Perilla Leaf Powder) Source: Wen Bing Tiao Bian sweating and relieve the cold-dryness from the exterior. The pungent and bitter Qian Hu can descend the Lung-Qi, expel wind and remove phlegm in the Lung. • Jie Geng and Xing Ren serve as deputies and regulate the Lung-Qi. Jie Geng moves upwards and can disperse the Lung-Qi; Xing Ren moves downwards and can descend the Lung-Qi. They can also eliminate phlegm and stop cough. • Ban Xia and Fu Ling are used to dry dampness and transform phlegm; Chen Pi and Zhi Ke regulate the Qi in the Upper-Jiao. They are all used as assistants. • Sheng Jiang, Da Zao and Gan Cao serve as assistants as well as envoys in the formula. They strengthen and harmonize the Nutritive-Yin and Defensive-Qi, and harmonize the functions of the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, the methods of releasing the exterior, regulating the Lung-Qi and transforming phlegm are applied in order to treat the different aspects of the syndrome. • The selected herbs are light in nature and weight, but are active and sufficient to treat the syndrome. It shows a subtle way to spread and regulate the Qi and fluid without the likelihood of injuring this fragile organ.

It is used for treating exogenous pathogenic cold-dryness that invades the superficial region of the body and the Lung. It disturbs dispersing and descending of the Lung-Qi and fluid, leading to phlegm accumulation. The manifestations are slight headache, chills, aver- sion to wind and cold, cough with thin sputum, nasal obstruction and dry nasal cavities. The tongue coating is white and slightly dry, and the pulse is superficial and wiry. In this formula: • Zi Su Ye and Qian Hu are used as chief. The pungent and warm Zi Su Ye can slightly induce Sang Ye (Mori folium) 3 g Xing Ren (Armeniacae semen) 4.5 g Dan Dou Chi (Sojae semen praeparatum) 3 g Bei Sha Shen (Glehniae radix) 6 g Chuan Bei Mu (Fritillariae cirrhosae bulbus) 3 g Li Pi (Pyri pericarpium) 3 g Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) 3 g Analysis of the formula This formula gently disperses dryness and clears and moistens the Lung. It is a formula to treat the 353 Syndrome of dryness and formula compositionChapter syndrome of warm-dryness. When exogenous path- ogenic warm-dryness injures the Lung-Qi and fluid, symptoms such as dry throat and thirst, and dry cough without phlegm or with a small amount of scanty, thick phlegm arise. When the superficial region is blocked by dryness, fever and headache may occur. A red tongue indicates the existence of heat; a thin, dry and white coating indicates the existence of dryness; a floating pulse on the Lung position suggests that the Lung is disturbed. In this formula: • Sang Ye and Dan Dou Chi are used as chief. Sang Ye is sweet, bitter and cold, and can gently disperse the heat in the Lung. Dan Dou Chi, which is processed by Bo He and Qing Hao, is pungent and cold, and can also disperse the heat in the Lung. • The deputy is Xing Ren, which can regulate the Lung-Qi as it can disperse and descend the Lung-Qi. Since it is a seed, it can also moisten the Lung. • Bei Sha Shen, Chuan Bei Mu and Li Pi serve as assistants. Bei Sha Shen can moisten the Lung and generate the fluid; Chuan Bei Mu and Li Pi can moisten the Lung, stop cough and remove phlegm. • Zhi Zi, another assistant, can clear the heat in the Upper-Jiao. Commentary on strategies • The characteristic of the composition of this formula is to put herbs with pungent, cold and moistening properties together to disperse and clear the Lung-heat on the one hand, and to protect and generate the fluid so as to treat the warm-dryness on the other hand. • The dosages of the herbs in the formula are very small, indicating the principle of treating disorders of the Lung. Qing Zao Jiu Fei Tang (Eliminate Dryness and Rescue the Lungs Decoction) Source: Yi Men Fa Lü Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) 3.6 g E Jiao (Asini corii colla) 2.4 g Hei Zhi Ma (Sesami semen nigricum) 3 g Xing Ren (Armeniacae semen) 2 g Mi Zhi Pi Pa Ye (honey-fried Eriobotryae folium) 3 g Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 2 g Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) 3 g Analysis of the formula This formula clears the warm-dryness and moistens the Lung. It is used for a syndrome where the warm- dryness injures the Lung and weakens the Lung-Qi and Lung-Yin. The symptoms are headache, fever, thirst, dry cough without phlegm, and dry throat and nasal cavities. When the Qi is disturbed in the Lung, fullness in the chest and irritability may occur. A dry tongue body without coating indicates a severe defi- ciency of Yin and fluid. A weak, thready and rapid pulse indicates that the Qi and Yin are both injured and that the pathogenic warm-dryness still exists. In this formula: • Sang Ye, which is bitter, cold and sweet, is used as chief. It gently and effectively disperses the Lung-Qi, moistens the dryness and clears heat in the Lung. • A small amount of Shi Gao is used as deputy to enhance the ability of Sang Ye to clear heat and relieve dryness in the Lung. • The sweet and cold Mai Men Dong is also used as deputy to nourish the Yin and fluid and reduce the heat. • The assistants are divided into two groups. E Jiao, Hei Zhi Ma, Xin Ren and Pi Pa Ye are in the first group. The first two herbs can tonify the blood and essence, and moisten the Lung; the last two can clear heat and descend the Lung-Qi. Ren Shen and Gan Cao form the second group. They can tonify the Qi and are used to treat Qi deficiency caused by heat and dryness. Commentary on strategies • The composition of this formula is characterized by selecting sweet, bitter, cold and moistening herbs and by avoiding the common (but inappropriate) methods, namely, using pungent or aromatic herbs to disperse the Lung-Qi; using bitter and cold herbs to clear Lung-heat. Sang Ye (Mori folium) 9 g Shi Gao (Gypsum) 7.5 g 354


• Moreover, the dosage of Shi Gao is a good example of the strategy to treat dryness. Unlike the usual method of prescribing a large dosage to treat an excess heat syndrome of the Lung, in this formula a small amount of Shi Gao is used. In this way, the dispersing nature is obviously predominant and it enhances the function of Sang Ye. Also in this way, it avoids the likelihood of injuring a weak Stomach and the weakened Qi in the Middle-Jiao. Yang Yin Qing Fei Tang (Nourish the Yin and Clear the Lungs Decoction) Source: Chong Lou Yu Yao hardness and reduces swelling of the throat. Mu Dan Pi can cool the blood, dissipate the constrained fire and therefore reduce fire-toxin. • Bai Shao Yao, Chuan Bei Mu and Bo He serve as assistants. Bai Shao Yao can stabilize the Yin and reduce heat. It also softens the Liver and prevents the Liver insulting the Lung when the Lung is in a weak condition. Chuan Bei Mu can moisten the Lung, stop cough, and remove and dissipate phlegm. It enhances the function of Xuan Shen to reduce the swelling of the throat. Bo He can disperse the heat from the Lung and benefit the throat. • The envoy is Gan Cao, which is sweet and moist, can drain the fire and remove fire-toxin. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, sweet, cold and moistening herbs are used together to nourish the Yin of the Lung and Kidney; the herbs that remove fire-toxin and the herbs that dissipate hardness and swelling are used together against the epidemic heat-toxin. • Since an exogenous pathogenic factor should be eliminated, a small amount of Bo He is used for this purpose.

The manifestations are fever, dry nasal cavities, a dry mouth, irritability, hoarse breathing, swollen and sore throat, and the development of a white, curd-like membrane in the throat that is dif- ficult to scrape off. This syndrome shows a red tongue with a dry, yellow coating and a thready and rapid pulse. In this formula: • Sheng Di Huang and Mai Men Dong are used as chief to directly nourish the Yin and clear heat in the Lung. • Xuan Shen and Mu Dan Pi are used as deputies.

It is used to treat internal dryness caused by deficiency of the Kidney- Yin and the Lung-Yin, and up-flaring of empty-fire. The manifestations and signs are cough with blood- streaked sputum, dry and sore throat, hot sensation in the palms and soles, bone steaming, night sweat- ing, a red tongue without coating and a thready and rapid pulse. In this formula: • Bai He, Sheng Di Huang and Shu Di Huang are used as chief. Bai He moistens the Lung, clears heat in the Heart and calms the mind. Sheng Di Huang can nourish the Yin of the Lung and Kidney, and reduce the heat from these organs. Shu Di Huang nourishes the Yin and essence of the Kidney and Liver in order to control the empty-fire. • Mai Men Dong and Chuan Bei Mu serve as deputies. Mai Men Dong nourishes the Yin of the Lung and Heart, and reduces the fire in the Upper-Jiao. Chuan Bei Mu moistens the dryness of the Lung and stops cough. • There are five assistants: – Xuan Shen is bitter, salty and cold. It can lift the Kidney-water from the Lower-Jiao to the Upper-Jiao to reduce the excess fire of the Heart, descend the heat from the Lung and therefore pacify the Lung. – Dang Gui and Bai Shao Yao form a pair of herbs. They tonify the Liver-Yin and blood, and prevent the Liver attacking the Lung when the Liver-Qi stagnates. Moreover, Dang Gui regulates the blood and moistens the dryness because blood in the sputum is a sign that blood has left its pathway. Bai Shao Yao nourishes the Yin and softens the Liver, thereby benefiting the Yin in the Lung. – Jie Geng can enhance the ability of Chuan Bei Mu to remove phlegm and stop cough. Together with Gan Cao, it dissipates the hardness and benefits the throat. It can also disperse Lung Qi. Commentary on strategies Several strategies are used in this formula. • First of all, not only are there herbs that nourish the Yin and moisten the dryness of the Lung, but also herbs that tonify the Kidney essence and Liver blood. These herbs may make the function of moistening the dryness more stable and sufficient, especially in the severe condition of dryness in the Lung. • Second, herbs that reduce dry-heat, dissipate the sticky phlegm and benefit the throat are used, such as Xuan Shen, Chuan Bei Mu, Jie Geng and Gan Cao. • Moreover, the selection of Xuan Shen, Dang Gui and Bai Shao Yao enriches the treatment strategies by considering the relationship of the Lung, Kidney and Liver in the syndrome.

## Large Intestine

Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Moisten the Stomach and Large Intestine Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix), Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix) and Shi Hu (Dendrobii caulis)** These three herbs are sweet and cold, and enter the Stomach meridian. They can nourish the Yin, gener- ate the fluid, and thus moisten the Stomach and relieve thirst. Moreover, Sheng Di Huang and Shi Hu also enter the Kidney meridian. They can be selected in a severe condition of both Stomach-Yin and Kidney-Yin deficiency. 356


Huo Ma Ren (Cannabis semen), Yu Li Ren (pruni semen), Xing Ren (armeniacae semen), He Shou Wu (polygoni multiflori radix), Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix), Xuan Shen (Scrophulariae radix) and Feng Mi (Mel) These herbs are moist in nature and are particularly used for moistening the dryness of the intestines and treating mild constipation. Huo Ma Ren and Yu Li Ren are seeds and contain oil that can moisten the intestines and relieve the dryness. They are often used together to enhance each other’s function. Xing Ren is the seed of apricot and has a similar function to the first two herbs. However, it also has a dispersing tendency. As it can ascend the Lung-Qi, it can activate Qi movement in the Large Intestine. He Shou Wu and Dang Gui are able to tonify the blood and can moisten the intestines. They are par- ticularly suitable for use in the formula to treat constipation caused by blood deficiency. Since the bitter, salty and cold Xuan Shen can reduce heat and increase the fluid in the intestines, it can soften the feces and treat constipation due to Yin deficiency with heat in the intestine. The sweet and moist Feng Mi can be mixed with cold water and drunk in the morning on an empty stomach. It may stimulate the stomach and intes- tines and promote bowel movement. It is used to treat chronic and mild constipation. Deputy: Clear heat from the Stomach and Large Intestine and generate the body fluids Shi Gao (Gypsum), Zhi Mu (anemarrhenae rhizoma) and Tian Hua Fen (trichosanthis radix) These substances are cold and enter the Stomach meridian. They are able to clear heat and reduce fire there. In addition, they can all increase the fluid of the Stomach and relieve thirst. They are often used as deputies in the formula to treat dryness due to heat in the Stomach. Assistant: Tonify and regulate the Qi, promote digestion, soothe the Stomach- Qi and promote bowel movement Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) and Huang Qi (astragali radix) Ren Shen and Huang Qi are sweet and warm, and enter the Lung and Spleen meridians. They can be selected as assistants in the formula to tonify the Qi in order to generate the Yin. They can also be used in the condition where the Qi and Yin are both deficient. Ge Gen (puerariae radix) Ge Gen is sweet, pungent and slightly cold, and enters the Stomach meridian. It moves upwards, and can ascend and spread the fluid, thus relieving thirst. Zhi Shi (aurantii fructus immaturus) Zhi Shi is bitter and slightly cold, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. This herb is able to promote the Qi movement. As it has a descending tendency, it can promote bowel movement and is often used in the formula for treating constipation. Da Huang (rhei rhizoma) and Mang Xiao (Natrii sulfas) Da Huang and Mang Xiao are purgative herbs. The bitter and cold Da Huang can purge the intestines and the salty and cold Mang Xiao can soften the hard feces and moisten the intestines. They can be used together with herbs that nourish the Yin and moisten the intestines to treat severe constipation. Examples of classical formulas Mai Men Dong Tang (Ophiopogonis Decoction) Source: Jin Kui Yao Lue Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix) 35 g Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 6 g Jing Mi (non-glutinous rice) 5 g Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) 4 pieces Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) 6 g Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) 5 g Analysis of the formula This formula can nourish the Stomach and generate body fluid. It can also direct rebellious Qi in the Stomach downwards. It treats the syndrome where the Qi and Yin of the Stomach and the Lung are deficient, and the empty-fire of these organs flares up. When the Lung and Stomach lose nourishment from the Yin and fluid, cough, spitting of saliva and 357 Syndrome of dryness and formula compositionChapter dry mouth exist. When the Qi is weak in the Lung, wheezing and shortness of breath may occur. When the Stomach-Qi is weak, the empty-fire flares up and the Stomach fails to descend the Qi, a dry and uncomfortable sensation in the throat may emerge. In this case, the tongue is red with a thin coating and the pulse is thready and rapid. In this formula: • Mai Men Dong is used in a very large dosage as chief. It is sweet and slightly cold, can nourish the Yin and moisten dryness of the Lung, Heart and Stomach. It can also slightly tonify the Qi of these organs. • Ren Shen is the deputy. It can strongly tonify the Qi of these organs, accelerate the Yin generation and therefore enhance the ability of Mai Men Dong. • The assistants are Ban Xia, Jing Mi, Gan Cao and Da Zao. They tonify the Qi of the Middle- Jiao and enhance the ability of Ren Shen. Da Zao and Gan Cao are sweet herbs and may enhance the ability of Mai Men Dong to generate Stomach-Yin. Ban Xia can direct the Stomach-Qi downwards. When the herbs are used together, the Yin and Qi become strong. As the Qi is then able to descend again, all the symptoms disappear. Commentary on strategies • In this formula, besides the method of directly tonifying the Yin of the Stomach, an indirect way of tonifying the Yin is also used too, namely, tonifying the Qi in order to generate Yin. • In addition, a procedure of strengthening the Middle-Jiao so as to harmonize the Qi in the Middle- and Upper-Jiao is also applied. Yu Ye Tang (Jade Fluid Decoction) Source: Yi Xue Zhong Zhong Can Xi Lu Shan Yao (Dioscoreae rhizoma) 30 g Huang Qi (Astragali radix) 15 g Zhi Mu (Anemarrhenae rhizoma) 18 g Tian Hua Fen (Trichosanthis radix) 9 g Ge Gen (Puerariae radix) 4.5 g Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae fructus) 9 g Ji Nei Jin (Gigeriae galli endothelium corneum) 6 g Analysis of the formula This formula can tonify Qi, generate body fluid, moisten dryness and relieve thirst. It treats ‘thirst and wasting’ syndrome, a syndrome known as dia- betes in western medicine. It is caused by Yin defi- ciency of the Kidney, Stomach and Lung. When dryness occurs in the Stomach, the Qi is too weak to spread the fluid, and excessive thirst appears. Heat consumes the Qi and can directly lead to las- situde and shortness of breath. If the Kidney fails to control the Bladder and is unable to separate clean fluid from turbid, patients may pass large amounts of turbid urine frequently. Yin and Qi deficiency often show in a red tongue with a thin and dry coating, and a weak and thready pulse. In this formula: • Shan Yao is chief and is used in a large dosage. It is sweet, neutral and astringent, and enters the Spleen, Lung and Kidney meridians. It can tonify and stabilize the Qi and Yin of the Spleen and Kidney, and reduce frequent urination. • Huang Qi, another chief herb, tonifies and ascends the Spleen-Qi, accelerates the fluid spreading to the Stomach and Lung, and therefore relieves thirst. • Zhi Mu and Tian Hua Fen are used as deputies. They can nourish the Yin, reduce heat and moisten dryness, thus also relieving thirst. • There are three assistants: Ji Nei Jin aids digestion in order to strengthen the Spleen; Ge Gen moves upwards, can ascend and spread the fluid, and enhance the ability of Huang Qi; Wu Wei Zi has a sour taste, can stabilize the Qi and Yin, and enhance the ability of Shan Yao, Zhi Mu and Tian Hua Fen. Commentary on strategies • This formula shows the principle of treating diabetes, which includes tonifying and stabilizing the Qi and Yin of the Kidney, Spleen and Lung. • It also shows the strategies of treating diabetes by using herbs that move inwards and upwards. They demonstrate the methods of tonifying, stabilizing, ascending and spreading Qi and Yin. 358


Zeng Ye Cheng Qi Tang (Increase the Fluids and Order the Qi Decoction) Source: Wen Bing Tiao Bian movement. It is used for treating constipation where the fluid is dried up by the excess heat in the intes- tines. In this syndrome, if only purgatives are used, the Yin may be injured further and the constipation may get worse. This formula demonstrates the strat- egy that purgatives can be used without the side effect of injuring the fluid in the intestines. In this formula, two groups of herbs are selected. • In the first group, a large doze of salty and cold Xuan Shen is used. It can increase the fluid in the intestines, clear heat and soften the feces. The large doses of Mai Men Dong and Sheng Di Huang are used to directly nourish the Yin and clear the heat. • In the second group, Da Huang and Mang Xiao are used to stimulate the intestines and soften the stool respectively. They are used to treat constipation directly. This formula is particularly useful for habitual constipation when there is Yin deficiency with heat in the intestines.

## and formula composition


Although, broadly speaking, all disorders can be con- sidered as reflecting disharmonies of Yin and Yang in the body, some of the syndromes in this chapter are so distinct that they cannot really be classified in any of the other chapters. The composition of these formulas is based on two groups of herbs, each of which partly fulfills the role of chief in the formula, even though the two groups have very dif- ferent properties and functions. Formulas that harmonize are mainly used to treat disharmony between internal organs, dishar- mony between Qi and blood, and syndromes characterized by the coexistence of heat and cold, or by the coexistence of deficiency and excess. By adopting the approach of harmonizing the involved aspects, further pathological development can be prevented. Some of the syndromes and classical formulas presented here have already been intro- duced in other chapters, but it will become appar- ent that the treatment methods and strategies adopted in these formulas can be viewed from other perspectives and inspire the creation of new formulas.

## Large Intestine)

Associated disorders in western medicine Acute and chronic gastroenteritis, hyperchlorhydria, prolapsed stomach, dilatation of the stomach, peptic and duodenal ulcers, stress-related belching and vomiting, irritable bowel syndrome, allergies, hepa- titis, cholecystitis, and the side effects of some medicines. Analysis of the syndrome This syndrome is generally referred to as dishar- mony between the Liver and Spleen. In fact, it can be divided into several sub-syndromes besides disharmony between the Liver and Spleen, such as disharmony between the Liver and Stomach, and disharmony between the Liver and Large Intestine. Since the Stomach and Large Intestine are directly linked to the transportation function of the Spleen, and both belong to Earth in the Five-Element theory, the Liver often attacks these organs if it overacts on the Spleen. Hence they are often considered and discussed as one syndrome under the name of disharmony between the Liver and Spleen. The Liver is an important organ in human physi- ology. The free flow of Liver-Qi drives the functions of the internal organs. One of these is the Spleen’s function of transportation and transformation. The proper flow of Liver-Qi depends on an adequate supply of Liver-blood, which is generated from the food essence and is transformed by the Spleen. These physiological features mean that there is a special relationship between the Liver and the Spleen. In pathological conditions, any of these three factors (Liver-Qi stagnation, Liver-blood defi- ciency or Spleen-Qi deficiency) can impact on, or be influenced by, the other two. This may lead to disharmony between the organs and cause the fol- lowing manifestations: • If Liver-Qi stagnation is the causative factor, there is obvious hypochondriac pain and distension, and fullness in the chest, stomach and abdomen arises because the Liver and Gall Bladder meridians spread through the hypochondriac region, and the Qi of these organs moves through the pathways of the San Jiao. • When Liver-Qi is stagnant, patients get angry easily, and are prone to irritability, depression and frustration. They tend to have dream- Main symptoms Hypochondriac pain and distension, fullness in the chest, stomach and abdomen, irritability, depression and frustration, dream-disturbed sleep, irregular menstruation, a bitter taste in the mouth, dry mouth and throat, headache, vertigo, fatigue, reduced appetite, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, cold hands and fullness in the chest when subject to strong emotional disturbance. Tongue Pale or pink, with a thin white coating. Pulse Wiry and deficient. 363 Syndrome of disharmony and formula compositionChapter disturbed sleep, and female patients may have irregular menstruation. Furthermore, the Liver-Qi can easily generate heat if it stagnates, even if only for a very short time. • Liver-fire gives rise to a bitter taste in the mouth and dry mouth and throat. In most cases, the stagnation of Liver-Qi has a clear causative factor, usually stress. • If there is obvious Liver-Qi stagnation but the cause is unclear, it is most likely caused by Liver-blood deficiency. In that situation, the Liver-blood is too weak to nourish the Liver, so the Qi moves slowly and tends to become stagnant. The syndrome of Liver-blood deficiency manifests as dizziness, vertigo, headache, migraine, tiredness, pale complexion, brittle nails and hair, irregular menstruation, irritability and mood swings. • In the case of Spleen-Qi deficiency, the Qi is unable to ascend properly to the head, and patients often have chronic headaches, vertigo, fatigue and poor appetite. • As soon as the Spleen becomes weak, it becomes vulnerable to attack from the Liver. When the Liver-Qi overacts on the Spleen, the Qi is blocked in the Middle-Jiao. The Stomach-Qi cannot descend, thus fullness in the stomach, nausea and vomiting may occur; the Spleen-Qi is unable to ascend, thus giving rise to diarrhea. • When there is strong emotional disturbance, the Qi is obstructed in the chest, so it cannot spread and is unable to reach the extremities, resulting in cold hands and fullness of the chest. • Liver-Qi stagnation does not manifest in a distinct tongue sign; however, if heat is generated, a red border can be observed on the tongue. • If Liver-Qi overacts on the Spleen and Stomach, a thick coating can be found on the tongue, showing that the digestion is impaired. • When blood is deficient, the tongue is pale or a delicate pink color. If there is Spleen-Qi deficiency, the tongue is pale with teeth marks. • The typical Liver-Qi stagnation pulse is wiry. If there is also blood deficiency, a thready pulse can be felt. If there is obvious Qi deficiency, the pulse can be weak, particularly in the Spleen position. (See Figures 18.1 and 18.2 on page 378.) Treatment principle: Harmonize the Liver and Spleen; regulate the Qi Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief and Deputy: Harmonize the Liver and Spleen; regulate the Qi in the Middle-Jiao


Since each of the three factors – Liver-Qi stagnation, Liver blood deficiency and Spleen-Qi deficiency – can be a causative factor as well as a consequence of the others, the chief is used to treat the direct cause and the deputies treat the developed conditions and the consequences. thus, the chief and the deputies can be selected from the following three groups of herbs. Xiang Fu (Cyperi rhizoma), Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix), Qing Pi (Citri reticulatae viride pericarpium) and Mu Xiang (aucklandiae radix)** These herbs are often selected to spread the Liver-Qi. 364


Xiang Fu is a very commonly used herb to regu- late the Liver-Qi. It is pungent, sweet, slightly bitter and warm, and enters the Liver and San Jiao merid- ians. Xiang Fu is an effective and gentle herb to regulate Qi. It is warm and pungent without a harsh and drying nature. It promotes the Liver-Qi move- ment without the side effect of injuring the Yin and blood of the Liver. It is slightly bitter, thus can reduce the slight Liver-heat that is generated by Liver-Qi stagnation. The sweetness can soften the Liver and moderate the speed of the Qi movement. All these characteristics match the pathological changes in the syndrome of Liver-Qi stagnation. Because it enters the San Jiao meridian that is the passage of the Qi and water, it can effectively spread the Qi in the entire body. Since Xiang Fu is gentle and can effectively regulate the Liver-Qi, it is often selected in formulas for treating both excess and deficiency syndromes that are associated with Liver- Qi stagnation. Chai Hu is another commonly used herb to reg- ulate the Liver-Qi and is also a gentle herb. Unlike Xiang Fu, it has the function of dispersing and ascending the Liver-Qi rather than promoting its circulation. It is particularly suitable for use as chief in formulas to spread constrained Liver-Qi that is directly caused by stress, depression and frustration. Since the tendency of its action is upwards, it should be used with caution in syndromes of ascending of Qi, fire or Yang of the Liver. Qing Pi is warm and bitter, and enters the Liver, Gall Bladder and Spleen meridians. It can break up the Qi stagnation and effectively promote the free flow of Liver-Qi and alleviate pain. It is often selected in a formula to treat distending pain in the chest, breasts and hypochondriac region. Because its action is strong, it may injure the Qi and Yin, and therefore it is used only for a short period of time and mainly in excess conditions. Mu Xiang is pungent, bitter, warm and aromatic, and enters the Gall Bladder, Spleen and Large Intestine meridians. It can strongly and quickly activate Qi movement, and can especially regulate Qi of the Liver and Large Intestine and alleviate pain. It also strengthens the Spleen and promotes the digestion. It is especially effective in treating disorders where the Liver-Qi overacts on the Spleen, causing stomachache, abdominal pain and distension, diarrhea, poor appetite and poor diges- tion. As this herb is quite warm and pungent, and is strong in action, its dosage should be controlled carefully. Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix) and Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) These two herbs are often used to tonify the blood. Dang Gui is sweet, pungent and warm, and enters the Heart, Liver and Spleen meridians. It can tonify the blood, warm the blood and promote the blood circulation. Bai Shao Yao is bitter, sour and cold, and enters the Liver and Spleen meridians. It nour- ishes the Liver-Yin, tonifies the blood and stabilizes the blood circulation. Since Bai Shao Yao is able to soften the Liver and relax the tendons, it can reduce the aggression of the Liver. These two herbs tonify the Yang and Yin aspects of the blood and are there- fore very often used together as one unit to nourish the blood, soften the Liver and keep the Liver-Qi moving steadily. Ren Shen (Ginseng radix), Bai Zhu (atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) and Fu Ling (poria) These herbs are often selected to strengthen the Spleen. Ren Shen and Bai Zhu are sweet and warm, and Fu Ling is sweet, neutral and bland. They all enter the Spleen meridian. They can directly tonify the Spleen and are selected as chief in the formula when the disharmony is caused directly by chronic Spleen deficiency. Moreover, they can also be used as dep- uties as they generate the Qi and blood, and can maintain the proper function of the Liver. In addi- tion, they strengthen the Spleen in order to stimu- late its resistance at the same time that the Liver-Qi is attacking the Spleen. Assistant: Regulate the Liver-Qi, strengthen the Spleen, clear heat and remove phlegm in the Middle-Jiao Xiang Yuan (Citri fructus), Fo Shou (Citri sarcodactylis fructus) and Mei Gui Hua (rosae flos) These three herbs are often used in formulas to treat the syndrome of disharmony between the Liver and Stomach. Xiang Yuan and Fo Shou enter the Liver, Spleen and Stomach meridians. They are bitter, sour and slightly warm. Both are very effective in pro- moting the Liver-Qi movement and treating hypo- chondriac pain, distension and depression. Moreover, they are particularly effective in the condition where the stagnant Liver-Qi disturbs the Stomach and leads to distension in the gastric and hypochondriac 365 Syndrome of disharmony and formula compositionChapter regions. They can soothe the Stomach-Qi so as to improve appetite and stop vomiting and belching. Mei Gui Hua has the function of harmonizing the Qi in the Liver and Stomach, and treats the syndrome of Liver-Qi attacking the Spleen and Stomach. As well as having functions similar to those of Xiang Yuan and Fo Shou, this herb can also promote the blood circulation and is an appro- priate herb to treat disorders due to Qi and blood stagnation, such as irregular menstruation and dysmenorrhea. Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) and Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet and warm, and primarily enters the Spleen meridian. It can both tonify and moderate the movement of the Qi. It is often used with herbs that nourish the Yin such as Bai Shao Yao to strongly soften the Liver and relax the tendons. It is often used to protect the Stomach in the condi- tion of Liver attacking the Stomach. Bai Shao Yao is the most commonly used herb to soften the Liver. It is sour, bitter and slightly cold. It is able to nourish the Yin and blood of the Liver, and its cold and bitter nature can reduce heat, which is caused by deficiency of blood and stagnation of the Liver-Qi. It is often used in a formula to treat Liver-Qi stagnation, which is caused by Yin and blood deficiency. Besides the common symptoms of Qi stagnation, a thready and wiry pulse is the indica- tion for using this herb in the formula. Moreover, Bai Shao Yao is also often used as corrective assist- ant. In the treatment, since the herbs that stimulate Qi may injure the blood and cause further stagnation of the Qi, it is necessary to nourish the blood in order to spread the Liver-Qi. Jing Jie (Schizonepetae herba) and Bo He (Menthae herba) Jing Jie and Bo He have a pungent taste, and enter the Liver meridian. They possess a light and subtle dispersing ability and can disperse the constrained Liver-Qi. They are selected as assistants in formulas to enhance the function of the chief in spreading the Liver-Qi and treating excess and deficiency condi- tions where Liver-Qi stagnation is involved. Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix), Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) and Zhi Shi (aurantii fructus immaturus) These three herbs all enter the Spleen meridian. They can regulate the Spleen-Qi and Stomach-Qi. They are often selected as assistants in formulas to treat disharmony between the Liver and Spleen. Fang Feng enters the Liver and Spleen meridians, can effectively disperse Qi stagnation and relieve cramp and distension when the Liver attacks the Spleen. Since it ascends and spreads the Spleen-Qi, it can treat borborygmi and diarrhea. Chen Pi can promote Qi movement in the Stomach, reduce the sensation of fullness in the Stomach and improve appetite. Zhi Shi can descend the Qi in the intes- tines and reduce pain and distension in the abdomen. Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) and Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex) When stagnant Liver-Qi generates heat and the heat disturbs the blood, these two herbs can be used in the formula. Zhi Zi is cold and enters the San Jiao meridian. It can drain the excess heat from the Liver and the San Jiao passage, and leach out the heat by promot- ing urination. Mu Dan Pi is cold in nature and enters the blood level of the Liver meridian. It can cool the blood, promote the blood circulation and thus mod- erate the Qi movement. Its pungent taste can also disperse the stagnation of blood. Qing Hao (artemisiae annuae herba) and Zhu Ru (Bambusae caulis in taeniam) These two herbs are cold in nature and can be used in formulas in conditions where damp-heat or phlegm-heat is generated in the Middle-Jiao. Qing Hao is aromatic and enters the Liver and Gall Bladder meridians. It can disperse dampness and heat, spread Liver-Qi and is often used in damp-heat obstruction in the Liver and Gall Bladder. The manifestations are chills, fever, reduced appet- ite, nausea, and a sticky and bitter taste in the mouth. Zhu Ru enters the Stomach and Gall Bladder meridians. It can soothe the Stomach-Qi and elimi- nate phlegm-heat. It treats nausea, vomiting, full- ness in the Stomach and irritability. Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) and Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) Sheng Jiang is pungent and slightly warm, and enters the Stomach and Spleen meridians. It can soothe the Stomach-Qi, subtly disperse accumulation of dampness, fluid and phlegm in the Stomach, and can therefore promote digestion. Da Zao is sweet and warm, and can tonify the Qi and blood. These two herbs are often selected as assistants in the formula 366


as a pair of herbs to gently strengthen the function of the Spleen and Stomach. Examples of classical formulas Xiao Yao San (Rambling Powder) Source: Tai Pi Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang circulation and boost the function of the Spleen. This strategy is represented by the selection of Chai Hu and is enhanced by Bo He. • The second group serves to tonify the Liver- blood and therefore to soften the Liver and promote its Qi movement; it is represented by Dang Gui and Bai Shao Yao. • The third group is selected to tonify the Spleen-Qi so as to produce enough blood to support the function of the Liver. This strategy is carried out by using Bai Zhu and Fu Ling and is further enhanced by Sheng Jiang and Zhi Gan Cao. With regard to the structure of this formula, Liver- Qi stagnation predominates and Chai Hu is used as the chief herb. If blood deficiency is obvious and is the cause of the Liver-Qi stagnation, Dang Gui and Bai Shao should be used as chief herbs. When the Spleen-Qi has been very weak for a long period of time, and has led to blood deficiency and Liver-Qi stagnation, herbs that tonify the Spleen should be used as chief herbs. Commentary on strategies This formula is characterized by harmonizing the functions of the Liver and Spleen through the understanding of the relationship between the Qi and blood, the material aspect and the functioning aspect of the Liver, and the relationship of the Liver and Spleen. It is a gentle and well-organized formula. It is not only a good example for study, but also a good formula that can be used for a long period of time.

The manifesta- tions are hypochondriac pain, headache, vertigo, a bitter taste in the mouth, dry mouth and throat, fatigue and reduced appetite. In some cases, there may be alternating fever and chills, irregular men- struation, or breast distension and pain. The tongue color is often pale or pink with a thin white coating and the pulse is wiry and deficient. In this syndrome, each of the three factors (Liver- Qi stagnation, Liver-blood deficiency and Spleen-Qi deficiency) can influence, or be influenced by, the other two. This may lead to disharmony between the functions of the Liver and Spleen and cause related manifestations. In this formula, there are three groups of herbs that treat the pathological changes from the three factors involved. • The first group is used to directly spread the Liver-Qi which can then further promote blood Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) 6–9 g Zhi Shi (Aurantii fructus immaturus) 9–12 g Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) 12–24 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 6–9 g 367 Syndrome of disharmony and formula compositionChapter Analysis of the formula This formula can spread constrained Liver-Qi, soften the Liver and regulate the function of the Spleen. It is used for treating an acute excess condition where the Liver-Qi is stagnant and overacts on the Spleen. When strong emotions disturb the Qi movement, the Liver-Qi is obstructed and unable to spread throughout the entire body, especially to the extremities. This leads to cold fingers and toes, stiff and painful muscles, irritability and fullness in the chest. When Liver-Qi is severely stagnant, it can overact on the Spleen and Stomach, causing fullness and pain in the epigastrium and abdomen, and even severe diarrhea. In this syndrome, patients often show a red tongue with a yellow coating, and have a wiry pulse. In this formula: • Chai Hu is used as chief to spread the Liver-Qi directly. • Bai Shao Yao is used as deputy. Since it can nourish the Liver-Yin and blood, soften the Liver and relax the tendons, it can reduce the aggression of the Liver. In addition, it can also stabilize the Spleen-Qi and bind up the intestines, thereby reducing the abdominal pain and diarrhea. When Chai Hu and Bai Shao Yao are used together, they can effectively regulate the Qi of the Liver. • Zhi Shi serves as assistant. It descends the Qi in the intestines and reduces the distension and pain. When the ascending Chai Hu and the descending Zhi Shi are used together, they can properly regulate the Liver-Qi and the Qi in the intestines. • Zhi Gan Gao also serves as assistant. On the one hand, it can enhance the function of Bai Shao Yao to soften the Liver and reduce the abdominal pain; on the other hand, it can strengthen and protect the Spleen, which is suppressed by the Liver, in order to restore the balance between these two organs. Commentary on strategies Although there are only four herbs in the formula, the interrelationships that result from their combi- nation enable the formula to reduce the Liver, strengthen the Spleen, open the Qi obstruction and harmonize the Liver and Spleen. It is therefore a very good example for the study of herbal combinations. Tong Xie Yao Fang (Important Formula for Painful Diarrhea) Source: Jing Yue Quan Shu Bai Zhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) 90 g Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) 60 g Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) 45 g Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix) 60 g Analysis of the formula This formula is able to reduce the Liver and strengthen the Spleen. It is used for severe abdomi- nal pain, borborygmi and diarrhea due to Liver- Qi overacting on the Spleen. A thin, white tongue coating and a wiry pulse are present in this syndrome. In this formula: • Bai Zhu and Bai Shao Yao are used as chief. Bai Zhu can strengthen the Middle-Jiao and tonify the Spleen-Qi so as to boost its resistance when under attack by the Liver-Qi. Bai Shao Yao is used to nourish the Yin, soften the Liver and relax the tendons, thereby reducing the aggression of the Liver. When these two herbs are used together, the relationship between the Liver and Spleen will return to balance. • Chen Pi is used as assistant. It activates Qi movement and transforms dampness in the Middle-Jiao, thereby assisting Bai Zhu to tonify the Spleen-Qi. At the same time, it can also assist Chai Hu to spread the Liver-Qi. • Fang Feng also serves as assistant. It enters the Liver and Spleen meridians, expels wind, reduces tension between the Spleen and Liver, and can assist Bai Shao Yao and Chen Pi to spread the Liver-Qi, while also ascending and spreading the Spleen-Qi to treat borborygmi and diarrhea. Commentary on strategies There are only four herbs in the formula, but each of them has a clear role in the treatment and they help each other in restoring the balance between the Liver and Spleen. The selection of Fang Feng, in particular, is an inspirational one, as in this context, it perfectly fits the treatment strategy of spreading 368


the Liver-Qi and reducing the obstruction of the Spleen-Qi.

## 2 Syndrome of disharmony at

<!-- chunk -->

## the Shao Yang level

• As the Gall Bladder meridian runs through the chest and the hypochondriac region, fullness of the chest and hypochondriac region are also experienced. • When the Qi is obstructed, it can invade the Stomach and cause nausea and reduced appetite. • The Gall Bladder is an extraordinary organ where the minister fire resides. When the Qi is obstructed, it can quickly generate heat, causing dry throat and a bitter taste in the mouth. • A wiry pulse indicates the stress between the body’s resistance and the pathogenic factor. A tongue that is normal in color with a thin white coating indicates an acute but mild illness, while a pale tongue often indicates weak bodily resistance. (See Figures 18.3 and 18.4 on page 379.) Treatment principle: Harmonize the Shao-Yang level Main symptoms Alternating fever and chills. Secondary symptoms Hypochondriac distension, reduced appetite, dry throat, bitter taste in the mouth. Tongue Normal or slightly pale. Pulse Wiry. Associated disorders in western medicine Acute and chronic gastroenteritis, prolapsed stomach, dilatation of the stomach, peptic and duo- denal ulcers, stress-related vomiting, irritable bowel syndrome, food allergies and intolerances, and the side effects of some medicines. Analysis of the syndrome According to the Six-Meridian differentiation theory for diseases induced by cold, when a cold pathogenic factor penetrates beyond the Tai Yang meridian (level), it enters the Shao Yang meridian (level) (domain of the San Jiao and Gall Bladder), which is located between the Tai Yang and the Yang Ming meridians (levels). • When the body’s resistance attempts to fight off the pathogenic cold, chills and fever are manifest. • When the pathogenic cold is stronger than the body’s resistance, cold predominates. • If the body’s resistance is stronger than the pathogenic cold, heat arises. Alternating fever and chills is a characteristic symptom that indicates the fight between the body’s resistance and the pathogenic cold at the Shao Yang level. Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Harmonize the Shao Yang level In a syndrome of disharmony at the Shao Yang level, excess and heat often coexist with deficiency and cold. The excess and heat are generated from the fight between the pathogenic factor and the body’s resistance. The cold and weakness are caused by the 369 Syndrome of disharmony and formula compositionChapter deficiency of the body’s resistance or the damage done by the pathogenic factor. To treat only heat may increase the cold and weaken the body, and vice versa. Special herbal combinations are required in this complicated condition. Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) and Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) Chai Hu is pungent and neutral, and enters the Gall Bladder and Liver meridians. It has ascending and dispersing abilities. It disperses and expels the pathogenic cold from the Shao Yang level, and dis- perses and spreads the Qi of the Shao Yang as well. Huang Qin is bitter and cold, and enters the Gall Bladder meridian. It can clear the heat at the Shao Yang level and reduce the fire from stress. When these two herbs are used together, the obstruction of Qi, heat and cold are separated and eliminated, and the free flow of the Qi at the Shao Yang level is restored. Ban Xia (pinelliae rhizoma) and Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) This combination is used to open the Qi obstruction that is caused by conflict between cold and warm, and excess of exogenous pathogenic factor and the weakened body resistance in the Middle-Jiao. Ban Xia is pungent and warm, and enters the Stomach and Spleen meridians. It can disperse the obstructed Qi in the Middle-Jiao and soothe the Stomach-Qi. Huang Qin is bitter and cold, and enters the Spleen and Gall Bladder meridians. Since it can clear heat and descend Qi, it can reduce the Qi obstruction. This combination of warm Ban Xia and cold Huang Qin can reduce the conflict between cold and heat in the Middle-Jiao. At the same time, the pungent Ban Xia can disperse the Qi and bitter Huang Qin can descend the Qi. In this way, the Qi becomes harmonized in the Middle-Jiao. Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) The sweet and warm Ren Shen can directly tonify the Qi, especially the weakened body resistance, and thus can stop further pathological change in the body. Ren Shen is often used with the combi- nation of Chai Hu and Huang Qin, or Ban Xia and Huang Qin, which regulate the Qi and harmonize the cold and heat at the Shao Yang level. These combinations can reduce the excess pathogenic factor and strengthen the weakness of the body’s resistance. Assistant: Enhance the function of the chief and harmonize the Shao Yang level Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma), Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) and Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma) These herbs are often used to enhance the functions of the chief and deputies in harmonizing Shao Yang and are particularly selected in severe cases. Huang Lian is bitter and cold, and enters the Liver, Gall Bladder, Spleen and Large Intestine meridians. It enhances the function of Huang Qin in descending the Qi and clearing heat. Sheng Jiang and Gan Jiang are pungent and warm. They enhance the ability of Chai Hu and Ban Xia to disperse the constrained Qi, warm the Middle-Jiao and strengthen the body’s resistance. In this way the harmonizing action of the formula is stronger. Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao is sweet in nature and primarily enters the Spleen meridian. It can tonify the Spleen-Qi and strengthen the Middle-Jiao. It is used as assistant in the formula to help Ren Shen in stopping the further development of pathological changes. At the same time, it can also moderate the Qi movement and its sweet taste may protect the Stomach. For these reasons it is very useful in the condition of Liver attacking the Spleen.

Analysis of the formula This formula is recorded in the Shang Han Lun, the classical text by Dr Zhang Zhong Jing which has been in use for more than 2000 years. The primary purpose of this formula is to relieve disorder at the Shao Yang level. In this formula: • Chai Hu is one of the two chief herbs. It is pungent and neutral, and enters the Gall Bladder and Liver meridians. Chai Hu has ascending and dispersing properties and can disperse and expel pathogenic cold from the Shao Yang level. At the same time, it also disperses and spreads the Qi. • Huang Qin is the other chief herb in this formula. It is bitter and cold, and enters the Gall Bladder meridian. Huang Qin can clear heat from the Shao Yang level and reduce the heat generated by the stagnation of Qi. When these two herbs are used together, they open up the obstruction of Qi, heat and cold, allowing the Qi to move freely in the Shao Yang meridians. The other herbs serve as assistants in the formula. • Ban Xia, which is pungent and warm, can disperse the Qi stagnation and directly soothe the Stomach-Qi, thereby reducing the Qi obstruction caused by the Gall Bladder overacting on the Stomach. • Ren Shen strengthens the body’s resistance and prevents the pathogenic factor from entering deeper into the body. • Sheng Jiang and Da Zao enhance the ability of Ren Shen to strengthen the Spleen and generate the Qi. Sheng Jiang also enhances the ability of Ban Xia to disperse the pathogenic factor and soothe the Stomach-Qi. • Zhi Gan Cao serves as both assistant and envoy, tonifying the Qi and harmonizing the herbs in this formula. When the above herbs are combined, the pathogenic cold can be eliminated and the heat reduced, the movement of Qi in the Shao Yang meridians and Stomach is harmonized, and all the symptoms disappear. Commentary on strategies • This formula shows clearly how to treat a complex condition at the Shao Yang level by simultaneously expelling cold, clearing heat and strengthening the body’s resistance. In this way, the Qi movement through the Shao Yang meridians becomes smooth. • In clinical practice, this formula is used not only to relieve Shao Yang syndrome, but also to treat Qi stagnation in the Liver and Gall Bladder meridians when Liver-Qi overacts on the Stomach, impairing digestion and weakening the body’s resistance. Ban Xia Xie Xin Tang (Pinellia Decoction to Drain the Epigastrium) Source: Shang Han Lun Ban Xia (Pinelliae rhizoma) 9 g Gan Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma) 9 g Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) 9 g Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) 3 g Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) 9 g Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) 6 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 6 g Analysis of the formula This is another formula devised by Dr Zhang Zhong Jing. It was originally used for a condition in which a Shao Yang syndrome had previously been treated, not by the harmonizing method, but by the purging method – an erroneous treatment strategy which had injured the Qi and Yang of the Middle-Jiao. However, the body’s resistance is still struggling to expel the pathogenic cold, and this process gener- ates heat. The pathological changes result in Qi stag- nation, which leads to epigastric fullness and distension, with mild pain and reduced appetite. Since the Qi movement is disturbed in the Middle- Jiao, nausea, vomiting, borborygmi and diarrhea may be experienced. A thin, sticky, yellow tongue coating and a wiry and rapid pulse are the characteristic signs of this syndrome. In this formula: • Ban Xia is used as chief to disperse the Qi stagnation, open the obstruction and soothe the Stomach-Qi. It can directly reduce the fullness and tightness in the epigastric region. In 371 Syndrome of disharmony and formula compositionChapter combination with the assistant Gan Jiang, it warms the Middle-Jiao and disperses the cold. • Huang Qin and Huang Lian also serve as chief. They are bitter and cold, have a downward- moving tendency and can clear heat. When pungent-warm herbs and bitter-cold herbs are combined, the cold and heat complex, which knots up the Qi and causes obstruction, is dissipated. • Ren Shen, Zhi Gan Cao and Da Zao are used as assistants. They tonify the Spleen, and prevent the pathogenic cold from entering into deeper levels of the body. They can also protect the Stomach and promote digestion so as to treat the weakness of the body’s resistance. When these seven herbs are used together, the heat and cold are separated and eliminated, the Middle- Jiao becomes stronger, the Spleen-Qi can ascend and the Stomach-Qi can descend properly, and all the symptoms disappear. Commentary on strategies • This formula is used to treat a complex condition in which cold and heat coexist, alongside both excess and deficiency in the Middle-Jiao. • It demonstrates how a combination of pungent- warm herbs and bitter-cold herbs can treat a complicated syndrome in which heat and cold are mixed together. • This strategy is used not only in treating Shao Yang syndrome, but also in similar conditions where the Spleen-Qi is weak and the Liver-Qi stagnates, thus producing cold and heat, such as in cases of acute and chronic gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, food allergy and intolerance.

## 3 Syndrome of disharmony

<!-- chunk -->

## between Ying-Qi and Wei-Qi

Secondary symptoms Headache, sensations of discomfort in the body, blocked nose and cough. Tongue Normal tongue with a white coating. Pulse Superficial and soft. Main symptoms Mild fever, aversion to wind, slight sweating and, in some cases, skin rashes and urticaria. Associated disorders in western medicine Recurrent colds, spontaneous sweating with slight fever and aversion to wind after illness, surgery or childbirth, chronic sinusitis, allergies, and morning sickness in early pregnancy. Analysis of the syndrome Ying-Qi, the Nutritive-Qi, is directly generated by food and drink through the function of the Spleen, and it nourishes the body. Since it carries out the functions of blood and Yin, it is often directly called Ying-Yin. Wei-Qi, the Defensive-Qi, is originally derived from Kidney-Qi and is enhanced by the Spleen-Qi. Both Ying-Yin and Wei-Qi are lifted by the Spleen-Qi to the Upper-Jiao and are spread throughout the entire body by means of the Lung’s dispersing function. Ying-Yin and Wei-Qi move together as a Yin- Yang couple, the Wei-Qi guards the Ying-Yin and Ying-Yin nourishes the Wei-Qi. The Ying-Yin moves inside the meridians while the Wei-Qi travels just outside the meridians. They circulate in the super- ficial region of the body, bringing warmth and nutri- tion to this region, and control the proper opening and closing of the pores. Disharmony between Ying and Wei can arise in several conditions. First of all, Spleen-Qi deficiency may cause weakness in the Ying-Qi and Wei-Qi directly. Second, when external pathogenic wind and cold attack the superficial region of the body, the Defensive-Qi may be unable to close the pores tightly enough, allowing the pathogenic wind and cold to invade the body and disturb the relationship between the Ying and Wei. Furthermore, if wind disturbs the superficial region of the body, the pores may lose control, allowing the body fluid to leak out as sweat, which directly weakens the Ying-Yin and causes disharmony between Ying and Wei. Moreover, if blood and Yin are deficient, Ying-Yin is also weak 372


and is unable to accompany the Wei-Qi properly, so disharmony between Ying and Wei rises. • When the Ying-Qi and Wei-Qi are unable move properly in a harmonized way, symptoms in the superficial region of the body may appear, such as fever, aversion to wind, sensations of discomfort in the body, skin rashes or allergies which are characterized by symptoms which arise quickly and change rapidly. • A floating but soft pulse and a white tongue coating are signs of this disharmony. (See Figures 18.5 and 18.6 on page 380 and Figure 18.7 on page 381.) Treatment principle: Strengthen and Harmonize the Ying-Qi and Wei-Qi Gui Zhi is warm, pungent and sweet, and enters the Heart, Lung and Bladder meridians. It has the function of warming and strengthening the Heart- Yang, promoting blood circulation, spreading Yang-Qi and unblocking the meridians. Since its pungent and warm nature is stabilized by its sweet taste, its function of stimulating the Yang and Qi is effective and stable. It is often used to strengthen and stimulate the Wei-Qi in the condition of dishar- mony of Ying and Wei. It is often used with Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora), which is able to stabilize the Ying-Yin. Huang Qi is sweet and slightly warm, and enters the Spleen and Lung meridians. It can strongly tonify the Spleen-Qi and promote transfor- mation of Qi and blood so as to strengthen the Wei-Qi. Since it can also strengthen the Lung-Qi, promote the spreading of the Wei-Qi on the surface of the body and control the opening and closing of the pores, it can control the Ying-Yin, stop sweating and stabilize the exterior. It can be used in condi- tions of Wei-Qi deficiency and disharmony of Ying and Wei. Dang Gui is pungent, sweet and slightly warm. Its sweet and warm properties can tonify the blood, and its pungent and warm nature may promote the blood circulation. It plays a role in harmonizing Ying and Wei through generating the Ying-Yin and promoting the movement of Ying-Qi. It is particularly used in the condition of blood deficiency, which leads to disharmony of Ying and Wei. It is often used with Bai Shao Yao to nourish and stabilize the Ying-Yin in this situation. Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) and Sheng Di Huang (rehmanniae radix) These two herbs are chosen separately to work with Gui Zhi or Huang Qi or Dang Gui to nourish the Ying-Yin so as to harmonize Ying and Wei. Bai Shao Yao is sour, bitter and slightly cold. Sour and cold may generate the blood and Yin, and sup- plement the shortage of the substantial part of the blood and the Ying-Yin. Bitter and cold properties can clear heat and reduce empty-heat in the blood caused by deficiency of blood and Yin. In this way, the blood can circulate in a moderate way. It is considered an important herb in harmonizing the Ying and Wei by nourishing and stabilizing the Ying-Yin. Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Harmonize Ying and Wei Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus), Huang Qi (astragali radix) and Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix) These three herbs are chosen separately to work with either Bai Shao Yao or Sheng Di Huang to regulate and strengthen the function of Wei-Qi so as to harmonize Ying and Wei. 373 Syndrome of disharmony and formula compositionChapter Sheng Di Huang is sweet and cold, and enters the Heart, Liver and Kidney meridians. Like Bai Shao Yao, it can nourish the Ying-Yin, but it cannot sta- bilize the Yin as it has no sour taste. However, it can stabilize the Ying-Yin through the approaches of clearing heat and cooling the blood. It is particularly useful if the heat pushes the Ying-Yin out of the body and causes sweating, leading to more severe disharmony of Ying-Yin and Wei-Qi. Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Zhi Gan Cao enters the 12 regular meridians, but primarily enters the Spleen meridian. It can tonify the Spleen-Qi, and although the function is not very strong, its steady and moderate characteristics are often the favorite in selection to treat chronic and complicated conditions. Owing to its sweet and neutral properties, it can be combined with warm and pungent herbs to generate the Wei-Qi, and can be combined with cold and sour herbs to nourish the Ying-Yin. This sweet herb, which primarily enters the Middle-Jiao, as a central force, can tonify, stabilize and connect Yin, Yang, Qi and blood in the body, especially in weak and complicated conditions. Assistant: Tonify and regulate the Qi; promote digestion in order to generate Ying-Qi and Wei-Qi Shan Yao (Dioscoreae rhizoma) and Huang Qi (astragali radix) Shan Yao is neutral and sweet, and enters the Lung, Spleen and Kidney meridians. Although the func- tion of tonifying the Spleen-Qi is not very strong, it can either tonify the Qi or the Yin as it has an astringent taste. It can be selected as assistant to tonify and stabilize the Spleen so as to promote generation of Ying-Qi and Wei-Qi. It is especially suitable for use in the treatment of sweating. Huang Qi is sweet and slightly warm, and enters the Spleen and Lung meridians. It can strongly tonify the Spleen-Qi and promote the transform- ation of the Qi and blood so as to strengthen the Wei-Qi. As it can control the opening and closing of the pores, it can control the Ying-Yin, stop sweating and stabilize the exterior. Jing Jie (Schizonepetae herba), Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix) and Chai Hu (Bupleuri radix) Jing Jie and Fang Feng are pungent and slightly warm. They can expel wind and are commonly used for mild exterior wind-cold syndrome. In the syn- drome of disharmony of Ying and Wei, they can be selected as assistants to expel wind and directly relieve aversion to wind. Moreover, Jing Jie can expel wind in the blood so it is often used in skin disorders when itch exists due to wind invasion, such as eczema, urti- caria and food allergy. Fang Feng is less strong in dispersing the wind on the surface of the body than Jing Jie because Fang Feng is sweet and this moderates its pungent taste. However, as Fang Feng is warmer than Jing Jie and enters the Spleen meridian, it is especially good at expelling damp- ness and cold in the regions that are deeper than the body surface, such as the subcutaneous region and muscles which are controlled by the Spleen. It is often used in food allergy and food intolerance when the Qi and blood are weak and are not in harmony. Chai Hu is pungent and neutral, and enters the Liver and Gall Bladder meridians. It possesses a dispersing and ascending capacity. Chai Hu is par- ticularly effective in spreading Qi in Shao Yang meridians. It is selected in the condition where there are alternating chills and fever, dry throat, a bitter taste in the mouth and fullness in the chest and hypochondriac region. Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) and Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) In the formula for treating the syndrome of dishar- mony of Ying and Wei, Sheng Jiang and Da Zao, as assistants, are often used as one unit. The pungent and warm Sheng Jiang is selected to assist the chief to expel wind and cold, and to enhance the force of the Wei-Qi. As it enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians, it can soothe the Stomach-Qi, warm the Middle-Jiao, aid digestion and therefore enhance the source of the Wei-Qi. The sweet and warm Da Zao enters the Spleen meridian, and can tonify the Spleen-Qi and nourish the blood. It enhances and strengthens the chief to nourish and stabilize Ying- Yin and Ying-Qi. 374


Examples of classical formulas Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction) Source: Shang Huan Lun of Bai Shao Yao. Together Da Zao and Zhi Gan Cao tonify the Spleen-Qi, thus strengthening both the Ying-Qi and the Wei-Qi. Commentary on strategies There are several characteristic features of this formula. • First of all, Gui Zhi and Bai Shao Yao are used to harmonize and tonify the Wei-Qi and Ying- Yin and they focus on the main pathological changes. • Second, the combination of Sheng Jiang and Da Zao is used to strengthen the Middle-Jiao in order to promote the generation of Wei-Qi and Ying-Qi. • Third, the formula utilizes well-balanced herbal pairings. Thus Gui Zhi and Sheng Jiang tonify the Yang and Qi, while Bai Shao Yao and Da Zao tonify the Yin and blood. When combined in this way, these pairings bring balance and ensure safe use, enabling their application in many types of disorder that are caused by disharmony between Ying and Wei. • Finally, four of the five ingredients in this formula (the exception being Bai Shao Yao) are often used as ingredients in cooking, so this formula is easily accepted by patients and can be widely used.

Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) 9 g Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) 9 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 6 g Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) 9 g Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) 12 pieces Analysis of the formula This formula was devised by Dr Zhang Zhong Jing. It was originally used to treat disharmony between Ying and Wei in an exterior deficiency syndrome of the Tai Yang meridian, which, in Zang Fu differen- tiation theory, equates to a wind-cold syndrome. The manifestations are fever with irregular sweating and aversion to wind, a blocked nose, headache, a white tongue coating and a superficial, weak or slow pulse. However, this formula can also be used to treat different disorders directly caused by dishar- mony between Ying and Wei. In this formula: • Gui Zhi and Bai Shao Yao are paired as chief. The warm and sweet Gui Zhi promotes blood circulation and strengthens the Yang and Qi in the superficial region of the body, while the sour and cold Bai Shao Yao nourishes the Yin and body fluids, thereby strengthening the Ying-Yin. They perfectly match each other to address the condition of deficiency and imbalance between the Wei-Qi and the Ying-Yin in the superficial region of the body, restoring the physiological balance between the two. • The assistants are Sheng Jiang, Da Zao and Zhi Gan Cao. The pungent and warm Sheng Jiang assists Gui Zhi, enhancing the power of the Wei-Qi to expel wind and cold. It enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians, soothes the Stomach-Qi, warms the Middle-Jiao, aids digestion and boosts the Wei-Qi. The sweet and warm Da Zao enters the Spleen meridian, nourishes the blood and supports the function Main symptoms Cold and sore extremities, desire for warmth, a dry mouth and throat, low-grade fever, a pale complexion, tiredness, reduced appetite. Secondary symptoms Abdominal pain, palpitations, irritability. Tongue Pale, with a thin coating. Pulse Thready. 375 Syndrome of disharmony and formula compositionChapter Associated disorders in western medicine Insomnia, arrhythmia due to weak constitution or chronic disease, gastritis and peptic ulcer. Analysis of the syndrome This is a complicated syndrome where the five inter- nal organs are all weak, and the Qi, blood, Yin and Yang are all deficient. This syndrome often occurs in people with a weak constitution or patients suf- fering from chronic illness. • The deficiency of Yang manifests as cold and painful extremities, a desire for warmth and intermittent, spasmodic abdominal pain that is alleviated by warmth and pressure. • The deficiency of Qi causes tiredness and reduced appetite. • The deficiency of blood may lead to a lusterless complexion, palpitations, a pale tongue and a thready pulse. • The deficiency of Yin manifests as low-grade fever, dry mouth, dry throat and irritability. (See Figure 18.8 on page 381.) Treatment principle: Use sweet herbs to tonify the Spleen and strengthen the Middle-Jiao so as to tonify and harmonize the Qi, blood, Yin and Yang of the body


In this syndrome, the Qi, blood, Yin and Yang are all deficient, but to different degrees, which makes the treatment more complicated. tonifying the Yang by using pungent and hot herbs may injure the Yin and blood; nourishing the Yin and blood by using cold and sour herbs may injure the Yang and Qi. therefore a special principle is developed for this complicated syndrome: 1. tonify the Spleen as it is the source of all the essential materials of the body and it is also the foundation of other organs. 2. Use sweet herbs as the basic flavor in the composition of these herbs can tonify the body without having the side effect of injuring the Yin or Yang, and can be readily combined with cold and warm herbs in order to tonify the Yin and Yang of the body. Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Tonify the weakness Yi Tang (Maltose) and Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Yi Tang and Gan Cao are sweet and neutral. They enter the Spleen meridian. They are often used as chief in formulas to treat general weakness of Yin, Yang, Qi and blood of all the internal organs. • First of all, they can directly tonify the Spleen-Qi, the source of Qi and blood, the foundation of life. It is particularly sensible for these herbs to be selected in an extremely weak condition of the internal organs. • Second, compared with the herbs that tonify the Spleen, they have an obviously advantage in the selection. Because they have gentle actions of tonifying, they carry out a steady but effective function that has no side effects to harm the Yin or the Yang. They are particularly useful in chronic deficiency conditions. • Third, their neutral property can be used in either cold or heat syndromes, which often exist in chronic deficiency conditions. Their sweet taste can combine with warm herbs to tonify the Yang and combine with cold herbs to generate the Yin. • Finally, their sweet, nourishing nature can perfectly moderate the movement of Qi and blood, reduce tension due to disharmony in the body and slow down pathological development. 376


Their sweet taste can also ease the muscles and relieve cramping pain of the Stomach and intestines. Deputy: Nourish blood and Yin, tonify Qi and Yang Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) Gui Zhi is warm, pungent and sweet, and enters the Heart, Lung and Bladder meridians. It can strengthen and stimulate the Heart-Yang, promote the blood circulation and spread the warmth of Yang in the body. Since its pungent and warm nature is stabi- lized by its sweet taste, its function of stimulating the Yang and Qi is effective and stable. It can be used as deputy in the formula to strengthen the Yang and Qi in the body. Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix) Dang Gui is pungent, sweet and slightly warm. It can tonify the blood and promote blood circulation. It is often selected as deputy in the formula to tonify the blood, enhance the herbs that stimulate the Yang and Qi, and generate blood. Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) Bai Shao Yao is sour, bitter and slightly cold. It can generate the blood and Yin. This function can be enhanced by sweet herbs. In addition, its bitter and cold properties can clear heat and reduce empty- heat in the blood caused by deficiency of blood and Yin. In this way, the blood can circulate in a moder- ate way. Bai Shao Yao is often used as deputy in the formula to tonify the substantial part of the blood and Yin and reduce heat. Shu Di Huang (rehmanniae radix praeparata) Shu Di Huang is sweet and slightly warm, and enters the Kidney and Liver meridians. It is the most important herb for tonifying the blood as well as tonifying the Kidney-essence. Since its function is strong and quick, it can be used as deputy in the formula to treat severe deficiency of the Yin and essences. However, Sheng Di Huang is very cloying in nature and can easily obstruct the Qi movement. When the Spleen-Qi is weak, it can easily cause distension in the abdomen and reduced appetite. As such, it is often used with herbs that promote diges- tion and regulate Qi in the Middle-Jiao. Ren Shen (Ginseng radix) Ren Shen is sweet, bitter and slightly warm, and enters the Lung and Spleen meridians. Since Ren Shen can strongly tonify the Yuan-Qi (the Source- Qi), it can tonify the Qi of all the internal organs. For instance, it tonifies the Heart-Qi, calms the mind and therefore treats palpitations and restless- ness. It can tonify the Spleen-Qi and treat poor appetite, tiredness and diarrhea. It can tonify the Lung-Qi so as to treat shortness of breath. Moreo- ver, it also promotes the generation of the blood, body fluids and Yin. It can be used as deputy to treat a severe condition of Qi deficiency. Assistant: Promote digestion in order to generate Qi, blood, Yin and Yang Chen Pi (Citri reticulatae pericarpium) Chen Pi is dried tangerine peel. It is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters particularly the Spleen and Stomach meridians. It regulates the Qi in the Mid- dle-Jiao and promotes digestion. It is often selected as corrective assistant in formulas to reduce the cloying nature of the sweet tonifying herbs. It can directly treat distension in the Stomach and reduced appetite caused by Qi stagnation in the upper abdomen. Fu Ling (poria) Fu Ling is neutral and bland, and enters the Heart, Spleen and Kidney meridians. It can gently tonify the Qi of these organs, and can be used in either heat or cold syndromes of deficiency. It is often used as assistant to eliminate dampness in the Middle- Jiao. The dampness can be generated by deficiency of Spleen-Qi or from the cloying nature of the sweet tonifying herbs. Fu Ling can also tonify the Heart-Qi and calm the mind. Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) and Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) Sheng Jiang is pungent and warm, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. It is selected to assist the chief and deputies to soothe the Stomach- Qi, warm the Middle-Jiao, aid digestion and there- fore enhance the source of the Qi. It is also often used to enhance the ability of the deputy to stimu- late and warm the Yang in the body. Da Zao is sweet and warm, and enters the Spleen meridian. It can tonify the Spleen-Qi and nourish the blood. It is often used to enhance the ability of 377 Syndrome of disharmony and formula compositionChapter the deputy to nourish blood. Sheng Jiang and Da Zao are used as one unit in the formula. Examples of classical formulas Xiao Jian Zhong Tang (Minor Construct the Middle Decoction) Source: Shang Han Lun the Spleen directly without the risk of harming the Yin or the Yang. Since its nourishing nature makes it perfect for easing the muscles, it can relieve cramping pain. • When Yi Tang is used with Gui Zhi, one of the deputy herbs which is pungent, sweet and hot, the Spleen-Yang can be tonified and stimulated. As the pungent and hot nature of Gui Zhi is modified by the large amount of Yi Tang, it will not injure the Yin and blood. • When Yi Tang is used with Bai Shao Yao, the other deputy which is sour, bitter and cold, the Yin can be generated and the blood and Yin deficiency can be treated. As the cold nature of Bai Shao Yao is minimized by the large amount of Yi Tang, the Yang and Qi will not be injured. • The pungent and hot Sheng Jiang stimulates the Yang, and assists Gui Zhi to warm the Middle- Jiao. It also soothes the Stomach-Qi, disperses the cold and fluid accumulation, and improves digestion. • The sweet and warm Da Zao can tonify the blood and Spleen-Qi, and serves as assistant to Bai Shao Yao. • Zhi Gan Cao serves as assistant as well as envoy. On the one hand, it can tonify the Spleen and soothe the muscles, thus assisting the chief; on the other hand, it moderates the action of the other herbs in its role as envoy. Commentary on strategies The composition of this formula has several distinc- tive characteristics. • First of all, sweet herbs are used to directly tonify the Spleen. • Second, the combinations of sweet and warm herbs and sweet and cold herbs are used to generate the Yang and the Yin respectively. • Third, the herbal combinations and dosage ratios are arranged in a thoughtful way so as to avoid causing injury to other aspects in the process of tonifying one aspect. In this way, the Yin, Yang, Qi and blood are gener- ated gradually, steadily and sufficiently. As soon as the Yin and blood can nourish the internal organs, the functions of the Yang and Qi are boosted and all symptoms gradually disappear. This formula is a very good example of treating a chronic condition of deficiency. Yi Tang (Maltose) 18–30 g Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus) 9 g Bai Shao Yao (Paeoniae radix lactiflora) 9 g Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) 6 g Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens) 10 g Da Zao (Jujubae fructus) 4 pieces Analysis of the formula This formula primarily treats Spleen-Qi and Yang deficiency. In fact, it treats a chronic syndrome of deficiency of the Middle-Jiao, where not only Qi and Yang are deficient, but also the Yin and blood, on account of the debilitating effects of the long- term weakness of Yang and Qi. The Yang and Qi deficiency manifests as intermittent, spasmodic abdominal pain that is relieved by warmth and pres- sure, reduced appetite, and cold and sore extremi- ties. The Qi and blood deficiency manifests as a lusterless complexion, palpitations, a pale tongue and a thready pulse; the Yin deficiency manifests as low-grade fever, dry mouth, dry throat and irritability. The Qi, blood, Yin and Yang in the Middle- Jiao are all deficient, but to different degrees, and this makes the treatment more complicated. Tonify- ing the Yang by using pungent and hot herbs may injure the Yin and blood; nourishing the Yin and blood by using cold and sour herbs may injure the Yang and Qi. The formula Xiao Jian Zhong Tang demonstrates some important strategies by which all four aspects can be tonified in a balanced and effective way. • A large amount of Yi Tang is applied as the chief ingredient. Since it is sweet and neutral and enters the Spleen meridian, it can tonify 378

## Syndrome of Yong Yang

In Chinese, Yong means carbuncle and Yang means ulceration. Yong Yang is a collective term in tradi- tional Chinese medicine for boils, carbuncles, ulcer- ation and localized open or closed wounds. Since these disorders are located on the skin, are observ- able and palpable, they are recognized as a special syndrome in differentiation. According to differ- ences in causes, manifestations and signs, Yong Yang can be subdivided into Yang syndrome and Yin syn- drome. The treatments are different.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1 Yang syndrome

The Yang type of Yong Yang syndrome is character- ized by localized redness, swelling, hot sensations and pain. High fever and general pain may also exist. This syndrome appears in acute inflammations, such as carbuncles, furuncles, abscesses and infected open wounds. The book The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine indicated: ‘Most of the sores which are painful, itchy and swollen are due to fire.’ In clinical practice, this syndrome is mainly related to fire disturbance of the Heart, Liver and Stomach. The Heart is a fire organ and its fire can easily flare up in a pathological condition. The Heart-fire can also be rapidly increased by the influence of Liver-fire because the Liver is its mother organ. The blazing Heart-fire can easily generate fire-toxin and lead to a fire-toxin syndrome. The Stomach is another source of excess fire in the body. It is a Yang Ming organ and is responsible for receiving, ripening and transporting food. All these activities increase and produce heat, and lead to fire-toxin syndrome. A Yang-type Yong Yang syndrome often appears when patients are subject to strong emotions or are under stress, which can quickly generate internal heat-toxin, injure the flesh and blood, and lead to boils and carbuncles. A Yang-type Yong Yang syn- drome is also caused by inappropriate dietary habits such as overindulgence in spicy, greasy, sweet foods and alcohol, which easily generate heat and damp- ness in the Middle-Jiao and influence the subcutane- ous region. This situation frequently occurs in a person with a Yang constitution or a patient who suffers from internal heat due to chronic disease or taking certain medication. Manifestations Main symptoms Boils, carbuncles, ulceration and localized open wounds with signs of redness, swelling, heat and pain. Secondary symptoms Acute condition At the initial stage: Fever, chills, generalized pain of the body. The boil or carbuncle is hard and painful. At the metaphase stage: Pus is formed, thus the boil or carbuncle becomes soft and the pain is less severe. At the recovery stage: Perforation occurs, pus is discharged and the healing process starts. Chronic condition Pus is formed but the boil or carbuncle does not readily perforate, and the localized lesion is accompanied by mild pain, swelling and a warm sensation. Tongue Red tongue with yellow coating. Pulse Wiry, rapid and forceful. Associated disorders in western medicine Carbuncles, furuncles, abscesses and infected open wounds. Analysis of the syndrome • When heat accumulates in the skin, subcutaneous region and muscles, the patient may feel hot in the affected region and observe a red color of the skin lesions. • Heat obstructs the Qi and blood, and causes swelling and pain. • If heat disturbs the normal movement of Defensive-Qi in the superficial region of the body, chills and fever may appear at the initial stage. • Heat-toxin with stagnant dampness, Qi and blood may form a hard and painful lesion. • When excess heat blazes in the blood and flesh, pus is eventually formed. • If the Qi and blood are strong enough in the body, the body’s resistance can push out the 385 Yong and Yang syndrome and formula compositionChapter toxin. The lesion thus perforates, pus is discharged, and the pain and the hot sensation are reduced. • When Qi movement and blood circulation are improved in the local region, the healing process starts. • If the body’s resistance is not strong, the Qi and blood are too weak to push out the toxin. Pus forms but the boil or carbuncle does not perforate and discharge pus. The disorder then leads to a chronic process. (See Figure 19.1 on page 395.) Treatment principle • At the initial stage: Clear heat-toxin and reduce swelling so as to prevent further development of the syndrome. • If the pus is forming but the boil or carbuncle is not ready to perforate: Activate Qi and blood, accelerate formation of pus and perforation of the boil or carbuncle. • If the pus is formed and the boil or carbuncle becomes soft and less painful: Discharge the pus by promoting perforation or making an incision. • After pus has been discharged: Tonify the Qi, nourish Yin and stimulate the blood in order to promote the healing process. Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Clear wind-heat, remove heat-toxin or damp-heat in order to stop the pathogenic development at the initial stage Jin Yin Hua (Lonicerae flos) and Lian Qiao (Forsythiae fructus) Jin Yin Hua is sweet and cold, and enters the Heart, Liver and Stomach meridians. It is a strong herb to clear heat in these organs and meridians. Its sweet and cold properties may generate body fluids so it can prevent Yin consumption from internal heat. As Jin Yin Hua is collected in the early summer when the flowers are still in bud, this herb has a light fragrant smell that has dispersing and ascending abilities. It may slightly disperse and ascend the fire, especially the constrained fire, and can therefore effectively clear heat and remove heat-toxin. Because of these characteristics, it is often selected as chief at the initial stage of Yang-type Yong Yang syndrome. Lian Qiao is less cold than Jin Yin Hua but has a bitter taste. It enters the Heart and Small Intestine meridians. Bitterness may descend fire from the Heart and cold may clear heat. This herb possesses strong dispersing and ascending abilities and is espe- cially effective in dispersing heat in the Heart and relieving restlessness and a warm sensation in the chest. It is also able to dissipate clumps and nodules caused by constrained heat, accumulation of food and phlegm, and stagnation of blood. Its dispersing and dissipating actions are stronger than those of Jin Yin Hua. It is especially used for treating Yang-type Yong Yang syndrome caused by blazing Heart-fire. As Jin Yin Hua and Lian Qiao have similar prop- erties and actions, they are often used together to enhance the strength of reducing heat-toxin. Pu Gong Ying (taraxaci herba), Di Ding (Violae herba) and Ye Ju Hua (Chrysanthemi indici flos) These herbs can strongly reduce heat-toxin and are often applied in the formula to treat Yang-type Yong Yang syndrome. Pu Gong Ying is bitter, sweet and cold, and enters the Liver and Stomach meridians. It can effectively reduce swelling and clear heat-toxin. It can be used at the initial stage of boils and carbuncles when they 386


are warm and swelling. The fresh herb of Pu Gong Ying can be smashed and applied on the swelling and painful places. When there is an ulcer characterized by a red color, a hot sensation and burning pain, Pu Gong Ying can also be used. In this case, it is not only used orally, but also topically as a local com- press after the herb is cooked. Di Ding is bitter, pungent and cold, and enters the Heart and Liver meridians. It should be selected in the formula if a boil is hard, deep-based and very painful. It is suitable for use when the cause of the disorder is blazing Heart-fire rather than heat in the Stomach. Ye Ju Hua is bitter and neutral, and enters the Lung, Liver and Kidney meridians. It can effectively clear heat-toxin and also reduce swelling. Like Pu Gong Ying, it can be used both orally and topically. Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix), Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma), Huang Bai (phellodendri cortex), Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) and Long Dan Cao (Gentianae radix) These herbs are very cold and bitter, and can inten- sively clear heat and dry dampness. They treat severe damp-heat syndrome, which can be observed in infections of skin and subcutaneous regions, ulcers, eczema and some open wounds where the lesions are red, painful and weeping. When a person has fat skin or overindulges in greasy, sweet and pungent food, skin infections with thick pus can develop easily, which is considered as damp-heat accumulation in syndrome differentiation. Huang Qin, Huang Lian and Huang Bai are often selected in the formula to remove the damp-heat. If Yang- type Yong Yang syndrome is linked directly with strong emotions and stress, Huang Lian and Long Dan Cao are often used as they enter the Heart and Liver meridians and can reduce the blazing fire. These herbs can be used separately according to the syndrome features and location of the lesions. Huang Qin enters the Lung and Large Intestine meridians. It particularly clears heat in the Lung and the Upper-Jiao and damp-heat in the intestine. As skin is related to the Lung, Huang Qin can be used for the initial and metaphase stages of Yang-type Yong Yang syndrome, which is characterized by itchy and red superficial skin eruptions, and red and weeping ulcers. When damp-heat also accumulates in the Large Intestine due to inappropriate dietary habit with symptoms such as sticky and stinking feces, this herb is more suitable for selection. Huang Lian enters the Heart and Stomach meridians. It can strongly reduce fire in the Heart and Stomach, and treat boils or carbuncles devel- oped under stress and strong emotions, or due to consumption of very spicy food. Huang Bai enters the Kidney and Bladder merid- ians. It can clear heat and dry dampness in the Lower-Jiao. It is an appropriate herb to treat boils and carbuncles in the groins, buttocks and external genital area. It is also used for treating pruritus vulvae, scrotitis and penitis due to damp-heat in the Lower-Jiao and disturbance of empty-fire of the Kidney. Huang Qin, Huang Lian and Huang Bai can also be applied topically in lotions or pastes to clear heat and dry dampness. They can also be used together in a cream, called San Huang Gao (the three yellow cream), to treat boils and carbuncles. Zhi Zi enters the San Jiao meridian. It can be combined with any other herbs in this group to enhance their function of clearing heat. At the same time, it leaches out the damp-heat by promoting urination. The latter is the strong point of this herb as it can clear damp-heat of the Heart, Liver and Bladder and lead it to exit the body by urination. Long Dan Cao enters the Liver meridian and can strongly clear Liver-heat. If Yang-type Yong Yang syndrome appears on the lateral sides of the face, neck and hypochondriac region, such as in cases of herpes zoster, Long Dan Cao can be selected. Long Dan Cao can also be selected in the formula to treat damp-heat in the Liver meridian in the Lower-Jiao, such as in cases of vaginitis, scrotitis and penitis. Deputy: Promote blood circulation and reduce heat in the blood Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma), Dan Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix), Mu Dan Pi (Moutan cortex) and Chi Shao Yao (paeoniae radix rubra) Chuan Xiong is pungent and warm, and enters the Liver, Gall Bladder and Pericardium meridians. Pun- gency can disperse congealed blood, and warmth can activate blood circulation and dissipate blood stagna- tion. Chuan Xiong is a very effective herb to invigor- ate blood and to promote blood circulation. It is characterized by high moving speed and strength. For treating Yang-type Yong Yang syndrome, since it can remove congealed blood and reduce pain, it 387 Yong and Yang syndrome and formula compositionChapter can be selected at all stages of the disorder. It should be mentioned that this herb is warm and very pungent, and a large dosage or long-term use may consume the Yin and Qi. Herbs that nourish the Yin and tonify the Qi should therefore be selected along with Chuan Xiong when treating a chronic condition. Dan Shen is bitter and slightly cold, and enters the blood level of the Heart and Liver meridians. It is able to promote blood circulation, cool the blood, calm the mind and eliminate irritability. It is a good choice for treating Yang-type Yong Yang syndrome when the color of the skin turns to deep red or purple, which indicates stagnation of blood. Dan Shen can also be applied topically to reduce pain and swelling. The syndrome is often caused by stress and emotional disturbance, which lead to Liver-Qi stag- nation, Liver-fire or Heart-fire generation, when the heat further enters the blood and consumes the blood. Mu Dan Pi and Chi Shao Yao are both cold in nature. They are very often used for cooling the blood and treating heat in the blood. Moreover, they are both able to promote blood circulation and are often chosen because they have fewer side effects than other cold herbs of generating congealed blood in the process of cooling the blood. Chi Shao Yao is bitter and cold, and enters the Liver meridian, the blood level. It is especially effec- tive in clearing excess heat in the blood. As it is strong in promoting blood circulation and removing congealed blood, it can effectively alleviate pain and reduce swelling. Moreover, it is one of the com- monly selected herbs to apply topically to relieve pain and reduce swelling in strain and acute closed injury. Mu Dan Pi is pungent and cold, and enters the Liver meridian. It is able to clear empty-heat in the blood and is often selected in the formula to treat a sub-acute condition of Yang-type Yong Yang syn- drome when the excess heat has consumed the Yin, especially the Liver-Yin. Zi Cao (arnebiae/Lithospermi radix) and Qian Cao Gen (rubiae radix) Zi Cao is salty, sweet and cold, and enters the Heart and Liver meridians; Qian Cao Gen is bitter and cold, and enters the Liver and Pericardium meridi- ans. These two herbs enter the blood and cool the blood. At the same time, they can reduce congealed blood. Qian Cao Gen can also stop bleeding. They are particularly selected in the condition when the skin lesion is deep red or purple in color, which suggests that heat has entered the blood and blood stagnation exists, such as in the sub-acute or chronic condition of boils and carbuncles, ulcers, closed injury of muscles and joints, or bleeding under the skin. Assistant: Transform dampness, discharge pus and promote healing Gua Lou (trichosanthis fructus), Pu Gong Ying (taraxaci herba), Xia Ku Cao (prunellae spica), Zhe Bei Mu (Fritillariae thunbergii bulbus) and Wang Bu Liu Xing (Vaccariae semen) All of these herbs are able to promote pus forma- tion, and therefore the boil or carbuncle will soon be ready to perforate or be incised. As soon as the pus can be discharged, the healing process can start. Gua Lou and Pu Gong Ying can accelerate and increase pus formation, eliminate dampness and phlegm, and clean up the purulent lesion. They are often used in the metaphase of Yang-type Yong Yang syndrome. Xia Ku Cao and Zhe Bei Mu have a pungent nature, can break up phlegm accumula- tion and soften hardness, and are particularly applied at the early stage of metaphase of Yong Yang syn- drome when the boil or carbuncle is hard and painful, with no chance of reduction as there might have been at the initial stage. The only solution is to accelerate the process of pus formation and push out the toxin. Wang Bu Liu Xing is bitter and neutral, and enters the Liver and Stomach meridians. It has a strong moving ability and enters the blood level. It can promote Qi movement, eliminate stagnant blood and open up the collaterals. It is often selected when obstruction of dampness, phlegm, Qi and blood exists at the metaphase stage of the boil or carbuncle. It can accelerate perforation and dis- charge pus. Wang Bu Liu Xing (Vaccariae semen), Zao Jiao Ci (Gleditsiae spina) and Chuan Shan Jia (Manitis squama)** These substances are all able to promote the perfo- rating process of boils or carbuncles. When pus has been formed, pain becomes less severe. They can activate the Qi movement, open up the obstruction of dampness and phlegm, break up blood stagnation and thus activate perforation so as to clean up the wound. 388


Dong Gua Zi (Benincasae semen), Lu Gen (phragmitis rhizoma) and Yi Yi Ren (Coicis semen) These three herbs are sweet and cold, and can clear heat, transform dampness, discharge pus and clean up the wound. Moreover, these herbs can eliminate dampness without the side effect of injuring the body fluids. They are frequently used when perfora- tion has already taken place and the open wound is purulent. Dong Gua Zi enters the Lung, Stomach, Large Intestine and Small Intestine meridians. It has a lubricating nature and can clear heat from the Lung and eliminate accumulation from the Large Intes- tine. It is able to transform phlegm and discharge pus, and is often used for treating abscesses of the Lung and intestines, and purulent open wounds. Lu Gen enters the Lung, Stomach and Kidney meridians. It is effective in clearing heat of the Lung and transforming phlegm and damp-heat there. It is often used for treating abscesses in the Lung and purulent open wounds. Yi Yi Ren is sweet, bland and slightly cold, and enters the Spleen, Stomach and Lung meridians. Similar to Dong Gua Zi and Lu Gen, it is able to transform damp-heat and discharge pus, and is often used for treating abscesses in the Lung and the intes- tines. It is also able to discharge pus from open wounds. Bai Zhi (angelicae dahuricae radix) and Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix) Bai Zhi is an aromatic herb and Fang Feng is pungent in nature. These two herbs enter the Spleen merid- ian. Since they can eliminate dampness and trans- form pus, they are often used to clean up the purulent open wound and promote the healing process. Ku Shen (Sophorae flavescentis radix), Bai Xian Pi (Dictamni cortex), Di Fu Zi (Kochiae fructus) and Huang Bai (phellodendri cortex) These herbs are able to clear heat and dry dampness. They are particularly used when the skin lesions are very red, itchy and weeping, indicating accumula- tion of damp-heat. They are selected not only for treating boils and carbuncles, but also other skin disorders such as eczema with infections caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. They can also be applied topically to relieve itch and dry oozing. They are often used as assistants in the formula to enhance the ability of herbs that strongly reduce damp-heat, such as Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix), Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) and Huang Bai (Phellodendri cortex). Huang Qi (astragali radix), Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix) and Sheng Ma (Cimicifugae rhizoma) These herbs are used when the pus is formed but is thin and scanty, which indicates that the Qi and blood are too weak to push out the toxin and promote perforation so as to discharge the pus. If this situation lasts for a long period of time, the healing process is unable to start, and the disorder leads to a chronic process. Huang Qi is sweet and warm, and enters the Spleen and Lung meridians. As it can strengthen the Spleen-Qi and Lung-Qi, it can also strengthen the muscles and the subcutaneous region. It can promote pus formation and pushing out toxin in the condition where the body’s resistance is too weak to fight against pathogenic heat-toxin, and is unable to accelerate perforation to discharge pus. The pungent and warm Dang Gui can enhance this function of Huang Qi because it can tonify the blood, promote blood circulation and improve blood supply in the local region. At the same time, Sheng Ma may also be used as it enters the Spleen merid- ian and has an ascending nature. It can increase the strength of Huang Qi in ascending the Spleen-Qi so as to push out the toxin.

This can assist the body’s resistance in the local region. • Chuan Shan Jia and Zao Jiao Ci are the substances that are particularly used in Yong Yang syndrome. When boils and carbuncles are at the early metaphase stage, these substances can reduce swelling and soften hardness by activating the Qi and blood in the local region and breaking up the obstruction. At the late metaphase stage, these substances can accelerate perforation of boils or carbuncles and discharge pus. In this way, they promote the healing process. • Since Chuan Shan Jia and Zao Jiao Ci are used in the formula, it is neither applicable for the initial stage of boils and carbuncles nor when perforation has taken place. Wu Wei Xiao Du Yin (Five-Ingredient Decoction to Eliminate Toxin) Source: Yi Zong Jin Jian Analysis of the formula This formula can clear heat and eliminate heat- toxin, reduce swelling and promote discharge of pus. It can also invigorate blood and alleviate pain. This formula is used in the early metaphase of Yang-type boils and carbuncles due to fire-toxin and phlegm- fire in the body. This manifests as red, swollen, hot and painful skin lesions that are usually accompanied by fever, mild chills and headache. The patient has a thin, yellow or white tongue coating and a rapid and forceful pulse. In this formula: • Jin Yin Hua is used as chief to clear heat-toxin directly. Since it is a flower and has an ascending tendency in action, it can also disperse constrained heat and expel pathogenic heat. The pungent Fang Feng and Bai Zhi serve as deputies to enhance this function of Jin Yin Hua. • Dang Gui, Chi Shao Yao, Ru Xiang and Mo Yao can regulate blood and dissipate congealed blood, as well as reduce the swelling and alleviate pain. • Zhe Bei Mu, Tian Hua Fen can clear heat and dissipate hard swelling so as to reduce pain. • Chuan Shan Jia and Zao Jiao Ci can open the meridians and activate the Qi and blood in the collaterals, promote discharge of pus and break up hardness. They are used as assistants. • Chen Pi is used as assistant to regulate the Qi. Gan Cao is used as both assistant and envoy to reduce heat-toxin and harmonize the herbs in the formula. Commentary on strategies This formula demonstrates several treatment prin- ciples for the Yang type of sores and carbuncles. • Directly clear hear-toxin and expel the pathogenic factor so as to treat the cause of the disorder. Jin Yin Hua (Lonicerae flos) 20 g Di Ding (Violae herba) 15 g Tian Kui Zi (Semiaquilegiae radix) 15 g Pu Gong Ying (Taraxaci herba) 15 g Ye Ju Hua (Chrysanthemi indici flos) 15 g Analysis of the formula This formula can clear heat, relieve fire-toxin, cool the blood and reduce swelling. It is used for treating Yang-type boils and carbuncles in metaphase. The skin lesions are very red, swollen, hot and painful, and are usually accompanied by fever and chills. This formula especially treats a hard lesion which is small in size but deep-seated and very painful. The patient often has a red tongue with a yellow coating and a rapid pulse. This syndrome is cause by exogenous pathogenic heat which generates fire-toxin. Heat causes stagna- tion and produces more accumulation, which gener- ates more heat. As this cycle continues, the accumulated fire-toxin forms a very hard, deep- seated lesion. The extreme stagnation causes severe 390


pain. The presence of fever and chills reflects the fight between the body’s resistance and the patho- genic factor. In this formula: • Jin Yin Hua is used as chief. This pungent and cold herb can either clear heat-toxin or expel heat. This aromatic flower brings strong, sufficient but light and subtle actions and is crowned as the definitive herb for treating Yang-type Yong Yang syndrome in traditional Chinese medicine. • The remaining herbs are used as deputies in the formula. They can enhance the ability of Jin Yin Hua to clear heat-toxin and cool the blood. Commentary on strategies This formula contains only five herbs. They concen- trate on intensively clearing heat, removing toxin and cooling the blood. It is only used in a severe case of boils and carbuncles at the metaphase stage and for a short period of time. Tou Nong San (Discharge Pus Powder) Source: Wai Ke Zheng Zong also strengthens the Defensive-Qi in order to push out the toxin and discharge the pus. • This action is strongly enhanced by Dang Gui and Chuan Xiong, which activate the blood circulation and remove toxin in the blood. They are considered as deputies in the formula. • Chuan Shan Jia and Zao Jiao Ci are used as assistants. Their strong and sharp action of breaking up obstruction in the collaterals accelerates perforation. Commentary on strategies This formula demonstrates strategies of how to assist body resistance to push out toxin and acceler- ate perforation so as to discharge pus. It is often used in the condition of chronic and recurrent abscess. Huang Lian Jie Du Tang (Coptis Decoction to Relieve Toxicity) Source: Wai Tai Mi Yao quoted from the formula of Dr Cui Huang Qi (Astragali radix) 12 g Dang Gui (Angelicae sinensis radix) 6 g Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma) 3 g Chuan Shan Jia (Manitis squama)** 3 g Zao Jiao Ci (Gleditsiae spina) 5 g Analysis of the formula This formula can push toxin outward and discharge pus. It is used for treating an abscess that leads to a chronic process. The abscess is accompanied by localized pain, swelling, heat and production of pus but without signs of perforation. This is because the Qi is deficient and it is unable to push the toxin outward and discharge the pus. Instead, an abscess is formed under the skin. The accumulated toxin creates pain, swelling and heat. In this formula: • Huang Qi is used as chief. It can strongly tonify the Spleen-Qi and strengthen the muscles. It Huang Lian (Coptidis rhizoma) 3–9 g Huang Qin (Scutellariae radix) 6 g Huang Bai (Phellodendri cortex) 6 g Zhi Zi (Gardeniae fructus) 9 g Analysis of the formula This formula is able to drain fire, dry dampness and relieve heat-toxin in the San Jiao regions. It is used to treat metaphase Yang-type Yong Yang syndrome when there is high fever, irritability, furuncle or carbuncle with thick and greenish pus. Patients have a red tongue with a yellow coating and a rapid and forceful pulse. In this formula: • The bitter and cold Huang Lian is used as the chief to directly clear heat from the Heart. It can also clear the heat from the Stomach. • Huang Qin and Huang Bai, which are also bitter and cold, are used as deputies. They clear 391 Yong and Yang syndrome and formula compositionChapter heat from the Upper- and Lower-Jiao respectively. • Zhi Zi also serves as deputy. Since it enters the San Jiao meridian, it can drain the heat from these three regions and eliminate the heat by promoting urination. Commentary on strategies In this formula, there are only four herbs. Huang Lian focuses on clearing heat from the Heart, the organ of fire. Huang Qin and Huang Bai can clear heat in the Upper- and Lower-Jiao so as to enhance the ability of Huang Lian. Zhi Zi helps Huang Lian to drain the Heart-fire by promoting urination. These four herbs are all bitter and cold; however, as they enter different meridians and regions, they can completely remove the damp-heat from the entire body.

## 2 Yin syndrome

Analysis of the syndrome This is known as Yin-type Yong Yang syndrome. The disorders not only influence skin, subcutaneous regions and muscles, but also the joints and bones, such as a syndrome called crane’s knee wind, which manifests as a swollen and painful knee joint with muscular atrophy of the upper and lower legs. Yin- type Yong Yang syndrome exists in the condition of Yang deficiency and blood deficiency. In such condi- tions, cold, dampness and phlegm can accumulate and congeal, with stagnant blood in muscles, tendons and bones. • Since there is no obvious heat, the color of the skin is not changed. However, in a severe and chronic case, a purple color of the lesion can be observed. The color suggests chronic blood stagnation. • In the absence of heat, which has a moving and expanding nature, the Yin-type Yong Yang lesion is not as painful and swollen, and has no clear border with the surrounding tissue. • An open lesion is usually a chronic ulcer, which produces thin fluid or pus. This is because the body’s resistance is very weak and is unable to fight against the pathogenic cold and dampness. Since the Qi and blood are too weak to support growing flesh, the healing process is very slow. • The pale tongue and thready pulse indicate the deficiency of the Qi and blood of the body. (See Figure 19.2 on page 396.) Treatment principle: Expel wind, cold and dampness, promote blood circulation, tonify the Qi and blood and strengthen the Yang Main symptoms Localized swellings without sign of perforation and having no clear border with the surrounding tissue, no distinguishing color change of the skin and without warm sensation or severe pain. Secondary symptoms Generalized pain of the body, tiredness and weakness, fear of cold or having chills, scanty pus which is thin and without odor, weeping skin ulcers, an open wound with a purple or pale color, deformation of joints and atrophy of muscles. Tongue Pale with a white coating. Pulse Deep and thready. Associated disorders in western medicine Lymphatic tuberculosis, tubercular joint disease, chronic osteomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis, aseptic suppuration, cancer. 392


Structure of the formula and selection of herbs Chief: Expel wind, dampness and cold, warm the Yang and tonify the blood Cang Zhu (atractylodis rhizoma) and Ai Ye (artemisiae argyi folium) Cang Zhu is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Spleen and Stomach meridians. It is a strong aromatic herb and can reach the skin, subcutaneous region and muscles. Since it can effectively dry dampness and open up meridians, it can be used as chief in the formula to treat Yin-type Yong Yang disorder. Ai Ye is pungent, bitter and warm, and enters the Liver, Spleen and Kidney meridians. This aromatic herb can regulate Qi and blood, warm meridians, expel cold and stop pain. It can be selected as chief in the formula to treat the cause of Yin-type Yong Yang disorder. Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi cassiae ramulus), Rou Gui (Cinnamomi cassiae cortex) and Lu Jiao Jiao (Cervi cornu gelatinum)** Gui Zhi and Rou Gui are sweet and pungent. Gui Zhi enters the Heart meridian and Rou Gui enters the Kidney meridian. They warm the interior, strengthen the Yang of the Heart and Kidney respec- tively, and can expel cold. They can be used as chief in the formula to treat the cause of Yin-type Yong Yang syndrome. Lu Jiao Jiao is also sweet and warm, and enters the Kidney and Liver meridians. It can warm the Kidney-Yang and tonify the Kidney-essence and the blood. Since it is an animal product, it has a stronger and quicker action of tonifying the body than that of herbs. It is selected as chief for treating the cause and pathological development of chronic Yin-type Yong Yang syndrome where the Yang, the Kidney- essence and the blood are severely weakened. Shu Di Huang (rehmanniae radix praeparata), Dang Gui (angelicae sinensis radix) and Huang Qi (astragali radix) Shu Di Huang is sweet and slightly warm, and enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. It can tonify the blood and Kidney-essence so as to treat the cause of Yin-type Yong Yang syndrome. Having a similar function to that of Shu Di Huang, Dang Gui can also tonify the blood. In addi- tion, it can promote blood circulation and improve the blood supply in the local region owing to its pungent nature. As Dang Gui enters the Liver meridian, it can particularly tonify the Liver blood and benefit the joints and tendons. Huang Qi is sweet, and warm, and enters the Spleen and Lung meridians. This herb can strongly tonify the Spleen-Qi and ascend the Qi to the Lung. It can warm the muscles and strengthen and spread the Defensive-Qi in the subcutaneous region and skin. To treat Ying-type Yong Yang syndrome, Huang Qi can be used as chief in the formula at different stages to tonify the Lung-Qi and Spleen- Qi. In the initial period it can prevent the develop- ment of the disorder when the Qi is too weak to defend itself from pathogenic factors. It can be used at the chronic stage of Yong Yang syndrome where chronic ulcer is not healing when the Qi is too weak to push out the toxin and dampness. It can also be used in the recovery period when the body becomes very weak after a long-term illness and Qi and blood are severely consumed. Deputy: Promote Qi movement and blood circulation, tonify Qi and blood, eliminate cold and dampness and open up meridians Hong Hua (Carthami flos), Tao Ren (persicae semen) and Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong rhizoma) These herbs are pungent and warm. They enter the Liver and Heart meridians and can activate blood circulation and remove congealed blood. For treat- ing Yin-type Yong Yang syndrome, these herbs can improve blood supply in the local region, help the body resistance to clean up dampness, remove the stagnation and promote healing. They can also relieve pain and stiffness of the muscles and joints. Ji Xue Teng (Spatholobi caulis et radix) and Sang Zhi (Mori ramulus) Ji Xue Teng is bitter, slightly sweet and warm, and enters the Liver and Kidney meridians. It can tonify the blood and promote blood circulation. As it is the vine of the plant, it has the function of opening up the meridians and collaterals. It can treat stiff- ness and numbness of limbs due to blood deficiency and blood stagnation. It can be used in the formula for treating Yin-type Yong Yang syndrome, espe- cially when the muscles and joints are stiff and 393 Yong and Yang syndrome and formula compositionChapter weak due to both deficiency and stagnation of blood. Sang Zhi is bitter and neutral, and enters the Liver meridian. This herb can expel wind and damp- ness, promote urination, benefit joints and relax tendons. It can be used when the Yin-type swelling or ulcer is swollen up or weeping, and is slow to heal. Jiang Huang (Curcumae longae rhizoma), Ru Xiang (Olibanum) and Mo Yao (Myrrhae) Jiang Huang is pungent and warm, and enters the Spleen and Liver meridians. It can strongly promote the Qi movement and blood circulation, and open up the meridians so that it can relieve pain. This herb can be used in conditions where there is defor- mation of joints with pain, stiffness and muscular atrophy of the limbs. Ru Xiang is bitter, pungent and warm, and enters the Heart, Liver and Spleen meridians; Mo Yao is bitter, pungent and neutral, and enters the Liver meridian. Both can break up congealed blood, open up meridians and stop pain. Since they move quickly and can easily reach the skin, subcutaneous region and muscles, they are particularly suitable for selec- tion in treating Yin-type swelling in bones and joints where deformation, pain and stiffness present. They can also be used to treat skin ulcers and open wounds that are dark-purple in color due to poor blood supply in the local area in a chronic condition. These herbs improve blood supply, stimulate growing of new flesh and promote healing. Assistant: Tonify Qi, blood and Yin, promote healing of the ulcer Huang Qi (astragali radix), Bai Zhu (atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma) and Fu Ling (poria) These herbs are often used as assistants in the formula to strengthen the function of the Spleen so as to dry dampness and promote healing of Yin-type Yong Yang syndrome. Huang Qi also has the func- tion of stimulating the growing of new flesh and promoting healing. Sheng Ma (Cimicifugae rhizoma), Bai Zhi (angelicae dahuricae radix) and Fang Feng (Saposhnikoviae radix) Sheng Ma enters the Spleen meridian and has an ascending nature. It is often used together with Huang Qi to enhance its function of ascending the Spleen-Qi and strengthening the muscles in order to stimulate the growing of new flesh and promote healing in Yin-type Yong Yang syndrome. Bai Zhi is pungent and hot, and enters the Spleen meridian. This aromatic herb can spread its Qi quickly and can penetrate turbidity, transform dampness and discharge pus and fluid. It is often used as assistant in the formula when the Yin-type ulcer discharges thin and turbid pus and fluid, and healing is not able to take place. Fang Feng is pungent and slightly warm, and enters the Spleen meridian. It can expel wind and dampness and can be selected as assistant in the formula to treat Yin-type ulcer where fluid, pus and swelling present. Tian Men Dong (asparagi radix), Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogonis radix), Lu Gen (phragmitis rhizoma), Bai Shao Yao (paeoniae radix lactiflora) and Zhi Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix preparata) Except for Zhi Gan Cao, all these herbs are sweet and cold. They can nourish the Yin of different organs of the body. Tian Men Dong primarily enters the Kidney meridian, Bai Shao Yao the Liver merid- ian, Mai Men Dong the Heart and Stomach merid- ians, and Lu Gen the Lung meridian. If these herbs are combined with Zhi Gan Cao, the tonifying func- tion becomes stronger and stable. They can be used as helping assistants in the formula to treat Yin deficiency when Yin is not used properly but turns into accumulated fluid, dampness or pus in a chronic Yin-type ulcer. Since the pungent and warm herbs that are used in the formula can also injure the Yin of the body, the sweet and cold herbs can be used as corrective assistants to nourish the Yin and reduce the side effects of the pungent and warm herbs. Envoy: Harmonize herbs in a formula Sheng Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) Sheng Gan Cao is sweet and neutral. It can harmo- nize the herbs in the formula and also reduce toxin. This herb is used in small amounts because its sweet taste may preserve dampness. 394


Examples of classical formulas Yang He Tang (Yang-Heartening Decoction) Source: Wai Ke Quan Sheng Ji Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae radix praeparata) 30 g Lu Jiao Jiao (Cervi cornu gelatinum)** 9 g Pao Jiang (quick-fried Zingiberis rhizoma preparatum) 2 g Rou Gui (Cinnamomi cassiae cortex) 3 g Ma Huang (Ephedrae herba)* 2 g Bai Jie Zi (Sinapis albae semen) 6 g Sheng Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae radix) 3 g Analysis of the formula This formula can warm the Yang and tonify the blood, expel cold and treat Yin-type swelling or ulcer. The manifestations are localized swelling without signs of perforation, no clear border with surrounding tissues, no distinguishing color change of the skin and without warm sensation or severe pain. This formula treats Yin-type ulcer, which pro- duces fluid and thin pus and is slow to heal. The patient has a pale tongue with a white coating and a deep and thready pulse. In the formula: • The sweet and warm Shu Di Huang is used to tonify the essence and blood of the body, together with Lu Jiao Jiao to tonify the Kidney- essence and Yang, and strengthen the bones and tendons. When the blood and Yang are strong, the Qi is strengthened, the dampness can be reduced and the healing process can start. • Pao Jiang and Rou Gui are used as deputies to gently and steadily spread the Yang and warm the muscles so as to expel the dampness and cold. Pao Jiang is processed Sheng Jiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recens). After processing, the pungent nature of Sheng Jiang is reduced. As it can gently warm the Middle-Jiao and strengthen the Spleen, it can warm the muscles and activate blood circulation to improve the local condition. Rou Gui is pungent but its sweet taste reduces its pungent property. It can warm the Kidney-Yang so as to stimulate the Qi, Yang and blood in the local region. • Ma Huang is pungent and hot, and enters the Lung meridian. It can activate the Qi movement and lead the herbs entering the affected area in the superficial region of the body. Bai Jie Zi is also pungent and hot. It can expel dampness and cold, and remove phlegm, particularly in the subcutaneous region. They are used as assistants in the formula. • Sheng Gan Cao is used as envoy to harmonize the herbs in the formula and to reduce toxin. Commentary on strategies In this formula, a number of warm herbs are used. • One group contains warm and sweet Shu Di Huang, Lu Jiao Jiao and Rou Gui to tonify the Yang, essence and blood, promote the growing of flesh and promote healing. • Another group contains hot and pungent Ma Huang and Bai Jie Zi. They can activate the Yang, expel cold and eliminate dampness and phlegm. When they are used together, Yin-type localized swelling can be treated. • Moreover, this formula also suggests that using animal products may quickly and strongly tonify the Yang, blood and essence. In clinical practice, an appropriate diet with chicken, mutton and venison is suggested. 395 Yong and Yang syndrome and formula compositionChapter

In this type of combination, the first herb treats the main disorder and its dosage and function are larger and stronger than those of the second (and third) herbs. The second (and third) herbs serve to reduce the side effects and to moderate the speed and the temperature of the first. This type of combination is widely used to correct the side effects of a particular herb, to prolong the action of a herb in a steady way, to moderate the movement of Qi and to harmonize the internal organs. Moreover, some special strategies have been developed from this type of combination to attain efficient therapeutic effects. For example, upward- moving and downward-moving herbs, and dispersing and restraining herbs, may be used at the same time.
