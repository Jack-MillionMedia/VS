Judgments about which phenomena are worth studying, which kinds of data are significant, as well as which descriptions (or theories) of those phenomena are most adequate, satisfying, useful, even reliable, depend critically upon the social, linguistic, and scientific practices of those making the judgment in question.

# From Complementary and Alternative Medicine to Functional Medicine

<!-- chunk -->

## Health Care’s Emerging Evolution

The U.S. medical care system is self-validating. Biomedicine is rarely viewed as a historical and cultural byproduct, but rather is considered to be entirely factual, scientific, and universal. Furthermore, many powerful groups have an interest in the maintenance of existing approaches. Nonetheless, several problems have been identified with this medical care delivery system, including issues of access, quality of care, quality of life, technology use, and costs. The conservative, self-validating nature of biomedicine places severe limits on our ability to rethink our approach to medicine and deepen innovative and viable solutions to these problems. Alternative health care systems exist as a rich readily accessible resource for testable ideas about the practice and organization of medical and health care. By virtue of their popular nature, they seem generally to be well-received, low technology, and low-cost approaches to health problems. The potential contribution of these systems to solutions for the medical care problems we face would seem to be great.

## How Often do Women Seek CAM Therapies and why?

The dissonance between women’s talents and women’s fate bears close attention as it reflects the evolution of institutions that lack the feminine voice. The absence of balance in these institutions has perpetuated a crisis that now extends alarmingly through all levels of health—from the health of tissues, mind, and relationships, to the health of the environment upon which life itself is dependent.32

## Toward an Integrated Future of Health Care

a practice that is oriented toward prevention of illness and toward the active pursuit of an optimum state of health. It is the marriage of conventional biomedicine, other healing modalities, and traditional medical systems (Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, homeopathy, and Western herbalism, among others).40 This involves an understanding of the influences of mind, spirit, and community, as well as the body. It entails developing insight into the patient’s culture, beliefs, and lifestyle that will help the provider understand how best to trigger the necessary changes in behavior that will result in improved health. This cannot be done without a sound commitment to the doctor–patient relationship.41

Integrative Medicine is the practice of medicine that reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, healthcare professionals and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing.

—Developed and adopted by The Consortium, May 2004, edited May 2005

Natural therapies incorporating herbs tend to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of a client. Finally, there is a growing trust in herbal medicine and a belief in its ability to heal. These factors combine to form a foundation for transforming illness into wellness. How this renewal is achieved by herbal medicine is not through mimicking a medical model of pathology or substituting “natural” drugs. One alternative objective in herbal medicine is to assess and address functional disturbances rather than pathology. We look for simple causes that affect our normal function rather than suspecting disease first.

# History of Herbal Medicines for Women

Such “fathers of herbal medicine” as Dioscorides did not simply pull their therapeutic theories out of the air. His herbal was the human, largely female heritage finally recorded by a man interested enough in the subject and literate enough to be able to write it down. Ironically, the early records of women’s knowledge could be read by very few women.1

## Women, Herbs, and Health Reform: A Historical Summary

<!-- chunk -->

## Women Healers Throughout History

The experience of women healers, like the experience of women in general, is a shadow throughout the record of the world that must be sought at the interface of many disciplines: history, anthropology, botany, archaeology, and the behavioral sciences. . . . The available information on woman as healer in the western tradition spans several thousand years, stretching far back into prehistory when conditions were likely to support women as independent and honored healers. During and following those very early years, the role of women healers has been inexorably married to shifts in the ecology, the economy, and the politics in the area in which they lived.2

She personified the balance that is so critical to the advancement of woman as a health care professional; a knowledge of science, attention to the magic that is embedded in the mind, a mission of service, awareness of suffering and the gift of compassion. She also had the courage to speak, write, and teach with conviction.2

Eclectic Remedies Acting on the Reproductive Organs of Women

Adapted from Ellingwood F: New American Materia Medica.

TABLE 2-9

Additional Female Reproductive Remedies Used by the Eclectics

∗ The description of the physical symptoms by which Hildegard’s visions were accompanied is remarkably consistent with the characteristics of migraine headaches, including the prodromal or “aural” phase, through to the blinding lights and pain, and finally with the euphoric postmigraine phase. Thus she may have been a lifelong sufferer of migraine headaches.

∗ Many of the medical programs, for example, Johns Hopkins University and Harvard Medical College, are among those medical colleges that continue to thrive today.

† Currently, the number of female and male medical students is approximately equal, with there often being slightly more female students than male entering medical school classes; however, specialties such as surgery are more common to men than women.

## The Evidence Base for Botanical Medicine

<!-- chunk -->

## What is Evidence-Based Medicine?

Decisions in medicine, irrespective of how much objective evidence we gather, always involves the weighing of probabilities . . . To suggest that randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses and clinical practice guidelines will eliminate the need for clinical judgment is to misrepresent the realities of clinical medicine (both CAM [complementary and alternative medicine] and conventional). If medicine could be purely evidence-based (which is highly debatable both practically and financially), then in theory medical care . . . could essentially be administered by computers and computer algorithms.2

The practice of evidence-based medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research. By individual clinical expertise we mean the proficiency and judgment that individual clinicians acquire through clinical experience and clinical practice. Increased expertise is reflected in many ways, but especially in more effective and efficient diagnosis and in the more thoughtful identification and compassionate use of individual patients’ predicaments, rights, and preferences in making clinical decisions about their care. By best available clinical evidence we mean clinically relevant research, often from the basic sciences of medicine, but especially from patient centered clinical research . . . Without clinical expertise, practice risks becoming tyrannized by evidence, for even excellent external evidence may be inapplicable to or inappropriate for an individual patient. Without current best evidence, practice risks becoming rapidly out of date, to the detriment of patients . . . External clinical evidence can inform, but can never replace, individual clinical expertise, and it is this expertise that decides whether the external evidence applies to the individual patient at all and, if so, how it should be integrated into a clinical decision.7

## Supporting Evidence for Botanicals Discussed In this Text

### Scientific Evidence

<!-- chunk -->

#### Problems with Conventional Research Methodologies for Botanical Therapies

Experience has shown that there are real benefits in the long-term use of whole medicinal plants and their extracts, since the constituents in them work in conjunction with each other. However, there is very little research on whole plants because the drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures of natural chemicals, the collective function of which is uncertain. To isolate each active ingredient from each herb would be immensely time-consuming at unsupportable cost, and is almost impossible in the case of preparations.11

### Historical and Traditional Evidence

Traditional use occurs in the context of a traditional medicine system. This healing system may have evolved over thousands of years and be part of a great culture, or it may be part of a smaller or more primitive system. The important point is that traditional use is the refined knowledge of many generations, carefully evaluated and re-evaluated by many practitioners of the craft. It is not just the anecdotal accounts of a few practitioners.26

## Botanical Medicine Dosing

∗ Note that the author is philosophically opposed to the mistreatment of animals for the benefit of science, strongly favoring instead the development of harmless animal studies and ethical human study models. However, given the value of certain information derived from animal studies, for example, teratogenicity and mutagenicity studies, animal studies are regrettably included.

∗ In the first edition of this book I used the word “compliance” here, where it is now changed to commitment. Compliance is a word that I have eliminated from my own doctor–patient lexicon. This shift is more than semantic; it reflects a change in the patient–doctor relationship to one of mutual understanding and practitioner efficacy in determining and working with the patient to overcome obstacles to what is ideally a commitment to adhering to a protocol, compared with the outdated model in which a patient “complies” with the “doctor’s orders.” It is also an evolution beyond “adherence” and “concordance,” which the reader can learn more about here: Aronson JK: Compliance, concordance, adherence, Br J Clin Pharmacol 63(4):383–384, 2007.

## Addressing Ethical Considerations

<!-- chunk -->

## Guidelines

If evidence supports both safety and efficacy, the physician should recommend the therapy but continue to monitor the patients conventionally. If evidence supports safety but is inconclusive about efficacy, the treatment should be tolerated and monitored for effectiveness. If evidence supports efficacy but is inconclusive about safety, the therapy still could be tolerated and monitored closely for safety. Finally, therapies for which evidence indicates either serious risk or inefficacy obviously should be avoided and patients actively discouraged from pursuing such a course of treatment.64

## Stress, Adaptation, The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis, and Women’s Health

Viewed from the perspective of the evolution of the animal kingdom, sustained psychological stress is a recent invention, mostly limited to humans and other social primates.

Robert Sapolsky, author, Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers

<!-- chunk -->

## Stress, Health, and Disease: The Physiology and Pathophysiology of Stress and the Stress Response

Life exists by maintaining a complex dynamic equilibrium, or homeostasis, that is constantly challenged by intrinsic or extrinsic adverse forces or stressors. Stress is, thus, defined as a state of threatened homeostasis, which is reestablished by a complex repertoire of physiologic and behavioral adaptive responses of the organism. The adaptive responses may be inadequate for the reestablishment of homeostasis or excessive and prolonged; in either case a healthy steady state is not attained, and pathology may ensue.58

The terms, “allostasis” and “allostatic overload,” allow for a more accurate definition of the overused word “stress” and provide a view of how the essential protective and adaptive effects of physiological mediators that maintain homeostasis—the body’s optimal set points for important factors such as blood pressure, fluid balance, pH, glucose levels, oxygen levels, temperature, etc.—are also involved in the cumulative effects of daily life when they are mismanaged or overused. When mediators of allostasis, like cortisol and adrenaline, are released in response to stressors or to lifestyle factors such as diet, sleep, and exercise, they promote adaptation and are generally beneficial. However, when these mediators are not turned off when the stress is over, or when they are not turned on adequately during stress, or when they are overused by many stressors, there are cumulative changes that lead to a wear-and-tear, called “allostatic load or overload,” on the body and brain. The concept of allostasis refers to the network of interacting mediators by which stability, that is, homeostasis, is achieved through change. There are primary mediators of allostasis, such as, but not confined to, hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, catecholamines, and cytokines. These mediators interact with each other to create a network of reciprocal effects.53

Adaptogens reduce the cost of homeostasis/allostasis to the organism, preventing or delaying damaging effects caused by stress and aging. By helping to maintain a state of balance throughout the body, adaptogens hold the key to vitality.

## Low Libido and Sexual Dysfunction

Sexual relationships are some of the most important social and biological relationships in human life. Next to thirst, hunger and sleep, the sexual urge is the most powerful biological drive. This physiological instinct, so essential to the survival of the species, is one of the mainsprings of human motivation, and its fulfillment or disappointment is closely related to happiness or misery. Normal sexual function involves the successful integration of biological, psychological, and interpersonal influences.413

# Menstrual Wellness and Menstrual Problems

The scientific study of menstruation has been hampered by the overpowering influence of traditions and social and cultural beliefs. We have all, men and women, been conditioned to view menstruation in a negative way. Perhaps, it is time to look at menstruation from another point of view. How many fine novels have been finished in a burst of creativity in the premenstrual period? How many great ideas have been born premenstrually?

### Environmental Exposures

State-of-the art testing of tampons and tampon materials that can detect even trace amounts of dioxin has shown that dioxin levels are at or below the detectable limit. FDA’s risk assessment indicates that this exposure is many times less than normally present in the body from other environmental sources, so small that any risk of adverse health effects is considered negligible. A part per trillion is about the same as one teaspoon in a lake fifteen feet deep and a mile square. No risk to health would be expected from these trace amounts.33

Although scientists have recognized an association between TSS and tampon use, the exact connection remains unclear. Research conducted by the CDC suggested that use of some high absorbency tampons increased the risk of TSS in menstruating women. A few specific tampon designs and high absorbency tampon materials were also found to have some association with increased risk of TSS. These products and materials are no longer used in tampons sold in the United States. Tampons made with rayon do not appear to have a higher risk of TSS than cotton tampons of similar absorbency.33

## Premenstrual Symptoms, Premenstrual Syndrome, and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder

Is PMS due to an individual pathologic problem or is it due to cultural beliefs, beliefs that lead to the menstrual cycle being associated with a variety of negative reactions, or a combination of both? What if our societies and cultures had celebrated menstruation as a time of pleasure (and even public joy) rather than something private (to be hidden) and negative? Would we have PMS today? The answer may lie in the unravelling of the role of our shared beliefs about menstruation in society, rather than the functioning of those beliefs in individuals.1

## Herpes


TABLE 12-6

Symptoms of Herpes According to Type of Outbreak

• This is the initial outbreak after infection; if patients do not notice vesicles, a primary outbreak may be dismissed as “flu.”

• Characterized by systemic infection, commonly with fever and aching

• May last 2-3 weeks

• Frequently accompanied by lymphadenopathy

• Appearance of vesicle clusters on an erythematous base that develop into ulcers that crust over and heal

• Severe primary outbreak can cause serious infection, including encephalitis, and may require hospitalization

• Immunocompromised patients may develop especially severe symptoms

• Symptoms of tingling and itching or perineal aching may precede the appearance of vesicles and last 1-3 days. Note that virus is already present on the skin during this stage.

• Vesicles appear and last up to 10 days until full healing.

• Asymptomatic with viral shedding

# Pregnancy and Botanical Medicine Use and Safety

So 8 days late, huh, you must be getting a little uncomfortable? … If you’re anxious there are a few ways to help things along … actually there are things you can do … just some home remedies.… I’ve found that some of them are very effective … there’s an herbal tea you can drink.…

Obstetrician in Friends, The One Where Rachel Is Late

The charge that herbal medications are not well tested in pregnancy is true, but it is just as true that conventional medications are not well tested in pregnancy. The medication-related embryopathies with which we are familiar are nearly all associated with conventional prescription drugs: thalidomide, anticonvulsants, ACE inhibitors, misoprostol, lithium, and isotretinoin. The most common embryopathy affecting humans is fetal alcohol syndrome, which is not associated with an herbal medication. This observation does not mean that herbal medications are safe, but only underscores the need to be well informed when prescribing in pregnancy. Let’s recommend medications in pregnancy that have been adequately studied, without assuming that all conventional medications are on one side of a divide and all herbal medications are on the other side.1

Note: For drugs in B1, B2, or B3 categories, human data are lacking or inadequate and subcategorization is therefore based on available animal data. The allocation of a B category does NOT imply greater safety than the C category. Drugs in category D are NOT absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy (e.g., anticonvulsants). Moreover, in some cases the D category has been assigned on the basis of suspicion.

Medications for treating GERD are not routinely or rigorously tested in randomized, controlled trials in pregnant women because of ethical and medicolegal concerns. Most recommendations arise from case reports and cohort studies by physicians, pharmaceutical companies, or the FDA. Voluntary reporting by the manufacturers suffers from an unknown duration of follow up, absence of appropriate controls, and possible reporting bias.3

## Pain in Labor

Knowledge is the most powerful thing as far as pain.77

The nonpharmacologic approach to pain includes a wide variety of techniques to address not only the physical sensations of pain but also to prevent suffering by enhancing the psycho emotional and spiritual components of care. Pain is perceived as a side effect of a normal process, not a sign of damage, injury, or abnormality. Rather than making the pain disappear, the midwife and other caregivers assist the woman to cope with it, build her self-confidence, and maintain a sense of mastery and well-being.82

# The Postpartum

<!-- chunk -->

## Postpartum Care of the Mother

On Crete, right after a baby is born, it is given chamomile tea. The mother’s breasts and nipples are washed with chamomile tea before she nurses. When visitors come to the hospital to see the new baby, the first question they ask is “has she/he drunk the chamomile yet?” The tea is considered the perfect thing for both mother and child after the excitement of labor. Once the baby has had its first chamomile, it is a huge relief to everyone because it is a sign that they are healthy and now part of the clan. In the hospital near the village I live in part of the year, there is a special room for brewing chamomile for the new mothers and babies.1

Patricia Kyritsi Howell, Herbalist

## What is the Postpartum?

<!-- chunk -->

## Redefining Postpartum in a Woman-Centered Way

The main focus of postnatal care has traditionally been that of ensuring the physical recovery of the mother from the effects of pregnancy and labor and establishing infant feeding patterns … The emotional and psychological needs of mothers have not received much attention until recently and there has been an assumption that these needs will automatically be met if the first two aspects of care are satisfied. The organization of postnatal care has accordingly been based upon this premise.4

## Postpartum Depression

Postpartum depression is a crippling mood disorder, historically neglected in health care, leaving mothers to suffer in fear, confusion, and silence. Undiagnosed it can adversely affect the mother–infant relationship and lead to long-term emotional problems for the child. I have described it as ‘a thief that steals motherhood.’16

Cheryl Tatano Beck

<!-- chunk -->

## Etiology and Risk Factors for Ppd

<!-- chunk -->

## Prevention of Postpartum Depression


Any drug that affects infant growth, in or ex utero, should be regarded with suspicion and should not be written up as a recommendable solution for postpartum depression, comparable with innocuous and effective methods such as psychotherapy, nurse home visits, and group therapy. The available evidence indicates that even when infant serum levels are low or undetectable, side effects may occur. There is an ample body of evidence that SSRIs taken during pregnancy cause neonates to suffer withdrawal symptoms, which all by itself is a matter for concern. Postpartum depression is an issue that should not be taken lightly, but, as history shows, the short-term benefits of drugs that have not been sufficiently studied do not weigh up against the tragic long-term disasters they might provoke.49

## Postpartum Perineal Healing

Episiotomy is one of the most commonly performed procedures in obstetrics. In 2000 approximately 33% of women giving birth vaginally had an episiotomy. Historically, the purpose of this procedure was to facilitate completion of the second stage of labor to improve both maternal and neonatal outcomes. Maternal benefits were thought to include a reduced risk of perineal trauma, subsequent pelvic floor dysfunction and prolapse, urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and sexual dysfunction. Potential benefits to the fetus were thought to include a shortened second stage of labor resulting from more rapid spontaneous delivery or from instrumented vaginal delivery. Despite limited data, this procedure became virtually routine resulting in an underestimation of the potential adverse consequences of episiotomy, including extension to a third- or fourth-degree tear, anal sphincter dysfunction, and dyspareunia.87

The Empowered Years: Menopausal Health


23. Menopausal Health

# Menopausal Health

<!-- chunk -->

## Perimenopause and Menopause: An Overview

In other cultures women do not report severe symptoms of menopause and menopause is not managed medically. Relying solely on a medical perspective (or disease model) of menopause does not account for the impact of culture and other social influences and may ignore the variety of patient perspectives on the menopausal transition.1

<!-- chunk -->

## What is Menopause?

Rather than view menopause as the end of a woman’s life, it is important to remember that life expectancies in the developed countries around 80 give women an estimated equal number of years in the menopausal chapter of their lives as in the 25–35 years of fertility they experience. This positive emphasis on a woman’s post-fertile years is celebrated by progressive women’s health advocates. Terms such as the perimenopausal decline, past the prime of life, crone, and post-fertile do not address the new chapters of a woman’s life that begin when her child-conceiving capacities have altered. The impact of patient-directed advertising and marketing that impedes the redefining of mid-life for women is disheartening. The implicit reference to women primarily as childbearers, mothers, and caretakers for upbringing focuses away from the other roles women dream of in their lives: purposes, spiritual journeys, and ambitions on nonreproductive levels that women also embody.

## Reframing Menopause: The Wise Woman Perspective

The joy of menopause is the world’s best-kept secret. Like venturing through the gateway to enter an ancient temple, in order to claim that joy a woman must be willing to pass beyond the monsters who guard its gate…as thousands of women from all cultures throughout history have whispered to each other, it is the most exciting passage a woman ever makes.18

[Menopause] is not a natural condition; it is an endocrine disorder and should be treated medically with the same seriousness we treat other endocrine disorders, such as diabetes or thyroid disease.19

Theresa L. Crenshaw

… the conventional view of menopause as a scary transition heralding ‘the beginning of the end’ couldn’t be farther from the truth.21

• No known major side effects and no reported herb–drug interactions


• Excess intake may lead to hyperthyroidism

• May contain concentrated heavy metals found in the ocean

• High sodium content may make use inadvisable for patients with heart or renal failure

• Not for medicinal use during pregnancy and lactation (modest food use acceptable) because iodides can cross the placenta and enter into breast milk


• Gastric irritation and vomiting at high doses

• Possible reduction in the efficacy of antacids, H2-receptor antagonists, PPIs, and sucralfate if taken with blessed thistle

• Possible decrease in platelet aggregation and increase in bleeding time

• Tannins in the herb theoretically increase risk of gastric and esophageal cancer, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity if taken chronically


• No toxic effects documented from topical use; however, all use during pregnancy is contraindicated because of possible absorption and toxicity to the fetus

• Topically, the herb has been shown to be nonirritant and nonallergenic


• Overdose can cause symptoms similar to nicotine poisoning

• Maternal use during pregnancy has been associated with case reports of neonatal MI, cerebral ischemia, increased meconium, and fetal tachycardia. Should be used only by skilled midwives and obstetric care providers


• The safety of internal consumption is in question because isolated components have been reported to be toxic in humans and livestock

• Use of fresh plant has been reported to cause nausea and vomiting

• Volatile oils in the plant have been reported to cause irritation of the throat and eyes, as well as headache


• Small amounts of verbalin stimulated the uterus in a frog model; the herb is contraindicated in pregnancy because of possible abortifacient/oxytocic activity


• Possible thyroid suppression

• Do not give concurrently with thyroid medications


• Flatulence, nausea, vomiting

• Sedation

• Cases of hepatotoxicity have occurred after consumption of TCM formulae containing bupleurum; however, the formulae also contained other herbs and no causality has been established with this herb

• KSw/C/LD

• P—first trimester

• Caution advised in diabetic patients because of possible hypoglycemic effects of the herb

• Three case reports of allergic dermatitis associated with topical use

• Limited clinical evidence in HIV patients suggested possible additive effects with estrogens

• In vivo uterine stimulant activity has been reported; this has not been observed clinically; however, medicinal use of burdock should be avoided during the first trimester


• PAs found in this herb are known to be hepatotoxic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic

• PA-free products used for short duration (up to 4 months) and in the recommended dosage are likely safe; however, there are limited safety data on this herb. As product quality may vary, it is possible that toxic amounts of PAs may be present in poorly processed products

• Internal use: LSw/C/LD

• Topical use: KSw/C

• P—internal use

• Allergic sensitivity has been reported, including cross-sensitivity in patients with latex allergy

• Because calendula was traditionally used to affect the menstrual cycle, and in vitro uterotonic activity has been reported, internal consumption during pregnancy is not recommended

• May have spermatocide activity


• Do not use caraway oil internally


• Castor is a highly toxic plant and should not be taken internally other than in commercially prepared oil extract products

• Castor is contraindicated in pregnancy other than to stimulate labor

• Causes diarrhea


• P/L—internal use

• Contraindicated with concurrent administration of immunosuppressive medications, passive vaccines, immunoglobulin therapy, cryoprecipitates, and fresh plasma products

• It should not be taken by patients who have recently received or are awaiting organ or bone marrow transplantation

• Should not be taken by women trying to conceive—it is traditionally used as a contraceptive agent


• Internal consumption of celandine has been associated with a total of 47 case reports of adverse events to the WHO Uppsala Monitoring Center up to the July 2005, including several case reports of hepatotoxicity including symptoms such as hepatitis, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes. In 2003, the Australian government’s Therapeutic Goods Administration recommended that C. majus preparations intended for oral intake be labeled with a warning to seek the advice of a health care professional before using if there is a history of liver disease and to discontinue use if symptoms of liver disease occur

• Nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, discolored stool, and vomiting may result from use


• Skin rash occasionally with topical application

• While chamomile is commonly cited as a contraindicated herb during pregnancy, this is based on a study conducted in 1979 that found teratogenic effects using a concentrated extract of α-bisoprolol at high doses. No teratogenic effects were seen at lower doses and the dose of the oil constituent required to cause teratogenicity is far greater than it would ever be possible for someone drinking the tea to ever approximate


• KSwC/LD


• Adverse effects include nausea, headache, acne, and GI symptoms

• According to a German postmarket surveillance study of 1634 women taking the herb, a total of 23 women became pregnant while using chaste tree; 19 of the 23 reported having been previously unsuccessful in trying to conceive

• Theoretical inhibition of breast milk, though traditionally used to increase breast milk supply

• May exacerbate depression in some women with progesterone deficiency or PMS-D

• Possible interference with dopaminergic drugs

• Not for use without medical supervision

• Not to be used by patients with bleeding/clotting disorders

• Do not combine with BP, cardiac, peptic ulcer, or antiplatelet medications


• P/L—internal or extended topical

• Comfrey products are safe for topical application. While there is some transdermal absorption of PAs, which can be hepatotoxic when taken internally, the amount absorbed when used on unbroken skin is likely to be insignificant, and even on broken skin, minimal. Nonetheless, regular use on broken skin is not recommended. The German Commission E recommends not exceeding 1000 μg/day of PAs transdermally, and not using topical applications of comfrey products for longer than 4 to 6 weeks total per year


• See Barberry

• As with other berberine-containing herbs (e.g., barberry, goldenseal), internal use is generally not recommended during pregnancy; however, topical use in suppositories appears to be safe


• An isolated crystalline component from corn silk has been shown to have hypotensive and uterine-stimulating activity in rabbits, likely because of cholinergic effects. Although the herb is not typically contraindicated during pregnancy, it is prudent to be cautious given this observation.


• Possible additive effects with antiarrhythmic medications

• Oral administration of 1 to 50 mg/kg of gindarin to rats from the first to the second day of gestation led to significant embryotoxicity

• P/LD

• Because of the known abortifacient activity of this herb, it is contraindicated during pregnancy


• Long history of traditional use for threatened miscarriage, uterine irritability, and painful labor suggests possible safety during pregnancy


• In clinical trials, there is a high dropout rate of cranberry juice users because of taste

• Contrary to some claims, it is unlikely that regular consumption of cranberry juice will lead to the development of uric acid or oxalate stones; however, individuals who tend to form such stones may wish to avoid regular consumption and/or consumption of large amounts of cranberry juice

• There are several reports of interaction with warfarin

• There are no known contraindications to the use of cranberry juice during pregnancy and lactation


• Because of high tannin content, use cautiously in inflammatory and ulcerative GI conditions


• Mild stimulating effects may possibly lead to insomnia

• Because of possible cyanogenetic constituents, use during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended


• Contraindicated in bile duct and intestinal obstructions

• Diuresis is not appropriate during pregnancy; use of dandelion leaf as a food is acceptable

• Dandelion leaf should be treated as a prescription diuretic in terms of precautions with other medications; dandelion is K+ rich


• Contraindicated for patients with gallbladder obstruction and obstructive ileus

• No known contraindications during pregnancy when used in amounts comparable to food use


• Increased bleeding

• Not to be taken with blood-thinning medications

• In TCM, dong quai is always combined with other herbs

• GI symptoms, including nausea, laxative effects, vomiting, and bloating may occur

• Photosensitivity with severe reactions may occur because of furocoumarin, psoralen, and bergapten contents

• Dong quai may have hypotensive action; a limited body of research suggests possible interference with antiarrhythmic medications, β-blockers, and calcium channel blockers

• Avoid during pregnancy unless under the care of a qualified TCM practitioner

• Two case reports of rash in breastfeeding infants of mothers who took dong quai, including reappearance with discontinuation and retrial


• Transitory tingling of the tongue is a normal effect of this herb

• Possible allergy when flowering tops are given to allergic patients; use of root product only usually prevents allergy

• Should not be taken by transplant patients or patients taking immunomodulatory medications

• There is no clear evidence from either basic science or human reports that echinacea causes significant hepatotoxicity

• Oral intake of echinacea is considered safe during pregnancy based on preliminary studies


• Insomnia has been rarely observed in clinical studies

• Some sources recommend a limitation on the duration of use from 1 to 3 months; however, this is based on the need to reevaluate for possible health conditions rather than risks associated with the herb

• Contrary to some reports, there does not appear to be a significant need for concern over the development of hypertension from the use of eleuthero

• Eleuthero has been known to be adulterated with Periploca sepium, a plant that contains cardioactive glycosides and was associated with a case of fetal androgenization (“hairy baby syndrome”) in a woman who unknowingly consumed an adulterated product during pregnancy

• KSw/C/LD

• Contraindicated in patients with seizure disorders; use of the oil may trigger undiagnosed temporal lobe epilepsy, particularly in schizophrenic patients, or those taking epileptogenic medications

• Possible GI upset

• No teratogenicity has been demonstrated during pregnancy; however, data are limited. Because linoleic and gamalenic acids are components of breast milk, it seems safe for breastfeeding mothers to consume EPO; however, data are limited and concerns have been raised whether maternal consumption would cause excess consumption in the breastfeeding infant


• Although this herb has traditionally been used to improve fertility, there are no safety data on intake during pregnancy. The herb possesses uterotonic activity. Therefore the herb should be discontinued when pregnancy has been achieved and care taken in women with a prior history of first-trimester miscarriage

• This plant is considered endangered and therefore should only be used from cultivated sources


• EO not for internal use

• Not for medicinal use during pregnancy because of possible estrogenic effects

• Caution is recommended in women with a history or risk of ER-positive cancer

• Sw/C


• Caution in diabetics because of hypoglycemic effects

• Caution in patients taking hypokalemic agents, cardiac glycoside medications, or with cardiac disease because of risk of hypokalemia from consumption

• Theoretical risk of increased bleeding; caution advised in patients taking anticoagulants

• Possible estrogenic activity requires caution when combined with estrogenic medications and oral contraceptives

• Possible reduction in serum thyroid hormone concentrations; therefore caution is required for patients with hypothyroidism

• Not for medicinal use during pregnancy because of possible hypoglycemic and hypothyroid effects

• Possible potentiation of MAOIs in patients taking these medications

• If a nursing mother consumes a large amount, the baby’s urine may have a maple syrup–like odor that could be confused with maple syrup urine disease

• Possible interference with iron absorption with long-term use


• Contact dermatitis (including oral ulcers/sore mouth) from fresh leaves

• Reported side effects include GI complaints, tingling sensation on the tongue, headache, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence, dizziness, and skin rash

• No adverse effects seen in rats and pigs receiving 100 to 150 times the human dose daily

• Because of reported abortifacient activity, feverfew is contraindicated during pregnancy. It has been reported to induce uterine contractions in full-term pregnant women


• Avoid in patients with bleeding disorders and those on anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapies

• May interfere with absorption of medications; take 2 hours apart from other medications

• Use cautiously in patients with irritable bowel disorders, chronic diarrhea, or diverticulitis

• Caution advised in patients with diabetes because of case series showing elevated glucose levels in patients taking omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in flax seeds

• Drink plenty of water when taking soaked or ground flax seed to prevent constipation and bowel obstruction

• Has uncertain effects on triglyceride levels (may raise or lower); avoid in patients with hypertriglyceridemia

• Immature flax seeds are neurotoxic and should not be taken. Symptoms of toxicity include ataxia, tachycardia, and weakness

• Possible interactions with NSAIDs, mood stabilizers, oral hypoglycemic agents (including insulin), antihyperlipidemic agents, oral contraceptives, HRT, and antihypertensive drugs

• Animal studies show possible harmful effects when taken during pregnancy and lactation, including increased levels of LH and testosterone, increased epididymal weight, and decreased prostate weight in males; altered mammary structure, delayed or early onset puberty depending on dose, and reduced or lengthened number of estrous cycles in females exposed to flax seeds in utero


• Direct or prolonged exposure to skin can lead to irritation and ulceration

• GI upset when taken raw internally; also garlic odor from ingesting fresh garlic

• Possible interactions with anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications

• Possible increased bleeding time; therefore discontinuation 2 weeks prior to surgery is recommended

• In vitro increase in uterine activity; therefore caution when taking medicinally in pregnancy; no expected adverse effects when taken as a food in pregnancy

• Altered odor of breast milk in breastfeeding mothers consuming garlic has led to alterations in infant feeding in a blinded, placebo-controlled study. Amniotic fluid odor is also influenced by maternal garlic consumption

• There are no known adverse clinical or experimental effects of garlic on pregnancy or lactation


• Contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation because of mutagenic effects seen on Ames test


• May increase absorption of other medications

• Contraindicated in patients with gallstones

• Caution in patients with peptic ulcer disease or GERD

• Contraindicated in patients with bleeding disorders, on medications for bleeding disorders, and before and after surgery

• During pregnancy dose should not exceed 1 g/day because of possible abortifacient activity; doses up to this amount considered safe for the treatment of NVP


• Possible GI upset, headache, dizziness

• Case reports of spontaneous bleeding have led to a high level of caution pre- and post-surgery and in patients on antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapies


• Generally well tolerated in most clinical trials

• Caution advised in diabetic patients because of possible hypoglycemic effects

• May cause or exacerbate hypertension, insomnia, anxiety, palpitations, and tachycardia in some individuals. Patients with any of these as pre-existing conditions should avoid ginseng use unless under the supervision of a qualified TCM practitioner

• Limited case reports of epistaxis, increased vaginal bleeding, and a single report of reduced effectiveness of warfarin. Based on these reports, caution has been advised for patients on antiplatelet/anticoagulant medications and pre- and post-surgically

• Although no adverse effects, mutagenicity, or teratogenicity have been reported, and the herb is traditionally used during pregnancy and for postpartum convalescence, it is generally recommended that ginseng only be used under the supervision of a qualified health professional during pregnancy


• Considered well tolerated, with no known contraindications or major adverse effects

• Individuals may experience nonspecific GI complaints when taking globe artichoke

• Likely safe when taken for short periods

• Because of lack of toxicity data, excessive use should be avoided in pregnancy and lactation

• P/LD

• Goat’s rue has caused poisoning and death in sheep; however, there is no evidence of human poisoning by goat’s rue reported in the literature. Oral administration of goat’s rue to pregnant ewes at various stages of gestation produced no noticeable damage in the offspring

• Caution is advised in diabetic patients because goat’s rue may enhance the hypoglycemic effects of hypoglycemic drugs; however, there are no documented cases of this effect

• Goat’s rue taken with mineral salts increased milk production in lactating women in a controlled trial from 1968; however, no safety or toxicity studies have been done on use during lactation


• Possible sensitivity in patients allergic to plants in the Compo sitae family, and specifically to goldenrod; contact dermatitis


• There is limited research on goldenseal herb; however, much is known about isolated constituents from the herb, most notably, berberine and hydrastine

• Although one cannot extrapolate the effects of isolated constituents to the whole plant, cautions are suggested when using this herb regularly or in high doses

• Consumption of isolated berberine alkaloids in goldenseal is toxic

• High doses of hydrastine have caused elevated blood pressure after intravenous administration in animal studies; lower doses of berberine and hydrastine have hypotensive effects. Caution is suggested in use with hypertensive patients, and those on antihypertensive medications

• No reported clinical herb–drug interactions

• In vitro berberine has been reported to decrease the anticoagulant effects of heparin in dog and human blood, and although no sedative activity has been reported, increased barbiturate sleeping time has been reported

• Berberine is reported to increase coronary blood flow, and at high doses is reported to inhibit cardiac muscle activity

• Caution is advised in patients with cardiac arrhythmias

• Antihistamine and antimuscarine activity has been reported

• The use of goldenseal during pregnancy is controversial. Typically contraindicated, this is based on limited reports of increased activity of the in vitro increase of uterine stimulant activity on guinea pig and rat uterine tissue from the isolated fraction canadine. However, the total alkaloid fraction of goldenseal has demonstrated anticonvulsant activity in vitro. The issue of contraindication in pregnancy appears to have less to do with the effects of the herb as a uterine tonic and more to do with the potential toxicity of long-term intake of the alkaloids. At this time, goldenseal is not recommended for regular or high-dose intake during pregnancy; however, based on current literature, it is premature to entirely contraindicate its use during pregnancy and lactation

• This herb is considered ecologically endangered; therefore only products made from cultivated herb should be used


• Well tolerated when taken for up to 6 to 12 months for chronic insufficiency and wound healing

• Numerous case reports of allergic reactions and contact dermatitis

• Limited reports of adverse effects of gastric irritation and nausea have been reported

• Conflicting reports state both possible lipid-lowering and lipid-elevating effects with this herb

• Animal studies suggest possible sedating effects

• Caution in diabetics based on animal evidence of possible ability to raise blood glucose

• Safety unknown during pregnancy and lactation


• Diuresis

• More than 500 mg/day of caffeine is associated with insomnia, palpitations, anxiety, agitation, delirium, psychosis, and detrusor muscle instability. Withdrawal commonly accompanies cessation of chronic use

• Preliminary research suggests a possible reduction in estrogen associated with regular green tea consumption

• Regular consumption of high tannin beverages may interfere with iron absorption

• Numerous interactions with caffeine and medications are known; the effects of green tea as a source of herb–drug interactions has not been well studied

• Regular caffeine consumption is best avoided in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, because caffeine crosses the placenta. Consumption of more than 400 mg/day of caffeine during pregnancy has been associated with increased rates of SIDS; more than 1100 mg/day has been associated with congenital birth defects

• Caffeine is readily transferred into breast milk and may lead to sleep disturbances in infants. Infants of breastfeeding mothers consuming more than 500 mg caffeine/day have been reported to have tremors and cardiac dysrhythmias

• Green tea extracts and other concentrated green tea products are not recommended and are not considered safe during pregnancy and lactation


• Considered safe when used in recommended doses for up to 6 months

• Reversible inhibition of platelet aggregation; possible interference with anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications; discontinue 1 week prior to surgery

• Mild thyroid stimulation; not recommended in patients with thyroid disorders

• Possible hypersensitivity reactions

• May increase bioavailability of propranolol (β-blocker) and decrease the bioavailability of diltiazem (calcium channel blocker)

• Adverse effects include GI upset and headache

• Not recommended during pregnancy because of possible abortive effects; not recommended during lactation


• No known adverse effects or herb–drug interactions have been associated with this herb other than the possible glucose-lowering effects and possible potentiation of hypoglycemic agents and antihyperlipidemic effects and possible potentiation of lipid-lowering drugs


• Hawthorn is exceptionally well tolerated and safe as recommended

• Theoretical concerns exist regarding potentiation of the actions of other cardiovascular medications; however, this has not been demonstrated clinically, including in a trial comparing digoxin alone compared with digoxin plus hawthorn. Potentiation of inotropic effects without toxicity was observed in guinea pig hearts. Use of the herb concurrently with cardiac glycosides has been suggested as a means to lower cardiac glycoside dose and toxicity

• Theoretical potentiation of effect on medications with coronary dilatory effects was seen in animal studies

• Rare reported side effects include nausea, headache, dizziness, and palpitations

• Unspecified hawthorn extracts have demonstrated reduction in uterine tissue tone and motility in vitro. The clinical significance of this is unknown in pregnancy


• May exacerbate depression in some patients. Do not use concurrently with antidepressant medications or in patients with moderate to severe depression

• High doses may be significantly sedating

• Direct estrogenic effects of phytoestrogens have been observed in vitro. Caution is advised in patients with ER–positive cancer and those using hormonal contraception or HRT

• Hops may increase serum glucose levels; therefore caution is advised in diabetic patients

• Not for use during pregnancy

• LS

• Possible GI irritation

• No documented herb–drug interactions

• Improperly prepared products may contain aescin, which has theoretical additive effects with anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs

• Limited data suggest no adverse reactions or toxicity during pregnancy and possible safety for the treatment of venous insufficiency and varicosities


• Horsetail is generally very well tolerated with few reports of adverse effects

• Theoretical herb–drug interactions include:

—Thiamine depletion because of thiaminase in the herb

—Adverse effects with cardiac glycosides, diuretics, steroids, and laxatives because of potassium-depleting effects of horsetail

• The nicotine content in horsetail is theoretically suggested to cause side effects associated with nicotine use and has theoretically suggested ability to have additive effects with other CNS stimulants

• Not for internal use during pregnancy


• Rotenone, a constituent in Jamaican dogwood, is a known toxin. Symptoms of overdose may include numbness, tremors, salivation, and sweating. In vivo oral doses of up to 1.5 mg/kg have not been shown to be toxic in animal studies

• Caution is advised in patients with hypotension, cardiac insufficiency, and bradycardia

• Jamaican dogwood has been reported to have a potent depressant effect on the uterus in vivo and in vitro, possibly equivalent to papaverine

• Use is generally not recommended in pregnancy because of limited safety data; however, cautious use under the supervision of a qualified practitioner may be acceptable for a limited number of conditions. Use is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy


• Associated with risk of hepatotoxicity; contraindicated in patients with history of liver disease. Periodic evaluation of liver enzymes may be prudent with chronic use

• Should not be taken in conjunction with CNS-affecting drugs because of possible potentiation; possible interaction with benzodiazepines

• Possible extrapyramidal effects with kava use

• Kava dermopathy may occur with abuse; it is reversible on discontinuation


• Theoretical additive effects with CNS depressants, antidepressant drugs, and antiseizure medications

• Possible lipid-lowering effects may be additive with lipid-lowering medications

• EO for topical use only

• Because of the ability of volatile oils to cross the placenta and the CNS effects of lavender, use of not more than an occasional cup of beverage tea with lavender is recommended during the first trimester


• Possible TSH/thyroxin antagonist effects


• Serious side effects include hypertension, symptoms of hyperaldosteronism, electrolyte imbalances (and associated sequelae), and hormonal dysregulation including elevated prolactin and estrogen levels in women, which may affect fertility or menstrual regularity

• Hypokalemia with chronic use/overdose; also blocked aldosterone/renin response, lethargy, hypertension, headache, sodium retention, and in rare cases pulmonary hypertension and CHF (not caused by the DGL form)

• Caution should be exercised with patients on digoxin because of potential decreases in potassium associated with licorice intake

• May reduce the effects of diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone, affecting blood pressure and CHF control, and may cause hypokalemia when combined with furosemide, insulin, or Kayexalate

• May theoretically interfere with hormonal contraceptives and HRT

• Contraindicated in patients with hypertension or mineralocorticoid disorders

• Increased risk of premature labor when used regularly during pregnancy. Generally not recommended for use during pregnancy; exceptions may be considered for short-term use under supervision of a qualified practitioner for specific conditions


• Side effects associated with cardiac glycosides including vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, visual disturbances, hypotension, serious arrhythmias, and sinoatrial block

• Risk of interactions/potentiation with other cardiac glycoside drugs


• There are limited data on the safety and efficacy of linden, an herb with a long history of use in European herbal medicine. Prior allegations that the herb should be avoided in patients with a cardiac disorder do not appear to have any scientific basis


• Lobelia acts on nicotinic receptors and may cause respiratory stimulation in low doses and respiratory depression in high doses

• Tachycardia may occur at higher doses; if it does, discontinue and resume only at a lower dose with close monitoring, if at all

• Other side effects include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, hypotension, diaphoresis, and palpitations

• Some midwives use this herb to relax the cervix during a difficult labor with failure to progress; there are no data on the efficacy or safety of this practice. The herb should not be used in pregnancy prior to labor and should only be used in labor, if at all, under the supervision of a qualified practitioner

• LS

• Sedation

• Decreased reflexes

• Risks associated with smoking

• Risks of dependency

• Because of illegality, use is not recommended


• There are no reported side effects or herb–drug interactions. The high mucilage content has been purported to possibly reduce the absorption of other medications


• Avoid in patients with salicylate sensitivity, G6PD deficiency, and bleeding disorders

• Toxicity and fetal malformations have been seen in animal studies; therefore use of this herb is contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation


• Well tolerated with no expected side effects with the exception of reports of hypersensitivity reactions

• Rarely, headache, pruritus, or GI upset have been reported

• Hypoglycemic effects have been reported; thus caution is advised in diabetic patients

• Possible herb–drug interactions include interference with medications metabolized by CYP via inhibition of the enzyme, theoretical decreased clearance of glucuronidated agents, increased clearance of estrogens, and increased efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs, including platinums and anthracyclines

• Two separate clinical trials of milk thistle in pregnant women yielded positive results with no evidence of harmful effects on the pregnancy or offspring. In one study, 400 mg of silymarin was used to treat mothers for 60 days for intrahepatic cholestasis. The women experienced improvements in symptoms and blood work. In another study, a 15-day trial of milk thistle was shown to attenuate pruritus associated with intrahepatic cholestasis


• No adverse effects or herb–drug interactions are expected. There is a general lack of clinical and safety data on this herb, although there is a significant record of historical use

• No warnings or cautions have been reported in association with the purported cardioactivity of the herb, which was found to have inhibitory effects on myocardial function

• Motherwort is traditionally not recommended for use during pregnancy because of purported uterotonic effects. Leonurine, a constituent, is reported to have uterotonic effects; stachydrine, another constituent, is reported to have oxytocic effects


• Prolonged topical use may cause contact dermatitis—limit topical use to 7 days consecutively


• Nettle has a long historic use as a food and tonic. It is considered well tolerated but is almost entirely lacking in clinical data

• Uterotonic activity has been reported in vivo in pregnant and nonpregnant murine models, with betaine and serotonin considered the active ingredients. The clinical relevance of this is unknown. Although this has been a purported basis for contraindication of use during pregnancy, nettle has been consumed in large quantities by pregnant women as a uterine tonic with no reported increase in uterine activity, miscarriage, or malformations in the offspring


• Oregano is considered safe when used in amounts comparable with use in foods

• The EO is for topical use only. Prolonged topical use may lead to contact dermatitis

• Not for internal medicinal use during pregnancy and lactation because the volatile oils can cross the placenta and enter into breast milk


• See Goldenseal for cautions associated with berberine, which is found in Oregon grape root


• KSw/C/LD

• No known contraindications or herb–drug interactions reported in the literature; excessive doses may theoretically cause sedation

• At the highest concentrations of extract, passionflower increased spontaneous uterine contractions on isolated rat uteri, and caused a statistically significant reduction in tissue response to acetylcholine when compared with control


• Safe when used for topical use, including for acute use as a suppository during pregnancy


• Possible anticoagulant activity; caution should be used with patients with bleeding problems or on anticoagulant/antiplatelet medications


• Contraindicated in patients with esophageal reflux disease

• Caution recommended for patients with salicylate allergy

• Caution recommended for patients with gallstones

• EO not for internal use

• For use as a beverage tea only during the first trimester of pregnancy; the volatile oils can cross the placenta


• Side effects include GI symptoms and skin rash


• Known toxicity associated with internal use of all parts of the plant with both internal and topical use. Peripheral blood changes have been observed with ingestion, including eosinophilia

• Toxicity symptoms include nausea, vomiting, cramping, weakness, diarrhea, hematemesis, hypotension, and tachycardia

• Limited topical use under qualified supervision only

• Not for internal or topical use at any time during pregnancy or lactation


• Serious allergic reactions have been reported after ingestion

• Bowel obstruction has been reported after ingestion, particularly in individuals who have had prior bowel surgery or when psyllium has been taken with inadequate quantities of water

• GI side effects include bloating, gas, and diarrhea, as well as constipation (as a result of obstruction)

• Caution is suggested in diabetic patients because of the hypoglycemic effects of psyllium

• Pregnancy and lactation warnings include those described above for this herb. No other known contraindications exist during pregnancy for any of the trimesters; however, pregnancy safety studies are lacking


• Only preparations made from dried plant material should be used—fresh plant is toxic

• Increased uterine activity has been documented


• The high salicylates and tannin levels in this herb suggest that use during pregnancy is not appropriate; however, there are no studies of pregnancy/lactation safety with this herb, and a dearth of research on this herb generally


• Some consider caution advisable for patients with a risk/history of ER–positive cancer

• Standardized isoflavone products should not be used during pregnancy and lactation because of the potential for estrogenic activity

• Possible cautionary use when taking hormonal contraceptives or HRT. Red clover may enhance estrogenic effects via ER binding


• Safety of use during pregnancy has been demonstrated

• There are no known contraindications or expected side effects or herb–drug interactions; however, any herb with a high tannin content can theoretically interfere with nutrient absorption, particularly iron, when taken in high doses or for extended periods

• Some women report nausea when taking raspberry leaf tea during the first trimester of pregnancy, likely because of the astringency of the herb


• Not to be used for patients with coagulation disorders or those taking anticoagulant/antiplatelet medications


• Digestive complaints have been reported

• Caution is advised in patients with immune dysfunction, autoimmune disorders, and those taking immunosuppressive medications

• Safety in pregnancy is not established

• There is no expected contraindication in lactation


• Side effects are uncommon; rashes are one of the most common side effects

• Caution is advised in patients with immune dysfunction, autoimmune disorders, and those taking immunosuppressive medications

• Safety in pregnancy is not established

• There is no expected contraindication in lactation


• Limited data show this to be a well-tolerated herb with no expected side effects or herb–drug interactions

• Safety in pregnancy is not established

• There is no expected contraindication in lactation


• Overall, this herb is reported to have low toxicity

• Because of reputed abortifacient effects and ability to affect the menstrual cycle, this herb is not recommended for internal use during pregnancy beyond the normal amount found in food use

• EO is for topical use only; extended topical use may lead to irritation


• Sage products should not be used internally during pregnancy beyond minimal amounts found as seasoning in foods. The herb is strongly abortifacient and emmenagogic

• Sage oil is toxic and is not meant for internal consumption


• Contraindicated for patients with bleeding disorders or on anticoagulant/antiplatelet medications

• May increase risk of bleeding and should be discontinued 1 week prior to surgical procedures


• No side effects or drug interactions have been reported; overall, there are limited data on this herb


• Not for use with adolescents because of possible hormonal effects; treatment of acne may be an exception under qualified supervision

• May cause GI upset

• Possible interference with hormonal contraception and HRT

• Not for use in pregnancy because of potential for stimulating uterine contractions

• Caution recommended with barbiturates, which may be potentiated; may antagonize the effects of stimulants


• Contraindicated in patients with intestinal obstruction, stenosis, atony inflammatory bowel diseases, appendicitis, and undiagnosed GI disorders

• Contraindicated in patients with electrolyte disturbances and dehydration

• Excessive use can lead to dependency

• Long-term use can lead to hypokalemia with resultant cardiac and neuromuscular dysfunction, particularly when combined with cardiac glycosides, diuretics, or steroids

• Although there have been no documented adverse effects from the use of senna during pregnancy or lactation, use during pregnancy and lactation is generally not recommended because of potentially genotoxic anthracoids (emodin and physcione) contained in the herb


• Because of the high saponin content, this herb is not recommended for patients with cholestasis, fat malabsorption, and upper GI irritation, or inflammation. Gastric irritation and reflux are possible side effects

• In a murine model using oral administration of the herb, Kupffer cell enlargement, liver congestion, bile plugs, mild cellular degeneration, fibrosis, and leukocytic infiltration were observed

• Although this herb is used traditionally to promote fertility, it is also used as an abortifacient; therefore use in pregnancy is not recommended and if used as a fertility agent, use should be discontinued upon conception. There is no known increase in harmful effects on the fetus from limited use in women


• There is a general lack of safety and toxicity data available for this herb. Low toxicity was shown in a single murine study in vitro of intraperitoneally and subcutaneously injected extract, at doses of 1.5 g/kg and 31.5 g/kg, respectively. Toxicity signs included sedation, pupil dilatation, hind limb paralysis, dyspnea, and death because of respiratory paralysis

• Generally contraindicated in pregnancy because of reported oxytocin activity, possibly a result of tyramine contained in the plant


• There is a general lack of safety and toxicity data for skullcap, with no reported contraindications or herb–drug interactions

• Adulterations of skullcap with the toxic herb Teucrium have occurred; thus caution is advised and a reliable product source should be obtained. This is of particular importance in pregnancy. Ingestion of Teucrium has led to reports of hepatitis

• Overdose of skullcap tincture may lead to the following symptoms: giddiness, stupor, confusion, and seizures. This is most likely a result of adulteration with Teucrium


• There are no known contraindications or toxicity issues associated with slippery elm use

• Any contraindications to use of slippery elm during pregnancy are a vestige of the use of slippery elm sticks to dilate the cervix mechanically to induce abortion. Oral intake of slippery elm is not known to be abortifacient and is considered safe during pregnancy

• Slippery elm was traditionally used as a supplement for newborns, and also to increase the supply and quality of breast milk. There are no expected contraindications to use during lactation


• Gas, indigestion

• Possible goitrogenic effects (>30 g/day)

• Fermented products contraindicated with MAOIs

• Concentrated soy products are not recommended for use during pregnancy and lactation because of possible estrogenic effects


• Not for treatment of severe depression

• Potential herb–drug interactions with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), immunosuppressives (e.g., cyclosporine), oral contraceptives, indinavir and other HIV medications, digoxin, and other drugs metabolized by the CYP oxidase system, and SSRIs

• Theoretical effects on serum hormone levels because of actions on CYP metabolism

• Photosensitivity has been reported in patients taking high doses of hypericin; caution should be observed for patients using high-dose St. John’s wort or taking the herb for a prolonged duration

• Safety during pregnancy has not been established

• The detrimental effect of untreated depression on the mother and fetus are increasingly well accepted. There is no known contraindication to use during lactation. Prenatal and postpartum depression should be treated by a qualified health professional

• Safety during pregnancy and lactation is discussed in detail in Plant Profiles: St. John’s Wort


• Not for internal use

• Prolonged topical use may cause irritation


• Known neurotoxicity

• Not for internal use

• Avoid even topical use during pregnancy and lactation


• Not for internal use during pregnancy (topical and suppository use is acceptable), other than amounts typically consumed in foods

• Not to exceed 10 g dried leaf containing 0.03% thymol/day

• Thyme oil is highly toxic and not intended for internal use (dilute use in suppositories is acceptable)


• Tribulus is used as a fertility agent in both men and women. Because it has demonstrated an increase in fetal damage in animal studies, discontinuation immediately upon conception is recommended. No increase in frequency of malformation or other harmful fetal effects have been seen in women using it to increase fertility; however, studies are very limited and animal evidence of harm is significant

• In vivo mouse studies have suggested a very low toxicity from this herb. Staggers (a neuromuscular disease), cholestasis, and photosensitivity have all been observed in sheep that have consumed tribulus

• The high saponin content may cause gastric irritation and reflux as side effects


• Overall, turmeric has a very good safety profile, even in high doses

• High doses and prolonged use may be associated with gastric irritation and are not recommended for individuals with peptic ulcer disease or gastric hyperacidity

• Turmeric should not be taken by individuals with bile duct obstruction, gallstones, or those taking immunosuppressant medications

• In vitro studies demonstrate inhibition of platelet aggregation and thus the herb may potentiate the effects of anticoagulant/antiplatelet medications. Caution is also advised with discontinuation of the herb 1 week prior to surgical procedures

• Curcumin potently inhibits CYP in rats. There are no human data

• Curcumin (200 mg/kg) protected against doxorubicin myocardial toxicity in rats

• Because of lipid-lowering effects, turmeric may potentiate the effects of lipid-lowering medications

• It is traditionally considered emmenagogic; therefore, it is not recommended for internal use in pregnancy in doses higher than those typically found in food


• Safety in pregnancy is not established; therefore, use topically (including in vaginal suppositories) only


• Many references state that uva ursi is not to be used in pregnancy; however, there is no evidence direct evidence to support this claim. See Plant Profiles: Uva Ursi

• Not for use more than 7 days consecutively

• Some authorities claim that the herb is most effective when urinary pH is alkaline; therefore it is often given with two 00-sized capsules of baking soda


• Valerian effects possibly enhanced by alcohol consumption—avoid excessive alcohol consumption concurrently with this herb

• Intake of valerian preparations is not recommended within 2 hours before driving or operating machinery because of possibly impaired response time

• Herbalists have reported a paradoxic effect of stimulation rather than relaxation in a small percentage of patients using valerian

• In vitro experiments suggest that valerian may inhibit CYP activity

• Caution is recommended when using in combination with CNS-depressing medications

• Even overdose with large quantities of the herb have not led to fatality; however, side effects have included tremor, GI upset, chest tightness, and when injected, cardiac disturbance, blurred vision, and excitability, among other less significant symptoms

• The safety of valerian during pregnancy and lactation has not been established. In a limited number of cases of valerian intoxication during pregnancy, no teratogenic effects have been observed. Degradation products of valepotriates have demonstrated cytotoxicity and mutagenicity in vitro, but have not caused birth defects in a limited number of animal studies. They are poorly absorbed

• Topical use only for use during pregnancy for the treatment of varicosities, hemorrhoids, and postnatal perineal care


• Possible GI complaints with long-term use of high doses

• Although hormonal effects are not supported by scientific research, internal use is not recommended in individuals with a history of sex hormone–dependent cancers

• Possible/theoretical interactions with steroids, hormonal contraception, HRT, and lipid-lowering agents (potentiation)

• Caution is advised in avoiding products that may have been adulterated with progesterone


• Minor adverse effects include GI upset, dizziness, sweating, and rash. Adverse effects associated with salicylates may be associated with this herb

• Precautions similar to those with other salicylate-containing medications are advised, including avoiding if there is salicylate sensitivity, asthma, peptic ulcer disease, gout, bleeding disorders, and kidney or liver disease

• Drug interactions associated with salicylates are theoretically possible with the use of willow bark

• Safety during pregnancy is not known, and in fact, the safety of aspirin in pregnancy is somewhat uncertain. Salicylates excreted in breast milk have been observed to cause skin rash in the breastfeeding infant


• Data on the internal use of witch hazel are limited. No side effects or contraindications are reported for this herb other than possible GI irritation in some individuals

• Excessive ingestion is not recommended because of the high tannin content of the herb

• No problems are expected with the topical use of witch hazel during pregnancy and lactation. Internal use is not recommended


• Limited safety and clinical data available; considered to have low toxicity with toxic principles in too low a concentration to be clinically significant in humans

• Contraindicated in those with known allergy to plants in the Compositae family

• Not for internal use during pregnancy because of thujone content and purported abortifacient activity


• Limited data available for this herb; excessive and prolonged use of laxatives may lead to abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and hypokalemia

• Avoid if there is intestinal obstruction, as with all laxatives

• Although no safety data exist for use during pregnancy and lactation, caution is advised during pregnancy because of anthraquinone contents; anthraquinones can be passed into the breast milk


• Multiple adverse effects are associated with use. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, dizziness, and irritability. Toxicity is associated with lupuslike syndrome

• Avoid in patients with renal disease, hypertension, CAD, PTSD, panic disorder, ulcers (active), bipolar disorder, and hepatic insufficiency

• Multiple possible herb–drug interactions include drugs metabolized by CYP, alcohol, androgenic and antiandrogenic drugs, benzodiazepines, antihypertensive medications, MAOIs, opioid antagonists, and sympathomimetics, as well as other theoretic contraindications

• Not for long-term use

• Should only be used by trained practitioners


• In vivo mouse models showed low toxicity. Limited human clinical and safety data

• Commonly used in TCM, including in formulae used during pregnancy

• No reported contraindications or herb–drug interactions
